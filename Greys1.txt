Owen tries to teach the doctors a lesson in teamwork when he signs them up for a baseball league; Lexie can't hide her jealousy when she sees Mark with another woman; Alex fights to keep baby Zola from being transferred to another hospital because of a conflict of interest involving Derek and Meredith; and Richard scolds Meredith and Bailey in an effort to get them to end their feud. Not that, Grey's Anatomy isn't essentially a spoof of itself these days. The residents and interns treat the victims of an apartment-building explosion, while Alex investigates its cause; Mama Burke (Diahann Carroll) returns to collect her son's things while Cristina gets rid of her wedding presents; Lexie Grey tries to have a heart-to-heart with an unwilling Meredith; Callie is overwhelmed with her duties as chief resident while Bailey searches for an outlet for her pent-up leadership skills. Meredith works furiously to save a paramedic trapped in an ambulance; Lexie literally holds the life of a patient (Seth Green) in her hands; Derek must rely on nurse Rose to save a patient when an OR computer breaks down; and Bailey keeps Tucker waiting while she operates on a white supremacist.
