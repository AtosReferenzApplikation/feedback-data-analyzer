In a show like this, killing off Obstacles are encountered by the group members on a mission to find supplies.

I like the idea that Rick will be somewhere, hidden from his family. The Walking Dead has a sprawling cast of characters, but the story at its core has always revolved around Rick's leadership of the group of survivors.They have shamelessly manipulated our affection for Rick...Despite Rick's horse making me shake my damn head at times, despite Maggie and Negan's scene together succumbing to the trope/cliche... this episode was one more reason why this season has been an entertaining ride. While the turn is interesting, the actual execution is a little ham-fisted... But these are pretty minor quibbles about a story where empathy brings about character change. "Omega" wasn't exactly an exciting episode of The Walking Dead, but it sure was interesting. We now have a really solid idea of what everyone else is up against. A villain and followers who don't think about life in the same ways the heroes do.
