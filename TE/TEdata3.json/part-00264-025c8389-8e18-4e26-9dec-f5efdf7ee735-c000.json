{"value":"I'd never seen a Tarzan movie before so when I saw it on the tele I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight. Not how I'd imagined Tarzan would look. And, unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell. Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine.<br /><br />Oh well, so much for expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - The monkey Cheeta was there. There was some guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and a romance... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you understand, but equally nothing good.<br /><br />Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan:

{"value":"I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas, I was wrong. Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. I've a feeling O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But apart from that, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director.

{"value":"- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror.

{"value":"I saw this film at its New York's High Falls Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and awful bore. Although it was funny in some places, the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden, especially the \"Lovely Lady\" and the voice of the narrator (whom I have never heard of) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the redeeming feature of this film, true action and grit and (out of the cast) the only real acting. I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing, this could have been a half decent film.

{"value":"A memorable line from a short lived show. After viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter back said FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad responded YOU BET! A fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show. Using this line added a unique element to our season that I'll never forget. We had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line.

{"value":"It's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. It is by far the number 1 worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Not only have I ever been this bored before (luckily not for more then 1,5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. After the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. You hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and Trent Harris never lays his hands on a camera again...","finished_norm":["it","amaz","that","thi","movi","turn","out","to","be","in","on","of","my","hitlist","after","all","it","be","by","far","the","numb","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","not","onli","have","i","ever","be","thi","bore","befor","luckili","not","for","much","then","hour","the","preadolesc","attempt","at","humor","that","featur","it","be","not","even","close","to","get","but","on","of","the","corner","of","my","mouth","slightli","tilt","after","the","veri","awkward","part","you","tend","to","hope","that","the","other","part","will","be","at","littl","slightli","well","you","hope","in","vain","it","onli","go","downhil","from","therebr","br","the","movi","have","no","stori","worth","tell","whatsoev","and","repeat","thi","nonstori","three","time","on","can","onli","hope","that","by","some","miracl","all","remain","copi","of","thi","movi","be","lose","forev","and","trent","harri","never","lai","hi","hand","on","a","camera","again"],"filtered":["amaz","thi","movi","turn","hitlist","far","numb","wrong","movi","ever","seenbr","br","onli","ever","thi","bore","befor","luckili","much","hour","preadolesc","attempt","humor","featur","even","close","get","corner","mouth","slightli","tilt","veri","awkward","part","tend","hope","part","littl","slightli","well","hope","vain","onli","go","downhil","therebr","br","movi","stori","worth","tell","whatsoev","repeat","thi","nonstori","three","time","onli","hope","miracl","remain","copi","thi","movi","lose","forev","trent","harri","never","lai","hi","hand","camera"],"filtered2":["amaz","turn","hitlist","far","numb","wrong","ever","seenbr","onli","ever","bore","befor","luckili","hour","preadolesc","attempt","humor","featur","even","close","get","corner","mouth","slightli","tilt","veri","awkward","part","tend","hope","part","littl","slightli","well","hope","vain","onli","go","downhil","therebr","stori","worth","tell","whatsoev","repeat","nonstori","three","time","onli","hope","miracl","remain","copi","lose","forev","trent","harri","never","lai","hand","camera"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,6,8,11,14,15,17,20,25,42,44,61,79,90,96,101,108,174,177,181,219,221,224,231,235,295,305,369,516,682,685,747,941,965,986,991,1010,1324,1516,1708,1711,2222,2271,2526,2912,2933,3164,3807],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,6,8,11,14,15,17,20,25,42,44,61,79,90,96,101,108,174,177,181,219,221,224,231,235,295,305,369,516,682,685,747,941,965,986,991,1010,1324,1516,1708,1711,2222,2271,2526,2912,2933,3164,3807],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.9739294460164585,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.6219954307453837,3.209458785004948,3.7637034094785053,1.9469506069506084,2.0477128419653545,2.0390708128715254,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.456282578459816,2.458149992634611,7.332685962348011,2.5792094178355414,2.6423424573643777,2.689504733779216,2.7049353070058615,2.6457189377809835,2.7910771187233068,2.8612813773965557,3.121829110937649,3.442099372982581,3.6497387377608255,3.607563812710113,3.7465885637507435,3.9612932464190886,7.973653096848507,4.039936373738201,4.004218291136122,4.34596758485818,4.364659717870332,4.535724120139652,4.671389985292807,4.733083554298147,5.02684467282631,5.02684467282631,5.143104478942172,5.3560264761848435,5.373120909544144,5.5623629091826725,5.719991853386255]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247392E-4,2.154078066332402E-4,2.154609924846841E-4,2.1541767793321686E-4,2.154380646612077E-4,2.1540661893957913E-4,2.154736133886267E-4,2.1537456994793341E-4,2.1540785215747802E-4,2.156304528310067E-4,2.1734141771275817E-4,2.1540820795554685E-4,2.156122131408865E-4,2.1563467621359302E-4,2.1553671901055084E-4,2.154185264322718E-4,2.1549263873663025E-4,2.1559405030503626E-4,2.1542964756197347E-4,2.1542885992980777E-4,2.1562267093784936E-4,2.154504437022091E-4,2.154507697677841E-4,2.1558878983769252E-4,2.154297252728719E-4,2.1563725358021186E-4,2.154836357275372E-4,2.1540732385964934E-4,2.1550498033487108E-4,2.1557075556130414E-4,2.1545150052150534E-4,2.15566891653393E-4,2.1567272961560616E-4,2.158729073506166E-4,2.1548326336575657E-4,2.154183957775206E-4,2.1549606627473282E-4,2.154402735272828E-4,2.1537479982036356E-4,2.1542958084691736E-4,2.156454781016619E-4,2.1552718298266607E-4,2.1556738289319776E-4,2.1538551900011018E-4,2.1542963562520235E-4,2.154183147719789E-4,2.1549123191840175E-4,2.1552859836735812E-4,2.1548477184478597E-4,2.1545061712774098E-4,2.1541884748491844E-4,2.158602057199364E-4,2.1547305307223916E-4,2.1542958624900336E-4,2.1547189913423328E-4,2.154075442506245E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.154411514247663E-4,2.1541914990540854E-4,2.1540742129050496E-4,2.155797523947596

Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But, they remain as boring as they were before. Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\") \"Rich and Strange\" by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidor's \"The Crowd\" is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.<br /><br />*** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie

{"value":"This was a weird movie. It started out pretty good. A solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />Next comes his \"down fall\" Here i could tell I was in for a real cheesy \"B\" movie. Poor acting , I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts...<br /><br />From this point on it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death

{"value":"I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor,poor, PITIFUL acting, REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals that weren't even the LEAST BIT funny(unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good). all the boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week. This movie is absolutely lousy, it's not worth even renting. In fact don't even watch it on t.v.! Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! I BARELY give this 1 star(out of 10).

Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing.

{"value":"When i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film. Usually when you have these types of movies there's generally ONE sasquatch, but in this one there is like what? 7 or 10 of them?. Acting was good, plot was OK, i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims, very good camera work. I was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little. This movie was way better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more sasquatch films, i mean i really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one i'm reviewing is OK, but the movie Sasquatch was not, but I'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saterday afternoon, but for any other occasions, no.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","thi","film","i","think","it","be","go","to","be","a","good","sasquatch","film","usual","when","you","have","thi","typ","of","movi","there","gener","on","sasquatch","but","in","thi","on","there","be","like","what","or","of","them","act","be","good","plot","be","okai","i","like","the","scene","where","the","sasquatch","be","kill","the","few","victim","veri","good","camera","work","i","be","expect","it","to","be","a","gori","film","but","it","be","veri","littl","thi","movi","be","wai","well","than","sasquatch","the","scifi","channel","realli","ne","to","make","much","sasquatch","film","i","mean","i","realli","like","sasquatch","mountain","abominib","be","not","good","the","on","i","be","review","be","okai","but","the","movi","sasquatch","be","not","but","i","be","not","review","that","so","let","me","get","back","on","track","thi","movi","be","good","for","a","raini","saterdai","afternoon","but","for","ani","other","occas","no"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","think","go","good","sasquatch","film","usual","thi","typ","movi","gener","sasquatch","thi","like","act","good","plot","okai","like","scene","sasquatch","kill","victim","veri","good","camera","work","expect","gori","film","veri","littl","thi","movi","wai","well","sasquatch","scifi","channel","realli","ne","make","much","sasquatch","film","mean","realli","like","sasquatch","mountain","abominib","good","review","okai","movi","sasquatch","review","let","get","back","track","thi","movi","good","raini","saterdai","afternoon","ani","occas"],"filtered2":["see","think","go","good","sasquatch","usual","typ","gener","sasquatch","like","act","good","plot","okai","like","scene","sasquatch","kill","victim","veri","good","camera","work","expect","gori","veri","littl","wai","well","sasquatch","scifi","channel","realli","ne","make","sasquatch","mean","realli","like","sasquatch","mountain","abominib","good","review","okai","sasquatch","review","let","get","back","track","good","raini","saterdai","afternoon","ani","occas"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,12,13,14,15,19,20,21,27,32,33,48,63,76,88,110,124,130,176,191,225,231,265,384,535,728,781,867,1487,1667,2345,2418,4335,4448],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,12,13,14,15,19,20,21,27,32,33,48,63,76,88,110,124,130,176,191,225,231,265,384,535,728,781,867,1487,1667,2345,2418,4335,4448],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,3.3930723249613526,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.6955116224012472,1.8729627573220065,2.1337665533324026,2.0317223413467334,2.1290479736304078,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,5.008094298653827,5.092022696851891,2.641219492619754,2.7049353070058615,2.73529586597515,3.109204957709252,3.4986697244709752,3.7740817043309423,3.9363956947973615,3.8844878351953436,4.581533656170946,4.8796870284900224,5.051537285416681,5.129498826886393,5.9370563586240825,47.07859603291847]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780535E-4,2.192553104372059E-4,2.1930944626706028E-4,2.1926535805328183E-4,2.1928610891855594E-4,2.192541015295696E-4,2.1932229259911845E-4,2.1922148009526643E-4,2.1925535677457436E-4,2.1948193342720778E-4,2.2122345868647703E-4,2.1925571892772588E-4,2.19463367949094E-4,2.1948623224568852E-4,2.193865253813076E-4,2.1926622170779185E-4,2.193416577681339E-4,2.1944488069798175E-4,2.1927754147741055E-4,2.192767397769629E-4,2.1947401253786457E-4,2.1929870906764101E-4,2.1929904095723216E-4,2.194395262708673E-4,2.192776205763412E-4,2.1948885564790853E-4,2.193324939519082E-4,2.1925481904056069E-4,2.1935421980567505E-4,2.1942116987548014E-4,2.192997847633017E-4,2.194172369524269E-4,2.195249653380587E-4,2.1972871854514215E-4,2.1933211493919237E-4,2.192660887193525E-4,2.193451465271648E-4,2.1928835723826438E-4,2.1922171407356007E-4,2.1927747357072428E-4,2.1949722707154405E-4,2.1937681902578181E-4,2.194177369665052E-4,2.1923262471379966E-4,2.1927752932743093E-4,2.1926600626693133E-4,2.1934022582203948E-4,2.1937825969134956E-4,2.193336503619008E-4,2.1929888559081085E-4,2.1926654849491629E-4,2.197157900444468E-4,2.1932172227464688E-4,2.1927747906929962E-4,2.1932054772559194E-4,2.1925504336804647E-4,0.8537985157896817,2.1928925081630266E-4,2.192668563170861E-4,2.1925491821167631E-4,2.194303274057622E-4,2.1934224257171342E-4,2.192548265573635E-4,2.192325353934709E-4,2.1921048914035567E-4,2.194086901232129E-4,2.192655676928648E-4,2.1936523766456564E-4,2.1942961580067295E-4,2.193300648539748E-4,2.1927776949505668E-4,2.192328227927159E-4,2.192889065993934E-4,2.192327047112023E-4,2.1924420968899238E-4,2.1923282899755122E-4,2.19375141739224

{"value":"I like Fulci films, i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people.<br /><br />Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed. Structurally, it's like most Fulci films you've seen. Some stuff happens, some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another. Really it's like Conan with no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore.<br /><br />This one

{"value":"this film was totally not what i expected. <br /><br />if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two. <br /><br />its really strange because i cannot see the point . the prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense, the don't even match . maybe i am naive but ain't a vol 1 & vol 2 meant to match up. <br /><br />carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original, and in the prequel he lives and don't go jail. <br /><br />the plot was OK , but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the

{"value":"Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible. I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production. Some blind dude gets some new eyes, bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf. Nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what's up with that female cop? If you really want to find out, check out Eyes of the Werewolf!<br /><br />Not a bad idea for a movie. I just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the movie.","finished_norm":["ey","of","the","werewolf","be","a","realli","bad","movi","the","premis","be","real","good","but","the","overal","execut","be","just","terribl","i","wish","the","filmmak","would","have","take","their","time","with","thi","project","instead","of","rush","it","into","product","some","blind","dude","get","some","new","ey","bad","thing","be","that","thei","belong","to","a","mean","old","werewolf","nasti","thing","begin","to","happen","to","the","dude","a","he","turn","into","a","cheesi","look","creatur","can","he","find","a","cure","befor","hi","hot","girlfriend","find","out","who","be","that","weird","littl","troll","who","help","him","out","and","what","up","with","that","femal","cop","if","you","realli","want","to","find","out","check","out","ey","of","the","werewolfbr","br","not","a","bad","idea","for","a","movi","i","just","wish","the","filmmak","would","have","spend","a","lot","for","time","in","preproduct","befor","thei","decid","to","shoot","the","movi"],"filtered":["ey","werewolf","realli","bad","movi","premis","real","good","overal","execut","terribl","wish","filmmak","take","time","thi","project","instead","rush","product","blind","dude","get","new","ey","bad","thing","thei","belong","mean","old","werewolf","nasti","thing","begin","happen","dude","turn","cheesi","look","creatur","find","cure","befor","hi","hot","girlfriend","find","weird","littl","troll","help","femal","cop","realli","want","find","check","ey","werewolfbr","br","bad","idea","movi","wish","filmmak","spend","lot","time","preproduct","befor","thei","decid","shoot","movi"],"filtered2":["ey","werewolf","realli","bad","premis","real","good","overal","execut","terribl","wish","filmmak","take","time","project","instead","rush","product","blind","dude","get","new","ey","bad","thing","belong","mean","old","werewolf","nasti","thing","begin","happen","dude","turn","cheesi","look","creatur","find","cure","befor","hot","girlfriend","find","weird","littl","troll","help","femal","cop","realli","want","find","check","ey","werewolfbr","bad","idea","wish","filmmak","spend","lot","time","preproduct","befor","decid","shoot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,13,14,16,29,31,37,38,67,72,79,80,87,88,94,96,117,123,147,152,166,185,190,249,281,283,323,399,412,422,476,484,505,543,625,659,662,666,730,761,962,1052,1364,1427,1493,1540,2333,5852],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,13,14,16,29,31,37,38,67,72,79,80,87,88,94,96,117,123,147,152,166,185,190,249,281,283,323,399,412,422,476,484,505,543,625,659,662,666,730,761,962,1052,1364,1427,1493,1540,2333,5852],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,3.205071257016622,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,2.6390769554676132,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,4.557934924044366,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,3.893901213901217,1.9951803900462557,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.2797301185117202,2.2619070973220485,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.4423870329693536,2.518833027372001,2.558331832813986,2.6754694156628323,8.497001404085061,2.7678802023081546,6.0866465060504265,6.258230235337164,3.107414446935464,3.2090054908152035,3.6105180246075443,3.291526514503207,3.41740676039221,3.477726550625732,3.6194333882654965,3.6405503117064195,3.616452760127359,3.6621227969605474,3.767137231978131,3.9405024767500145,10.078229530836248,4.1302590120314875,4.436351646326448,9.210500365576523,4.605250182788262,4.528289141652134,5.116075806554253,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691627E-4,1.8602795149399927E-4,1.8607388323225527E-4,1.8603647642975694E-4,1.8605408257553726E-4,1.860269257919961E-4,1.860847827485873E-4,1.8599924801951197E-4,1.860279908091051E-4,1.862202305795431E-4,1.8769783390787707E-4,1.8602829807924038E-4,1.8620447863330688E-4,1.8622387792744188E-4,1.8613928128212602E-4,1.8603720920051163E-4,1.8610121319542614E-4,1.8618879305904958E-4,1.8604681349948778E-4,1.860461332938787E-4,1.8621351007268015E-4,1.8606477321704622E-4,1.8606505480995558E-4,1.861842500762341E-4,1.860468806112581E-4,1.862261037624283E-4,1.8609343812280905E-4,1.8602753456675998E-4,1.8611187150105948E-4,1.8616867552698427E-4,1.8606568589487276E-4,1.8616533862436826E-4,1.8625674115804863E-4,1.8642961629456632E-4,1.8609311654811618E-4,1.860370963659951E-4,1.8610417324549052E-4,1.8605599017042668E-4,1.8599944653923116E-4,1.8604675588381722E-4,1.862332065267212E-4,1.8613104589010137E-4,1.8616576286309942E-4,1.8600870371092388E-4,1.8604680319079416E-4,1.860370264089438E-4,1.8609999825564628E-4,1.8613226822794952E-4,1.8609441928299887E-4,1.8606492298876032E-4,1.860374864642149E-4,1.864186470619605E-4,1.8608429885475173E-4,1.860467605491031E-4,1.8

{"value":"I have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first.<br /><br />It was awful. I actually didn't watch the end of it. It was like watching a boring soap or a really good one (all soaps are crap). The actors were poor and storyline was bad. The person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is on about. The script was awful. 2 People was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no. He says \"If you do that ... I will hurt you\" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, watch away. Please do not watch this film because ...

{"value":"Ever wonder why Pacific Islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of Black Americans? regardless of their ethnic origins? Well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question - but it will provide an excellent case study.<br /><br />From its onset this film acts as a sort of \"Old School\" for Pacific Island New Zealanders, which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task. Is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? or is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes humorless, and the ending is expected. This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema, as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit.","finished_norm":["ever","wonder","why","pacif","island","seem","to","automat","assum","the","sens","of","humour","of","black","american","regardless","of","their","ethnic","origin","good","thi","film","will","not","provid","ani","answer","to","thi","often","ponder","question","but","it","will","provid","a","excel","case","studybr","br","from","it","onset","thi","film","act","a","a","sort","of","old","school","for","pacif","island","new","zealand","which","immedi","rais","the","question","what","exactli","be","the","point","of","such","a","task","be","it","mean","to","perpetu","ingrain","stereotyp","of","pacif","island","new","zealand","or","be","it","intend","to","exploit","thi","potenti","market","the","stori","be","weak","joke","humorless","and","the","end","be","expect","thi","film","have","do","noth","for","new","zealand","cinema","a","it","be","mere","a","appropri","romant","comedi","that","be","devoid","of","ani","merit"],"filtered":["ever","wonder","pacif","island","seem","automat","assum","sens","humour","black","american","regardless","ethnic","origin","good","thi","film","provid","ani","answer","thi","often","ponder","question","provid","excel","case","studybr","br","onset","thi","film","act","sort","old","school","pacif","island","new","zealand","immedi","rais","question","exactli","point","task","mean","perpetu","ingrain","stereotyp","pacif","island","new","zealand","intend","exploit","thi","potenti","market","stori","weak","joke","humorless","end","expect","thi","film","noth","new","zealand","cinema","mere","appropri","romant","comedi","devoid","ani","merit"],"filtered2":["ever","wonder","pacif","island","seem","automat","assum","sens","humour","black","american","regardless","ethnic","origin","good","provid","ani","answer","often","ponder","question","provid","excel","case","studybr","onset","act","sort","old","school","pacif","island","new","zealand","immedi","rais","question","exactli","point","task","mean","perpetu","ingrain","stereotyp","pacif","island","new","zealand","intend","exploit","potenti","market","stori","weak","joke","humorless","end","expect","noth","new","zealand","cinema","mere","appropri","romant","comedi","devoid","ani","merit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,17,21,24,27,35,44,49,66,67,69,87,88,127,130,173,175,214,223,229,269,288,296,378,379,400,409,462,547,580,604,695,719,800,837,864,918,920,926,988,1044,1235,1243,1695,1748,2171,2263,2322,2899,3391,3657,3666,4430,5427,6892],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,17,21,24,27,35,44,49,66,67,69,87,88,127,130,173,175,214,223,229,269,288,296,378,379,400,409,462,547,580,604,695,719,800,837,864,918,920,926,988,1044,1235,1243,1695,1748,2171,2263,2322,2899,3391,3657,3666,4430,5427,6892],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,2.600540117735859,1.463169012899134,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,2.127032521151058,6.345073114567986,2.0317223413467334,2.4359679371086367,2.2642139034199635,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.7303758068497004,2.825563294794476,2.8432628718938773,2.76533567167316,2.8015621426949333,2.9504565686333644,6.261889888691316,3.1272886331425473,3.130944944345658,3.2209578243390444,3.2639531875991072,3.432149042129413,3.5039747767006686,3.5727776966246974,7.343025074620773,12.216815263143413,3.9121030022283168,3.8463152616903136,3.9782428047328615,4.039936373738201,3.952924996748572,3.9323057095458362,4.035401218572811,4.1554492608600455,4.4637506205145625,4.3215761317340196,4.715065048795469,4.706176101378222,5.039114765418124,5.064116067623542,5.051537285416681,5.3560264761848435,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,5.7959777603641776,18.304078229746075,20.176541156965058,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8341338219946435E-4,1.8325085032897537E-4,1.8329609637950112E-4,1.832592480010136E-4,1.8327659131506585E-4,1.832498399390702E-4,1.83306833183406E-4,1.832225753516671E-4,1.8325088905716926E-4,1.834402589938744E-4,1.8489580405681546E-4,1.832511917402506E-4,1.8342474219911888E-4,1.8344385189267553E-4,1.8336051814059898E-4,1.8325996983266748E-4,1.8332301834983033E-4,1.834092907855143E-4,1.8326943075474964E-4,1.8326876070352743E-4,1.834336388134801E-4,1.8328712236231627E-4,1.8328739975149178E-4,1.8340481562219995E-4,1.832694968646481E-4,1.8344604449948906E-4,1.8331535934666972E-4,1.8325043962579604E-4,1.8333351754392825E-4,1.8338947357617624E-4,1.8328802141531582E-4,1.83386186488204E-4,1.8347622452756656E-4,1.8364651891350798E-4,1.8331504257257505E-4,1.8325985868259065E-4,1.8332593421105953E-4,1.8327847043260042E-4,1.8322277090780293E-4,1.8326937399918932E-4,1.8345304123081846E-4,1.8335240568986678E-4,1.833866043937263E-4,1.832318898846594E-4,1

You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Still, it managed to disappoint, failing even to be a good-bad film.<br /><br />Every scene was by rote, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, leaned back and said, \"My work is done\". It's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Watch \"The X-Files\" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They handle it better. Also, let anyone know that sitting through \"Fatal Error\" is just that.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","expect","much","from","thi","tv","movi","you","have","to","set","the","bar","low","than","you","would","for","midget","limbo","for","ani","tb","movi","star","antonio","sabato","jr","still","it","manag","to","disappoint","fail","even","to","be","a","goodbad","filmbr","br","everi","scene","be","by","rote","a","if","someon","have","cut","and","past","scene","from","a","dozen","movi","and","tv","show","deal","with","big","busi","conspiraci","into","the","script","lean","back","and","sai","my","work","be","do","it","all","clich","all","predict","and","even","wrong","the","actor","be","forc","to","look","like","thei","re","take","it","serious","even","when","the","plot","develop","be","laughablebr","br","do","yourself","a","favor","watch","the","xfile","if","you","re","in","the","mood","for","paranoia","thei","handl","it","well","conjur","let","anyon","know","that","sit","through","fatal","error","be","just","that"],"filtered":["expect","much","thi","tv","movi","set","bar","low","midget","limbo","ani","tb","movi","star","antonio","sabato","jr","still","manag","disappoint","fail","even","goodbad","filmbr","br","everi","scene","rote","someon","cut","past","scene","dozen","movi","tv","show","deal","big","busi","conspiraci","script","lean","back","sai","work","clich","predict","even","wrong","actor","forc","look","like","thei","re","take","serious","even","plot","develop","laughablebr","br","favor","watch","xfile","re","mood","paranoia","thei","handl","well","conjur","let","anyon","know","sit","fatal","error"],"filtered2":["expect","tv","set","bar","low","midget","limbo","ani","tb","star","antonio","sabato","jr","still","manag","disappoint","fail","even","goodbad","filmbr","everi","scene","rote","someon","cut","past","scene","dozen","tv","show","deal","big","busi","conspiraci","script","lean","back","work","clich","predict","even","wrong","actor","forc","look","like","re","take","serious","even","plot","develop","laughablebr","favor","watch","xfile","re","mood","paranoia","handl","well","conjur","let","anyon","know","sit","fatal","error"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,16,19,20,25,26,27,28,31,32,39,41,48,63,64,68,77,82,85,100,109,124,130,139,158,172,187,215,217,244,303,320,337,338,345,371,440,468,566,790,945,1070,1110,1129,1323,1581,1844,1911,2028,2128,2835,3277,5224,5545,5652,7551,7862],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,16,19,20,25,26,27,28,31,32,39,41,48,63,64,68,77,82,85,100,109,124,130,139,158,172,187,215,217,244,303,320,337,338,345,371,440,468,566,790,945,1070,1110,1129,1323,1581,1844,1911,2028,2128,2835,3277,5224,5545,5652,7551,7862],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.7780513171783934,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,4.012839573363895,1.9463902258768238,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.1405462403177813,2.125691139326857,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.3106972614914807,5.000281788719697,2.4732161909892554,2.605934685587711,2.6113665294700725,2.634508058031767,2.868298950055202,2.938298364153555,2.973659465713028,2.9720957437368454,3.0022328381570844,3.0466846007279185,3.212973749990824,3.304513710030018,3.439602492783994,3.749984152751882,3.9782428047328615,4.176068548062782,4.1554492608600455,4.197121957260614,4.383707912841026,4.671389985292807,4.9227044135737135,4.890269137820559,4.9909126636002465,5.185068678041204,5.444579873526289,5.9370563586240825,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8905805373476247E-4,1.888905198354579E-4,1.889371583639502E-4,1.8889917595156248E-4,1.8891705301789596E-4,1.8888947835011646E-4,1.8894822560029494E-4,1.8886137467649954E-4,1.8889055975553827E-4,1.8908575768079335E-4,1.905860981326346E-4,1.8889087175389722E-4,1.8906976334612976E-4,1.890894611534978E-4,1.890035627485446E-4,1.8889991999807625E-4,1.8896490887621988E-4,1.8905383640476647E-4,1.8890967208646774E-4,1.889089814139636E-4,1.890789337598465E-4,1.889279081652853E-4,1.889281940913013E-4,1.8904922351525857E-4,1.8890974023094324E-4,1.8909172123927673E-4,1.8895701416202983E-4,1.8889009649260898E-4,1.889757311901543E-4,1.890334093073378E-4,1.8892883488725215E-4,1.8903002105699843E-4,1.8912283007823695E-4,1.8929836538968454E-4,1.8895668763899704E-4,1.8889980542728023E-4,1.8896791447506084E-4,1.8891898996655022E-4,1.8886157625100838E-4,1.8890961358421647E-4,1.8909893329976967E-4,1.8899520063162564E-4,1.890304518238473E-4,1.8887097587057738E

{"value":"There really wasn't much of a story in this film. It loosely based itself off the events in the first Lion King movie. It is supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa met via their aloneness. But there isn't much more than that.<br /><br />It mixes some scenes from the original, then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit. But still, is that it? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation.<br /><br />I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, then this is it. But other than that, it does little justice for the animators. Disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions. It really was quite boring and could have used Jason Statham.

{"value":"This is by far THE WORST movie i have ever watched. I've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake, no, wait, i mean the the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created. Please just do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for. In summation, i guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.<br /><br />Real Rating,

{"value":"I agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased \"For The Birds\" won the Oscar in 2002 for \"Best Animated Short,\" not this sick material, which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone, of course, who has no belief in heaven or hell.<br /><br />The animation was good, but so are a lot of animated shorts. And, by the way, I love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start.<br /><br />As for the story here: a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey (symbolism here) is told by a TV set (which appears every few hundred yards away) that he is in either heaven, hell, or purgatory. Each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news.

{"value":"One of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked. One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner. If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.","finished_norm":["on","of","the","major","flaw","in","thi","film","be","that","while","the","mock","of","pretenti","yuppi","be","satisfi","it","fail","to","realiz","that","the","movi","maker","themselv","be","guilti","of","be","on","of","that","that","deserv","to","be","mock","on","of","the","characterist","of","thi","yuppi","typ","be","the","conceit","misunderstand","that","thei","the","yuppi","be","the","onli","on","sophist","enough","to","understand","art","while","the","movi","ignor","thi","characterist","and","instead","focu","on","their","misunderstand","of","din","i","find","it","iron","that","onli","peopl","who","enjoi","thi","movi","boast","the","same","conceit","tast","in","film","a","the","charact","do","in","their","choic","of","dinner","if","thi","pompou","charact","that","be","in","thi","movi","have","a","video","librari","at","home","i","would","bet","that","american","psycho","would","be","on","of","that","movi"],"filtered":["major","flaw","thi","film","mock","pretenti","yuppi","satisfi","fail","realiz","movi","maker","themselv","guilti","deserv","mock","characterist","thi","yuppi","typ","conceit","misunderstand","thei","yuppi","onli","sophist","enough","understand","art","movi","ignor","thi","characterist","instead","focu","misunderstand","din","find","iron","onli","peopl","enjoi","thi","movi","boast","conceit","tast","film","charact","choic","dinner","thi","pompou","charact","thi","movi","video","librari","home","bet","american","psycho","movi"],"filtered2":["major","flaw","mock","pretenti","yuppi","satisfi","fail","realiz","maker","themselv","guilti","deserv","mock","characterist","yuppi","typ","conceit","misunderstand","yuppi","onli","sophist","enough","understand","art","ignor","characterist","instead","focu","misunderstand","din","find","iron","onli","peopl","enjoi","boast","conceit","tast","charact","choic","dinner","pompou","charact","video","librari","home","bet","american","psycho"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,23,38,93,152,200,212,215,223,240,302,382,384,404,405,423,436,619,762,763,809,872,923,1047,1246,1451,1685,1725,2038,2424,2711,2829,2902,3303,3379,3455,4610,6583,6587],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,23,38,93,152,200,212,215,223,240,302,382,384,404,405,423,436,619,762,763,809,872,923,1047,1246,1451,1685,1725,2038,2424,2711,2829,2902,3303,3379,3455,4610,6583,6587],"values":[2.247774048205673,1.982619630677639,1.364847727375781,1.519311641348122,2.035389827120098,2.3131195476980753,2.5308211829319704,2.5983793339432615,2.605934685587711,2.825563294794476,2.7666071276613566,2.902686292364678,3.235085203598255,3.109204957709252,3.1419947805322432,3.109204957709252,3.164467636384302,3.2070272508030975,3.5929222627171646,3.7465885637507435,3.749984152751882,3.8023521382691974,3.857614816944247,3.9911462095687695,4.140259095366071,4.315570107673808,4.499089986959872,4.662879295624898,4.789173020949191,4.979216623837056,5.259176650194926,10.852461469716184,5.3560264761848435,5.390512652256013,5.541743621979936,11.209845047202936,11.298748572344604,12.778082964734281,20.176541156965058,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278283E-4,2.505862069158131E-4,2.5064807858603353E-4,2.505976903047262E-4,2.506214064035924E-4,2.505848252590656E-4,2.5066276061866855E-4,2.5054754232407134E-4,2.505862598746463E-4,2.508452136206051E-4,2.528355973796035E-4,2.5058667377834775E-4,2.5082399519387317E-4,2.5085012672676965E-4,2.5073617206405766E-4,2.505986773727581E-4,2.5068489300962495E-4,2.5080286617253593E-4,2.5061161470196693E-4,2.5061069844103874E-4,2.508361608610074E-4,2.506358070744792E-4,2.5063618639005247E-4,2.5079674661457346E-4,2.5061170510388677E-4,2.508531250049423E-4,2.506744197127899E-4,2.505856453001279E-4,2.5069925012294775E-4,2.507757671478342E-4,2.5063703648367747E-4,2.507712722224067E-4,2.5089439465660816E-4,2.5112726355820133E-4,2.506739865403452E-4,0.35150245229523747,2.506888803013838E-4,2.506239760011385E-4,2.5054780973712956E-4,2.506115370916281E-4,2.5086269267877027E-4,2.5072507870075743E-4,2.507718436869292E-4,2.505602794736537E-4,2.506116008157933E-4,2.50598431146074E-4,2.506832564429229E-4,2.507267252329182E-4,2.50675741370145E-4,2.506360088222566E-4,2.505990508567381E-4,2.511124876152885E-4,2.50662108796618E-4,2.506115433759326E-4,2.5066076640818544E-4,2.505859016833081E-4,0.6289426030131816,2.50624997268677E-4,2.5059940266573095E-4,2.50585758642485E-4,2.50786233260484E-4,2.506855613798026E-4,2.5058565389105827E-4,2.5056017738972995E-4,2.505349807961613E-4,2.5076150407809297E-4,2.5059792990114835E-4,2.5071184239933196E-4,2.5078541996925843E-4,2.506716435043773E-4,2.5061187530261986E-4,2.505605058574261E-4,2.5062460386425056E-4,2.5056037090243435E-4,2.505735199054816E-4,2.505605129489129E-4,2.507231617352094E-4,2.50648538498

Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. It delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.<br /><br />Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright.

{"value":"This movie had so much potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of those elements was wasted. The story went nowhere, the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring, pointless, waste of a film. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak. However, I thought this movie was dreadful. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was Jody Foster's character. A very cocky \"fixer\" of sorts makes a nice idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere.

{"value":"The only film I've ever walked out on. Amazing, since I paid for myself and my date and I'm really cheap. But my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on, particularly since I could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end this film offends. Worse, it ain't funny. It wasn't funny then, and it sure ain't funny now. But even worse, is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart, sophisticated comedy. It's juvenile, really sophomoric script and ideas began an era (which continues to this day) where cheap laughs, and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film.<br /><br />Sexual Olympics?

{"value":"I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie. It is a \"B\" movie at best. Many events, characters, how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that in the book are very smooth, are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child. The character development is very poor. Personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a \"B\" horror flick. I understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book, but they screen play base missed many points. The casting was very good.","finished_norm":["i","read","the","book","celestin","propheci","and","be","look","forward","to","see","the","movi","be","advis","that","the","movi","be","loos","base","on","the","book","mani","of","the","book","much","interest","point","do","not","even","come","out","in","the","movi","it","be","a","b","movi","at","well","mani","event","charact","how","the","charact","interact","and","meet","in","the","book","be","simpli","chang","or","do","not","occur","the","flow","of","event","that","in","the","book","be","veri","smooth","be","choppi","and","fe","to","the","view","a","though","you","a","child","the","charact","develop","be","veri","poor","personnal","of","the","charact","differ","from","that","in","the","book","the","direct","be","similar","to","a","b","horror","flick","i","understand","that","it","would","take","six","hour","in","film","to","present","all","that","be","in","the","book","but","thei","screen","plai","base","miss","mani","point","the","cast","be","veri","good"],"filtered":["read","book","celestin","propheci","look","forward","see","movi","advis","movi","loos","base","book","mani","book","much","interest","point","even","come","movi","b","movi","well","mani","event","charact","charact","interact","meet","book","simpli","chang","occur","flow","event","book","veri","smooth","choppi","fe","view","though","child","charact","develop","veri","poor","personnal","charact","differ","book","direct","similar","b","horror","flick","understand","take","six","hour","film","present","book","thei","screen","plai","base","miss","mani","point","cast","veri","good"],"filtered2":["read","book","celestin","propheci","look","forward","see","advis","loos","base","book","mani","book","interest","point","even","come","b","well","mani","event","charact","charact","interact","meet","book","simpli","chang","occur","flow","event","book","veri","smooth","choppi","fe","view","though","child","charact","develop","veri","poor","personnal","charact","differ","book","direct","similar","b","horror","flick","understand","take","six","hour","present","book","screen","plai","base","miss","mani","point","cast","veri","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,10,15,16,20,31,34,40,50,60,66,83,86,92,102,145,146,151,174,180,192,201,204,212,255,257,278,312,320,334,350,411,470,589,642,699,940,1259,1348,1899,1913,2043,2122,2909,3473,4301],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,10,15,16,20,31,34,40,50,60,66,83,86,92,102,145,146,151,174,180,192,201,204,212,255,257,278,312,320,334,350,411,470,589,642,699,940,1259,1348,1899,1913,2043,2122,2909,3473,4301],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,4.495548096411346,3.6001823395697077,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,5.153983156711065,1.838176641236591,3.859446346783224,2.292318797740072,2.031112399272319,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.34599021453259,2.326138445979858,19.601718407671303,2.456282578459816,2.7097314792693545,2.5318267134339894,2.561435818751577,2.624524614047584,2.5983793339432615,2.6754694156628323,2.7602659523229094,2.8336934208777267,2.8824835850471584,2.938298364153555,5.885680771176112,3.0135689919434205,3.229006157521873,6.762949502332293,3.530930586689197,7.244845854227726,3.5813614403160887,3.952924996748572,4.315570107673808,4.470719289830655,4.828393734102471,4.848596441419991,4.900964426937307,4.9909126636002465,5.373120909544144,5.967828017290836,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691644E-4,1.8602795149399943E-4,1.8607388323225543E-4,1.860364764297571E-4,1.8605408257553742E-4,1.8602692579199626E-4,1.8608478274858745E-4,1.8599924801951213E-4,1.8602799080910527E-4,1.8622023057954324E-4,1.8769783390787723E-4,1.8602829807924055E-4,1.8620447863330704E-4,1.8622387792744204E-4,1.861392812821262E-4,1.860372092005118E-4,1.861012131954263E-4,1.8618879305904975E-4,1.8604681349948795E-4,1.8604613329387882E-4,1.8621351007268032E-4,1.8606477321704635E-4,1.8606505480995574E-4,1.8618425007623426E-4,1.8604688061125824E-4,1.8622610376242845E-4,1.860934381228092E-4,1.8602753456676015E-4,1.8611187150105964E-4,1.8616867552698443E-4,1.8606568589487292E-4,1.861653386243684E-4,1.862567411580488E-4,1.864296162945665E-4,1.8609311654811634E-4,1.8603709636599527E-4,1.8610417324549069E-4,1.8605599017042685E-4,1.8599944653923132E-4,1.8604675588381736E-4,1.8623320652672137E-4,1.8613104589010153E-4,1.8616576286309959E-4,1.8600870371092404E-4,1.8604680319079432E-4,1.8603702640894394E-4,1.8609999825564645E-4,1.8613226822794968E-4,1.8609441928299904E-4,1.8606492298876048E-4,1.8603748646421503E-4,1.8641864706196067E-4,1.860842988547519E-4,1.8604676054910323E-4,1.8608330230440983E-4,1.8602772489821693E-4,0.9852969376159039,1.86056748329905

{"value":"Nowhere near the original. It's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story. But the directing is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good directing. Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen. I watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B movie with second rate acting and directing. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do. This remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.<br /><br />It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.<br /><br />This is a complete waste of your time.

{"value":"What a muddled mess. I saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema, but this sure isn't one of them.<br /><br />While there very well could be some good ideas/concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances), it is all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned, or maybe he watched himself in Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness.<br /><br />His quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all.

{"value":"let me first say, i watched this movie around midnight, and usually there only is trash around this hour, but this movie broke the record<br /><br />first of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy, yet he gets to f*ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop, talks to a girl and then you see them f*ck<br /><br />secondly there are loads of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all, i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say: fast put your clothes on so we can f*ck!<br /><br />thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family, this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such

How on earth I managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows. <br /><br />Maybe it's me!!Maybe I don't get the premise of the film... or maybe I don't appreciate it's alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds.<br /><br />In addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do it? why do I watch such tripe? It's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion!! YAARGH!! An absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect. Apart from that it's not to bad.","finished_norm":["dooohhh","my","bwainn","hurrrt","good","it","certainli","doe","after","thi","endur","test","of","a","film","how","on","earth","i","manag","to","keep","go","without","hit","the","fast","forward","button","lord","onli","know","br","br","mayb","it","memayb","i","do","not","get","the","premis","of","the","film","or","mayb","i","do","not","appreci","it","alleg","mystic","atmospher","in","my","humbl","opinion","though","the","film","have","about","a","much","mystic","atmospher","a","a","trip","to","mcdonaldsbr","br","in","addit","the","charact","be","all","dread","and","there","be","much","charact","develop","in","a","tom","jerri","cartoon","yaarrrghhh","why","do","i","do","it","why","do","i","watch","such","tripe","it","enough","to","make","on","run","awai","and","join","a","monasteri","or","the","foreign","legion","yaargh","a","absolutlei","dread","film","in","just","about","everi","respect","apart","from","that","it","not","to","bad"],"filtered":["dooohhh","bwainn","hurrrt","good","certainli","doe","thi","endur","test","film","earth","manag","keep","go","without","hit","fast","forward","button","lord","onli","know","br","br","mayb","memayb","get","premis","film","mayb","appreci","alleg","mystic","atmospher","humbl","opinion","though","film","much","mystic","atmospher","trip","mcdonaldsbr","br","addit","charact","dread","much","charact","develop","tom","jerri","cartoon","yaarrrghhh","watch","tripe","enough","make","run","awai","join","monasteri","foreign","legion","yaargh","absolutlei","dread","film","everi","respect","apart","bad"],"filtered2":["dooohhh","bwainn","hurrrt","good","certainli","doe","endur","test","earth","manag","keep","go","without","hit","fast","forward","button","lord","onli","know","mayb","memayb","get","premis","mayb","appreci","alleg","mystic","atmospher","humbl","opinion","though","mystic","atmospher","trip","mcdonaldsbr","addit","charact","dread","charact","develop","tom","jerri","cartoon","yaarrrghhh","watch","tripe","enough","make","run","awai","join","monasteri","foreign","legion","yaargh","absolutlei","dread","everi","respect","apart","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,9,10,11,18,26,85,86,93,125,134,137,155,163,320,345,388,389,484,522,538,542,572,653,694,699,759,835,961,995,1042,1185,1306,1319,1431,1446,1762,1770,2549,2766,3027,3581,4076,5685,6110],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,9,10,11,18,26,85,86,93,125,134,137,155,163,320,345,388,389,484,522,538,542,572,653,694,699,759,835,961,995,1042,1185,1306,1319,1431,1446,1762,1770,2549,2766,3027,3581,4076,5685,6110],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,2.035389827120098,2.2242236634876535,2.2443961816702407,2.2939035841256437,2.3074766467914385,4.800114871605731,2.938298364153555,3.0022328381570844,3.0914425013694116,3.0914425013694116,3.291526514503207,3.604618302480356,3.43462735814388,3.4471119148061256,3.4933926673701317,3.9911462095687695,3.6284289511740746,3.5813614403160887,3.969732115064953,7.722819775825597,3.9954846111673676,8.061773076436568,4.115443926246347,4.235066888824737,4.499089986959872,4.403125998698128,4.890269137820559,4.581533656170946,4.724033718778229,4.789173020949191,5.185068678041204,5.3064295350454715,11.124725818365345,5.672363804397,5.822646007446338,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816466E-4,2.2324275812784212E-4,2.2329787848933362E-4,2.232529884731E-4,2.2327411672029316E-4,2.232415272346222E-4,2.23310958448924E-4,2.2320831253640848E-4,2.2324280530791688E-4,2.2347350255652807E-4,2.252466997550512E-4,2.2324317404730224E-4,2.2345459944065E-4,2.2347787955470622E-4,2.233763593891773E-4,2.232538678343091E-4,2.2333067579914003E-4,2.2343577597443485E-4,2.232653934689038E-4,2.2326457718847365E-4,2.234654376153402E-4,2.232869460197476E-4,2.2328728394518973E-4,2.2343032416998444E-4,2.232654740063531E-4,2.234805506669639E-4,2.233213453268011E-4,2.2324225779449925E-4,2.2334346629394172E-4,2.2341163393927875E-4,2.2328804127835604E-4,2.234076294908202E-4,2.2351731705956893E-4,2.2372477578809868E-4,2.2332095942123793E-4,2.2325373242729915E-4,2.2333422800586628E-4,2.2327640592866794E-4,2.2320855076990673E-4,2.232653243272447E-4,2.2348907433600583E-4,2.2336647651074383E-4,2.2340813859831555E-4,2.2321965983456367E-4,2.2326538109796075E-4,2.232536484753717E-4,2.2332921781121275E-4,2.233679433767196E-4,2.2332252276763826E-4,2.2328712575322467E-4,2.2325420056448943E-4,2.2371161216552582E-4,2.233103777523479E-4,2.2326532992581887E-4,2.2330918184256557E-4,2.2324248620167692E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731

{"value":"This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the Perfect fair and just prosecutor (not to mention executive producer), the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path.<br /><br />Sure, nobody wants to defend the Nazi's point of view, but THAT WAS THE POINT of the Nuremberg Trails! Four hours of simply bashing on the Nazi's.... c'mon! Thats been done already!<br /><br />I really think Alec Baldwin should just stick to being Kim Bassinger's husband.<br /><br />Right after the movie ended, TNT showed the 1959 movie, Trail at Nuremberg. That movie is FAR
