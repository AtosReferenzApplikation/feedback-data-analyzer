{"value":"In recent times I have been subjected to both this movie and \"King Arthur\", on DVDs chosen by others for an evening's \"entertainment\" and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion I have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination, and is content as long as they get \"action\". Both movies were utter rubbish.<br /><br />Whatever happened to character development? Whatever happened to meaningful dialogue? Whatever happened to ACTING? And, when watching something that vaguely purports to be \"historical\", whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of the \"political map\" of the time, even some slight flavour of the era, especially in its social attitudes. Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America? I have read on the message boards of disclaimers that \"little was known\" of the dark ages. Not so. Considerable amounts are known, with much learned scholarship on the era, but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework.<br /><br />I only wish I could vote

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Alice, having defeated Freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to re-adjust her life. But her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence- Freddy, trying to come out into their world again.<br /><br />It's interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing Freddy films- Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin made a good job of it, Hopkins IMO has made something of a podge with this entry, that should be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />The story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here, with Freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby. Even at about an hour and a half, it all gets rather tiresome, and of course, not scary at all.<br /><br />The \"bon appetit, bitch\" catch-phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very

{"value":"Horrendous pillaging of a classic.<br /><br />It wasn't written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him, but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues; lying about the knives, etc... ) This, in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him, but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the 'mistaken-identity-murder-game later on. Which in itself is also ridiculous: 'So-and-so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need extending.<br /><br />It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again, but that's about the only small pleasure to be had. It's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all.","finished_norm":["horrend","pillag","of","a","classicbr","br","it","be","not","write","convincingli","at","all","why","mari","should","develop","such","sympathi","for","bate","he","mai","be","much","stabl","until","thei","start","plai","prank","with","him","but","he","still","doe","not","help","himself","at","all","with","hi","action","invit","a","compar","strang","to","stai","alon","with","him","in","hi","until","recent","disus","motel","tell","the","attract","young","girl","of","hi","past","mental","issu","lie","about","the","knife","etc","thi","in","addit","to","her","previou","knowledg","should","have","keep","mari","extrem","wari","of","him","but","thi","somehow","doe","not","happen","just","so","thei","can","plai","the","mistakenidentitymurdergam","late","on","which","in","itself","be","conjur","ridicul","soandso","be","the","real","killer","plu","her","a","good","conjur","him","there","be","too","mani","contriv","twist","in","order","to","slap","a","stori","on","screen","when","the","narr","do","not","ne","extendingbr","br","it","be","good","to","see","perkin","repris","hi","famou","role","again","but","that","about","the","onli","small","pleasur","to","be","have","it","definit","not","a","patch","on","hitchcock","and","if","you","have","no","intent","of","even","try","to","get","close","then","you","should","not","be","bother","at","all"],"filtered":["horrend","pillag","classicbr","br","write","convincingli","mari","develop","sympathi","bate","mai","much","stabl","thei","start","plai","prank","still","doe","help","hi","action","invit","compar","strang","stai","alon","hi","recent","disus","motel","tell","attract","young","girl","hi","past","mental","issu","lie","knife","etc","thi","addit","previou","knowledg","keep","mari","extrem","wari","thi","somehow","doe","happen","thei","plai","mistakenidentitymurdergam","late","conjur","ridicul","soandso","real","killer","plu","good","conjur","mani","contriv","twist","order","slap","stori","screen","narr","ne","extendingbr","br","good","see","perkin","repris","hi","famou","role","onli","small","pleasur","definit","patch","hitchcock","intent","even","try","get","close","bother"],"filtered2":["horrend","pillag","classicbr","write","convincingli","mari","develop","sympathi","bate","mai","stabl","start","plai","prank","still","doe","help","action","invit","compar","strang","stai","alon","recent","disus","motel","tell","attract","young","girl","past","mental","issu","lie","knife","etc","addit","previou","knowledg","keep","mari","extrem","wari","somehow","doe","happen","plai","mistakenidentitymurdergam","late","conjur","ridicul","soandso","real","killer","plu","good","conjur","mani","contriv","twist","order","slap","stori","screen","narr","ne","extendingbr","good","see","perkin","repris","famou","role","onli","small","pleasur","definit","patch","hitchcock","intent","even","try","get","close","bother"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,11,17,18,36,39,40,46,50,64,65,71,80,84,90,94,110,128,129,134,135,150,185,192,252,274,295,320,329,363,366,392,417,429,435,439,440,457,482,496,549,562,648,650,749,784,806,811,865,911,921,1180,1185,1198,1490,1631,1638,1673,1681,1706,1916,2496,3326,4547,4711,4992,5149,5797,7379,8121],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,11,17,18,36,39,40,46,50,64,65,71,80,84,90,94,110,128,129,134,135,150,185,192,252,274,295,320,329,363,366,392,417,429,435,439,440,457,482,496,549,562,648,650,749,784,806,811,865,911,921,1180,1185,1198,1490,1631,1638,1673,1681,1706,1916,2496,3326,4547,4711,4992,5149,5797,7379,8121],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,1.4680183469605717,3.1077880109725475,3.2569937516641474,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.0477128419653545,2.08112281984698,2.1290479736304078,2.3409902041158843,2.4106958340079214,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.332712011146513,2.518833027372001,2.5318267134339894,3.0433232530252132,2.748952192422636,2.7910771187233068,2.938298364153555,2.951986790814132,3.0349689855553557,3.008694896185175,3.0670934723591254,3.1932880749197934,3.2872346624216657,3.2829611516442836,3.2872346624216657,3.212973749990824,3.3243163373261977,3.3154667220492153,3.293679367864308,3.4471119148061256,3.432149042129413,3.6105180246075443,3.6621227969605474,3.7165362186843414,3.7636829971100436,3.880604335168946,3.8425769395797067,3.9201351739255808,3.969732115064953,8.7043191102122,4.263079925052412,4.235066888824737,4.34596758485818,4.558366596889411,4.646072177308517,4.589376833631972,4.7061

{"value":"Note: I will reveal a key part of the plot, but if you've looked at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you'll already know it.<br /><br />This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who isn't very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer doesn't know the difference between a chemical and an organism.<br /><br />Forget the fact the the UN and the NSA seem to be running the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don't wear protective gear (not even gloves). These are quibbles in the context of this movie. In the scientific world within this story, 2+2=6.34 and gravity goes sideways.<br /><br />The fact is that the people in this movie do not (with a few exceptions) behave the way human beings behave. Almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate.

{"value":"Elvis Presley plays a \"half-breed\" Native American (\"Indian\") who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight, and make children. Fighting, wrestling, and \"punching out\" each other replace the stereotypical hand-raised expression \"How\"?<br /><br />Although he does have make-up on, it's obvious Elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films; possibly, he was getting ready for his famous \"comeback\". It couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about. Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in \"war paint\", should be ashamed.<br /><br />The best song is \"Stay Away\" (actually, \"Green Sleeves\" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis' love song to the bull \"Dominic\". There are some surreal scenes, but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre; though, \"Stay Away, Joe\" might provide some laughs if you're in the right \"mood\".<br /><br />Otherwise,

{"value":"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's \"hippie mentality\" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in \"love\" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she \"loves\" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can.

{"value":"A group of extremely unlikable A-holes are tormented by lame puppets that some elderly douche bag night-watchman has kept locked away in a film vault for twenty years for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />Many people know this film merely from MST3K's spot-on ribbing of the flick. But I've seen the actual movie and can safely say that yes it's bad, really, REALLY bad. From the one of the most awful 'fight' scenes I've ever witnessed to the stuffed toy 'aliens' that suffer from a lack of motion (I had a My Pet Monster that was scarier) right up to the atrocious acting (I had a My Pet Monster that was more charismatic) However, that being said Rick Sloan's \"Vice Academy\" films are somehow, and trust me I have no earthly idea how, much worse. That's not to suggest that this film is anything but crap, because it isn't.

{"value":"This flick was a blow to me. I guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models, home makers or mistresses, since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway. It is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated. Inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected), Artemisia's entire character and all that she stands for, had been reduced to a standard Hollywood, female character; a pitiful, physically flawless, helpless little creature, displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here. Sadder yet, was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film, and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture, just plain pisses me off. If the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.","finished_norm":["thi","flick","be","a","blow","to","me","i","guess","littl","girl","should","aspir","to","be","noth","much","than","swimsuit","model","home","maker","or","mistress","sinc","that","seem","to","be","all","thei","will","ever","be","portrai","a","anywai","it","be","truli","sadden","to","see","a","artist","work","and","life","be","so","unjustli","misinterpret","inconciev","or","perhap","it","should","have","be","expect","artemisia","entir","charact","and","all","that","she","stand","for","have","be","reduc","to","a","standard","hollywood","femal","charact","a","piti","physic","flawless","helpless","littl","creatur","displai","none","of","the","charact","trait","that","actual","get","her","that","place","in","histori","which","be","be","mutil","here","sad","yet","be","to","see","that","a","great","part","of","the","audienc","be","too","badli","educ","in","the","area","to","comprehend","the","incred","gap","between","the","messag","convei","in","the","film","and","realiti","to","portrai","the","artist","a","someon","in","love","with","her","reallif","rapist","someon","whom","she","in","realiti","accus","of","rape","her","even","when","under","tortur","just","plain","piss","me","off","if","the","director","have","noth","much","substanti","to","sai","she","should","have","refrain","from","base","her","stori","on","a","real","person"],"filtered":["thi","flick","blow","guess","littl","girl","aspir","noth","much","swimsuit","model","home","maker","mistress","sinc","seem","thei","ever","portrai","anywai","truli","sadden","see","artist","work","life","unjustli","misinterpret","inconciev","perhap","expect","artemisia","entir","charact","stand","reduc","standard","hollywood","femal","charact","piti","physic","flawless","helpless","littl","creatur","displai","none","charact","trait","actual","get","place","histori","mutil","sad","yet","see","great","part","audienc","badli","educ","area","comprehend","incred","gap","messag","convei","film","realiti","portrai","artist","someon","love","reallif","rapist","someon","realiti","accus","rape","even","tortur","plain","piss","director","noth","much","substanti","sai","refrain","base","stori","real","person"],"filtered2":["flick","blow","guess","littl","girl","aspir","noth","swimsuit","model","home","maker","mistress","sinc","seem","ever","portrai","anywai","truli","sadden","see","artist","work","life","unjustli","misinterpret","inconciev","perhap","expect","artemisia","entir","charact","stand","reduc","standard","hollywood","femal","charact","piti","physic","flawless","helpless","littl","creatur","displai","none","charact","trait","actual","get","place","histori","mutil","sad","yet","see","great","part","audienc","badli","educ","area","comprehend","incred","gap","messag","convei","realiti","portrai","artist","someon","love","reallif","rapist","someon","realiti","accus","rape","even","tortur","plain","piss","director","noth","substanti","refrain","base","stori","real","person"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,10,14,17,35,44,48,49,51,52,54,58,61,75,80,84,130,139,153,162,164,168,194,198,243,257,300,302,318,334,342,370,377,386,422,448,455,469,499,569,586,616,656,724,746,754,761,763,802,970,1063,1105,1157,1266,1418,1613,1719,2013,2054,2625,2849,3080,3268,4015,4256,4361,4660,5024,5177,6547,6937],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,10,14,17,35,44,48,49,51,52,54,58,61,75,80,84,130,139,153,162,164,168,194,198,243,257,300,302,318,334,342,370,377,386,422,448,455,469,499,569,586,616,656,724,746,754,761,763,802,970,1063,1105,1157,1266,1418,1613,1719,2013,2054,2625,2849,3080,3268,4015,4256,4361,4660,5024,5177,6547,6937],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,3.3716610723085094,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,1.463169012899134,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,3.3840606616174704,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.2642139034199635,4.587807168251287,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,2.3930275298746078,2.4894767118610357,2.5378812223426954,2.5439726117360975,2.627841366673578,2.7602659523229094,2.932274249550174,2.902686292364678,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,2.9705344631698933,2.9958122703541616,3.0602441305135506,3.0433232530252132,3.2090054908152035,3.2681460658591432,3.2787058260741455,6.657541375351156,3.3814747511661465,3.6436037491933098,3.4572130107926293,3.5173618574831282,7.36198256252986,7.597548633842627,4.00861390260916,3.7465885637507435,3.9405024767500145,3.749984152751882,3.8883864756110005,4.086456389373095,4.100845126825194,4.390138803171316,4.2860694432771105,4.32

{"value":"I saw this film in my cinema class. I am glad that I did not pay to see it. I came into it with an open mind, and was even a little excited. I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never connected with this movie. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the storyline, or rather, lack thereof, was a problem. There was no central, connecting theme to the movie. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a western? Kind of, but no. I'm all for twists in movies, I recently saw \"Brick\" and loved it, but the place that this movie went was just too out there. It was so weird, and if I weren't required to have sat through the whole film, I would have walked out. The writing wasn't terrible, but it was just all over the place. By the time this movie ended, I was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner. There was just something about this film that didn't resonate, I understand more offbeat films like \"Fight Club\", but I just did not care about the characters at all.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","in","my","cinema","class","i","be","glad","that","i","do","not","pai","to","see","it","i","come","into","it","with","a","open","mind","and","be","even","a","littl","excit","i","realli","enjoi","ed","norton","and","evan","rachel","wood","and","the","rest","of","the","cast","be","interest","i","just","never","connect","with","thi","movi","the","act","be","great","the","cinematographi","be","interest","but","the","storylin","or","rather","lack","thereof","be","a","problem","there","be","no","central","connect","theme","to","the","movi","be","it","a","romanc","between","norton","and","wood","good","no","not","realli","be","it","a","western","kind","of","but","no","i","be","all","for","twist","in","movi","i","recent","see","brick","and","love","it","but","the","place","that","thi","movi","go","be","just","too","out","there","it","be","so","weird","and","if","i","be","not","requir","to","have","sit","through","the","whole","film","i","would","have","walk","out","the","write","be","not","terribl","but","it","be","just","all","over","the","place","by","the","time","thi","movi","end","i","be","just","leav","terribli","confus","and","wish","that","it","have","end","soon","there","be","just","someth","about","thi","film","that","do","not","reson","i","understand","much","offbeat","film","like","fight","club","but","i","just","do","not","care","about","the","charact","at","all"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","cinema","class","glad","pai","see","come","open","mind","even","littl","excit","realli","enjoi","ed","norton","evan","rachel","wood","rest","cast","interest","never","connect","thi","movi","act","great","cinematographi","interest","storylin","rather","lack","thereof","problem","central","connect","theme","movi","romanc","norton","wood","good","realli","western","kind","twist","movi","recent","see","brick","love","place","thi","movi","go","weird","requir","sit","whole","film","walk","write","terribl","place","time","thi","movi","end","leav","terribli","confus","wish","end","soon","someth","thi","film","reson","understand","much","offbeat","film","like","fight","club","care","charact"],"filtered2":["see","cinema","class","glad","pai","see","come","open","mind","even","littl","excit","realli","enjoi","ed","norton","evan","rachel","wood","rest","cast","interest","never","connect","act","great","cinematographi","interest","storylin","rather","lack","thereof","problem","central","connect","theme","romanc","norton","wood","good","realli","western","kind","twist","recent","see","brick","love","place","go","weird","requir","sit","whole","walk","write","terribl","place","time","end","leav","terribli","confus","wish","end","soon","someth","reson","understand","offbeat","like","fight","club","care","charact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,8,10,13,14,21,24,34,42,51,53,54,60,65,74,92,111,122,160,164,166,167,183,200,205,212,226,233,238,242,244,294,322,399,409,427,435,449,515,524,534,562,625,628,629,655,767,769,892,989,1035,1152,1227,1263,1376,2400,4705,4890,5681,5827,5945,6116],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,8,10,13,14,21,24,34,42,51,53,54,60,65,74,92,111,122,160,164,166,167,183,200,205,212,226,233,238,242,244,294,322,399,409,427,435,449,515,524,534,562,625,628,629,655,767,769,892,989,1035,1152,1227,1263,1376,2400,4705,4890,5681,5827,5945,6116],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,3.676353282473182,1.9073850067444174,1.9486336368009016,2.0489535369135887,2.1183455303375887,2.2489347673732487,2.3722295531801256,4.7860550597492155,2.4423870329693536,2.4609576687888097,2.4885128563647294,2.5308211829319704,2.571852579609833,2.5983793339432615,2.5940874818617203,2.8377834061292515,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.634508058031767,2.886778509330039,2.885344817328191,3.129115117668582,3.2209578243390444,3.233054746047873,3.2829611516442836,3.2597778161886266,3.3956930001684253,3.4028786598293,3.4933926673701317,3.432149042129413,3.6194333882654965,3.607563812710113,3.488143311483988,7.459562890868725,7.5833136983049,4.0536665665501035,3.9825254665248626,4.044492190274062,4.2860694432771105,4.213208095012239,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.535724120139652,5.373120909544144,6.0662680901040895,13.200701152068694,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6168948300964637E-4,1.6154620178448814E-4,1.615860887896238E-4,1.6

{"value":"Special effects? Good.<br /><br />Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. No meaning. This film rendered Superman as a meaningless hero, a hero with no archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here, he represented nothing but a Hulk.<br /><br />Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a fine choice, among others.<br /><br />This still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever. I cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film, when Superman was, and is, daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken.<br /><br />Just a few instances: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and on and on and on. He was just another goofball Hackman incarnation.<br /><br />And Superman? For what did he stand in this film?

{"value":"How the hell did they get this made?! Presenting itself as a caper comedy, the misbegotten \"$\" is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments. The usually dependable Warren Beatty looks drunk, and the usually hilarious Goldie Hawn acts like she's on depressants. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the guy with the champagne bottle of LSD can save this litany of worthlessness.<br /><br />Am I comparing this movie to \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\"? I wouldn't do such a thing even if someone paid me. \"P9FOS\" was idiotically made but ended up hilarious; this was idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted out of your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for this when they co-starred in \"Shampoo\", but then they co-starred in the dreadful \"Town & Country\". Maybe they just shouldn't co-star in movies. All in all, I would rather have my skin torn off than have to watch this again. Awful.<br /><br />Maybe they should remake it with Jackie Chan.

{"value":"I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I still couldn't make it to the end credits. First time I managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest. Second time I managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting, lame SFX and extremely poor direction. Pales in comparison to the original.<br /><br />Anyone ever hear about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who haven't let me fill you in. It's 1982...ET is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time...Atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away let alone sell them.<br /><br />What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story?

{"value":"I really looked forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir amazing debut work, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered his best silent film so I had high hopes. Sadly this felt like a huge step backwards.<br /><br />Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this film. Her acting is over the top, even for a silent film. Her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens, not the late 20s. She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains. It was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all.<br /><br />The film was also quite long drawn, the camera work was uninteresting (aside from a shot of a horse race) and the editing was dull. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films.

{"value":"Artemesia takes the usual story about the art world, eg, \"You can't paint that! But I want to!\" and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film, well, interesting, but not remarkable.<br /><br />The story is about one of the first female painters around, Artemesia who course, is fiercely independent, but just can't stop thinking of men, and their bodies for artistic purposes of course. She soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist, but soon tutoring becomes much more then art, and soon after that, scandal erupts! Funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft-porn fantasy. I mean, was Artemesia THAT much of a man-hungry person? Also, it's quite funny when she's insisting that she \"paints for herself!\" yet falls for the first person she sees.<br /><br />Actually, the story itself is quite fascinating, and it ends with a trial, which I always love. But I wasn't too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher, who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn't fall for.

{"value":"About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not? Oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre! Whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity. I know it what it takes to make films and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making Meat Market but none of that money and time went in to making it good. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. I don't know how you got a DVD release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall. In gore films it is quality not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I couldn't get my money back. Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock.

{"value":"Basically this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns. Watching the Detectives has none of that.<br /><br />The premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads, not to mention the lack of any real visual story-telling style. I mean, this film is centered around MOVIES, yet is itself incredibly uncinematic! That's a major failing right there.<br /><br />But the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way. So the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem, well, not terribly interesting.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And the romance isn't terribly romantic, either.<br /><br />So avoid it.

{"value":"Stalker is right! Girl sees guy, girl wants guy, girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him, girl won't leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can't stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying, girl STILL won't leave him alone. Played right, Drake's character could have been charming but she's completely, wholly, unrelenting in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, Drake's attempt at playing, \"charmingly screwball\" comes off as, \"disturbingly demented.\" Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as I've ever seen from him. The direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim.<br /><br />Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt, it just stinks. Worse still, Drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of Valium and a restraining order. She ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust

{"value":"The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches. <br /><br />(Moderate Spoiler Alert) Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which delivers death by cartoon. Still this was handled nicely, especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out.<br /><br />Additionally, there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle.<br /><br />Having said that, I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale, because this was pretty awful. I bought \"Soul Survivors\" at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream. However , where \"Soul Survivors\" has nothing to redeem it, or have it make any sense, this at least had a couple of stylish notes, referred to above.<br /><br />Interestingly, the DVD lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens, which is the only way to watch this. The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable.<br /><br />3 out of

{"value":"It was the tag-line \"in the tradition of American Pie\" that fooled me into renting this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in the style of Jackass, with the major difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie seems like a Citizen Kane.<br /><br />This movie made me regret that I rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10, because now I can't go beneath that. This one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic feats.<br /><br />I actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something I very rarely do. But it was just too plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary.<br /><br />Can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop you on the head when you were just a child? Or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you got nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off? Something must be wrong, at least.<br /><br />My advice: stay clear of this one. Even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure.","finished_norm":["it","be","the","taglin","in","the","tradit","of","american","pie","that","fool","me","into","rent","thi","movi","what","i","get","be","a","piec","of","junk","in","the","styl","of","jackass","with","the","major","differ","that","compar","to","thi","jackass","the","movi","seem","like","a","citizen","kanebr","br","thi","movi","make","me","regret","that","i","reward","other","movi","with","out","of","becaus","now","i","ca","not","go","beneath","that","thi","on","make","quit","some","bad","movi","look","like","cinemat","featsbr","br","i","actual","turn","it","off","after","minut","and","that","someth","i","veri","rare","do","but","it","be","just","too","plain","bore","stupid","uninterest","and","unnecessarybr","br","ca","not","believ","some","peopl","actual","reward","thi","with","out","of","what","do","your","parent","do","drop","you","on","the","head","when","you","be","just","a","child","or","be","it","the","veri","movi","you","ever","see","so","you","get","noth","to","compar","it","to","be","you","still","a","virgin","and","be","breast","all","you","ever","think","off","someth","must","be","wrong","at","leastbr","br","my","advic","stai","clear","of","thi","on","even","if","your","in","the","mood","for","a","simpl","movi","that","doe","not","requir","think","choos","someth","els","or","you","will","regret","it","for","sure"],"filtered":["taglin","tradit","american","pie","fool","rent","thi","movi","get","piec","junk","styl","jackass","major","differ","compar","thi","jackass","movi","seem","like","citizen","kanebr","br","thi","movi","make","regret","reward","movi","becaus","ca","go","beneath","thi","make","quit","bad","movi","look","like","cinemat","featsbr","br","actual","turn","minut","someth","veri","rare","plain","bore","stupid","uninterest","unnecessarybr","br","ca","believ","peopl","actual","reward","thi","parent","drop","head","child","veri","movi","ever","see","get","noth","compar","still","virgin","breast","ever","think","someth","must","wrong","leastbr","br","advic","stai","clear","thi","even","mood","simpl","movi","doe","requir","think","choos","someth","els","regret","sure"],"filtered2":["taglin","tradit","american","pie","fool","rent","get","piec","junk","styl","jackass","major","differ","compar","jackass","seem","like","citizen","kanebr","make","regret","reward","becaus","ca","go","beneath","make","quit","bad","look","like","cinemat","featsbr","actual","turn","minut","someth","veri","rare","plain","bore","stupid","uninterest","unnecessarybr","ca","believ","peopl","actual","reward","parent","drop","head","child","veri","ever","see","get","noth","compar","still","virgin","breast","ever","think","someth","must","wrong","leastbr","advic","stai","clear","even","mood","simpl","doe","requir","think","choos","someth","els","regret","sure"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,9,12,15,16,18,22,23,25,35,44,49,52,53,59,64,81,91,96,108,119,120,136,141,180,196,204,208,218,223,366,380,404,482,584,586,590,661,670,736,904,989,1013,1057,1093,1129,1247,1283,1450,1482,1669,1678,1760,2106,2371,2889,3312,5536,5868,7016],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,9,12,15,16,18,22,23,25,35,44,49,52,53,59,64,81,91,96,108,119,120,136,141,180,196,204,208,218,223,366,380,404,482,584,586,590,661,670,736,904,989,1013,1057,1093,1129,1247,1283,1450,1482,1669,1678,1760,2106,2371,2889,3312,5536,5868,7016],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.463169012899134,3.209458785004948,1.6920303308087352,3.4244306149452273,5.100954820682302,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,3.899514464849456,2.0105926690411424,2.0390708128715254,2.138507503627933,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.346825985579986,2.2657547357741192,2.7097314792693545,2.478925055209576,2.624524614047584,2.6289494000279396,2.5940874818617203,2.825563294794476,3.008694896185175,3.102062070196872,3.1419947805322432,6.630933444098431,3.5146700658174166,3.4572130107926293,3.4986697244709752,3.5727776966246974,3.7264536553416874,3.6841709341823097,3.9121030022283168,4.044492190274062,4.039936373738201,4.181290492043933,4.150360191352575,4.197121957260614,4.327618446189983,4.3773181147422555,4.484804029712395,4.506310234933358,4.74221603786142,9.359947457968397,4.956227105612356,5.259176650194926,5.089758498236879,10.781025304512026,5.626901430320244,12.875663293073144,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5360363215407885E-4,1.5346751621014653E-4,1.5350540852540747E-4,1.5

{"value":"One of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of Love Story; one loved it or hated it. But there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this movie rated a 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland turns in a fabulous job as Oliver's father. But the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings, at least, not for me. I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal -- I still haven't seen Barry Lyndon -- because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The lone exception is What's Up, Doc?, in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for Barbra Streisand's goofball protagonist -- and, not coincidentally, he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure! McGraw and O'Neal tend to mug their lines, rather than act them.<br /><br />This movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career: it was Tommy Lee Jones's first

{"value":"This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie \"Sholay\", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company he pulled a Coppola (Godfather) on us; What were you thinking RGV? Anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the Old sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay,sholay). Both \"bad yet funny\" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. Later in the movie, now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you haven't been watching Bollywood movies, the Good guys win in the end.

{"value":"This movie was a major disappointment on direction, intellectual niveau, plot and in the way it dealt with its subject, painting. It is a slow moving film set like an episode of Wonder Years, with appalling lack of depth though. It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.<br /><br />The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms as \"beauty\". According to the makers of this movie, 'beauty' can be only experienced in Bob-Ross-style kitschy landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (like, primary school level) color theory and lots of sentiment. In parts the movie is offending, e.g. at a point it is stated (rather, celebrated by dancing on tables) that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works by definition being worthless 'bullshit' (quote).<br /><br />I do not understand how the movie could get such high rating, then again, so far not many people rated it, and they

{"value":"If you have seen the Sholay of 1975, Don't watch this movie. If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, Go WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay. <br /><br />Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best (Probably the only 40 mins of the reel that shouldn't be burnt). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character, it would still be worth a watch. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan(Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think, they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen carries herself well, with grace and make-up. But the award for the \"WORST performance and any role till date\" must go to Nisha Kothari.

{"value":"I expected a comedy like the \"Big Mama\" movies. Instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story.<br /><br />This movie has three plots: The first involves Madea and her taking in a foster child. The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father.<br /><br />There is actually very little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. The child does, in fact, turn herself around. Apparently, it pays to beat children.<br /><br />There are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (The ogling takes place at a family reunion.) The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. Is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama?

{"value":"Okay, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage, then basically that same hour repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. Flashbacks to the men's wives 3. The approach of the troops marching in a long line 4. Men running up hill and shooting, usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him. 5. Defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6. Men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs. That was the basic movie, and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time it did a flashback to the wives, it would show the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time. Other than that, the men couldn't kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of action, though the action was repetitive.

{"value":"One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. This is a must see, first of all to see the work out. There are a lot of work out shown, see those close ups, man you will enjoy it. A few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie. It's a slasher but without suspense. The ending is funny too, and the clothes she's wearing in the wood confronting the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. The killings are mostly done off screen, the blood flows but never too gory. There are a lot of fight scene's too, and hey, no one got hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, never seen a big one like that, won't spoil it, you must see it. And being a slasher there's a lot of T&A too. To guess who's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that's the best part, but what about the story of the copper in the woods, huh! But still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have. I'm glad that I have my copy, one of those slasher failures. But man, those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles!

{"value":"This film has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made. True, most of the films based on the works of King are pretty bad, but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible. There is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary. It is typical King garbage -- myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place, mixed with obvious and belabored so-called \"scares\" that are about as shocking as PeeWee's Playhouse (which, at least, is entertaining). It is full of ridiculous moments, not the least of which is Alice Krige's character. When she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old Batman TV show, it is so absurd as to be sickening. All the people who had cameos in this (including John Landis)are lucky they still have careers. But the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end, which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at K-mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out-act the people in the

{"value":"That's what the title should be, anyway.<br /><br />This movie combines guns, explosives, and mindless killing to make one flop of an \"action\" movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: answers type deal.<br /><br />What happens in the movie? People die.<br /><br />Is that it? Yes.<br /><br />What is the plot about? What plot?<br /><br />What is the point the movie is trying to make? Killing is the only solution.<br /><br />What are the characters like? Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities.<br /><br />Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it.<br /><br />If you like constant killing and greed, then watch the movie. If you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard \"entertainment\", then \"Made Men\" is not for you.<br /><br />To sum it up, the plotline stinks, the characters aren't worth their while, the

{"value":"There's not much to say about this one. Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does no good. They should know this anyway. We've seen a lot of monsters stomp on Tokyo.
