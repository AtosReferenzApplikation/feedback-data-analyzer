{"value":"SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten minutes of more, ahem, 'extreme' footage) here in the UK back in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case. Strangely enough, the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON canned, and the film has been all but forgotten as a result. I jumped at the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor. It's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented, a triple-X take on Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned?) with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze. If you don't consider yourself to be squeamish, this may force you to think again. By the time SEX WISH is over, you'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself. If any film truly deserves the \"it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie\" tag-line, it's this one.<br /><br />Highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her, Harry Reems's scene-stealing moustache, the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer (they'd have won Oscars for their entirely credible performances if the Academy had gone mad) before the man is castrated for his troubles, and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind-house origins. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you very, very wrong.","finished_norm":["sex","wish","be","actual","releas","minu","ten","minut","of","much","ahem","extrem","footag","here","in","the","uk","back","in","the","earli","dai","of","the","video","boom","and","caus","a","tabloid","storm","in","a","teacup","when","it","allegedli","inspir","a","copycat","murder","case","strang","enough","the","paper","brush","thi","ultradisturb","flick","under","the","carpet","in","their","headlong","rush","to","get","the","compar","innocu","like","of","freez","scream","and","night","of","the","demon","can","and","the","film","have","be","all","but","forget","a","a","result","i","jump","at","the","chanc","to","watch","it","on","a","dvdrw","and","spend","much","of","the","film","durat","with","my","jaw","on","the","floor","it","not","so","much","polit","incorrect","a","utterli","dement","a","triplex","take","on","michael","winner","death","wish","do","the","titl","kind","of","give","the","game","awai","a","far","a","inspir","be","concern","with","hardcor","sex","and","some","truli","nasti","violenc","throw","into","a","alreadi","bubbl","brew","of","seventi","sleaz","if","you","do","not","consid","yourself","to","be","squeamish","thi","mai","forc","you","to","think","again","by","the","time","sex","wish","be","over","you","will","want","to","scrub","your","eyebal","clean","with","disinfect","and","take","a","long","hot","shower","to","purg","yourself","if","ani","film","truli","deserv","the","it","onli","a","movi","onli","a","movi","onli","a","movi","taglin","it","thi","onebr","br","highlight","or","lowlight","a","rapist","us","a","vibrat","on","a","victim","a","he","masturb","over","her","harri","reem","scenest","moustach","the","helpless","young","black","coupl","who","be","forc","to","screw","in","front","the","sword","cane","killer","thei","have","have","win","oscar","for","their","entir","credibl","perform","if","the","academi","have","go","mad","befor","the","man","be","castrat","for","hi","troubl","and","some","jarringli","slick","direct","that","threaten","to","lift","the","proceed","abov","their","obviou","grindhous","origin","do","not","sai","i","do","not","warn","you","if","you","think","the","world","be","a","much","innoc","place","thirti","year","ago","sex","wish","will","prove","you","veri","veri","wrong"],"filtered":["sex","wish","actual","releas","minu","ten","minut","much","ahem","extrem","footag","uk","back","earli","dai","video","boom","caus","tabloid","storm","teacup","allegedli","inspir","copycat","murder","case","strang","enough","paper","brush","thi","ultradisturb","flick","carpet","headlong","rush","get","compar","innocu","like","freez","scream","night","demon","film","forget","result","jump","chanc","watch","dvdrw","spend","much","film","durat","jaw","floor","much","polit","incorrect","utterli","dement","triplex","take","michael","winner","death","wish","titl","kind","give","game","awai","far","inspir","concern","hardcor","sex","truli","nasti","violenc","throw","alreadi","bubbl","brew","seventi","sleaz","consid","squeamish","thi","mai","forc","think","time","sex","wish","want","scrub","eyebal","clean","disinfect","take","long","hot","shower","purg","ani","film","truli","deserv","onli","movi","onli","movi","onli","movi","taglin","thi","onebr","br","highlight","lowlight","rapist","us","vibrat","victim","masturb","harri","reem","scenest","moustach","helpless","young","black","coupl","forc","screw","front","sword","cane","killer","thei","win","oscar","entir","credibl","perform","academi","go","mad","befor","man","castrat","hi","troubl","jarringli","slick","direct","threaten","lift","proceed","abov","obviou","grindhous","origin","sai","warn","think","world","much","innoc","place","thirti","year","ago","sex","wish","prove","veri","veri","wrong"],"filtered2":["sex","wish","actual","releas","minu","ten","minut","ahem","extrem","footag","uk","back","earli","dai","video","boom","caus","tabloid","storm","teacup","allegedli","inspir","copycat","murder","case","strang","enough","paper","brush","ultradisturb","flick","carpet","headlong","rush","get","compar","innocu","like","freez","scream","night","demon","forget","result","jump","chanc","watch","dvdrw","spend","durat","jaw","floor","polit","incorrect","utterli","dement","triplex","take","michael","winner","death","wish","titl","kind","give","game","awai","far","inspir","concern","hardcor","sex","truli","nasti","violenc","throw","alreadi","bubbl","brew","seventi","sleaz","consid","squeamish","mai","forc","think","time","sex","wish","want","scrub","eyebal","clean","disinfect","take","long","hot","shower","purg","ani","truli","deserv","onli","onli","onli","taglin","onebr","highlight","lowlight","rapist","us","vibrat","victim","masturb","harri","reem","scenest","moustach","helpless","young","black","coupl","forc","screw","front","sword","cane","killer","win","oscar","entir","credibl","perform","academi","go","mad","befor","man","castrat","troubl","jarringli","slick","direct","threaten","lift","proceed","abov","obviou","gr

{"value":"WWF Survivor Series 2001<br /><br />This was among the worst events of 2001. Perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous Survivor Series'. There was only ONE survivor series match. And that Survivor Series match went on for 45 minutes. What's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock prevailing for his team. And don't get me started on the preview before the event. No matter who won it was obvious that no one was going to f***ing die. There was no need for all of that pointless hype. Whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event.<br /><br />And as for the rest of the matches: the first match was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly. William Regal versus Tajiri was boring and we've seen it 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus Test was good but nothing great. The tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening. The battle Royal went on for 10 minutes and no one really cared who'd win in the first place. The Women's title match wasn't great. No, not in the slightest. The main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history. The Alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months every single Alliance superstar returned. The match itself was poor. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. The Rock was too caught up with his acting to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one that jeopardised the whole match. If I wanted any 2 to be eliminated in the early going it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just fall guys. 7 matches isn't enough for a Survivor Series. If there's ever a Survivor Series as bad as this again

{"value":"I was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers. Sure, it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way, hitch to their home(at dusk), and invite their prey...sex-starved men to their boudoir. What happens there...well, after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot, but sex alone does not hold a film up(no pun intended...at least consciously). There really isn't much of a story here. We have the two girls. We are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol. Why? What does it mean\" Why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago? Does that have a purpose? Of course I have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice-looking girls doing as vampires in the English countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the Carpathians? Anyway, the script is riddled with such flaws. It is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims, wine and dine them(quite literally), and then go to bed in the crypt. The end gets going with some juicier scenes, but it is anti-climatic. There are, as I said, some effective scenes by the director...I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey. The house is also a most impressive set. And both girls are as I said very lovely. Marianne Morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one. For you older film fans, silent screen veteran Bessie Love has a brief cameo at film's end.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","nearli","a","smite","with","thi","a","mani","other","review","sure","it","have","a","pair","of","love","girl","plai","erot","lesbian","vampir","mariann","morri","and","anulka","have","plai","thi","two","love","siren","with","razor","tooth","that","run","up","to","car","on","a","road","out","of","the","wai","hitch","to","their","homeat","dusk","and","invit","their","preysexstarv","man","to","their","boudoir","what","happen","therewel","after","thei","disrob","and","kiss","each","other","mostli","thei","kill","their","visitor","director","jose","ramon","larraz","doe","have","some","flash","of","brillianc","with","hi","camera","some","scene","be","quit","eeri","and","effect","shoot","but","sex","alon","doe","not","hold","a","film","upno","pun","intendedat","littl","conscious","there","realli","be","not","much","of","a","stori","here","we","have","the","two","girl","we","be","show","some","inexplic","and","unexplain","begin","where","we","see","them","shoot","with","pistol","why","what","doe","it","mean","why","do","we","have","the","gui","that","stai","for","sever","dai","greet","a","gui","at","the","hotel","that","insist","he","know","him","from","year","ago","doe","that","have","a","purpos","of","cours","i","have","even","much","gener","question","like","what","be","a","coupl","of","nicelook","girl","do","a","vampir","in","the","english","countrysid","and","have","a","wine","cellar","fill","with","wine","from","the","carpathian","anywai","the","script","be","riddl","with","such","flaw","it","be","conjur","veri","spars","on","the","action","outsid","of","catch","victim","wine","and","dine","themquit","liter","and","then","go","to","bed","in","the","crypt","the","end","get","go","with","some","juici","scene","but","it","be","anticlimat","there","be","a","i","sai","some","effect","scene","by","the","directori","particularli","like","the","wai","the","girl","dress","and","be","film","in","the","wood","look","for","their","prei","the","hous","be","conjur","a","much","impress","set","and","both","girl","be","a","i","sai","veri","love","mariann","morri","in","particular","stand","out","in","much","wai","than","on","for","you","old","film","fan","silent","screen","veteran","bessi","love","have","a","brief","cameo","at","film","end"],"filtered":["nearli","smite","thi","mani","review","sure","pair","love","girl","plai","erot","lesbian","vampir","mariann","morri","anulka","plai","thi","two","love","siren","razor","tooth","run","car","road","wai","hitch","homeat","dusk","invit","preysexstarv","man","boudoir","happen","therewel","thei","disrob","kiss","mostli","thei","kill","visitor","director","jose","ramon","larraz","doe","flash","brillianc","hi","camera","scene","quit","eeri","effect","shoot","sex","alon","doe","hold","film","upno","pun","intendedat","littl","conscious","realli","much","stori","two","girl","show","inexplic","unexplain","begin","see","shoot","pistol","doe","mean","gui","stai","sever","dai","greet","gui","hotel","insist","know","year","ago","doe","purpos","cours","even","much","gener","question","like","coupl","nicelook","girl","vampir","english","countrysid","wine","cellar","fill","wine","carpathian","anywai","script","riddl","flaw","conjur","veri","spars","action","outsid","catch","victim","wine","dine","themquit","liter","go","bed","crypt","end","get","go","juici","scene","anticlimat","sai","effect","scene","directori","particularli","like","wai","girl","dress","film","wood","look","prei","hous","conjur","much","impress","set","girl","sai","veri","love","mariann","morri","particular","stand","much","wai","old","film","fan","silent","screen","veteran","bessi","love","brief","cameo","film","end"],"filtered2":["nearli","smite","mani","review","sure","pair","love","girl","plai","erot","lesbian","vampir","mariann","morri","anulka","plai","two","love","siren","razor","tooth","run","car","road","wai","hitch","homeat","dusk","invit","preysexstarv","man","boudoir","happen","therewel","disrob","kiss","mostli","kill","visitor","director","jose","ramon","larraz","doe","flash","brillianc","camera","scene","quit","eeri","effect","shoot","sex","alon","doe","hold","upno","pun","intendedat","littl","conscious","realli","stori","two","girl","show","inexplic","unexplain","begin","see","shoot","pistol","doe","mean","gui","stai","sever","dai","greet","gui","hotel","insist","know","year","ago","doe","purpos","cours","even","gener","question","like","coupl","nicelook","girl","vampir","english","countrysid","wine","cellar","fill","wine","carpathian","anywai","script","riddl","flaw","conjur","veri","spars","action","outsid","catch","victim","wine","dine","themquit","liter","go","bed","crypt","end","get","go","juici","scene","anticlimat","effect","scene","directori","particularli","like","wai","girl","dress","wood","look","prei","hous","conjur","impress","set","girl","veri","love","mariann","morri","particular","stand","wai","old","fan","silent","screen","veteran","bessi","love","brief",

{"value":"This is an awful film. Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good. The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way. Well, okay it might be interesting, but its not, because its so badly paced and and only partly acted. I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen, probably more laughable then they do on TV. (I won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest. Never read about that in the old west) This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward.<br /><br />I like schlock films but this is ridiculous. There is a reason that I don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good, the plot taking a back seat to breasts. The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats. The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent. The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level, infantile but harmlessly fun. Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie.<br /><br />The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex

{"value":"!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!<br /><br />You`d think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . In fact I`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That`s why I wrote \" Possible spoiler \" it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.<br /><br />Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film .

{"value":"I watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that I read about it here by others.<br /><br />They definitely saw something in this movie I didn't see, that's for sure.<br /><br />The movie starts off at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then it begins to get logged down and draggy, not to mention completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Eventually you find yourself saying: \"What?!? He's going to do that too? Just how far is he going to go with this thing?\"<br /><br />The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum's character, John, going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new store clerk, Auggie Rose, gets killed during the robbery. <br /><br />John gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This seems a little much, but wait, there's more.<br /><br />John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /><br />For reasons that never make any kind of logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful, loving girlfriend, a secure, well-paying job, nice house, nice car, expensive suits--decides he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose was, and experience life in a low paying job, living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people.<br /><br />Why this dim-witted, half-baked film got favorable reviews I'll never know. Sure Goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a BIG infatuation with Jeff Goldblum and have to see every film he's in, I wouldn't recommend this turkey.

{"value":"If this is supposed to be the black experience, let me out at either the front or back door.<br /><br />A mama's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it's all down hill for him. Angela Bassett, the one shining grace in this film, plays his over protective, religious mother. Despite her anger at how his life has turned, by the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. She allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children.<br /><br />This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this film was heading.<br /><br />I literally laughed out loud when at the end, when Bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. What man? He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. The complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher.<br /><br />The east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. All we see are guns blazing.<br /><br />A terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music. The African American community should take umbrage at their very being. Who was this classless fat slob who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison.

{"value":"If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low score 3/10.<br /><br />But it was entertaining, and there are several good things to say about the movie.<br /><br />The psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident, and is exited and eager to \"change the world\".<br /><br />From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and doesn't recognise this evil. <br /><br />The story builds fairly well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil, and wonder when and how James will discover this. Also when the break comes, James is in a way hunted by the evil, and you feel some suspense until \"the fight\" is over.<br /><br />Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements, and you get the picture.<br /><br />The character buildup is actually fairly good, you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed, some of them you \"get to know\".<br /><br />The film sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done fairly well. There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.<br /><br />The main character, James is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting.<br /><br />What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of \"Plan 9 from outer space\"-type bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad acting (or probably very

{"value":"Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of sorts. Minus the fangs, of course. They're dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who they proceed to torment and victimize. That's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it.<br /><br />It's not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character. I did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was very impressed by the cast's strong acting, particularly David Thelis's; only the character of Jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional. The photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together. <br /><br />What really turns me off about \"Naked\" (and the main reason I'd never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst. In other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? To suggest (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as Jeremy, seems completely absurd to me. They're both terrible, nasty people. And they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance. One could argue that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass. But still, his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter. And I could be wrong, but I'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical.","finished_norm":["johnni","and","jeremi","be","vampir","of","sort","minu","the","fang","of","cours","thei","re","dark","bitter","creatur","with","noth","well","to","do","than","to","spread","their","own","miseri","through","their","charm","name","a","sharp","tongu","and","a","fat","wallet","respect","thei","seduc","desper","soul","who","thei","proce","to","torment","and","victim","that","much","or","littl","the","basi","of","thi","black","comedi","a","i","understand","itbr","br","it","not","a","blend","of","black","humor","that","i","can","easili","subscrib","to","partli","becaus","it","bother","me","to","imagin","the","audienc","root","for","the","sleazi","main","charact","i","do","enjoi","howev","the","sound","and","the","melodi","of","the","rapidfir","and","supposedli","veri","witti","remark","i","be","veri","impress","by","the","cast","strong","act","particularli","david","theli","onli","the","charact","of","jeremi","seem","too","bidimension","the","photographi","and","the","music","both","dramat","and","somber","work","veri","good","togeth","br","br","what","realli","turn","me","off","about","nake","and","the","main","reason","i","have","never","recommend","it","to","anyon","be","the","wai","it","repeatedli","seem","to","present","misogyni","a","a","valid","wai","to","vent","on","angst","in","other","word","in","a","world","that","suck","so","bad","what","differ","doe","it","make","if","on","inflict","some","pain","on","girl","right","to","suggest","a","some","have","on","thi","websit","that","johnni","be","not","so","unkind","a","person","becaus","he","not","a","rough","on","girl","a","jeremi","seem","complet","absurd","to","me","thei","re","both","terribl","nasti","peopl","and","thei","re","particularli","keen","on","hurt","woman","everi","singl","time","thei","get","a","chanc","on","can","argu","that","johnni","eventu","get","what","he","deserv","a","if","hi","bad","karma","suddenli","swing","straight","back","and","bite","him","in","the","ass","but","still","hi","and","jeremi","sadist","behavior","be","treat","to","a","certain","degre","a","a","laugh","matt","and","i","can","be","wrong","but","i","be","guess","that","much","peopl","who","absolut","love","thi","movi","conjur","find","that","aspect","of","the","film","darkli","comic"],"filtered":["johnni","jeremi","vampir","sort","minu","fang","cours","thei","re","dark","bitter","creatur","noth","well","spread","miseri","charm","name","sharp","tongu","fat","wallet","respect","thei","seduc","desper","soul","thei","proce","torment","victim","much","littl","basi","thi","black","comedi","understand","itbr","br","blend","black","humor","easili","subscrib","partli","becaus","bother","imagin","audienc","root","sleazi","main","charact","enjoi","howev","sound","melodi","rapidfir","supposedli","veri","witti","remark","veri","impress","cast","strong","act","particularli","david","theli","onli","charact","jeremi","seem","bidimension","photographi","music","dramat","somber","work","veri","good","togeth","br","br","realli","turn","nake","main","reason","never","recommend","anyon","wai","repeatedli","seem","present","misogyni","valid","wai","vent","angst","word","world","suck","bad","differ","doe","make","inflict","pain","girl","right","suggest","thi","websit","johnni","unkind","person","becaus","rough","girl","jeremi","seem","complet","absurd","thei","re","terribl","nasti","peopl","thei","re","particularli","keen","hurt","woman","everi","singl","time","thei","get","chanc","argu","johnni","eventu","get","deserv","hi","bad","karma","suddenli","swing","straight","back","bite","ass","still","hi","jeremi","sadist","behavior","treat","certain","degre","laugh","matt","wrong","guess","much","peopl","absolut","love","thi","movi","conjur","find","aspect","film","darkli","comic"],"filtered2":["johnni","jeremi","vampir","sort","minu","fang","cours","re","dark","bitter","creatur","noth","well","spread","miseri","charm","name","sharp","tongu","fat","wallet","respect","seduc","desper","soul","proce","torment","victim","littl","basi","black","comedi","understand","itbr","blend","black","humor","easili","subscrib","partli","becaus","bother","imagin","audienc","root","sleazi","main","charact","enjoi","howev","sound","melodi","rapidfir","supposedli","veri","witti","remark","veri","impress","cast","strong","act","particularli","david","theli","onli","charact","jeremi","seem","bidimension","photographi","music","dramat","somber","work","veri","good","togeth","realli","turn","nake","main","reason","never","recommend","anyon","wai","repeatedli","seem","present","misogyni","valid","wai","vent","angst","word","world","suck","bad","differ","doe","make","inflict","pain","girl","right","suggest","websit","johnni","unkind","person","becaus","rough","girl","jeremi","seem","complet","absurd","re","terribl","nasti","peopl","re","particularli","keen","hurt","woman","everi","singl","time","get","chanc","argu","johnni","eventu","get","deserv","bad","karma","suddenli","swing","straight","b

{"value":"This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, though for reasons best left to the powers that be. A lot seems to have been made of the fact that it's the first Thai language film, made with Thai actors & crew, but directed by a westerner. Needn't have bothered to be honest, as this film is dull, dull, dull. Why hint at something, why shroud an idea in mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs, obvious shots and over the top scenes> Nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director Spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés. No hinting, no guessing, it's all up on screen, no need to use our imaginations. Wonder when the 'scary' bit is coming? No you wont, 'cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating, rising to a crescendo of ominously. Hell, I'm making up words to describe how bad this is. Wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really is a snake, and yes it's really is biting his crotch, and there's blood splattering everywhere. it's a strange, uneasy film for several reasons. It's supposed to be a horror film, but it's not scary - the jolts are signposted & obvious. It might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of Thailand, yet the director has a sleazy, lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens. Maybe it was casting himself as the virginity-taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe the whole thing was just pants. Uninspired, insipid, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for best description, but dull seems most appropriate and honest.

{"value":"Lets first start this review with the fact that I SIGNED UP JUST TO WRITE THE REVIEW AND WARN PEOPLE TO SAVE Their MONEY!!<br /><br />This was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since The Hulk. The storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with. If you are expecting 24 but on the big screen, flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket.. You may get more enjoyment that way. The acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (along with the so called \"twist\" in the end. I must say this.. The ending did surprise me. I am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. They rushed the ending so quickly that I didn't even realize that it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if I could just figure out how to get into that screening room.<br /><br />Casting was awful for a few reasons. First of all, they must have accidentally switched the character assignments, because Michael Douglas played the roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have been playing. While Douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him, Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him.

{"value":"Let's be honest. As a film school project, made without budget and \"real\" actors, this is a passably interesting film. As something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a very poorly produced product. If I would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally, it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would be getting a proper cinematic product, i.e. a film, I feel deeply disappointed. It's a videotaped TV play, something along the line of old sixties serials, but without that certain charm. Aside from the leading man Mr Redfield (who also is the director), the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus (a bit too old for that actually), or members of the director's household, who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches, but also the make-up artist or hairdresser (a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s). It's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds. Synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame \"period\" inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion. The film attempts to be \"dreamlike\", whereas in fact it's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing (and believe me, the standards weren't too high to start with). There are interesting dialogs every now and then, but overall it's pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew. That's how \"artsy\" films attempted to look in the 80s. Mr Redfield does a much better job as an actor than the

{"value":"The story behind this movie is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pacing, action sequences, stunts, and use of CG all cheapen and spoil the film.<br /><br />First off, action sequences. They are all quite unexciting. Most consist of someone standing up and getting shot, making no attempt to run, fight, dodge, or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.<br /><br />The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.<br /><br />Pacing: everything happens too quickly. For example, \"Elle\" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start can do back-flips, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the movie. As Lilith, she wouldn't have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she couldn't, since she had wings.<br /><br />Also, we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car, and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car (and then felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car)... \"Are you okay?\" asks the driver \"yes, I'm fine\" she says, bloodied and disheveled.<br /><br />I watched it all, though, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting... but in the end, the poor execution made me wish for anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comic relief, because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but this just made me want to shake the director awake, and give the writer a good talking to.","finished_norm":["the","stori","behind","thi","movi","be","veri","interest","and","in","gener","the","plot","be","not","so","bad","but","the","detail","write","direct","continu","pace","action","sequenc","stunt","and","us","of","cg","all","cheapen","and","spoil","the","filmbr","br","off","action","sequenc","thei","be","all","quit","unexcit","much","consist","of","someon","stand","up","and","get","shoot","make","no","attempt","to","run","fight","dodg","or","whatev","even","though","thei","have","all","the","time","in","the","world","the","sequenc","just","seem","bland","for","someth","make","in","br","br","the","cg","featur","veri","nice","render","and","anim","effect","but","thei","come","off","look","cheap","becaus","of","how","thei","be","usedbr","br","pace","everyth","happen","too","quickli","for","exampl","ell","be","train","to","fight","in","a","coupl","of","hour","and","from","the","start","can","do","backflip","etc","why","be","she","so","acrobat","none","of","thi","be","explain","in","the","movi","a","lilith","she","would","not","have","ne","to","be","abl","to","do","back","flip","mayb","she","can","not","sinc","she","have","wingsbr","br","conjur","we","have","sequenc","like","a","woman","get","run","over","by","a","car","and","get","up","and","just","wander","off","into","a","desert","room","with","a","sink","and","mirror","and","then","stab","herself","in","the","throat","all","for","no","appar","reason","and","without","ani","of","the","spectat","realli","care","that","she","just","get","hit","by","a","car","and","then","feel","the","secondari","effect","of","anoth","explod","car","be","you","okai","ask","the","driver","ye","i","be","fine","she","sai","bloodi","and","disheveledbr","br","i","watch","it","all","though","becaus","the","introduct","promis","me","that","it","would","be","interest","but","in","the","end","the","poor","execut","make","me","wish","for","anyth","els","blade","vampir","hunter","have","even","that","movi","with","vampir","where","jacki","chan","be","comic","relief","becaus","thei","manag","to","suspend","my","disbelief","but","thi","just","make","me","want","to","shake","the","director","awak","and","give","the","writer","a","good","talk","to"],"filtered":["stori","behind","thi","movi","veri","interest","gener","plot","bad","detail","write","direct","continu","pace","action","sequenc","stunt","us","cg","cheapen","spoil","filmbr","br","action","sequenc","thei","quit","unexcit","much","consist","someon","stand","get","shoot","make","attempt","run","fight","dodg","whatev","even","though","thei","time","world","sequenc","seem","bland","someth","make","br","br","cg","featur","veri","nice","render","anim","effect","thei","come","look","cheap","becaus","thei","usedbr","br","pace","everyth","happen","quickli","exampl","ell","train","fight","coupl","hour","start","backflip","etc","acrobat","none","thi","explain","movi","lilith","ne","abl","back","flip","mayb","sinc","wingsbr","br","conjur","sequenc","like","woman","get","run","car","get","wander","desert","room","sink","mirror","stab","throat","appar","reason","without","ani","spectat","realli","care","get","hit","car","feel","secondari","effect","anoth","explod","car","okai","ask","driver","ye","fine","sai","bloodi","disheveledbr","br","watch","though","becaus","introduct","promis","interest","end","poor","execut","make","wish","anyth","els","blade","vampir","hunter","even","movi","vampir","jacki","chan","comic","relief","becaus","thei","manag","suspend","disbelief","thi","make","want","shake","director","awak","give","writer","good","talk"],"filtered2":["stori","behind","veri","interest","gener","plot","bad","detail","write","direct","continu","pace","action","sequenc","stunt","us","cg","cheapen","spoil","filmbr","action","sequenc","quit","unexcit","consist","someon","stand","get","shoot","make","attempt","run","fight","dodg","whatev","even","though","time","world","sequenc","seem","bland","someth","make","cg","featur","veri","nice","render","anim","effect","come","look","cheap","becaus","usedbr","pace","everyth","happen","quickli","exampl","ell","train","fight","coupl","hour","start","backflip","etc","acrobat","none","explain","lilith","ne","abl","back","flip","mayb","sinc","wingsbr","conjur","sequenc","like","woman","get","run","car","get","wander","desert","room","sink","mirror","stab","throat","appar","reason","without","ani","spectat","realli","care","get","hit","car","feel","secondari","effect","anoth","explod","car","okai","ask","driver","ye","fine","bloodi","disheveledbr","watch","though","becaus","introduct","promis","interest","end","poor","execut","make","wish","anyth","els","blade","vampir","hunter","even","vampir","jacki","chan","comic","relief","becaus","manag","suspend","disbelief","make","want","shake","director","awak","give","writer","good","talk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,7,8,9,13,15,16,17,22,24,27,30,32,34,35,37,39,43,53,56,58,60,63,65,70,71,73,86,94,95,102,104,106,110,117,120,

{"value":"Same old same old about Che. It completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of Che. The silly seductive tale of an Argentinean rich-boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor, until eventually he was murdered by the CIA. Yeah, yeah, heard it all before, BORING AND UNTRUE!. The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak, who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the Cold War, he even begged the Soviet Union to nuke New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life, he declared that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world, Che was furious at the \"betrayal\". If Che's recommendations had been followed, you would not be reading this review now. How a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film. Incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. THAT WOULD MAKE AN Oscar WINNING FILM! I thought making independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING! They only stick to \"safe counterculture themes\", to wit, \"Che cool\", \"Wall Street bad\", \"Republican= Nazi\", \"Bush ex Hitler\", \"NRA is worse than KGB\", \"Christians are fanatics and stupid\", etc...ad nauseum.

{"value":"Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers tried to be, a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies. Now, I am not bagging 'Scream,' as I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy. Cut fails on most levels. It has its moments but overall it just does not work out, not even as a \"so bad it's good\" movie, just a below average one.<br /><br />The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story fairly well, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out, go figure. Go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off, which is apparently cursed. And, as you have probably predicted, one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.<br /><br />Unoriginal plot, poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow. There is plenty of referencing in the film, everything from 'Scream' to 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.' This isn't smart either, it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala Scream. For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it. Really, I should be supporting this movie because I'm Australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror (we do have our gems, though) but Cut is definitely not one of them.<br /><br />However, it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so, so that is something good at least. I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away.<br /><br

{"value":"If I had not read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before seeing this film, I would have liked it. Unfortuntately this is not the case. It is actually my kind of film, it is well made, and in no way do I want to say otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle.<br /><br />The harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern England working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after I had finished. I was put through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when reading about the women of Union Street. Excellent. A novel that at times I felt I could not read any more of, but I novel I simply couldn't put down. Depressing yes, but utterly gripping.<br /><br />The film. Oh dear. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it. A beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance...yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street'...no.<br /><br />The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue. The essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling William's score.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality', I advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'Schindler's List'...but without the happy ending.","finished_norm":["if","i","have","not","read","pat","barker","union","street","befor","see","thi","film","i","would","have","like","it","unfortunt","thi","be","not","the","case","it","be","actual","my","kind","of","film","it","be","good","make","and","in","no","wai","do","i","want","to","sai","otherwis","but","a","a","adapt","it","fail","from","everi","anglebr","br","the","harrow","novel","about","the","realiti","of","live","in","a","northern","england","workingclass","area","grab","hold","of","my","heartstr","and","refus","to","let","go","for","week","after","i","have","finish","i","be","put","through","tear","repuls","shock","anger","sympathi","and","miseri","when","read","about","the","woman","of","union","street","excel","a","novel","that","at","time","i","feel","i","can","not","read","ani","much","of","but","i","novel","i","simpli","can","not","put","down","depress","ye","but","utterli","grippingbr","br","the","film","oh","dear","hollywood","take","barker","truth","and","realiti","and","shower","a","layer","of","sweet","ic","sugar","over","the","top","of","it","a","beauti","film","a","inspir","soundtrack","excel","perform","a","tale","of","hope","and","romancey","a","adapt","of","union","streetnobr","br","the","woman","of","union","street","and","their","stori","be","condens","into","fonda","charact","their","stori","be","touch","on","but","mani","be","discard","i","accept","that","some","of","barker","tale","be","sensit","issu","and","be","too","horrif","for","mass","view","and","that","a","film","with","around","lead","protagonist","just","be","not","practic","but","the","content","be","not","my","main","issu","the","essenc","and","the","real","gut","of","the","novel","be","lose","dark","and","rain","break","window","cover","with","cardboard","and","the","graphic","describ","stench","of","poverti","be","replac","with","sunshin","pretti","hous","and","a","twinkl","william","scorebr","br","if","you","enjoi","the","film","for","it","posit","and","hope","in","the","face","of","realiti","i","advis","that","you","hesit","to","read","the","book","without","prepar","yourself","for","someth","much","like","schindler","listbut","without","the","happi","end"],"filtered":["read","pat","barker","union","street","befor","see","thi","film","like","unfortunt","thi","case","actual","kind","film","good","make","wai","want","sai","otherwis","adapt","fail","everi","anglebr","br","harrow","novel","realiti","live","northern","england","workingclass","area","grab","hold","heartstr","refus","let","go","week","finish","put","tear","repuls","shock","anger","sympathi","miseri","read","woman","union","street","excel","novel","time","feel","read","ani","much","novel","simpli","put","depress","ye","utterli","grippingbr","br","film","oh","dear","hollywood","take","barker","truth","realiti","shower","layer","sweet","ic","sugar","top","beauti","film","inspir","soundtrack","excel","perform","tale","hope","romancey","adapt","union","streetnobr","br","woman","union","street","stori","condens","fonda","charact","stori","touch","mani","discard","accept","barker","tale","sensit","issu","horrif","mass","view","film","around","lead","protagonist","practic","content","main","issu","essenc","real","gut","novel","lose","dark","rain","break","window","cover","cardboard","graphic","describ","stench","poverti","replac","sunshin","pretti","hous","twinkl","william","scorebr","br","enjoi","film","posit","hope","face","realiti","advis","hesit","read","book","without","prepar","someth","much","like","schindler","listbut","without","happi","end"],"filtered2":["read","pat","barker","union","street","befor","see","like","unfortunt","case","actual","kind","good","make","wai","want","otherwis","adapt","fail","everi","anglebr","harrow","novel","realiti","live","northern","england","workingclass","area","grab","hold","heartstr","refus","let","go","week","finish","put","tear","repuls","shock","anger","sympathi","miseri","read","woman","union","street","excel","novel","time","feel","read","ani","novel","simpli","put","depress","ye","utterli","grippingbr","oh","dear","hollywood","take","barker","truth","realiti","shower","layer","sweet","ic","sugar","top","beauti","inspir","soundtrack","excel","perform","tale","hope","romancey","adapt","union","streetnobr","woman","union","street","stori","condens","fonda","charact","stori","touch","mani","discard","accept","barker","tale","sensit","issu","horrif","mass","view","around","lead","protagonist","practic","content","main","issu","essenc","real","gut","novel","lose","dark","rain","break","window","cover","cardboard","graphic","describ","stench","poverti","replac","sunshin","pretti","hous","twinkl","william","scorebr","enjoi","posit","hope","face","realiti","advis","hesit","read","book","without","prepar","someth","like","schindler","listbut","without","happi","end"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,10,17,24,27,31,33,37,43,50,52,53,70,78,79,80,85,98,105,116,122,124,125,145,151,157,159,1

{"value":"I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. I remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants. What I didn't remember was HOW AWFUL IT WAS!!!<br /><br />I recently caught this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the pinnacle of her career playing Chrissy on 'Three's Company') plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest. Or should I say, a *MAN-EATING ANTS' NEST*!! One of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. One minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.<br /><br />If you thought that was pretty far-fetched, you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the Manor via helicopter! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!<br /><br />The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered in ants.<br /><br />That's basically the movie. There's really no \"disaster\" appeal or \"big-star\" draw to the film. It was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time. Now, it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station.<br /><br />If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Three's Company.

{"value":"Wow, the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago. I'll preface by saying I'm not a fan of narrated episodes. If the story/actors/etc. are worth their salt, they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out, reminded me of personages who can't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters. The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's just not my cup O tea. They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something. Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house, which has a singular half circle driveway, yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under, because it's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property. Sloppy editing, as she pulls into the driveway (for what seems the 100th time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house? The dolly close-ups were also overdone, like some Jr. High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time. I could keep picking apart, but that might get almost as boring as this episode was. It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player, automatic top etc. The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends, abruptly.

{"value":"Unfortunately I have to agree with the critic written by halopes.<br /><br />For a short film the cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very, very good. This might seem surprising at first but I was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals, so the quality is to be expected. The problem, as usual, resides in the story itself.<br /><br />Thing is, it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in cinema's case, SHOW a story) you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can't get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. He's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind. That's it. So what we have here is pure exposition. Instead of being shown a story, we're simply learning things about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, considering the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and the film's short duration, it's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to Voice-Over Narration. In this case it's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we'd never glean. In fact, if it wasn't for the VO we'd think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things. To make it worse the VO also explains what's happening on the screen! The images we're shown are just decoration for the text we're listening to.<br /><br />I could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something, but because the images don't stand on their own it's impossible to say that. What's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities (not incredible, but good) but fails to entertain, amuse, thrill or, at the very least, show a story.","finished_norm":["unfortun","i","have","to","agre","with","the","critic","write","by","halopesbr","br","for","a","short","film","the","cinematographi","costum","set","sound","edit","and","everyth","els","be","veri","veri","good","thi","mai","seem","surpris","at","but","i","be","tell","that","the","technic","crow","work","on","thi","consist","of","profession","so","the","qualiti","be","to","be","expect","the","problem","a","usual","resid","in","the","stori","itselfbr","br","thing","be","it","not","realli","a","stori","to","tell","a","stori","or","in","cinema","case","show","a","stori","you","ne","plot","and","conflict","you","ne","thing","that","happen","to","the","protagonist","event","thi","event","happen","becaus","the","protagonist","want","someth","and","for","some","reason","he","ca","not","get","it","tim","watcher","have","no","problem","or","goal","he","a","kind","of","supernatur","entiti","who","observ","mankind","that","it","so","what","we","have","here","be","pure","exposit","instead","of","be","show","a","stori","we","re","simpli","learn","thing","about","thi","tim","watcher","individu","of","cours","consid","the","peculiar","natur","of","tim","watcher","and","the","film","short","durat","it","hard","to","give","enough","background","about","him","so","the","movi","resort","to","voiceov","narrat","in","thi","case","it","us","in","the","wrong","possibl","sens","which","be","to","give","inform","that","otherwis","we","have","never","glean","in","fact","if","it","be","not","for","the","vo","we","have","think","the","charact","be","just","a","kooki","old","man","go","around","look","at","thing","to","make","it","wrong","the","vo","conjur","explain","what","happen","on","the","screen","the","imag","we","re","show","be","just","decor","for","the","text","we","re","listen","tobr","br","i","can","sai","that","thi","short","film","would","make","a","good","video","for","a","band","or","someth","but","becaus","the","imag","do","not","stand","on","their","own","it","imposs","to","sai","that","what","leav","obvious","have","valu","a","a","measur","of","the","crow","technic","capabl","not","incred","but","good","but","fail","to","entertain","amus","thrill","or","at","the","veri","littl","show","a","stori"],"filtered":["unfortun","agre","critic","write","halopesbr","br","short","film","cinematographi","costum","set","sound","edit","everyth","els","veri","veri","good","thi","mai","seem","surpris","tell","technic","crow","work","thi","consist","profession","qualiti","expect","problem","usual","resid","stori","itselfbr","br","thing","realli","stori","tell","stori","cinema","case","show","stori","ne","plot","conflict","ne","thing","happen","protagonist","event","thi","event","happen","becaus","protagonist","want","someth","reason","ca","get","tim","watcher","problem","goal","kind","supernatur","entiti","observ","mankind","pure","exposit","instead","show","stori","re","simpli","learn","thing","thi","tim","watcher","individu","cours","consid","peculiar","natur","tim","watcher","film","short","durat","hard","give","enough","background","movi","resort","voiceov","narrat","thi","case","us","wrong","possibl","sens","give","inform","otherwis","never","glean","fact","vo","think","charact","kooki","old","man","go","around","look","thing","make","wrong","vo","conjur","explain","happen","screen","imag","re","show","decor","text","re","listen","tobr","br","sai","thi","short","film","make","good","video","band","someth","becaus","imag","stand","imposs","sai","leav","obvious","valu","measur","crow","technic","capabl","incred","good","fail","entertain","amus","thrill","veri","littl","show","stori"],"filtered2":["unfortun","agre","critic","write","halopesbr","short","cinematographi","costum","set","sound","edit","everyth","els","veri","veri","good","mai","seem","surpris","tell","technic","crow","work","consist","profession","qualiti","expect","problem","usual","resid","stori","itselfbr","thing","realli","stori","tell","stori","cinema","case","show","stori","ne","plot","conflict","ne","thing","happen","protagonist","event","event","happen","becaus","protagonist","want","someth","reason","ca","get","tim","watcher","problem","goal","kind","supernatur","entiti","observ","mankind","pure","exposit","instead","show","stori","re","simpli","learn","thing","tim","watcher","individu","cours","consid","peculiar","natur","tim","watcher","short","durat","hard","give","enough","background","resort","voiceov","narrat","case","us","wrong","possibl","sens","give","inform","otherwis","never","glean","fact","vo","think","charact","kooki","old","man","go","around","look","thing","make","wrong","vo","conjur","explain","happen","screen","imag","re","show","decor","text","re","listen","tobr","short","make","good","video","band","someth","becaus","imag","stand","imposs","leav","obvious","valu","measur","crow","technic","capabl","incred","good","fail","entertain","amus","thrill","veri","littl","show","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indi

{"value":"This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I've spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you'd probably say, that's hard to imagine, but never-the-less, it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery, and suspense, why wouldn't you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these.<br /><br />From the cinematography, to the script, to the acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you are in for disappointment.<br /><br />\"Why is it so bad,\" you might be asking yourself. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie made me the least bit \"on edge,\" frightened, or curious. The script was at best laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely dreadful. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.<br /><br />I am not usually a very harsh critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery/suspense/horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and an overwhelming disappointment.

{"value":"I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's, but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So naturally, I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see \"Jerry Springer Uncensored.\" First of all, Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking, chain-smoking, drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona). The mom finds out about the affair, they get into a fight, they want to take it to the \"Jerry\" show (that's right, no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the \"Jerry\" show. The characters collide. Blah, blah, freakin' blah! Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, yet none of them checked out his movie. Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious!! Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited, with scenes that just don't connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With seldom laughs. <br /><br />My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risque as it gets. Don't get me wrong, the scene's pretty risque, but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on Springer's program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized.<br /><br />My

{"value":"Except for the acting of Meryl Streep, which is of note as always, I'd avoid this film because it has a dated \"Movie of the Week\" quality about it. But it is worth watching if you keep the several understories in mind: How a couple endures media scrutiny, and how the different are treated.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different. Australians are different than \"us\" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come at it with an air of \"oddness\" about them. The couple involved is religious (different than most of culture) and Adventists (different) at that. So their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we're faced with oddness questions. The real story, then, is how society (and the world) treats the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect.<br /><br />It's difficult to hear the phrase \"A dingo took my baby!\" without laughing and there are humorous posts, sadly, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered (as you'll find in web searches) that much larger children have been stalked by dingos. Research by experts in dingos have shown that it was not only possible but most probable that the baby was taken by dingos (maybe a pair), extracted expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments

{"value":"I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... When i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government... It's a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually ran by him. The movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after Mr Aimanov's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced. However, in late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/Russian rock legend, - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products... And again back to our 'nomads'. Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects. The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'KVN'.

{"value":"The word \"1st\" in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims. At least they don't have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise.<br /><br />1st should refer to: 1st draft of a script; 1st takes used in each performance in the final film; 1st edit in post production; etcetera, etcetera.<br /><br />The movie is not cast too badly, it's just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate, from the goofy script, to the wooden performances. And while suffering through this cobbled together film, by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery. At 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours.<br /><br />Going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes. Even in the equally awful, Lake Placid, at least the performances Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script, were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie. In 1st to Die, one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead's suicide.<br /><br />The editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters, who I think (were never quite told) is a D.A. She just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor's floor. And no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy.<br /><br />In a word, don't waste your time with this one. My wife and I wish we didn't. But at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was Mystery Science Theater. \"Meanwhile, in Cleveland . . . .\"

{"value":"A trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit (doing his job); he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother (there is a child in the back seat); he then is telling her what is wrong and BAM...they get killed. Okay, this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie. When I was watching this movie in the theatre I was with some friends. This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense/thriller that looked good to everyone in the group...this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I waste $7.oo on a movie ticket, but I had to sit through torture for the brain. This movie started off with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought \"this cant be bad\"...I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; even if you can get passed the bad acting, the \"not so scary\" storyline, and the over all horrible mess this movie was, you will still be puzzled. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, it's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about. Right now you may be thinking \"Oh man! I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is\". GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW!!! I'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it. Please people don't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential...it doesn't. I give this movie 1 out of 10 (if I could give a zero I would), and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie, you'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f. that

{"value":"It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. The paragraph-long \"plot summary\" written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. Alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. It's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. Newsflash to the the creators: I paid to watch you MAKE a movie. I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is somebody I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. Next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, I hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. That's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. As for the Maya character, she didn't seem like a real person.

{"value":"This movie is a cringe-fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot. But it is so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. They catch up with him in the year 1146. The 'futuristic' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-shakers like \" I double-checked everything twice!\" He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I guess chain mail wasn't on the budget, 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. The fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.It sounds truly awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous B-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, I would suggest you see. And once you have, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them point out all the funny, truly awful bits in the

{"value":"The movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level. By presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. Yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer. The lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern lackluster incarnation of Christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well. He is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. This movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. It raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer. It disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment.

{"value":"I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye. I waited for the next awful special effect, or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force, so I could learn how not to make a movie.<br /><br />It seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made, and saw cool things and said: \"Hey, we can do that.\" For example, the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the one car the protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on to. The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP. Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. Then the guy protecting the VIP says \"Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?\" He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies, he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion. Then for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and common sense, the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK!!! A lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn't make sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: \"Wow, that's incredibly cheesy.\" Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.","finished_norm":["i","sit","glue","to","the","screen","rivet","yawn","yet","keep","a","attent","ey","i","wait","for","the","next","aw","special","effect","or","the","next","ridicul","clichéd","plot","item","to","show","up","full","forc","so","i","can","learn","how","not","to","make","a","moviebr","br","it","seem","when","thei","set","out","to","make","thi","movi","the","crow","watch","everi","singl","other","actionsciencefictionshootemupgood","v","evil","movi","ever","make","and","see","cool","thing","and","sai","hei","we","can","do","that","for","exampl","the","onli","car","park","within","a","mile","on","what","seem","like","a","on","wai","road","with","a","shoulder","not","mean","for","park","be","the","on","car","the","protagonist","a","attract","brunett","bear","of","bile","be","throw","on","to","the","car","blow","to","piec","befor","she","even","land","on","it","the","special","effect","be","quit","obvious","my","big","beef","with","thi","movi","but","what","realli","put","it","in","my","bad","book","be","the","implaus","and","lack","of","reason","for","so","mani","elem","for","exampl","the","antagonist","a","fly","demon","with","the","abil","to","inflict","harm","in","bizarr","wai","happen","upon","a","lone","armi","truck","transport","a","import","vip","nameless","secur","gui","with","gun","get","out","of","the","truck","you","know","thei","be","alreadi","dead","then","the","gui","protect","the","vip","sai","under","no","circumst","do","you","leav","thi","truck","do","you","understand","me","he","get","out","to","find","the","beast","that","kill","hi","buddi","he","get","whack","in","a","almost","comic","cliché","fashion","then","for","no","appar","reason","defi","logic","convent","and","common","sens","the","dumb","ass","vip","get","out","of","the","truck","a","lot","of","what","happen","along","the","cours","of","the","movi","do","not","make","sens","transpar","act","distanc","me","from","the","movi","a","good","a","bad","camerawork","and","thing","that","just","make","you","go","wow","that","incredibli","cheesi","shiri","applebi","save","the","movi","from","a","becaus","she","give","the","movi","the","on","elem","that","alwai","make","viewer","enjoi","the","experi","sex","appeal"],"filtered":["sit","glue","screen","rivet","yawn","yet","keep","attent","ey","wait","next","aw","special","effect","next","ridicul","clichéd","plot","item","show","full","forc","learn","make","moviebr","br","seem","thei","set","make","thi","movi","crow","watch","everi","singl","actionsciencefictionshootemupgood","v","evil","movi","ever","make","see","cool","thing","sai","hei","exampl","onli","car","park","within","mile","seem","like","wai","road","shoulder","mean","park","car","protagonist","attract","brunett","bear","bile","throw","car","blow","piec","befor","even","land","special","effect","quit","obvious","big","beef","thi","movi","realli","put","bad","book","implaus","lack","reason","mani","elem","exampl","antagonist","fly","demon","abil","inflict","harm","bizarr","wai","happen","upon","lone","armi","truck","transport","import","vip","nameless","secur","gui","gun","get","truck","know","thei","alreadi","dead","gui","protect","vip","sai","circumst","leav","thi","truck","understand","get","find","beast","kill","hi","buddi","get","whack","almost","comic","cliché","fashion","appar","reason","defi","logic","convent","common","sens","dumb","ass","vip","get","truck","lot","happen","along","cours","movi","make","sens","transpar","act","distanc","movi","good","bad","camerawork","thing","make","go","wow","incredibli","cheesi","shiri","applebi","save","movi","becaus","give","movi","elem","alwai","make","viewer","enjoi","experi","sex","appeal"],"filtered2":["sit","glue","screen","rivet","yawn","yet","keep","attent","ey","wait","next","aw","special","effect","next","ridicul","clichéd","plot","item","show","full","forc","learn","make","moviebr","seem","set","make","crow","watch","everi","singl","actionsciencefictionshootemupgood","v","evil","ever","make","see","cool","thing","hei","exampl","onli","car","park","within","mile","seem","like","wai","road","shoulder","mean","park","car","protagonist","attract","brunett","bear","bile","throw","car","blow","piec","befor","even","land","special","effect","quit","obvious","big","beef","realli","put","bad","book","implaus","lack","reason","mani","elem","exampl","antagonist","fly","demon","abil","inflict","harm","bizarr","wai","happen","upon","lone","armi","truck","transport","import","vip","nameless","secur","gui","gun","get","truck","know","alreadi","dead","gui","protect","vip","circumst","leav","truck","understand","get","find","beast","kill","buddi","get","whack","almost","comic","cliché","fashion","appar","reason","defi","logic","convent","common","sens","dumb","ass","vip","get","truck","lot","happen","along","cours","make","sens","transpar","act","distanc","good","bad","camerawork","thing","make","go","wow","incredibli","cheesi","shiri","applebi","save","becaus","give","elem",

{"value":"Well first off I'd like to add that I myself is somewhat of a historian so what I look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts. But this is however not the case here. Sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it isn't entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying. Hitler wasn't anti-semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before world war one. It was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the Jews. His upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child wasn't a disturbed little brat. He had a more or less normal upbringing. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is Hitler.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle is a great actor but he doesn't really fit in the role as Hitler. Hitler wasn't as impossible and unstable as he is portrait-ed here. Under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom \"manipulated\" people through his charms. His unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the war.<br /><br />I'd like to see a film about Hitler's life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations. I really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil. It is much better to actually tell the story EXACTLY as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like! The ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this.

{"value":"I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.<br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.<br /><br />However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune.<br /><br />The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.<br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.<br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort

{"value":"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, \"wow, finally, some entertainment.\" It was slightly amusing for a week or so... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have WAY TOO MUCH \"playing around\" time.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air. But seriously, this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her. She is very unprofessional. She keeps on interrupting Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. It's just really become annoying to the point that I can't watch it anymore.<br /><br />Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. Hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. She's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. They're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...<br /><br />I believe \"Good Day LA\" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who actually CARE about the news.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (I'd really rather watch KTLA.
