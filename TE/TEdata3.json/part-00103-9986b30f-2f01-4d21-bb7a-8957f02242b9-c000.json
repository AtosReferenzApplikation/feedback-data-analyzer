{"value":"Ah WINTER KILLS , based on the novel by Richard Condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago . I knew Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller<br /><br />WINTER KILLS left me cold . It's not a thriller - It's a piece of worthless crap , possibly the worst movie I've seen this month and boy have I seen a lot of bad movies in June . The problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as William Richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce <br /><br />There's two things wrong with this movie . First off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner . It's not as OTT as say something like that James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances . This might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none . As a satire it's very silly , so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable . Secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they're rendered senseless . Take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called Dawson . Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane . The scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason<br /><br />A dire movie that's an ordeal to sit

{"value":"Probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's great portrayers of bumbling incompetence . . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster. As Pops Romano, he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan's manic foolishness. Respectable performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the harried boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk's advisor and Benedict Arnold.<br /><br />The plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could have proved a great comedic vehicle. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just provides a muddled mess. Sadly, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray his misfit brothers, both fall far short of their proven capability.<br /><br />There are some very funny scenes, but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones. What I truly miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies. There is no 'second level' of wit riding over the slapstick. No cultural references that only the adults get. . no double entendre. . it is just silly.<br /><br />And, by the way, this doesn't all mean that I am recommending it for your 9-year-old, because

{"value":"After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The voice-over describes the movie as surreal. Well, there's surreal, and there's surreal. <br /><br />There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imagery, particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor, were so nonsensical they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.<br /><br />My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy. <br /><br />I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. <br /><br />Still, as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace. I very much liked Madagascar Skin, and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative, and perhaps even style. It didn't even come close. For me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution.","finished_norm":["after","watch","thi","movi","on","dvd","i","watch","the","trailer","the","voiceov","describ","the","movi","a","surreal","good","there","surreal","and","there","surreal","br","br","there","be","realli","onli","on","part","of","the","film","that","seem","surreal","to","me","but","frankli","it","be","much","confus","than","surreal","the","other","unusu","imageri","particularli","the","lunchroom","scene","where","everybodi","be","on","the","floor","be","so","nonsens","thei","have","no","mean","i","do","not","mind","imageri","that","doe","not","mean","anyth","but","thi","scene","just","seem","irrelevantbr","br","my","impress","be","that","the","director","be","try","to","convei","logan","inner","monologu","i","do","not","know","what","els","would","explain","what","be","go","on","unfortun","noth","i","see","give","me","ani","clue","what","logan","be","think","about","what","hi","perspect","be","or","even","hi","emot","state","all","i","can","tell","be","that","he","be","not","particularli","happi","with","hi","physic","appear","and","that","he","have","a","crush","on","a","old","boi","br","br","i","think","the","end","signal","what","the","relationship","between","the","boi","have","becom","but","not","much","els","do","purpos","juxtapos","ambigu","scene","with","that","that","be","much","straightforward","seem","much","like","a","cop","out","than","a","artist","decis","br","br","still","a","tiresom","and","a","contentfre","the","movi","be","for","me","it","be","a","definit","chang","of","pace","i","veri","much","like","madagascar","skin","and","i","have","the","feel","thi","movi","aspir","to","that","kind","of","narr","and","perhap","even","styl","it","do","not","even","come","close","for","me","there","no","question","about","it","thi","movi","deserv","a","a","for","effort","but","a","have","for","execut"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","dvd","watch","trailer","voiceov","describ","movi","surreal","good","surreal","surreal","br","br","realli","onli","part","film","seem","surreal","frankli","much","confus","surreal","unusu","imageri","particularli","lunchroom","scene","everybodi","floor","nonsens","thei","mean","mind","imageri","doe","mean","anyth","thi","scene","seem","irrelevantbr","br","impress","director","try","convei","logan","inner","monologu","know","els","explain","go","unfortun","noth","see","give","ani","clue","logan","think","hi","perspect","even","hi","emot","state","tell","particularli","happi","hi","physic","appear","crush","old","boi","br","br","think","end","signal","relationship","boi","becom","much","els","purpos","juxtapos","ambigu","scene","much","straightforward","seem","much","like","cop","artist","decis","br","br","still","tiresom","contentfre","movi","definit","chang","pace","veri","much","like","madagascar","skin","feel","thi","movi","aspir","kind","narr","perhap","even","styl","even","come","close","question","thi","movi","deserv","effort","execut"],"filtered2":["watch","dvd","watch","trailer","voiceov","describ","surreal","good","surreal","surreal","realli","onli","part","seem","surreal","frankli","confus","surreal","unusu","imageri","particularli","lunchroom","scene","everybodi","floor","nonsens","mean","mind","imageri","doe","mean","anyth","scene","seem","irrelevantbr","impress","director","try","convei","logan","inner","monologu","know","els","explain","go","unfortun","noth","see","give","ani","clue","logan","think","perspect","even","emot","state","tell","particularli","happi","physic","appear","crush","old","boi","think","end","signal","relationship","boi","becom","els","purpos","juxtapos","ambigu","scene","straightforward","seem","like","cop","artist","decis","still","tiresom","contentfre","definit","chang","pace","veri","like","madagascar","skin","feel","aspir","kind","narr","perhap","even","styl","even","come","close","question","deserv","effort","execut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,11,12,13,15,18,19,24,26,27,30,34,35,36,43,49,58,61,64,67,88,90,104,115,122,169,196,227,238,247,278,282,295,318,378,380,392,395,401,418,423,427,476,497,498,506,546,577,605,662,668,724,794,905,950,970,1038,1198,1215,1237,1332,1483,1613,1617,1979,2060,2160,2334,2388,2495,2579,2615,2755,3382,3461,3496,4210,4987],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,11,12,13,15,18,19,24,26,27,30,34,35,36,43,49,58,61,64,67,88,90,104,115,122,169,196,227,238,247,278,282,295,318,378,380,392,395,401,418,423,427,476,497,498,506,546,577,605,662,668,724,794,905,950,970,1038,1198,1215,1237,1332,1483,1613,1617,1979,2060,2160,2334,2388,2495,2579,2615,2755,3382,3461,3496,4210,4987],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.

{"value":"Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. He certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can't save this turkey of a film, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in St. Louis.<br /><br />McQueen's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang. There's more than a broad hint that there's a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke. He's not liked at all by the other heist members, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. <br /><br />Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot, especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all pretty rough characters. That would certainly get my suspicions aroused.<br /><br />The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didn't do much of anything. One of those two jokers decided Steve's performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation. <br /><br />This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can't believe they would have if they saw this.<br /><br />Or they would have

{"value":"First, before reading further, you must understand that I'm not neo-nazi, I'm just trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again.<br /><br />I've seen this series and found it awful. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler wasn't angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is highly probable that Hitler, in reality, was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret. Third, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. That's a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him (of course, not Jews).<br /><br />This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly, and of course, not charming at all, you're wrong. If you think that, you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power, and stop thinking he was just awful, you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember he was elected) and stop

{"value":"I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa I don't have any information on that-. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think; It makes you wonder..

{"value":"Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming: science goes out the window and \"belief\" and \"consensus\" becomes the topic of discussion.<br /><br />It's because of that fact that I give a failing mark to Al Gore's documentary.<br /><br />Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of \"belief\" and \"consensus\".<br /><br />Of course, when you're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to \"stop Global Warming\" you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans. Maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has over-ceded the next Ice Age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet.<br /><br />But the fact remains that we don't know.<br /><br />so we're asked to \"believe\" in the \"consensus\". Never mind that any scientist that strays from the \"consensus\" is ostracized. Never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus. Einstein didn't \"believe\" in the consensus, neither did Copernicus or Galileo.<br /><br />So why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions? If Global Warming is so incontrovertible, surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening.<br /><br />What is going on here? That's the movie I was hoping Al Gore would have made.

{"value":"\"Shinobi\" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die.<br /><br />OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb.<br /><br />Fine, fine! There is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, NO! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, \"Lalala, I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*.\" THE END for that character.

{"value":"It's a while ago, that I have seen Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but he is now the husband and Jude Law the lover of his wife. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic play.<br /><br />During the movie I always had the feeling to watch a play. That's one of the reasons I dislike this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted a play I still must feel to see a movie and not just a play. Director Kenneth Brannigan did some marvelous movies in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the look of the movie. The design was modern, stylish clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never got the feeling that somebody ever lived in that house. The photography wasn't bad, but the lightening was awful. Sometimes there was blue light, dark, green light, to round it up not friendly for eyes.<br /><br />The acting was really good. Michael Caine's and Jude Law's perform at their best. I really would like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage. But I have to confess I never was a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the mid part. I remember that in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just marvelous directed. I tried to watch it twice and always in the mid part I felt asleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) isn't awful, but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth

{"value":"Another turgid action/adventure flick from the Quinn Martin Productions factory. Roy Thinnes plays undercover agent Diamond Head (Mr. Head, to you), working for his G-Man handler \"Aunt Mary\", looking for \"Tree\", who's on a mission to...well, just watch the movie. <br /><br />This one deserved and got the full MST3K sendup. As the boys and various reviewers have pointed out, the movie \"Fargo\" had more Hawaiian locations than this film. Apparently shot on a puny budget, this movie highlights Hawaii's broken-down dive shops, gas stations, and cheapo hotels. Zulu -- later to star as Kono in Hawaii-Five-O -- appears as Thinnes' lumpy, inept sidekick, while France Nguyen models the Jenny Craig diet gone horribly wrong. Others sharing the flickering screen include a drunken Richard Harris knockoff, a George Takai imitator, a not-so-smart hit-man with sprayed-on Sansabelt slacks, and the villain \"Tree\", sporting a veddy British accent. You can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits, but relax--just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70's movie-of-the-week.<br /><br />Whenever I think of this movie (and I think of this movie often), I catch myself humming the theme, written for flute and tuba...no one knows why. <br /><br />Trivia note--Diamond Head was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, one of three contract directors at Universal who would go on to make much bigger films, in his case Jaws 2.

{"value":"'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park' for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release.

{"value":"I'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. Anyway, this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual. Once again, the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie. He/she made the main character unlikable. She starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning, and then finds out when she becomes 30, that she's basically a sh*tty person (having affairs, etc.). Why the F would we feel for this person? OK, let's say we can get past that. Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity. I don't know if it's her or the writer's fault, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are NOT entertaining, they're annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to \"Thriller\". Holy crap that was painful. It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but an entire club full of people?!? Argh!!! The Macarena would be more believable! All of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character on \"Big\" had a job that made sense to a child. These body-switching/child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand, and this is by far the worst one yet.","finished_norm":["i","be","begin","to","see","a","pattern","in","the","movi","i","give","a","to","thei","be","almost","all","movi","that","my","wife","make","me","watch","mayb","i","should","stop","have","faith","in","her","tast","in","movi","anywai","thi","be","typic","drivel","aim","at","preteen","girl","but","do","even","much","poorli","than","usual","onc","again","the","writer","break","the","cardin","rule","of","ani","movi","hesh","make","the","main","charact","unlik","she","start","off","by","be","a","complet","btch","to","her","friend","at","the","begin","and","then","find","out","when","she","becom","that","she","basic","a","shtty","person","have","affair","etc","why","the","f","would","we","feel","for","thi","person","okai","let","sai","we","can","get","past","that","jennif","garner","be","about","a","far","from","attract","a","you","can","get","without","have","some","sort","of","deform","i","do","not","know","if","it","her","or","the","writer","fault","but","her","charact","go","good","beyond","my","threshold","for","annoy","here","a","tip","for","futur","filmmak","year","old","be","not","entertain","thei","re","annoi","far","and","awai","the","much","embarrass","moment","in","the","movi","come","when","thei","danc","to","thriller","holi","crap","that","be","pain","it","show","her","practic","that","danc","at","the","begin","that","explain","why","she","know","it","but","a","entir","club","full","of","peopl","argh","the","macarena","would","be","much","believ","all","of","a","sudden","she","complet","incompet","and","have","no","clue","how","to","do","her","job","and","no","on","notic","at","littl","tom","hank","charact","on","big","have","a","job","that","make","sens","to","a","child","thi","bodyswitchingchild","becom","adult","overnight","movi","be","realli","get","out","of","hand","and","thi","be","by","far","the","wrong","on","yet"],"filtered":["begin","see","pattern","movi","give","thei","almost","movi","wife","make","watch","mayb","stop","faith","tast","movi","anywai","thi","typic","drivel","aim","preteen","girl","even","much","poorli","usual","onc","writer","break","cardin","rule","ani","movi","hesh","make","main","charact","unlik","start","complet","btch","friend","begin","find","becom","basic","shtty","person","affair","etc","f","feel","thi","person","okai","let","sai","get","past","jennif","garner","far","attract","get","without","sort","deform","know","writer","fault","charact","go","good","beyond","threshold","annoy","tip","futur","filmmak","year","old","entertain","thei","re","annoi","far","awai","much","embarrass","moment","movi","come","thei","danc","thriller","holi","crap","pain","show","practic","danc","begin","explain","know","entir","club","full","peopl","argh","macarena","much","believ","sudden","complet","incompet","clue","job","notic","littl","tom","hank","charact","big","job","make","sens","child","thi","bodyswitchingchild","becom","adult","overnight","movi","realli","get","hand","thi","far","wrong","yet"],"filtered2":["begin","see","pattern","give","almost","wife","make","watch","mayb","stop","faith","tast","anywai","typic","drivel","aim","preteen","girl","even","poorli","usual","onc","writer","break","cardin","rule","ani","hesh","make","main","charact","unlik","start","complet","btch","friend","begin","find","becom","basic","shtty","person","affair","etc","f","feel","person","okai","let","get","past","jennif","garner","far","attract","get","without","sort","deform","know","writer","fault","charact","go","good","beyond","threshold","annoy","tip","futur","filmmak","year","old","entertain","re","annoi","far","awai","embarrass","moment","come","danc","thriller","holi","crap","pain","show","practic","danc","begin","explain","know","entir","club","full","peopl","argh","macarena","believ","sudden","complet","incompet","clue","job","notic","littl","tom","hank","charact","big","job","make","sens","child","bodyswitchingchild","becom","adult","overnight","realli","get","hand","far","wrong","yet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,13,14,23,25,26,27,28,30,34,38,43,57,67,68,71,82,84,91,101,103,115,124,125,131,147,153,155,161,163,173,179,180,188,191,194,195,198,235,236,263,265,269,271,286,287,289,313,315,323,336,360,386,395,398,429,440,459,492,502,557,613,615,648,688,714,734,759,844,872,917,1035,1038,1072,1096,1201,1205,1289,1298,1578,1786,1900,1940,2167,2396,3049,3166,3516,5303,5798,5859,6108,7513,7591,7607],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,13,14,23,25,26,27,28,30,34,38,43,57,67,68,71,82,84,91,101,103,115,124,1

{"value":"I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. And my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. HE was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that I found it insulting.<br /><br />First of all, they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. Sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film. Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. What? They couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee?

{"value":"After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Though i guess not. If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs.

{"value":"Years have past since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) stumbled onto the horrific plot that involved replacing humans with machines however since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we lost, now a superwoman of sorts who is the daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (She also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability) which I think is the films minimal connection to the first, however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future hunts her down in this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, that I can see why people liked even though I was no fan of said film. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful look and provide tons of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 doesn't even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip off of The Terminator with a muscled female who is so low on acting ability she makes Olivier Gruner seem like a master thespian and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original. I'll admit I was no fan of the original but it deserved a better follow up than this. The original also featured a good cast like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley this one features nobody and this time it's just a dull movie with a pretentious vibe.

{"value":"My friends and I rented this for \"Bad Movie Night\" with high hopes, but The Brain was something of a letdown. The Brain itself is gloriously goofy-looking, but it mostly just sits on its little platform. Who thought that it would be cool that the Brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn-out minutes? This movie has a number of things going for it at first, including an Estevez-knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius (we're told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts, which include putting krazy glue on someone's chair). It also has some great lines, a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere, and, yeah, some chick gets naked. However, the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing. During the last half things just start to drag on and on, with at least 3 or 4 pointless, boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell. I could've fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour- more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more Brain action. If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down. Maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie- I started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this

{"value":"Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widower father David Niven holiday in the South of France with nutty Mylène Demongeot. Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist. That's fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as he's done with all the women in his past...including Demongeot). When it appears as though she's becoming second banana in Niven's life, Seberg exact revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. The cinematography by Georges Périnal is stunning. The film features some of Preminger's least heavy-handed direction, although he rarely allows any close-ups, which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes (mostly involving bird-brained Demongeot). Seberg acquits herself fairly well, but Niven is at his least appealing...and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really mis-steps with that casting. It's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg's would-be suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother.

{"value":"Filmatography: Excellent, nice camera angles (I don't remember seeing a movie of late, with good close-ups, until this one). Could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera. NY is pictured good.I liked the upside down angles, in particular (a different touch).<br /><br />Music: Not impressive. Songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie. May be, I expected same quality like \"Anniyan\". A disappointment. <br /><br />Actors: Kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard-core action sequences. His age and belly really show up. Also, he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward. It was a very awkward to see a mature/aged star still trying to play like a 20+ heroes scenes. Love can be expressed at any age; as we get older, you still can express love nicely from a distance (without touching a woman too much. For example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in \"chandrmukhi\").<br /><br />Jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie. Not sure why she accepted this. Well, that is not my problem, I guess.<br /><br />Others just have a small presence.<br /><br />Direction: I expected Gautham to excel (or measure-up) to his other movie \"Kakka Kakka\". He disappointmented me. It took a long time to release the movie due to various issues. He slips in few scenes. Even abvious things got slipped from a famous director.<br /><br />Overall: Just a okay movie. Too much graphics.

{"value":"Somewhere, out there, there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made. One's that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space, or one's where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti. This motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's some sort of gimmicky film making technique or maybe it's that the film is so bad they have to fill it up with long, wasted shots because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes.

The best one so far was \"Beautiful Thing\". So, I watched this and after the very first opening shot which lingered and lingered I thought \"Oh, no, its going to be creative sinny mah\" But I gave it a chance and watched it and then when it ended I tossed the DVD in the trash. Sorry I didn't like it and if you did, sorry if I

{"value":"I almost burst into tears watching this movie. Not from laughing but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had him at his best, and Back To School is by far an 80's classic masterpiece. Then there was Ladybugs and that's when it started to show. Poor Rodney was getting old (Meet Wally Sparks was a slight step up from Ladybugs but not saying much). <br /><br />In My 5 Wives Rodney plays Monte (a name he must love since that was his name in Easy Money) a rich (isnt he always) guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing. Well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the Amish, he inherits 5 Wives. This sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is EVERYTHING. The script is so poor that Rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do. The movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the F word (which he should since the film is rated R but plays as if it was PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo. Don't get me wrong, at times I did laugh at a few of Rodney's jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow. We can see his jokes coming from miles. And the film turns way too PC which thanks to the horrible 1990's, the 70's and 80's Rodney just doesn't work anymore.","finished_norm":["i","almost","burst","into","tear","watch","thi","movi","not","from","laugh","but","from","the","memori","of","a","great","rodnei","dangerfield","movi","candyshack","be","hi","and","steal","the","movi","easi","monei","have","him","at","hi","well","and","back","to","school","be","by","far","a","classic","masterpiec","then","there","be","ladybug","and","that","when","it","start","to","show","poor","rodnei","be","get","old","meet","walli","spark","be","a","slight","step","up","from","ladybug","but","not","sai","much","br","br","in","my","wife","rodnei","plai","mont","a","name","he","must","love","sinc","that","be","hi","name","in","easi","monei","a","rich","isnt","he","alwai","gui","who","love","woman","and","get","marri","like","it","noth","good","now","he","inherit","a","huge","piec","of","land","and","sinc","the","land","be","run","by","the","amish","he","inherit","wife","thi","sound","like","a","great","idea","for","a","dangerfield","movi","the","problem","be","everyth","the","script","be","so","poor","that","rodnei","seem","to","be","sai","hi","on","liner","to","the","camera","and","all","the","side","charact","have","noth","to","do","the","movi","look","like","it","be","shoot","on","video","with","some","realli","poor","stunt","sequenc","that","be","obvious","not","rodnei","andrew","die","clai","plai","a","gangster","who","look","like","he","be","dye","to","sai","the","f","word","which","he","should","sinc","the","film","be","rate","r","but","plai","a","if","it","be","pg","and","jerri","still","have","a","nice","minut","cameo","do","not","get","me","wrong","at","time","i","do","laugh","at","a","few","of","rodnei","joke","but","the","poor","man","be","get","wai","too","old","and","wai","too","slow","we","can","see","hi","joke","come","from","mile","and","the","film","turn","wai","too","pc","which","thank","to","the","horribl","the","and","rodnei","just","doe","not","work","anymor"],"filtered":["almost","burst","tear","watch","thi","movi","laugh","memori","great","rodnei","dangerfield","movi","candyshack","hi","steal","movi","easi","monei","hi","well","back","school","far","classic","masterpiec","ladybug","start","show","poor","rodnei","get","old","meet","walli","spark","slight","step","ladybug","sai","much","br","br","wife","rodnei","plai","mont","name","must","love","sinc","hi","name","easi","monei","rich","isnt","alwai","gui","love","woman","get","marri","like","noth","good","inherit","huge","piec","land","sinc","land","run","amish","inherit","wife","thi","sound","like","great","idea","dangerfield","movi","problem","everyth","script","poor","rodnei","seem","sai","hi","liner","camera","side","charact","noth","movi","look","like","shoot","video","realli","poor","stunt","sequenc","obvious","rodnei","andrew","die","clai","plai","gangster","look","like","dye","sai","f","word","sinc","film","rate","r","plai","pg","jerri","still","nice","minut","cameo","get","wrong","time","laugh","rodnei","joke","poor","man","get","wai","old","wai","slow","see","hi","joke","come","mile","film","turn","wai","pc","thank","horribl","rodnei","doe","work","anymor"],"filtered2":["almost","burst","tear","watch","laugh","memori","great","rodnei","dangerfield","candyshack","steal","easi","monei","well","back","school","far","classic","masterpiec","ladybug","start","show","poor","rodnei","get","old","meet","walli","spark","slight","step","ladybug","wife","rodnei","plai","mont","name","must","love","sinc","name","easi","monei","rich","isnt","alwai","gui","love","woman","get","marri","like","noth","good","inherit","huge","piec","land","sinc","land","run","amish","inherit","wife","sound","like","great","idea","dangerfield","problem","everyth","script","poor","rodnei","seem","liner","camera","side","charact","noth","look","like","shoot","video","realli","poor","stunt","sequenc","obvious","rodnei","andrew","die","clai","plai","gangster","look","like","dye","f","word","sinc","rate","r","plai","pg","jerri","still","nice","minut","cameo","get","wrong","time","laugh","rodnei","joke","poor","man","get","wai","old","wai","slow","see","joke","come","mile","turn","wai","pc","thank","horribl","rodnei","doe","work","anymor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,10,13,16,18,20,25,28,33,34,35,40,45,48,49,51,54,55,59,63,64,67,70,71,77,96,101,117,123,126,131,133,137,141,143,146,162,167,178,193,197,202,214,218,230,231,240,258,262,263,293,296,332,341,349,350,390,425,444,578,651,733,744,870,937,1060,1068,1096,1120,1174,1199,1206,1230,1352,1432,1440,1546,1601,1705,2020,2470,2624,2828,3668,3714,3729,3793,4197,5426,7348,8142,8479],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1

{"value":"I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and divined that it had to be the best satire ever. What a brilliant idea for a satire--the genre is rife. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think all involved probably realize) is a catalogue of missed opportunities, not-quite-there performances and (thankfully!) a few extremely hilarious, inspired bits. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks really bad here, probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch, trying to hard to be funny and looking like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny just SEEING her makes you laugh, but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (the nerdier ones). I think the problem is the director just doesn't move things along at the right pace. He starts out very deadpan, and that sets the monotone. But when he lets things get really outrageous (the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I've had all year in movies, the first also coming in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY complaining about the movie IN & OUT), it's just plain funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just didn't. The clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the very few songs used are also perfect. This ends up as a medium-bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustratingly overlong sketches.","finished_norm":["i","be","dye","to","see","thi","onc","i","see","the","ridicul","meatbal","poster","and","divin","that","it","have","to","be","the","well","satir","ever","what","a","brilliant","idea","for","a","satireth","genr","be","rife","unfortun","the","finish","product","a","i","think","all","involv","probabl","realiz","be","a","catalogu","of","miss","opportun","notquitether","perform","and","thankfulli","a","few","extrem","hilari","inspir","bit","janean","garafolo","who","be","veri","strike","look","realli","bad","here","probabl","becaus","she","be","uncomfort","struggl","to","make","her","flat","role","funni","david","hyd","pierc","be","just","sad","to","watch","try","to","hard","to","be","funni","and","look","like","a","castro","nerd","molli","shannon","be","so","funni","just","see","her","make","you","laugh","but","somehow","her","segment","fail","to","snowbal","into","someth","hyster","paul","rudd","have","great","teen","manner","and","be","sexi","a","hell","the","other","gui","be","conjur","realli","funni","the","nerdi","on","i","think","the","problem","be","the","director","just","doe","not","move","thing","along","at","the","right","pace","he","start","out","veri","deadpan","and","that","set","the","monoton","but","when","he","let","thing","get","realli","outrag","the","drug","sequenc","be","the","funni","moment","i","have","have","all","year","in","movi","the","conjur","come","in","a","lame","movi","andrea","martin","in","all","over","the","gui","complain","about","the","movi","in","out","it","just","plain","funni","i","want","thi","movi","to","work","so","badli","but","it","just","do","not","the","cloth","and","styl","for","be","perfect","and","the","veri","few","song","us","be","conjur","perfect","thi","end","up","a","a","mediumbad","mad","tv","episod","complet","with","frustratingli","overlong","sketch"],"filtered":["dye","see","thi","onc","see","ridicul","meatbal","poster","divin","well","satir","ever","brilliant","idea","satireth","genr","rife","unfortun","finish","product","think","involv","probabl","realiz","catalogu","miss","opportun","notquitether","perform","thankfulli","extrem","hilari","inspir","bit","janean","garafolo","veri","strike","look","realli","bad","probabl","becaus","uncomfort","struggl","make","flat","role","funni","david","hyd","pierc","sad","watch","try","hard","funni","look","like","castro","nerd","molli","shannon","funni","see","make","laugh","somehow","segment","fail","snowbal","someth","hyster","paul","rudd","great","teen","manner","sexi","hell","gui","conjur","realli","funni","nerdi","think","problem","director","doe","move","thing","along","right","pace","start","veri","deadpan","set","monoton","let","thing","get","realli","outrag","drug","sequenc","funni","moment","year","movi","conjur","come","lame","movi","andrea","martin","gui","complain","movi","plain","funni","want","thi","movi","work","badli","cloth","styl","perfect","veri","song","us","conjur","perfect","thi","end","mediumbad","mad","tv","episod","complet","frustratingli","overlong","sketch"],"filtered2":["dye","see","onc","see","ridicul","meatbal","poster","divin","well","satir","ever","brilliant","idea","satireth","genr","rife","unfortun","finish","product","think","involv","probabl","realiz","catalogu","miss","opportun","notquitether","perform","thankfulli","extrem","hilari","inspir","bit","janean","garafolo","veri","strike","look","realli","bad","probabl","becaus","uncomfort","struggl","make","flat","role","funni","david","hyd","pierc","sad","watch","try","hard","funni","look","like","castro","nerd","molli","shannon","funni","see","make","laugh","somehow","segment","fail","snowbal","someth","hyster","paul","rudd","great","teen","manner","sexi","hell","gui","conjur","realli","funni","nerdi","think","problem","director","doe","move","thing","along","right","pace","start","veri","deadpan","set","monoton","let","thing","get","realli","outrag","drug","sequenc","funni","moment","year","conjur","come","lame","andrea","martin","gui","complain","plain","funni","want","work","badli","cloth","styl","perfect","veri","song","us","conjur","perfect","end","mediumbad","mad","tv","complet","frustratingli","overlong","sketch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,9,12,13,15,16,18,20,22,24,29,34,36,37,39,44,48,51,53,55,56,57,58,62,71,103,105,109,121,123,124,128,133,148,167,171,172,188,190,215,227,236,241,255,274,275,324,328,329,349,372,380,394,405,448,455,467,546,549,573,586,594,632,675,677,697,831,840,842,879,881,909,912,993,1046,1056,1087,1230,1232,1279,1381,1532,1738,1831,2058,2076,2101,2399,2503,2620,2626,2929,3094,4015,5069,5539,5576,5899,6134,6573,6727,7098,7260,8191,8587],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"hg is normally exploitive, and it's never really bothered me before--i loved \"bloodfeast 2\", but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm not opposed to witches, and i liked \"carrie\" (the novel and the movie) but this one bothered me. i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology.<br /><br />there were some decent concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber, this may have been a decent movie.","finished_norm":["hg","be","normal","exploit","and","it","never","realli","bother","me","beforei","love","bloodfeast","but","i","realli","do","not","like","pseudo","scienc","or","plai","on","heurist","the","whole","movi","be","base","on","a","man","with","esp","caus","by","a","electr","accid","and","a","witch","i","be","not","oppos","to","witch","and","i","like","carri","the","novel","and","the","movi","but","thi","on","bother","me","i","think","it","becaus","of","the","main","charact","develop","esp","from","a","electr","line","conjur","the","univers","professor","wast","hi","time","studi","esp","case","i","be","not","aliv","in","the","to","know","hand","whether","or","not","esp","be","a","common","fallaci","then","but","i","assum","that","ani","theori","of","such","natur","would","simpli","be","discredit","what","realli","bother","me","be","the","wai","the","polic","be","describ","schizophren","a","ruthless","unpredict","villain","who","can","seem","like","normal","peopl","of","the","time","and","then","just","snap","noth","can","be","far","from","the","truth","i","detest","such","concept","becaus","thei","add","to","public","idioci","mani","peopl","still","think","that","schizophrenia","be","dissoci","ident","disord","whoever","write","thi","script","do","not","know","much","about","psychologybr","br","there","be","some","decent","concept","to","the","movi","i","like","the","wai","the","witch","us","man","it","be","a","nice","chang","i","like","how","she","can","make","herself","attract","but","do","not","when","she","be","around","her","forc","lover","i","find","it","interest","how","her","lover","conjur","burn","hi","face","have","the","script","be","touch","up","for","a","few","week","befor","product","and","not","focu","sole","on","make","it","audienc","dumb","thi","mai","have","be","a","decent","movi"],"filtered":["hg","normal","exploit","never","realli","bother","beforei","love","bloodfeast","realli","like","pseudo","scienc","plai","heurist","whole","movi","base","man","esp","caus","electr","accid","witch","oppos","witch","like","carri","novel","movi","thi","bother","think","becaus","main","charact","develop","esp","electr","line","conjur","univers","professor","wast","hi","time","studi","esp","case","aliv","know","hand","whether","esp","common","fallaci","assum","ani","theori","natur","simpli","discredit","realli","bother","wai","polic","describ","schizophren","ruthless","unpredict","villain","seem","like","normal","peopl","time","snap","noth","far","truth","detest","concept","becaus","thei","add","public","idioci","mani","peopl","still","think","schizophrenia","dissoci","ident","disord","whoever","write","thi","script","know","much","psychologybr","br","decent","concept","movi","like","wai","witch","us","man","nice","chang","like","make","attract","around","forc","lover","find","interest","lover","conjur","burn","hi","face","script","touch","week","befor","product","focu","sole","make","audienc","dumb","thi","mai","decent","movi"],"filtered2":["hg","normal","exploit","never","realli","bother","beforei","love","bloodfeast","realli","like","pseudo","scienc","plai","heurist","whole","base","man","esp","caus","electr","accid","witch","oppos","witch","like","carri","novel","bother","think","becaus","main","charact","develop","esp","electr","line","conjur","univers","professor","wast","time","studi","esp","case","aliv","know","hand","whether","esp","common","fallaci","assum","ani","theori","natur","simpli","discredit","realli","bother","wai","polic","describ","schizophren","ruthless","unpredict","villain","seem","like","normal","peopl","time","snap","noth","far","truth","detest","concept","becaus","add","public","idioci","mani","peopl","still","think","schizophrenia","dissoci","ident","disord","whoever","write","script","know","psychologybr","decent","concept","like","wai","witch","us","man","nice","chang","like","make","attract","around","forc","lover","find","interest","lover","conjur","burn","face","script","touch","week","befor","product","focu","sole","make","audienc","dumb","mai","decent"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,10,12,13,22,23,26,27,33,35,38,39,40,42,45,46,49,50,54,56,60,64,65,77,79,89,98,101,107,111,168,179,190,201,235,251,262,278,288,299,309,320,334,338,420,453,456,471,474,496,520,597,619,621,648,668,700,726,745,758,780,857,862,910,913,918,920,939,954,1048,1135,1171,1325,1466,1523,1608,1609,1752,2355,2384,3604,4140,4157,4926,4968,6405,7114,7255,7315,7451,7560],"values":[2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,10,12,13,22,23,26,27,33,35,38,39,40,42,45,46,49,50,54,56,60,64,65,77,79,

{"value":"Somewhere, buried very deep inside this film is a half-way decent movie trying to get out. The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a graveyard) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design. Like I say, buried very deep. One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) a werewolf is, if I recall, along the lines of; \"Oh! Really?\". Not one of the better responses to said challenge. The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba the (apparently self-appointed) \"Queen of the Werewolves\". As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, Reb Brown's acting, and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits. The end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole film makes about the same amount of sense. If you happen to catch this on US television the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath. It's a sort of absurdity, cherry-on-top moment which defies satire.","finished_norm":["somewher","buri","veri","deep","insid","thi","film","be","a","halfwai","decent","movi","try","to","get","out","the","onli","trace","be","a","few","earli","scene","in","lo","angel","in","a","bar","and","a","graveyard","and","thereaft","a","coupl","of","piec","of","product","design","like","i","sai","buri","veri","deep","on","of","the","big","challeng","face","by","movi","involv","the","supernatur","be","how","to","have","charact","react","believ","in","unbeliev","situat","anni","mcenro","reaction","to","be","tell","that","her","sister","presum","dee","wallac","from","the","movi","be","be","a","werewolf","be","if","i","recal","along","the","line","of","oh","realli","not","on","of","the","well","respons","to","sai","challeng","the","non","sequitir","continu","a","the","stori","move","to","trannsylvania","in","search","of","stirba","the","appar","selfappoint","queen","of","the","werewolf","a","stirba","sybil","dan","be","the","two","well","thing","in","the","movi","ye","even","well","than","the","werewolf","groupsex","scene","reb","brown","act","and","the","oddli","simianlook","werewolf","suit","the","end","credit","have","assum","minor","legend","statu","and","be","avail","in","all","their","glori","at","littl","until","the","censor","find","them","on","youtub","check","them","out","to","see","why","and","rememb","the","whole","film","make","about","the","same","amount","of","sens","if","you","happen","to","catch","thi","on","u","televis","the","credit","have","be","reedit","to","replac","the","endlessli","repeat","shoot","of","dan","rip","off","her","top","with","anoth","endlessli","repeat","shoot","of","her","rip","open","a","cloak","onli","thi","time","she","have","some","kind","of","top","on","underneath","it","a","sort","of","absurd","cherryontop","moment","which","defi","satir"],"filtered":["somewher","buri","veri","deep","insid","thi","film","halfwai","decent","movi","try","get","onli","trace","earli","scene","lo","angel","bar","graveyard","thereaft","coupl","piec","product","design","like","sai","buri","veri","deep","big","challeng","face","movi","involv","supernatur","charact","react","believ","unbeliev","situat","anni","mcenro","reaction","tell","sister","presum","dee","wallac","movi","werewolf","recal","along","line","oh","realli","well","respons","sai","challeng","non","sequitir","continu","stori","move","trannsylvania","search","stirba","appar","selfappoint","queen","werewolf","stirba","sybil","dan","two","well","thing","movi","ye","even","well","werewolf","groupsex","scene","reb","brown","act","oddli","simianlook","werewolf","suit","end","credit","assum","minor","legend","statu","avail","glori","littl","censor","find","youtub","check","see","rememb","whole","film","make","amount","sens","happen","catch","thi","u","televis","credit","reedit","replac","endlessli","repeat","shoot","dan","rip","top","anoth","endlessli","repeat","shoot","rip","open","cloak","onli","thi","time","kind","top","underneath","sort","absurd","cherryontop","moment","defi","satir"],"filtered2":["somewher","buri","veri","deep","insid","halfwai","decent","try","get","onli","trace","earli","scene","lo","angel","bar","graveyard","thereaft","coupl","piec","product","design","like","buri","veri","deep","big","challeng","face","involv","supernatur","charact","react","believ","unbeliev","situat","anni","mcenro","reaction","tell","sister","presum","dee","wallac","werewolf","recal","along","line","oh","realli","well","respons","challeng","non","sequitir","continu","stori","move","trannsylvania","search","stirba","appar","selfappoint","queen","werewolf","stirba","sybil","dan","two","well","thing","ye","even","well","werewolf","groupsex","scene","reb","brown","act","oddli","simianlook","werewolf","suit","end","credit","assum","minor","legend","statu","avail","glori","littl","censor","find","youtub","check","see","rememb","whole","make","amount","sens","happen","catch","u","televis","credit","reedit","replac","endlessli","repeat","shoot","dan","rip","top","anoth","endlessli","repeat","shoot","rip","open","cloak","onli","time","kind","top","underneath","sort","absurd","cherryontop","moment","defi","satir"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,8,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,20,21,24,29,36,38,47,73,82,90,91,94,107,111,112,117,122,173,188,190,209,218,234,241,242,251,253,266,269,275,290,308,309,324,356,364,433,473,504,512,571,585,663,681,772,804,824,834,888,891,915,920,928,962,988,1036,1070,1089,1097,1202,1279,1336,1377,1396,1463,1469,1586,1607,1681,1700,1745,1767,1916,1955,2171,2311,2476,2482,2608,2920,3052,3108,3678,3940,4019,4445,4531,4698,4712,5398,5942,5973,6456],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2

{"value":"Ok so here's the basic plot. It is 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr Fu Manchu, a 168 year old Chinese man who has lived quite a long time. The film opens with his birthday in which he celebrates by drinking a special elixir that (even the film never mentions) prolongs his life. Well on this occasion the elixir is clumsily dropped by an assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies) and he orders his minions to then go find 6 rare items to make the elixir. This creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing museums of diamonds and venturing into London, to meet up with Dr Fu's nemisis, a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure.<br /><br />This was apparantly Sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable 'funny' roles in the Panther movies and particualrly in the movie 'The Party', is anything BUT that in this film. This film was absolute torture to sit through and I couldn't even finish it. He completly DIES and I kept cringing while watching Sellers performance.

{"value":"This remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.<br /><br />DeNiro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however he needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.<br /><br />Gregory Peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this.<br /><br />Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo's Oil but is not on the same form as \"Weeds\". Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.<br /><br />Some good points? The start credits(!), the first view of Cody's back when doing dips in the prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden's decent into full-fledged panic, Cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence.<br /><br />The worst? The \"Cleaning woman - BUT NOT REALLY!!!\" part. Clinging bare-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Are there no speed bumps in the US?) The \"He's dead - BUT NOT REALLY!!!\" partS and the aforementioned rambling ending.<br /><br />I may watch the original again, but I've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it.","finished_norm":["thi","remak","of","the","orgin","film","o","the","book","have","some","veri","good","part","to","commend","it","and","some","fine","perform","by","some","fine","actor","howev","scorses","opt","toward","the","end","for","the","much","formula","of","plot","twist","and","a","embarrassingli","overact","shakespearean","demis","that","have","me","look","at","my","watchbr","br","deniro","be","a","superb","actor","dedic","to","give","hi","all","in","the","work","he","doe","howev","he","ne","direct","to","focu","hi","talent","and","thi","be","sore","lack","in","the","last","five","minut","of","the","filmbr","br","gregori","peck","cameo","be","servic","but","noth","much","whilst","robert","michum","be","alwai","fun","to","watch","even","with","a","few","line","a","thisbr","br","nick","nolt","turn","in","a","well","perform","than","lorenzo","oil","but","be","not","on","the","same","form","a","we","joe","don","baker","have","some","great","line","while","juliett","lewi","prove","yet","again","that","talent","sometim","skip","a","generationbr","br","some","good","point","the","start","credit","the","view","of","codi","back","when","do","dip","in","the","prison","the","scene","where","codi","be","attack","with","basebal","bat","sam","bowden","decent","into","fullfledg","panic","codi","outwardli","calm","but","unnerv","prescencebr","br","the","wrong","the","clean","woman","but","not","realli","part","cling","barehand","to","the","undersid","of","a","car","for","a","hundr","mile","at","high","spe","be","there","no","spe","bump","in","the","u","the","he","dead","but","not","realli","part","and","the","aforement","rambl","endingbr","br","i","mai","watch","the","origin","again","but","i","have","yet","to","be","tempt","to","watch","the","remak","in","four","year","sinc","see","it"],"filtered":["thi","remak","orgin","film","o","book","veri","good","part","commend","fine","perform","fine","actor","howev","scorses","opt","toward","end","much","formula","plot","twist","embarrassingli","overact","shakespearean","demis","look","watchbr","br","deniro","superb","actor","dedic","give","hi","work","doe","howev","ne","direct","focu","hi","talent","thi","sore","lack","last","five","minut","filmbr","br","gregori","peck","cameo","servic","noth","much","whilst","robert","michum","alwai","fun","watch","even","line","thisbr","br","nick","nolt","turn","well","perform","lorenzo","oil","form","joe","baker","great","line","juliett","lewi","prove","yet","talent","sometim","skip","generationbr","br","good","point","start","credit","view","codi","back","dip","prison","scene","codi","attack","basebal","bat","sam","bowden","decent","fullfledg","panic","codi","outwardli","calm","unnerv","prescencebr","br","wrong","clean","woman","realli","part","cling","barehand","undersid","car","hundr","mile","high","spe","spe","bump","u","dead","realli","part","aforement","rambl","endingbr","br","mai","watch","origin","yet","tempt","watch","remak","four","year","sinc","see"],"filtered2":["remak","orgin","o","book","veri","good","part","commend","fine","perform","fine","actor","howev","scorses","opt","toward","end","formula","plot","twist","embarrassingli","overact","shakespearean","demis","look","watchbr","deniro","superb","actor","dedic","give","work","doe","howev","ne","direct","focu","talent","sore","lack","last","five","minut","filmbr","gregori","peck","cameo","servic","noth","whilst","robert","michum","alwai","fun","watch","even","line","thisbr","nick","nolt","turn","well","perform","lorenzo","oil","form","joe","baker","great","line","juliett","lewi","prove","yet","talent","sometim","skip","generationbr","good","point","start","credit","view","codi","back","dip","prison","scene","codi","attack","basebal","bat","sam","bowden","decent","fullfledg","panic","codi","outwardli","calm","unnerv","prescencebr","wrong","clean","woman","realli","part","cling","barehand","undersid","car","hundr","mile","high","spe","spe","bump","u","dead","realli","part","aforement","rambl","endingbr","mai","watch","origin","yet","tempt","watch","remak","four","year","sinc","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,13,15,16,18,19,20,24,25,30,32,41,46,48,49,51,57,59,61,63,66,69,70,71,96,102,105,107,110,112,113,144,151,162,183,194,197,211,228,259,276,284,309,312,356,435,464,483,495,500,505,539,540,563,566,606,619,690,821,852,931,994,1058,1176,1199,1206,1269,1328,1415,1433,1443,1474,1495,1533,1632,1966,2245,2360,2554,2574,2655,2726,2841,2863,2884,3184,3437,3675,3690,3855,3865,3869,3923,4046,4485,4513,4555,4573,6007,6203,6254,6942,6996,8098,8316],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"The concept of the legal gray area in Love Crimes contributes to about 10% of the movie's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to it's flagrant bad-ness. To say that Sean Young's performance as a so-called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement. With her bland suits and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them? This hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie. Watching Young go from frigid to full-frontal nudity does little to raise interest, but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does. Watching her rant and rave about her self-loathing and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rental fee, but it's all downhill to and from there. Despite her urge to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy it sure as hell can work in this. But I can't help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy Young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess. I'm guessing it does and the result is a \"thriller\" with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic.","finished_norm":["the","concept","of","the","legal","grai","area","in","love","crime","contribut","to","about","of","the","movi","appeal","the","other","can","be","attribut","to","it","flagrant","bad","to","sai","that","sean","young","perform","a","a","socal","district","attornei","be","wooden","be","a","gross","understat","with","her","bland","suit","and","superflu","hair","gel","young","doe","a","decent","job","at","convinc","the","audienc","of","her","devout","hatr","for","man","why","els","would","she","ask","her","onli","friend","to","pose","a","a","prostitut","just","so","she","can","arrest","cop","who","try","to","pick","up","on","them","thi","hatr","be","conjur","the","onli","reason","why","she","relentlessli","pursu","a","pervert","photograph","who","give","woman","a","consensu","thrill","and","the","drive","forc","behind","thi","crappi","movi","watch","young","go","from","frigid","to","fullfront","nuditi","doe","littl","to","rais","interest","but","the","temper","tantrum","she","throw","stand","next","to","a","fire","by","a","lake","doe","watch","her","rant","and","rave","about","her","selfloath","and","sexual","frustrat","make","love","crime","worth","the","rental","fee","but","it","all","downhil","to","and","from","there","despit","her","urg","to","bring","patrick","bergin","charact","to","justic","her","polic","skill","complet","escap","her","in","the","throe","of","her","own","tire","lust","and","passion","patrick","bergin","doe","a","decent","enough","job","a","a","slimi","sociopath","if","it","work","in","sleep","with","the","enemi","it","sure","a","hell","can","work","in","thi","but","i","ca","not","help","but","wonder","if","the","notic","lack","of","energi","young","bring","to","the","film","conflict","with","hi","slimi","i","be","guess","it","doe","and","the","result","be","a","thriller","with","thrill","that","be","thoroughli","bad","and","yet","comed"],"filtered":["concept","legal","grai","area","love","crime","contribut","movi","appeal","attribut","flagrant","bad","sai","sean","young","perform","socal","district","attornei","wooden","gross","understat","bland","suit","superflu","hair","gel","young","doe","decent","job","convinc","audienc","devout","hatr","man","els","ask","onli","friend","pose","prostitut","arrest","cop","try","pick","thi","hatr","conjur","onli","reason","relentlessli","pursu","pervert","photograph","give","woman","consensu","thrill","drive","forc","behind","thi","crappi","movi","watch","young","go","frigid","fullfront","nuditi","doe","littl","rais","interest","temper","tantrum","throw","stand","next","fire","lake","doe","watch","rant","rave","selfloath","sexual","frustrat","make","love","crime","worth","rental","fee","downhil","despit","urg","bring","patrick","bergin","charact","justic","polic","skill","complet","escap","throe","tire","lust","passion","patrick","bergin","doe","decent","enough","job","slimi","sociopath","work","sleep","enemi","sure","hell","work","thi","ca","help","wonder","notic","lack","energi","young","bring","film","conflict","hi","slimi","guess","doe","result","thriller","thrill","thoroughli","bad","yet","comed"],"filtered2":["concept","legal","grai","area","love","crime","contribut","appeal","attribut","flagrant","bad","sean","young","perform","socal","district","attornei","wooden","gross","understat","bland","suit","superflu","hair","gel","young","doe","decent","job","convinc","audienc","devout","hatr","man","els","ask","onli","friend","pose","prostitut","arrest","cop","try","pick","hatr","conjur","onli","reason","relentlessli","pursu","pervert","photograph","give","woman","consensu","thrill","drive","forc","behind","crappi","watch","young","go","frigid","fullfront","nuditi","doe","littl","rais","interest","temper","tantrum","throw","stand","next","fire","lake","doe","watch","rant","rave","selfloath","sexual","frustrat","make","love","crime","worth","rental","fee","downhil","despit","urg","bring","patrick","bergin","charact","justic","polic","skill","complet","escap","throe","tire","lust","passion","patrick","bergin","doe","decent","enough","job","slimi","sociopath","work","sleep","enemi","sure","hell","work","ca","help","wonder","notic","lack","energi","young","bring","conflict","slimi","guess","doe","result","thriller","thrill","thoroughli","bad","yet","comed"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,7,9,10,11,14,18,30,36,39,45,48,54,60,70,81,93,95,103,105,119,135,161,168,175,183,185,194,196,219,243,250,289,297,306,309,310,338,377,391,393,394,446,447,461,471,476,478,519,551,612,638,688,689,714,726,732,753,813,888,890,900,976,1028,1045,1077,1156,1218,1313,1331,1365,1373,1426,1437,1457,1458,1504,1564,1590,1655,1683,1785,1895,1938,1994,2153,2198,2217,2463,2505,2511,2526,2596,2811,3002,3093,3433,3457,3506,3990,4784,4791,5070,5076,5643,6002,6638,7807,8228],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute)...or is that cliché piled upon cliché. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, I can understand

{"value":"\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\" (1981) is, simply put, the worst movie ever made, far lamer than even the inept \"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\"<br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre, but each one landing at our feet with a sickening thud. There is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes, and no discernible story lines.<br /><br />Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There's none of that here.<br /><br />Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. But no such luck. As we've said, this film has no redeeming values. It is sickening all the way to the final fade-out -- which, perversely, is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going, and wanted to make the least of it.","finished_norm":["nation","lampoon","go","to","the","movi","be","simpli","put","the","wrong","movi","ever","make","far","lame","than","even","the","inept","plan","from","outer","spacebr","br","the","lampoon","film","be","tell","in","three","segment","each","on","supposedli","a","spoof","of","a","convent","movi","genr","but","each","on","land","at","our","foot","with","a","sicken","thud","there","be","no","rhym","or","reason","for","thi","execr","vignett","and","no","discern","stori","linesbr","br","anoth","review","on","thi","site","have","write","that","the","onli","good","point","about","the","film","be","the","nude","scene","true","miss","ganzel","and","dusenberri","do","flash","a","bite","of","flesh","and","veri","nice","it","be","too","but","the","director","seem","not","to","realiz","that","even","ta","ne","a","good","stori","to","surround","it","there","none","of","that","herebr","br","probabl","the","wrong","of","the","three","segment","be","the","last","on","featur","robbi","benson","and","richard","widmark","here","we","see","benson","a","a","young","eagerbeav","policeman","be","pair","with","a","cynic","oldtim","plai","by","widmark","and","for","just","a","moment","that","of","u","who","be","still","watch","thi","odiou","cinemat","exercis","be","hearten","by","the","think","that","we","be","about","to","see","a","redempt","tale","about","how","the","young","idealist","cop","bring","about","a","purifi","chang","in","the","oldtim","approach","to","polic","work","but","no","such","luck","a","we","have","sai","thi","film","have","no","redeem","valu","it","be","sicken","all","the","wai","to","the","final","fadeout","which","pervers","be","stretch","out","long","than","it","should","last","on","the","screen","appar","the","film","maker","know","thei","have","a","bad","thing","go","and","want","to","make","the","littl","of","it"],"filtered":["nation","lampoon","go","movi","simpli","put","wrong","movi","ever","make","far","lame","even","inept","plan","outer","spacebr","br","lampoon","film","tell","three","segment","supposedli","spoof","convent","movi","genr","land","foot","sicken","thud","rhym","reason","thi","execr","vignett","discern","stori","linesbr","br","anoth","review","thi","site","write","onli","good","point","film","nude","scene","true","miss","ganzel","dusenberri","flash","bite","flesh","veri","nice","director","seem","realiz","even","ta","ne","good","stori","surround","none","herebr","br","probabl","wrong","three","segment","last","featur","robbi","benson","richard","widmark","see","benson","young","eagerbeav","policeman","pair","cynic","oldtim","plai","widmark","moment","u","still","watch","thi","odiou","cinemat","exercis","hearten","think","see","redempt","tale","young","idealist","cop","bring","purifi","chang","oldtim","approach","polic","work","luck","sai","thi","film","redeem","valu","sicken","wai","final","fadeout","pervers","stretch","long","last","screen","appar","film","maker","know","thei","bad","thing","go","want","make","littl"],"filtered2":["nation","lampoon","go","simpli","put","wrong","ever","make","far","lame","even","inept","plan","outer","spacebr","lampoon","tell","three","segment","supposedli","spoof","convent","genr","land","foot","sicken","thud","rhym","reason","execr","vignett","discern","stori","linesbr","anoth","review","site","write","onli","good","point","nude","scene","true","miss","ganzel","dusenberri","flash","bite","flesh","veri","nice","director","seem","realiz","even","ta","ne","good","stori","surround","none","herebr","probabl","wrong","three","segment","last","featur","robbi","benson","richard","widmark","see","benson","young","eagerbeav","policeman","pair","cynic","oldtim","plai","widmark","moment","u","still","watch","odiou","cinemat","exercis","hearten","think","see","redempt","tale","young","idealist","cop","bring","purifi","chang","oldtim","approach","polic","work","luck","redeem","valu","sicken","wai","final","fadeout","pervers","stretch","long","last","screen","appar","maker","know","bad","thing","go","want","make","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,14,15,17,19,25,26,29,33,35,37,40,44,48,58,64,65,66,73,90,95,99,101,110,112,135,144,148,154,156,159,176,188,192,201,224,250,255,262,278,304,305,308,370,372,405,451,467,471,476,581,634,641,762,820,870,946,981,1055,1079,1093,1220,1275,1344,1414,1442,1455,1510,1532,1548,1728,1794,1867,1873,2082,2150,2481,2835,2881,3071,3253,3338,3353,3388,3738,4545,4676,4723,4956,5458,5947,6325,7919],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,14,15,17,19

{"value":"This is a typical late Universal Horror flick: its technically comptent, if by the numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. The most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the film's \"monster\". Its sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped, as I more often felt pity over fear or even loathing. Martin Koslack is on board as the film's mad artist, and he is very amusing in this part. I for one enjoy seeing Koslack in just about anything; for some reason the man amuses me. The only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd take on the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the film's male \"hero\" who is an \"artist\" who paints...get this...pin up girls. Somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villan's absurdist sculpture. Also amusing is the film's chief nasty critic, who at one point claims that he despises the hero's pin up art because \"women like that don't exist\" to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesn't get out enough. Finally, there's a bit of a subplot about the heroine's (who is an art critic herself) domestication by the leading man....completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. Overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","typic","late","univers","horror","flick","it","technic","comptent","if","by","the","number","with","a","cooki","cutter","plot","and","some","seriou","overact","the","much","interest","part","of","thi","film","be","it","stunt","cast","of","rondo","hatton","a","man","with","a","bone","diseas","a","the","film","monster","it","sad","to","see","thi","man","exploit","but","he","probabl","make","good","us","of","the","monei","thei","pai","him","hatton","be","littl","horrifi","than","the","studio","hope","a","i","much","often","feel","piti","over","fear","or","even","loath","martin","koslack","be","on","board","a","the","film","mad","artist","and","he","be","veri","amus","in","thi","part","i","for","on","enjoi","see","koslack","in","just","about","anyth","for","some","reason","the","man","amus","me","the","onli","other","part","of","the","film","that","entertain","me","be","the","film","absurd","take","on","the","art","world","here","we","be","show","evil","art","critic","who","revel","in","their","abil","to","break","artist","thi","be","side","by","side","with","the","film","male","hero","who","be","a","artist","who","paintsget","thispin","up","girl","somehow","our","hero","work","be","review","side","by","side","with","the","villan","absurdist","sculptur","conjur","amus","be","the","film","chief","nasti","critic","who","at","on","point","claim","that","he","despis","the","hero","pin","up","art","becaus","woman","like","that","do","not","exist","to","which","our","heroin","repli","with","a","assur","that","the","critic","just","doe","not","get","out","enough","final","there","a","bite","of","a","subplot","about","the","heroin","who","be","a","art","critic","herself","domest","by","the","lead","mancomplet","antifeminist","and","ridicul","to","wit","overal","thi","film","be","a","rather","mediocr","pictur","with","a","few","amus","elem"],"filtered":["thi","typic","late","univers","horror","flick","technic","comptent","number","cooki","cutter","plot","seriou","overact","much","interest","part","thi","film","stunt","cast","rondo","hatton","man","bone","diseas","film","monster","sad","see","thi","man","exploit","probabl","make","good","us","monei","thei","pai","hatton","littl","horrifi","studio","hope","much","often","feel","piti","fear","even","loath","martin","koslack","board","film","mad","artist","veri","amus","thi","part","enjoi","see","koslack","anyth","reason","man","amus","onli","part","film","entertain","film","absurd","take","art","world","show","evil","art","critic","revel","abil","break","artist","thi","side","side","film","male","hero","artist","paintsget","thispin","girl","somehow","hero","work","review","side","side","villan","absurdist","sculptur","conjur","amus","film","chief","nasti","critic","point","claim","despis","hero","pin","art","becaus","woman","like","exist","heroin","repli","assur","critic","doe","get","enough","final","bite","subplot","heroin","art","critic","domest","lead","mancomplet","antifeminist","ridicul","wit","overal","thi","film","rather","mediocr","pictur","amus","elem"],"filtered2":["typic","late","univers","horror","flick","technic","comptent","number","cooki","cutter","plot","seriou","overact","interest","part","stunt","cast","rondo","hatton","man","bone","diseas","monster","sad","see","man","exploit","probabl","make","good","us","monei","pai","hatton","littl","horrifi","studio","hope","often","feel","piti","fear","even","loath","martin","koslack","board","mad","artist","veri","amus","part","enjoi","see","koslack","anyth","reason","man","amus","onli","part","entertain","absurd","take","art","world","show","evil","art","critic","revel","abil","break","artist","side","side","male","hero","artist","paintsget","thispin","girl","somehow","hero","work","review","side","side","villan","absurdist","sculptur","conjur","amus","chief","nasti","critic","point","claim","despis","hero","pin","art","becaus","woman","like","exist","heroin","repli","assur","critic","doe","get","enough","final","bite","subplot","heroin","art","critic","domest","lead","mancomplet","antifeminist","ridicul","wit","overal","rather","mediocr","pictur","amus","elem"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,11,14,15,18,22,28,31,32,39,43,45,48,56,60,61,66,70,83,84,92,93,95,104,126,148,150,154,156,157,160,165,176,181,195,200,257,274,311,321,322,360,375,382,400,412,413,425,455,479,493,528,549,579,613,649,708,724,751,787,812,831,847,851,913,918,928,932,944,1052,1232,1266,1308,1333,1383,1409,1415,1546,2094,2119,2416,2563,2607,3031,3125,3500,3867,4137,4224,4592,7003],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatur

{"value":"I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure. A horrible joke of a film, I cringed throughout. Terrible, trite, distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths.<br /><br />The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film. However, he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded they stop using his name as a source (it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved).<br /><br />One scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is not one source for this. Hitler loved animals above people. He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal experimentation. He was also a vegetarian.<br /><br />The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce, involving bribery. Utter lies. He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time.<br /><br />There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one.<br /><br />Apart from these, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick.<br /><br />If he was even half as ignorant, demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed. Never mind become the leader of Germany.<br /><br />Honestly, this film was utterly terrible.<br /><br />Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide

{"value":"What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis.<br /><br />You gather a bunch of your friends at home, all hyped about the follow up work of Sean Ellis. You have an vague idea of the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations.<br /><br />It is late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type.<br /><br />15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up, at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches. Over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day.<br /><br />A few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this, in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images. Any other stuff I would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy. But that legacy can only carry you so long, this is a new level of boring movie-making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions, this is what it is.<br /><br />Decent cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either. There are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time.<br /><br />Final words, stay away.","finished_norm":["what","a","incred","fall","for","sean","ellisbr","br","you","gather","a","bunch","of","your","friend","at","home","all","hyp","about","the","follow","up","work","of","sean","elli","you","have","a","vagu","idea","of","the","plot","no","spoiler","that","can","kill","the","fun","veri","high","expectationsbr","br","it","be","late","at","night","perfect","atmospher","for","a","movi","of","thi","typebr","br","minut","pass","and","you","start","tell","yourself","it","be","bind","to","pick","up","at","min","you","start","wonder","if","you","should","just","go","to","sleep","and","save","thi","for","anoth","time","when","you","can","fulli","appreci","the","expect","not","exist","subtl","touch","over","the","half","hour","mark","you","realiz","half","of","your","your","hyp","up","audienc","be","alreadi","asleep","and","call","it","a","daybr","br","a","few","dai","late","when","you","exhaust","all","other","materi","to","watch","you","go","back","to","thi","in","the","middl","of","the","dai","thi","time","hope","your","mood","will","keep","you","awak","thi","time","minut","late","you","find","yourself","fastforward","the","unbeliev","and","needlessli","long","intermedi","transit","and","imag","ani","other","stuff","i","would","have","give","up","alreadi","but","there","be","cashback","and","it","legaci","but","that","legaci","can","onli","carri","you","so","long","thi","be","a","new","level","of","bore","moviemak","imagin","a","short","stori","extend","to","a","novel","with","just","descript","thi","be","what","it","isbr","br","decent","cast","be","wast","there","be","no","cinematographi","that","leav","you","in","aw","like","cashback","either","there","be","film","that","annoi","you","there","be","film","that","lack","certain","aspect","or","just","cheesi","unfortun","thi","be","just","a","wast","of","timebr","br","final","word","stai","awai"],"filtered":["incred","fall","sean","ellisbr","br","gather","bunch","friend","home","hyp","follow","work","sean","elli","vagu","idea","plot","spoiler","kill","fun","veri","high","expectationsbr","br","late","night","perfect","atmospher","movi","thi","typebr","br","minut","pass","start","tell","bind","pick","min","start","wonder","go","sleep","save","thi","anoth","time","fulli","appreci","expect","exist","subtl","touch","half","hour","mark","realiz","half","hyp","audienc","alreadi","asleep","call","daybr","br","dai","late","exhaust","materi","watch","go","back","thi","middl","dai","thi","time","hope","mood","keep","awak","thi","time","minut","late","find","fastforward","unbeliev","needlessli","long","intermedi","transit","imag","ani","stuff","give","alreadi","cashback","legaci","legaci","onli","carri","long","thi","new","level","bore","moviemak","imagin","short","stori","extend","novel","descript","thi","isbr","br","decent","cast","wast","cinematographi","leav","aw","like","cashback","either","film","annoi","film","lack","certain","aspect","cheesi","unfortun","thi","wast","timebr","br","final","word","stai","awai"],"filtered2":["incred","fall","sean","ellisbr","gather","bunch","friend","home","hyp","follow","work","sean","elli","vagu","idea","plot","spoiler","kill","fun","veri","high","expectationsbr","late","night","perfect","atmospher","typebr","minut","pass","start","tell","bind","pick","min","start","wonder","go","sleep","save","anoth","time","fulli","appreci","expect","exist","subtl","touch","half","hour","mark","realiz","half","hyp","audienc","alreadi","asleep","call","daybr","dai","late","exhaust","materi","watch","go","back","middl","dai","time","hope","mood","keep","awak","time","minut","late","find","fastforward","unbeliev","needlessli","long","intermedi","transit","imag","ani","stuff","give","alreadi","cashback","legaci","legaci","onli","carri","long","new","level","bore","moviemak","imagin","short","stori","extend","novel","descript","isbr","decent","cast","wast","cinematographi","leav","aw","like","cashback","either","annoi","lack","certain","aspect","cheesi","unfortun","wast","timebr","final","word","stai","awai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,8,11,15,17,27,30,32,38,48,59,63,71,73,74,76,87,89,90,92,99,108,123,130,132,134,138,142,150,155,156,161,168,170,174,175,181,183,189,206,207,210,211,227,258,259,260,271,272,302,309,330,340,361,365,405,419,445,446,474,487,490,528,537,543,554,571,621,629,645,677,717,732,740,745,774,835,961,1129,1250,1346,1366,1418,1457,1507,1600,1825,1932,2006,2068,2158,2204,2430,2972,2995,3258,3859,4048,4136,4564,4992,6183],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,8,11,1

{"value":"The comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the American style - awkward, stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so poor, that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted (as you'll remember, the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in Umbrellas). The translation of the French (for subtitled versions), as well, leaves something to be desired, although this can't be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting, such as references in songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well, the tight pants/white boots combination, and the freakishly unnatural colors, reminds one of an Austin Powers film . . .<br /><br />But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; note, for instance, the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg. Also, note the \"Convenient Brunette of Resolution\" - Madeleine in Umbrellas, and Josette in Young Girls.<br /><br />Generally speaking, those expecting the natural feel of Umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene), or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script, should probably pass this one b y. Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be quite
