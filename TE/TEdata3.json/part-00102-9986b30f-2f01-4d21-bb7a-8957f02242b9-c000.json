{"value":"This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVD's was absolutely horrible. The levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVD's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you understand neither. Ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. Before you fork out $50+ for this movie on DVD for your own library, I'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","a","commentari","on","the","actual","movi","but","on","the","ruscico","dvd","releas","for","north","america","i","do","not","know","if","there","have","be","differ","releas","and","updat","but","the","disk","we","rent","have","a","copyright","on","them","if","that","mean","anyth","anywai","the","sound","mix","on","thi","dvd","be","absolut","horribl","the","level","often","yoyo","up","and","down","when","the","scene","cut","to","a","battlefield","panorama","the","orchestr","track","would","thunder","so","loudli","that","i","do","not","know","which","would","blow","out","my","eardrum","or","my","speaker","when","it","be","time","for","dialog","the","volum","would","usual","drop","to","someth","bare","audibl","occasion","the","orchestra","and","foleywork","would","stai","loud","while","the","dialog","be","superimpos","at","a","much","lesser","level","my","wife","and","i","find","that","the","onli","wai","we","can","watch","thi","movi","at","all","from","thi","dvd","be","if","on","of","u","keep","a","hand","on","the","remot","to","continu","modul","the","volum","and","like","anoth","user","have","alreadi","comment","when","we","select","english","audio","the","dialog","keep","switch","back","and","forth","between","russian","and","english","and","occasion","when","the","charact","speak","in","french","on","the","nativ","track","the","dub","be","in","russian","so","you","re","sol","if","you","understand","neither","ultim","we","give","up","watch","after","the","disk","befor","you","fork","out","+","for","thi","movi","on","dvd","for","your","own","librari","i","have","heartili","recommend","get","your","hand","on","a","rental","copi","to","see","whether","you","can","realli","enjoi","thi","epic","flick","when","burden","by","such","bad","sound","particularli","if","you","have","never","read","the","book","and","realli","want","to","understand","the","storylin"],"filtered":["thi","commentari","actual","movi","ruscico","dvd","releas","north","america","know","differ","releas","updat","disk","rent","copyright","mean","anyth","anywai","sound","mix","thi","dvd","absolut","horribl","level","often","yoyo","scene","cut","battlefield","panorama","orchestr","track","thunder","loudli","know","blow","eardrum","speaker","time","dialog","volum","usual","drop","someth","bare","audibl","occasion","orchestra","foleywork","stai","loud","dialog","superimpos","much","lesser","level","wife","find","onli","wai","watch","thi","movi","thi","dvd","u","keep","hand","remot","continu","modul","volum","like","anoth","user","alreadi","comment","select","english","audio","dialog","keep","switch","back","forth","russian","english","occasion","charact","speak","french","nativ","track","dub","russian","re","sol","understand","neither","ultim","give","watch","disk","befor","fork","+","thi","movi","dvd","librari","heartili","recommend","get","hand","rental","copi","see","whether","realli","enjoi","thi","epic","flick","burden","bad","sound","particularli","never","read","book","realli","want","understand","storylin"],"filtered2":["commentari","actual","ruscico","dvd","releas","north","america","know","differ","releas","updat","disk","rent","copyright","mean","anyth","anywai","sound","mix","dvd","absolut","horribl","level","often","yoyo","scene","cut","battlefield","panorama","orchestr","track","thunder","loudli","know","blow","eardrum","speaker","time","dialog","volum","usual","drop","someth","bare","audibl","occasion","orchestra","foleywork","stai","loud","dialog","superimpos","lesser","level","wife","find","onli","wai","watch","dvd","u","keep","hand","remot","continu","modul","volum","like","anoth","user","alreadi","comment","select","english","audio","dialog","keep","switch","back","forth","russian","english","occasion","charact","speak","french","nativ","track","dub","russian","re","sol","understand","neither","ultim","give","watch","disk","befor","fork","+","dvd","librari","heartili","recommend","get","hand","rental","copi","see","whether","realli","enjoi","epic","flick","burden","bad","sound","particularli","never","read","book","realli","want","understand","storylin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,9,10,11,13,19,26,30,33,37,38,42,52,53,63,68,73,79,88,104,112,134,145,151,178,200,204,212,222,230,235,247,257,263,265,280,298,303,327,330,344,365,386,400,432,433,445,497,515,588,589,597,661,718,735,747,754,783,809,867,883,899,904,949,956,1099,1234,1364,1459,1504,1567,1579,1622,2064,2088,2161,2332,2559,2739,2902,3040,3501,4340,4829,5219,5469,5743,6561,6669,6856,7058,7429,7700,8353,8493],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"Having heard so many people raving about this film I thought I'd give it a go. Apart from being incredibly slow, which I don't mind as long as the wait is worth it, but it just isn't. As many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn't ring true. The reaction of the 4 men switches from shock, horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish. Surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing, then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip....why on earth tie the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously? Its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the townsfolk, well you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except for the knickers....what scenario leads to that? If she was raped then why still the knickers? If she was raped with the clothes on, then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers? If she wasn't raped, then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers....leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of? I truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall! Oh well its watchable but only just and only because, despite the poor script, the acting is

{"value":"Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are a supposedly hot item in this death trip; a luxury 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub-slash-hotel there's even a blind piano player who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b!$3& who'll do anything to get attention from henpecked husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and, later, the rest of the people on board.<br /><br />Memorable Moments: Boeing 747 doing a belly flop in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen getting her chops busted when she goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become 'ball bearings' in a sinking 'pinball machine.'<br /><br />The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but not much goes on in between. Hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel, but I forget the reason why not He would've done wonders for the 1970 original, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('77 also got inspiration from `The Flight of the Phoenix'). <br /><br />Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite from their days on `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte' (apparently here they are not playing heavies, just reunited Autumn Years' lovers). And isn't the actress playing Emily's companion the same one who played the hammered-to-death maid on `Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'<br /><br />TV actors include the girlfriend from `Mayberry RFD'

{"value":"Effort aside (This isn't a review about good intentions, its about the final product), this film is poorly written, overacted, and poorly directed. The story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film.<br /><br />Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us. You would never know that from this film of the lead actress's performance. In fact apply that to every character in the film, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot. In fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting, and I realized thats because she's making a speech! Every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she'll start pontificating about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white flags, etc. As played in the film, there's no WAY she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds.<br /><br />IN conclusion, this film robs Clara Barton of her struggles. It robs her of her humanity, and it inherently cheapens all she did because the script is written in clichés. The writer doesn't know Clara Barton, and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia Britannica article. (yes they had those back then) But hey, nice Technicolor!

{"value":"Ok first of all, this movie sucks. But lets examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing. But that's as far as they take this premise. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine, they break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibilty of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, ie.. the invisible man. But no.. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together, and trys to transport himself. Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary, (duh). Which wouldn't happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him money. Wah. Then to make the movie worse, throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left. This movie tried so I give it an honest 2 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine, making Lembach leave, making him try it again.

{"value":"I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride', and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends. It's fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...<br /><br />Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed up. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories -- to a man. Because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them.<br /><br />I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadn't read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. It's the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst.

{"value":"I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to \"Fabio on the beach\" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn't even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn't recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right).","finished_norm":["i","have","the","great","enthusiasm","go","in","to","the","advanc","screen","for","thi","movi","after","all","thi","be","on","of","the","old","and","much","complex","tale","know","to","mankind","and","it","be","on","of","the","epic","tale","i","read","a","a","kid","even","befor","tolkien","i","must","sai","that","it","be","a","huge","disappoint","thei","complet","make","the","plot","into","a","joke","and","turn","the","thing","into","on","long","soap","opu","the","elem","that","be","faith","to","the","plot","be","sprinkl","throughout","in","such","a","haphazard","manner","that","the","audienc","be","laugh","at","mani","time","at","the","silli","script","that","just","pai","lip","servic","to","thi","battl","of","all","battl","it","be","a","huge","disappoint","to","see","a","complex","charact","like","achil","who","have","a","strang","combin","of","nearli","matrixlik","power","utter","ruthless","and","male","lover","in","the","origin","poem","turn","to","fabio","on","the","beach","in","the","guis","of","pitt","who","with","a","good","script","and","much","effort","can","have","turn","thi","into","the","much","complex","and","origin","warrior","figur","hollywood","have","ever","produc","the","actor","be","actual","decent","try","to","make","the","well","of","a","ridicul","script","it","be","actual","a","wast","of","so","much","talent","peter","o","tool","steal","the","show","and","orlando","bloom","and","sean","bean","be","pathet","compar","it","to","lotr","or","gladiat","and","it","doe","not","even","hold","a","candl","to","them","plenti","of","hunk","for","the","ladi","to","goggl","over","but","not","enough","battl","scene","for","a","movi","that","be","about","on","long","battl","and","sieg","i","would","not","recommend","that","anyon","pai","to","see","thi","stori","drag","through","the","dirt","like","on","of","the","charact","be","at","littl","thei","get","that","part","right"],"filtered":["great","enthusiasm","go","advanc","screen","thi","movi","thi","old","much","complex","tale","know","mankind","epic","tale","read","kid","even","befor","tolkien","must","sai","huge","disappoint","thei","complet","make","plot","joke","turn","thing","long","soap","opu","elem","faith","plot","sprinkl","throughout","haphazard","manner","audienc","laugh","mani","time","silli","script","pai","lip","servic","thi","battl","battl","huge","disappoint","see","complex","charact","like","achil","strang","combin","nearli","matrixlik","power","utter","ruthless","male","lover","origin","poem","turn","fabio","beach","guis","pitt","good","script","much","effort","turn","thi","much","complex","origin","warrior","figur","hollywood","ever","produc","actor","actual","decent","try","make","well","ridicul","script","actual","wast","much","talent","peter","o","tool","steal","show","orlando","bloom","sean","bean","pathet","compar","lotr","gladiat","doe","even","hold","candl","plenti","hunk","ladi","goggl","enough","battl","scene","movi","long","battl","sieg","recommend","anyon","pai","see","thi","stori","drag","dirt","like","charact","littl","thei","get","part","right"],"filtered2":["great","enthusiasm","go","advanc","screen","old","complex","tale","know","mankind","epic","tale","read","kid","even","befor","tolkien","must","huge","disappoint","complet","make","plot","joke","turn","thing","long","soap","opu","elem","faith","plot","sprinkl","throughout","haphazard","manner","audienc","laugh","mani","time","silli","script","pai","lip","servic","battl","battl","huge","disappoint","see","complex","charact","like","achil","strang","combin","nearli","matrixlik","power","utter","ruthless","male","lover","origin","poem","turn","fabio","beach","guis","pitt","good","script","effort","turn","complex","origin","warrior","figur","hollywood","ever","produc","actor","actual","decent","try","make","well","ridicul","script","actual","wast","talent","peter","o","tool","steal","show","orlando","bloom","sean","bean","pathet","compar","lotr","gladiat","doe","even","hold","candl","plenti","hunk","ladi","goggl","enough","battl","scene","long","battl","sieg","recommend","anyon","pai","see","stori","drag","dirt","like","charact","littl","get","part","right"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,14,17,18,19,20,26,28,29,32,36,41,44,50,51,52,61,67,69,77,79,89,93,96,99,103,114,121,133,141,145,158,168,187,192,214,261,274,276,298,300,309,322,366,385,401,414,415,417,438,444,472,479,482,578,601,611,649,760,764,786,820,887,954,968,994,1024,1046,1072,1200,1343,1457,1470,1567,1632,1763,1775,1874,2437,2565,3522,3555,3847,4140,4324,4429,5052,5099,5351,5452,5499,5619,5699,5932,6109,7383,7893],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a grade B blend of pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family has been murdered and she was, in at least one case, the prime suspect), or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is her new room mate, and most of the action centers on him.<br /><br />Newbern's character is pretty sympathetic, and both he and Barrymore do decent work (though not exactly good). The mediocre to (at times) totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion. Leslie Hope's character is memorable, but so irritating that you will want to forget her.<br /><br />The plot eventually disintegrates into a bifurcated (one story arc is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) outlandish climax which is so badly conceived, acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of what value the film had achieved previously.<br /><br />Overall, the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first undergraduate film class. The acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them - at least until the film derails utterly and completely.<br /><br />My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid a first-person encounter.","finished_norm":["doppelgang","have","it","moment","but","thei","be","few","and","far","betweenbr","br","essenti","thi","be","a","grade","b","blend","of","poppsych","thriller","ghost","stori","and","horror","draw","barrymor","plai","a","young","woman","who","be","haunt","by","the","demon","of","her","past","much","of","her","famili","have","be","murder","and","she","be","in","at","littl","on","case","the","prime","suspect","or","doe","she","just","have","a","realli","bad","case","of","multipl","person","disord","georg","newbern","be","her","new","room","mate","and","much","of","the","action","center","on","himbr","br","newbern","charact","be","pretti","sympathet","and","both","he","and","barrymor","do","decent","work","though","not","exactli","good","the","mediocr","to","at","time","total","horrend","script","and","the","unimpress","direct","seem","to","have","combin","to","sink","the","rest","of","the","perform","into","oblivion","lesli","hope","charact","be","memor","but","so","irrit","that","you","will","want","to","forget","herbr","br","the","plot","eventu","disintegr","into","a","bifurc","on","stori","arc","be","psycholog","realism","the","other","be","supernatur","horror","outlandish","climax","which","be","so","badli","conceiv","act","and","photograph","that","it","effect","counteract","much","of","what","valu","the","film","have","achiev","previouslybr","br","overal","the","film","have","the","feel","of","what","mai","expect","to","be","the","result","of","be","knight","shamalyan","undergradu","film","class","the","act","and","script","for","the","two","lead","be","just","good","enough","to","make","you","care","a","littl","about","them","at","littl","until","the","film","derail","utterli","and","completelybr","br","my","recommend","send","your","doppelgang","but","avoid","a","firstperson","encount"],"filtered":["doppelgang","moment","thei","far","betweenbr","br","essenti","thi","grade","b","blend","poppsych","thriller","ghost","stori","horror","draw","barrymor","plai","young","woman","haunt","demon","past","much","famili","murder","littl","case","prime","suspect","doe","realli","bad","case","multipl","person","disord","georg","newbern","new","room","mate","much","action","center","himbr","br","newbern","charact","pretti","sympathet","barrymor","decent","work","though","exactli","good","mediocr","time","total","horrend","script","unimpress","direct","seem","combin","sink","rest","perform","oblivion","lesli","hope","charact","memor","irrit","want","forget","herbr","br","plot","eventu","disintegr","bifurc","stori","arc","psycholog","realism","supernatur","horror","outlandish","climax","badli","conceiv","act","photograph","effect","counteract","much","valu","film","achiev","previouslybr","br","overal","film","feel","mai","expect","result","knight","shamalyan","undergradu","film","class","act","script","two","lead","good","enough","make","care","littl","littl","film","derail","utterli","completelybr","br","recommend","send","doppelgang","avoid","firstperson","encount"],"filtered2":["doppelgang","moment","far","betweenbr","essenti","grade","b","blend","poppsych","thriller","ghost","stori","horror","draw","barrymor","plai","young","woman","haunt","demon","past","famili","murder","littl","case","prime","suspect","doe","realli","bad","case","multipl","person","disord","georg","newbern","new","room","mate","action","center","himbr","newbern","charact","pretti","sympathet","barrymor","decent","work","though","exactli","good","mediocr","time","total","horrend","script","unimpress","direct","seem","combin","sink","rest","perform","oblivion","lesli","hope","charact","memor","irrit","want","forget","herbr","plot","eventu","disintegr","bifurc","stori","arc","psycholog","realism","supernatur","horror","outlandish","climax","badli","conceiv","act","photograph","effect","counteract","valu","achiev","previouslybr","overal","feel","mai","expect","result","knight","shamalyan","undergradu","class","act","script","two","lead","good","enough","make","care","littl","littl","derail","utterli","completelybr","recommend","send","doppelgang","avoid","firstperson","encount"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,10,13,14,17,18,21,32,35,37,40,43,46,47,48,70,77,78,83,86,87,93,101,102,105,106,129,130,135,153,157,181,182,184,188,205,226,273,288,298,309,335,373,412,440,447,448,451,462,513,576,628,642,680,714,716,721,727,787,816,938,959,968,977,1073,1074,1137,1164,1197,1262,1288,1313,1315,1357,1686,1848,1909,1916,2054,2073,2129,2191,2233,2279,2691,2745,3171,3344,3749,3815,4097,4157,5044,5842,7358],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{

{"value":"I saw and liked the first two a lot, really. Especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. And it's a story standing alone. You don't have to know the first movie. I liked that in the \"Free Willy\" movies, too.<br /><br />But... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. But what for? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. But what for? I'd really like to know. You know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes after is mostly unnecessary. I guess many people liked Timon and Pumba, and so do I really. Yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. No chance, most of it wasn't funny at all, at least for me. Btw. what was the movie about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I'm very disappointed about it.<br /><br />If you like to see stories like: \"the story behind xy\", you should see \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman.

{"value":"...thankfully he hasn't, yet! This is crude, simplistic student politics made into drama. It needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits. Conceit 1: That a British electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left. Conceit 2: That all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new Prime Minister's only critics are sinister civil servants, MI5, big business and the Americans (naturally). Conceit 3: That this radical socialist PM can solve all union, economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation. Conceit 4: That severing all ties with the US and NATO is a good thing. Conceit 5: That the Soviet Union isn't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80's. And finally, Conceit 6: That the reactionary forces of the US would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against Britain.<br /><br />It's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti-Thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing TV critics singing its praises. When it was made, television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience. Ray McInally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points.

{"value":"I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh*t, but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p*ss poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a hotel room home video. Talking of home videos, since when has it been fair game to release them as films - I mean to say, films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame-o ideas together for the weekend, lavish the production with an £8.00 budget, and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then slap it on the shelves, for some poor sap (me), to take home in lonely desperation. But here's the clincher - I fast forwarded through most of this, and tossed it to one side, ready for the hammers... until the next night, while watching a Darren Day horror 'Hellbreed' (£1.99 to take home and keep from a different Blockbuster). Now this film made 'Grim Weekend' look like The Exorcist, so I slapped Grim Weekend back on, to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful IMDb boards, that viewers claimed were hilarious. Sure enough, once I had got over the misery, the pain, and the horror, of realising Grim Weekend was utter chod on toast, I could enjoy, savour, and downright get down to the funny stuff.

{"value":"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /><br />Recap: Mia (Helin) is returning home from capital Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved a town away. Mia is still single and is focused on her career. There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle. As the party goes on (and alcohol consumed), more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise...<br /><br />Comments: To be the work of a new writer/director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedy/dramas has been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This movie draws upon three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves. 2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety. This move has the focus on the last one, almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. No loss though, since the humor that is there is not funny. The performances from the cast are good I guess, though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this.<br /><br

{"value":"This mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations. SOTD falls somewhere between \"Kung-Fu\" and \"H R Pufnstuff\" on the entertainment spectrum. If it weren't so long (nearly 3 hours) I think that kids would like it quite a bit. It's got adventure, action, \"cliffhanger scenes\", and not too much romance or other \"icky\" stuff. When you're young, you're not too critical of flexing rubber swords, campy acting, and scenes that are repeated. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie, just as was done in old-time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed.) Finally, kids are usually more accepting of American English dialogue coming out of the mouths of Asian actors. (Not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /><br />I was going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, producers, and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project. This movie is not art, but, like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort, and discipline to get it made.<br /><br />Overall, not a recommended use for your time, but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini-van.<br /><br />Oh, yeah...hey, IMDb! \"Dialogue\" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell-checking seems to think that \"dialog\" is the proper spelling.

{"value":"Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred. <br /><br />Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall. <br /><br />One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned. The monk recounts the history of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts away to something else. Earlier the monk had offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house, although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care.<br /><br />There are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs in seeing the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's Motel Hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing, but on the whole this is a forgettable dud.","finished_norm":["dull","haunt","hous","thriller","find","a","american","famili","move","into","a","year","old","hous","in","japan","where","a","violent","murder","suicid","love","triangl","occur","br","br","novel","set","be","about","the","onli","elem","of","interest","in","thi","veri","slow","move","horror","flick","by","the","director","of","motel","hell","the","film","gener","zero","suspens","and","be","compos","of","somewhat","choppi","scene","that","rare","seem","to","be","lead","anywher","overal","br","br","on","obviou","exampl","be","a","fairli","earli","scene","where","the","male","lead","visit","a","templ","after","realiz","that","hi","hous","be","haunt","a","the","monk","have","earli","warn","the","monk","recount","the","histori","of","the","hous","which","the","viewer","be","alreadi","familiar","with","from","the","open","sequenc","and","then","the","film","simpli","cut","awai","to","someth","els","earli","the","monk","have","offer","to","help","good","where","be","the","help","the","famili","continu","to","stai","in","the","haunt","hous","a","thing","get","wrong","and","wrong","and","no","mention","of","the","monk","be","make","until","nearli","the","veri","end","when","he","turn","up","again","to","do","what","he","should","have","do","a","hour","earliertri","to","drive","the","spirit","out","of","the","hous","although","by","thi","time","it","difficult","for","the","viewer","to","carebr","br","there","be","some","probabl","unintent","campi","laugh","in","see","the","american","actor","at","the","end","becom","possess","by","the","japanes","spirit","and","suddenli","start","do","bad","martial","art","i","sai","probabl","becaus","the","scene","be","much","than","a","littl","reminisc","of","the","chainsaw","duel","from","the","same","director","motel","hell","which","be","much","obvious","mean","to","be","amus","but","on","the","whole","thi","be","a","forgett","dud"],"filtered":["dull","haunt","hous","thriller","find","american","famili","move","year","old","hous","japan","violent","murder","suicid","love","triangl","occur","br","br","novel","set","onli","elem","interest","thi","veri","slow","move","horror","flick","director","motel","hell","film","gener","zero","suspens","compos","somewhat","choppi","scene","rare","seem","lead","anywher","overal","br","br","obviou","exampl","fairli","earli","scene","male","lead","visit","templ","realiz","hi","hous","haunt","monk","earli","warn","monk","recount","histori","hous","viewer","alreadi","familiar","open","sequenc","film","simpli","cut","awai","someth","els","earli","monk","offer","help","good","help","famili","continu","stai","haunt","hous","thing","get","wrong","wrong","mention","monk","make","nearli","veri","end","turn","hour","earliertri","drive","spirit","hous","although","thi","time","difficult","viewer","carebr","br","probabl","unintent","campi","laugh","see","american","actor","end","becom","possess","japanes","spirit","suddenli","start","bad","martial","art","sai","probabl","becaus","scene","much","littl","reminisc","chainsaw","duel","director","motel","hell","much","obvious","mean","amus","whole","thi","forgett","dud"],"filtered2":["dull","haunt","hous","thriller","find","american","famili","move","year","old","hous","japan","violent","murder","suicid","love","triangl","occur","novel","set","onli","elem","interest","veri","slow","move","horror","flick","director","motel","hell","gener","zero","suspens","compos","somewhat","choppi","scene","rare","seem","lead","anywher","overal","obviou","exampl","fairli","earli","scene","male","lead","visit","templ","realiz","hous","haunt","monk","earli","warn","monk","recount","histori","hous","viewer","alreadi","familiar","open","sequenc","simpli","cut","awai","someth","els","earli","monk","offer","help","good","help","famili","continu","stai","haunt","hous","thing","get","wrong","wrong","mention","monk","make","nearli","veri","end","turn","hour","earliertri","drive","spirit","hous","although","time","difficult","viewer","carebr","probabl","unintent","campi","laugh","see","american","actor","end","becom","possess","japanes","spirit","suddenli","start","bad","martial","art","probabl","becaus","scene","littl","reminisc","chainsaw","duel","director","motel","hell","obvious","mean","amus","whole","forgett","dud"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,9,11,14,15,19,22,24,25,29,35,38,41,53,54,57,58,60,67,71,83,88,96,109,111,115,133,148,155,157,174,182,185,196,201,213,223,225,237,242,257,266,273,275,279,285,303,307,330,341,349,365,367,382,383,390,394,405,412,433,461,474,479,499,507,527,529,596,611,649,708,714,785,803,819,843,894,964,966,1013,1095,1167,1253,1262,1292,1304,1372,1386,1391,1733,1841,1943,2127,2436,2752,2931,2950,3281,3398,4293,4661,6293,6322,7600],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health. The formula hasn't been tested on a human, or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. He gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead. Hood of the living Dead is one piece of trash. The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil, the acting is just horrible especially with Rick' s fake crying for his brother, the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out, and the make up is just lame. It's only fake blood covered over the actors face. The zombies are also modified. They run, growl, and must be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only scuffle, moan, and must be shot in the brain to die! This film is so horrible, the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe

{"value":"At first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick, and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. However, the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected, and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the World War II era Army. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.<br /><br />The obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. The locations are great, the effects and action are weak. Imagine if \"Saving Private Ryan\" had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way Vin Diesel's Caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns drove around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and Boyd's racist Captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of Turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.<br /><br />In short, \"Black Brigade/Carter's Army\" doesn't quite succeed. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It could be remade as a very good film, and, as it stands, is an interesting

{"value":"This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.","finished_norm":["thi","be","almost","certainli","the","wrong","western","i","have","ever","see","the","stori","follow","a","formula","that","be","especi","common","to","western","and","martial","art","film","hero","learn","that","familyfriend","have","be","murder","so","hero","set","out","to","exact","reveng","foil","the","ineffect","lawman","rescu","the","kidnap","love","damsel","and","murder","the","expert","archnemesi","in","a","brutal","duel","thi","formula","have","often","be","success","otherwis","it","would","not","be","a","formula","but","gunfight","be","the","much","sophomor","execut","of","it","you","will","ever","see","the","script","be","atroci","simplemind","and","insult","it","sound","like","a","high","schooler","write","the","dialogu","becaus","it","lack","depth","matur","and","realism","the","sound","be","bad","it","sometim","look","dub","the","cinematographi","be","lame","and","the","set","be","sometim","just","facad","the","act","be","piti","sure","some","of","the","perform","can","blame","the","script","but","other","cannot","us","that","excus","i","hope","i","never","see","chri","lybbert","in","a","speak","role","ever","again","everi","time","he","sai","a","line","that","should","be","angri","or","mean","he","doe","noth","much","than","low","the","timbr","of","hi","voic","and","he","just","sound","like","a","kid","try","to","act","macho","and","speak","of","chri","lybbert","who","plai","hopalong","check","out","hi","dud","if","you","dare","to","watch","thi","film","he","wear","thi","brand","new","cloth","that","make","him","look","much","like","roi","roger","than","a","hardwork","downanddirti","cowboi","if","you","enjoi","inan","cinemat","fare","that","serv","mere","to","worship","the","imagin","grandeur","of","hopalong","cassidi","then","get","thi","but","if","you","have","much","than","two","neuron","watch","someth","els"],"filtered":["thi","almost","certainli","wrong","western","ever","see","stori","follow","formula","especi","common","western","martial","art","film","hero","learn","familyfriend","murder","hero","set","exact","reveng","foil","ineffect","lawman","rescu","kidnap","love","damsel","murder","expert","archnemesi","brutal","duel","thi","formula","often","success","otherwis","formula","gunfight","much","sophomor","execut","ever","see","script","atroci","simplemind","insult","sound","like","high","schooler","write","dialogu","becaus","lack","depth","matur","realism","sound","bad","sometim","look","dub","cinematographi","lame","set","sometim","facad","act","piti","sure","perform","blame","script","us","excus","hope","never","see","chri","lybbert","speak","role","ever","everi","time","sai","line","angri","mean","doe","noth","much","low","timbr","hi","voic","sound","like","kid","try","act","macho","speak","chri","lybbert","plai","hopalong","check","hi","dud","dare","watch","thi","film","wear","thi","brand","new","cloth","make","look","much","like","roi","roger","hardwork","downanddirti","cowboi","enjoi","inan","cinemat","fare","serv","mere","worship","imagin","grandeur","hopalong","cassidi","get","thi","much","two","neuron","watch","someth","els"],"filtered2":["almost","certainli","wrong","western","ever","see","stori","follow","formula","especi","common","western","martial","art","hero","learn","familyfriend","murder","hero","set","exact","reveng","foil","ineffect","lawman","rescu","kidnap","love","damsel","murder","expert","archnemesi","brutal","duel","formula","often","success","otherwis","formula","gunfight","sophomor","execut","ever","see","script","atroci","simplemind","insult","sound","like","high","schooler","write","dialogu","becaus","lack","depth","matur","realism","sound","bad","sometim","look","dub","cinematographi","lame","set","sometim","facad","act","piti","sure","perform","blame","script","us","excus","hope","never","see","chri","lybbert","speak","role","ever","everi","time","line","angri","mean","doe","noth","low","timbr","voic","sound","like","kid","try","act","macho","speak","chri","lybbert","plai","hopalong","check","dud","dare","watch","wear","brand","new","cloth","make","look","like","roi","roger","hardwork","downanddirti","cowboi","enjoi","inan","cinemat","fare","serv","mere","worship","imagin","grandeur","hopalong","cassidi","get","two","neuron","watch","someth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,9,16,17,18,21,22,25,36,40,42,44,47,49,53,54,56,65,77,85,87,88,105,107,109,114,119,128,131,178,181,183,196,200,211,217,248,260,267,273,340,344,372,375,382,389,400,428,430,500,504,514,532,617,627,629,662,709,770,815,836,871,879,898,914,939,949,1093,1140,1161,1176,1189,1191,1219,1266,1370,1386,1479,1723,1741,1774,1939,2054,2192,2342,2391,2551,2752,2933,3539,4056,4298,4439,4749,5116,5151,6293,6824,8203,8251],"values":[1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.

{"value":"I understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different. I understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss-understood movie. My point is as soon as this movie ended my first comment was: \" this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent\".....she uses daddy's' money to make a movie she wrote, directs, and pays for.....obviously to close to the movie to realize there was no character development and no directions such as a beginning, middle and ending.....the voyeur part was good and edgy but what was the point? I saw a women go to a house, find some pictures, screw the caretaker, come out side on a very cold night (not believable) to check on noise and runs over her caretaker lover....movie ends......some one educate my ignorant arss?? I really want to know what the point is....what was the directors' vision.....why no development of the dead lover? Why no background on the caretaker? What is the point of the night vision? What is the point of the lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why tell us about an escaped mental patient/peeping tom? What's with the urn? Oh and the lamp is that suppose to signify whose' house this is? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker feel like it's his house? that aspect was never pursued......as for William Defoe...I rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters.....write back and do

{"value":"Let's face it-- if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80's gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this don't need spoilers, because YOU already know them.<br /><br />The \"plot\" for this \"film\", is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the \"film\"; nerd and girl are captured; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames \"film\"; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. <br /><br />The end.<br /><br />The acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect-- B-grade. Some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this one. Granted, the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels, then you are right at home.<br /><br />Sadly, Mathew Broderick was too involved with some \"masterpiece\", that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one.

{"value":"This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. That is no exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.<br /><br />I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does Erwin/Elvira suicides at the end, but instead of this, in every scene somebody is trying to explain: \"when he was young, this happened...\" and \"he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there...\", etc.<br /><br />Soon in the movie, Erwin/Elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute (certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while telling her the story of Elvira's life, Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other. It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of \"I have suffered much in my life, and am about to die\".<br /><br />In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something, Erwin/Elvira encounters a former lover, that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira.<br /><br />There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinder's self- indulgence.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","confus","and","incoher","mess","of","intermin","scene","of","bore","dialogu","and","monologu","that","be","no","exagger","you","have","to","make","a","tremend","effort","to","even","try","to","becom","involv","with","itbr","br","i","sincer","think","fassbind","would","make","someth","interest","in","order","to","tell","why","doe","erwinelvira","suicid","at","the","end","but","instead","of","thi","in","everi","scene","somebodi","be","try","to","explain","when","he","be","young","thi","happen","and","he","just","come","back","from","casablanca","and","order","to","cut","everyth","down","there","etcbr","br","soon","in","the","movi","erwinelvira","be","in","a","slaughter","hous","talk","with","a","friend","prostitut","certainli","a","slaughter","hous","be","the","well","place","for","a","pleasant","littl","chat","and","while","tell","her","the","stori","of","elvira","life","fassbind","show","the","kill","of","on","cow","after","the","other","it","be","difficult","to","choos","between","give","attent","to","the","disturb","imag","or","what","the","transvestit","be","sai","of","cours","we","come","to","the","veri","forc","and","coars","symbol","of","i","have","suffer","much","in","my","life","and","be","about","to","diebr","br","in","on","of","the","spars","moment","where","actual","happen","someth","erwinelvira","encount","a","former","lover","that","onli","after","perform","a","extrem","gai","choreographi","with","two","other","gui","a","if","go","for","the","necessari","level","of","homosexu","be","that","he","recogn","elvirabr","br","there","be","some","interest","shot","and","idea","i","must","admit","such","a","when","the","nun","tell","the","stori","of","the","young","erwin","but","everyth","on","the","movi","be","wast","due","to","fassbind","self","indulg"],"filtered":["thi","confus","incoher","mess","intermin","scene","bore","dialogu","monologu","exagger","make","tremend","effort","even","try","becom","involv","itbr","br","sincer","think","fassbind","make","someth","interest","order","tell","doe","erwinelvira","suicid","end","instead","thi","everi","scene","somebodi","try","explain","young","thi","happen","come","back","casablanca","order","cut","everyth","etcbr","br","soon","movi","erwinelvira","slaughter","hous","talk","friend","prostitut","certainli","slaughter","hous","well","place","pleasant","littl","chat","tell","stori","elvira","life","fassbind","show","kill","cow","difficult","choos","give","attent","disturb","imag","transvestit","sai","cours","come","veri","forc","coars","symbol","suffer","much","life","diebr","br","spars","moment","actual","happen","someth","erwinelvira","encount","former","lover","onli","perform","extrem","gai","choreographi","two","gui","go","necessari","level","homosexu","recogn","elvirabr","br","interest","shot","idea","must","admit","nun","tell","stori","young","erwin","everyth","movi","wast","due","fassbind","self","indulg"],"filtered2":["confus","incoher","mess","intermin","scene","bore","dialogu","monologu","exagger","make","tremend","effort","even","try","becom","involv","itbr","sincer","think","fassbind","make","someth","interest","order","tell","doe","erwinelvira","suicid","end","instead","everi","scene","somebodi","try","explain","young","happen","come","back","casablanca","order","cut","everyth","etcbr","soon","erwinelvira","slaughter","hous","talk","friend","prostitut","certainli","slaughter","hous","well","place","pleasant","littl","chat","tell","stori","elvira","life","fassbind","show","kill","cow","difficult","choos","give","attent","disturb","imag","transvestit","cours","come","veri","forc","coars","symbol","suffer","life","diebr","spars","moment","actual","happen","someth","erwinelvira","encount","former","lover","onli","perform","extrem","gai","choreographi","two","gui","go","necessari","level","homosexu","recogn","elvirabr","interest","shot","idea","must","admit","nun","tell","stori","young","erwin","everyth","wast","due","fassbind","self","indulg"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,11,12,14,15,17,18,19,20,24,28,30,34,36,47,52,53,55,60,63,75,76,85,89,90,94,105,108,115,123,135,141,152,161,164,186,188,193,199,213,241,248,303,329,338,389,395,401,407,427,431,439,441,445,449,568,584,633,636,640,691,740,803,839,954,1040,1082,1109,1288,1372,1537,1568,1736,1769,2063,2216,2217,2304,2312,2479,2991,3139,3153,3382,3420,3589,3660,4686,5352,5476,6527,6616,7270,7337,7873,8284],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,11,12,14,15,17,18,19,20,24,28,30,34,36,47,52,53,55,60,63,75,76,85,89,90,94,105,108,115

{"value":"There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner...and especially right in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about on the new game show. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein so stoically and nasally says, \"wooww\".<br /><br />The only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over. Sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist...you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals, only to find out that only a minute has passed (but seemed like an eternity) since you last glanced at the clock. So, why didn't I just switch the channel? Well, probably for the same reason most other people didn't...out of sheer optimism. I mean, no one really *wants* to think that a show with Bill Shatner could actually be SO BAD.<br /><br />Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of William Shatner. My chief complaint was that the set was so dark. Watching it left me feeling depressed. You kept on wanting to get ahold of a little excitement, but there was just none to be had.

{"value":"It's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star. Prior to watching The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.<br /><br />There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers. Even more so in that the \"carefully crafted\" (or however they put it) conclusion didn't seem to follow logically from the plot (which naturally I can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers), and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.<br /><br />It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the mainstream audience. If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead.

{"value":"Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua \"Josh\" Pollack) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers \"Thank you\" to testifying officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation. You will see Mr. Cool J's devilish detective partner Dylan McDermott (as Frances \"Laz\" Lazerov) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The cops in the city of \"Edison\" are so corrupt they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and snort their dope. Whether he's out to impress his girlfriend (herein, called \"Pussy\") or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake.<br /><br />Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger. Writer/director David J. Burke keeps the film above water, but just barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the \"pop star to movie star\" sweepstakes (aka the \"rapper to actor\" progression). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace).

{"value":"Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest. This could not be further from that. Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema. I was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had that problem with Italian horror films.<br /><br />Massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in Fulci's Nightmare Concert. This isn't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is SO boring. The movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away. The last 30 minutes of the movie aren't so bad but still could have been much better. The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here. The end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor.<br /><br />This wasn't a very good film but for a true Italian horror freak (like myself) this movie is a must have since it is very rare. 4/10

{"value":"As usual, I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. There is no story!! A group of guys meander around Iraq. One day they are here diffusing a bomb. Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. No wait here they are back in Bagdad. There is no cohesive story at all. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think is going to happen??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look \"artsy\". And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent \"Full Metal Jacket\", \"Deerhunter\" or \"Platoon\".

{"value":"Okay, I rented this movie because of the director...he has made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen Waxork you are missing a fun ride). Anyway, I had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but I decided to suck it up and give it a look. It's bad. Very bad. If you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. First of all, the old saying 'You can't judge a book by it's cover' applies here. The box for this flick seems to indicate that Jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. The back of the box has a cool shot of the red-leather Jill and some other shots. The description makes you want to rent the movie because it SOUNDS good. You start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. Jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. The movie is not quite as predictable as you would think...and that's not a good thing. Characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation...it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie Dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. Also, what was the point of having Dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. Anthony Hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script. Had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent.

{"value":"Yes, this was pure unbelievable condescending babble. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy?

{"value":"This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look

{"value":"The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller (looking surprisingly aged a year after \"Tarzan and the Huntress\") is bad, in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller, shooting in beautiful scenery in México, with a top star of that country (Andrea Palma) and multiple award-winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, and bringing in prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score. Although it may have cost less for filming abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania, and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director, instead of Robert Florey, who gives it a very slow pace. Neumann had done a fine work with \"Tarzan and the Amazons\", \"Tarzan and the Leopard Woman\" and \"Tarzan and the Huntress\", and finished his career directing the classic \"The Fly\" the year before his death; while Florey became a television director, after a career of few remarkable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs (that have a Caribbean air, in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in México!)

{"value":"Losing Control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world. Usually, they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent, interspersed with copious disrobing. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make-believe world.<br /><br />Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering a bout of writer's block. Just by chance, (or is it?) she meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to divulge any information about himself, yet Kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales. As in most films of this type, the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up. I have seen enough of this kind of film to think, no change there, then - but I like them. They are so undemanding.<br /><br />Performances of the cast vary. Doug Jeffery carries the film as the psycho/sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril. Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either.<br /><br />Finally, a note of caution about the DVD under review. Both the cover and the disc state R-rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is cut short just as she's getting started. 4

{"value":"How many fricken' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background & peaking through a mirror's reflection? It's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory & four dozen times in this choppy, poorly done film. There were only two freaky moments to appreciate....when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the Diet Coke in the 64 oz. cup I was drawing it from. The side characters could have been pulled from various Scooby Doo cartoons. There was the friendly, aged sheriff. There was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the Alabama drawl. Lots'o'characters with no development. The most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning. But rather than explore the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other. When they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together....with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there. Oh...and the eerie sounds were also overdone. You know what I mean....creaking doors that open by themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. Haven't seen that before. Again, you'll see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over an over again. NOTE TO DIRECTOR: a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film.

{"value":"As said before, the visual effects are stunning. They're breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics like that are not easy AT ALL. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the plot confusing, but the overall conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to run away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the room of the bottomless pit, Proog explains that \"one step out of place and (you're dead)\". Here, there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the movie progresses, it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature. But suddenly, a conflict exists between man and man when Proog, out of nowhere, murders Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a \"sick man\". He betrays us. Not only is this depressing, but we don't care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. It's not a story about someone, through struggle, emerging stronger. It's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does. In my opinion, the movie is severely underdeveloped in all aspects. However, the graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy. There's no truth, no struggle and a bad surprise ending. In conclusion, an underdeveloped movie without a point. ...but the graphics are
