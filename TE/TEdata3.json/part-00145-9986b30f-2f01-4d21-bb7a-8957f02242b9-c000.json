{"value":"- Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s. I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of it works. A parody should be funny and this one just isn't. Not once during the entire runtime did I so much as crack a smile. In general, I am easily entertained, but I couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures.<br /><br />- I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning. The two \"stars\" make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet. These two come off as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me. After the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits. It's all just a complete waste of time.<br /><br />- I bought this on the double feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. That movie is Academy Award winning stuff in comparison with Invasion of the Star Creatures.","finished_norm":["let","me","start","by","sai","that","i","understand","that","invas","of","the","star","creatur","be","mean","to","be","a","parodi","of","the","scifi","film","of","the","i","understand","that","none","of","it","be","to","be","take","serious","the","problem","i","have","be","that","none","of","it","work","a","parodi","should","be","funni","and","thi","on","just","be","not","not","onc","dure","the","entir","runtim","do","i","so","much","a","crack","a","smile","in","gener","i","be","easili","entertain","but","i","can","not","find","a","sliver","of","entertain","anywher","in","invas","of","the","star","creaturesbr","br","i","know","i","be","in","troubl","right","from","the","begin","the","two","star","make","their","screen","appear","with","on","of","the","lame","gag","imagin","a","water","hose","thei","ca","not","control","that","get","them","both","wet","thi","two","come","off","a","boweri","boi","wannab","why","anyon","would","want","to","mime","the","act","and","persona","of","the","boweri","boi","be","beyond","me","after","the","littl","than","illustri","begin","the","movi","go","on","to","featur","comic","chase","sequenc","danc","indian","veget","man","decod","ring","and","other","assort","unfunni","bit","it","all","just","a","complet","wast","of","timebr","br","i","bui","thi","on","the","doubl","featur","dvd","with","invas","of","the","bee","girl","that","movi","be","academi","award","win","stuff","in","comparison","with","invas","of","the","star","creatur"],"filtered":["let","start","sai","understand","invas","star","creatur","mean","parodi","scifi","film","understand","none","take","serious","problem","none","work","parodi","funni","thi","onc","dure","entir","runtim","much","crack","smile","gener","easili","entertain","find","sliver","entertain","anywher","invas","star","creaturesbr","br","know","troubl","right","begin","two","star","make","screen","appear","lame","gag","imagin","water","hose","thei","ca","control","get","wet","thi","two","come","boweri","boi","wannab","anyon","want","mime","act","persona","boweri","boi","beyond","littl","illustri","begin","movi","go","featur","comic","chase","sequenc","danc","indian","veget","man","decod","ring","assort","unfunni","bit","complet","wast","timebr","br","bui","thi","doubl","featur","dvd","invas","bee","girl","movi","academi","award","win","stuff","comparison","invas","star","creatur"],"filtered2":["let","start","understand","invas","star","creatur","mean","parodi","scifi","understand","none","take","serious","problem","none","work","parodi","funni","onc","dure","entir","runtim","crack","smile","gener","easili","entertain","find","sliver","entertain","anywher","invas","star","creaturesbr","know","troubl","right","begin","two","star","make","screen","appear","lame","gag","imagin","water","hose","ca","control","get","wet","two","come","boweri","boi","wannab","anyon","want","mime","act","persona","boweri","boi","beyond","littl","illustri","begin","go","featur","comic","chase","sequenc","danc","indian","veget","man","decod","ring","assort","unfunni","bit","complet","wast","timebr","bui","doubl","featur","dvd","invas","bee","girl","academi","award","win","stuff","comparison","invas","star","creatur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,14,21,26,31,34,37,38,45,47,48,62,71,81,84,88,89,100,103,121,124,147,158,167,169,192,195,198,212,225,236,239,247,282,305,340,347,349,361,370,371,372,480,489,492,502,530,583,752,761,781,823,830,948,998,1004,1025,1084,1250,1292,1294,1303,1307,1381,1527,1868,1920,1926,2964,3266,3298,4291,4665,7111,7418,7864],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,14,21,26,31,34,37,38,45,47,48,62,71,81,84,88,89,100,103,121,124,147,158,167,169,192,195,198,212,225,236,239,247,282,305,340,347,349,361,370,371,372,480,489,492,502,530,583,752,761,781,823,830,948,998,1004,1025,1084,1250,1292,1294,1303,1307,1381,1527,1868,1920,1926,2964,3266,3298,4291,4665,7111,7418,7864],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.8162961064622165,3.412938870621443,1.6955116224012472,2.0226120445069267,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,2.2212694515902225,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,8.562184961271125,2.098582041218749,2.2190595059394194,2.2323930368088845,4.568864643066313,2.3106972614914807,2.4609576687888097,2.4214486257841834,2.5318267134339894,5.02578483168376,2.5439726117360975,5.196758667886523,2.641219492619754,2.617923930016232,2.6593400337329487,2.7303758068497004,5.837702458436066,5.7225627547931115,2.948928684455311,3.015198

{"value":"I am a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film. Now I know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and they can't act. That's why there porn stars, if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn. Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star. A fine example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth. She made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn't act. Where is she now? I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then \"Dream Quest\". Come on Jenna, we don't want to hear you talk, as much as we want to see you have sex. Also, you Jenna, would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done anal on

{"value":"Having read some good reviews about this film I thought it was about time I go and see it. Well I don't know why I bothered. Basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. Firstly, why did said Knights move the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages character figure out that 'Charlotte' was in fact a ship? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of Hollywood action gone wrong. Cage has been in some great action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why has he lowered himself to this? Is he getting too old?! His character is pretty annoying really - Somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the Declaration of Independancd, outruns thieves with guns, escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible.

{"value":"I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant. Narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting doesn't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow won't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history. Not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng.

{"value":"This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan, and I really appreciate musicals. In finality, Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really befuddling. I couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out. For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the \"no selling out\" message. When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up. Maybe I rented half of two different movies? Nope, there was a \"Keep Britain White\" song and dance sequence. I'm sorry, but WWII is not something you can write a musical about. At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as \"campy\" as I have several times in this review. Overall I'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors. (And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit!)

{"value":"So I'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller. Well worth a look then. Or so I thought.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />End Game has just about the most ridiculous plot I have ever had the displeasure of enduring. Now being something of a whodunnit, I can't really tear into it as I would like without 'ruining' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity. But questions such as 'Why has he/she/they done this?', and 'Where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off?' are all too abundant following the film's unintentionally hilarious conclusion.<br /><br />As for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor's realised that they've made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie, and this then shows in their performance? This is one of those. Accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed, irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison.<br /><br />Of course, this didn't make it to the cinema, and for the

{"value":"This movie was almost intolerable to sit through. I can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits, but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me. I've seen better acting in a 4th grade play. Aside from that the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in. I was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that. That is not a copycat the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn't him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder. Overall I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore. Plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","almost","intoler","to","sit","through","i","can","get","beyond","the","fact","that","it","look","like","it","be","shoot","with","a","home","video","camera","and","that","thi","movi","be","suppos","to","spin","over","week","in","time","yet","the","charact","do","not","onc","chang","outfit","but","the","act","break","the","th","wall","to","piec","for","me","i","have","see","well","act","in","a","th","grade","plai","asid","from","that","the","plot","be","unrealist","if","the","man","suspect","the","gui","he","would","have","turn","him","in","i","be","conjur","heavili","disappoint","that","all","the","kill","be","do","with","a","gun","what","kind","of","gore","be","that","that","be","not","a","copycat","the","zodiac","do","not","kill","us","just","a","gun","the","author","would","have","know","it","be","not","him","anoth","thing","that","realli","bother","me","be","that","thei","call","disassoci","ident","disord","dsm","when","that","be","the","name","of","the","book","us","to","diagnos","peopl","with","mental","disord","not","the","name","of","the","disord","overal","i","think","thi","movi","be","not","the","kind","of","movi","that","can","be","do","with","a","low","budget","at","littl","not","a","low","a","thei","have","or","thei","can","have","make","sure","thei","have","well","actor","or","much","gore","plenti","of","peopl","have","go","the","low","budget","rout","with","out","have","to","us","horribl","actor","look","at","easi","rider","that","have","denni","hopper","and","jack","nicholson","and","a","low","budget"],"filtered":["thi","movi","almost","intoler","sit","get","beyond","fact","look","like","shoot","home","video","camera","thi","movi","suppos","spin","week","time","yet","charact","onc","chang","outfit","act","break","th","wall","piec","see","well","act","th","grade","plai","asid","plot","unrealist","man","suspect","gui","turn","conjur","heavili","disappoint","kill","gun","kind","gore","copycat","zodiac","kill","us","gun","author","know","anoth","thing","realli","bother","thei","call","disassoci","ident","disord","dsm","name","book","us","diagnos","peopl","mental","disord","name","disord","overal","think","thi","movi","kind","movi","low","budget","littl","low","thei","thei","make","sure","thei","well","actor","much","gore","plenti","peopl","go","low","budget","rout","us","horribl","actor","look","easi","rider","denni","hopper","jack","nicholson","low","budget"],"filtered2":["almost","intoler","sit","get","beyond","fact","look","like","shoot","home","video","camera","suppos","spin","week","time","yet","charact","onc","chang","outfit","act","break","th","wall","piec","see","well","act","th","grade","plai","asid","plot","unrealist","man","suspect","gui","turn","conjur","heavili","disappoint","kill","gun","kind","gore","copycat","zodiac","kill","us","gun","author","know","anoth","thing","realli","bother","call","disassoci","ident","disord","dsm","name","book","us","diagnos","peopl","mental","disord","name","disord","overal","think","kind","low","budget","littl","low","make","sure","well","actor","gore","plenti","peopl","go","low","budget","rout","us","horribl","actor","look","easi","rider","denni","hopper","jack","nicholson","low","budget"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,10,12,13,14,16,20,21,23,26,29,32,39,40,41,45,55,56,73,76,96,97,117,119,122,131,142,143,149,151,187,194,217,218,230,231,236,240,244,256,278,302,358,360,412,496,501,502,744,777,853,857,887,911,936,938,977,1085,1112,1264,1608,1808,1942,2099,2644,3087,3349,4037,4127,4157,4707,4764,8397],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,10,12,13,14,16,20,21,23,26,29,32,39,40,41,45,55,56,73,76,96,97,117,119,122,131,142,143,149,151,187,194,217,218,230,231,236,240,244,256,278,302,358,360,412,496,501,502,744,777,853,857,887,911,936,938,977,1085,1112,1264,1608,1808,1942,2099,2644,3087,3349,4037,4127,4157,4707,4764,8397],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,2.729695454751562,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.8162961064622165,1.9536997889255368,5.583182805210536,1.8950689206770979,4.267533106664805,2.0390708128715254,2.0545557924622586,2.2797301185117202,2.1653408989309972,4.497869534746497,2.2512118082053005,2.2844323215331563,4.681980408231769,2.3253197803590226,2.8002454868101863,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,10.44546611788029,2.5940874818617203,2.

{"value":"I wouldn't give this movie a rating, it's not worthy. I watched it only because I'm a Pfieffer fan. I love her and would watch anything she made. Even in this dud, she didn't disappoint. Every scene with her in it, kept the viewer watching...waiting...for something to happen but nothing ever did. It had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started. Some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it.<br /><br />Pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely. The wardrobe and set was surprisingly good. <br /><br />I can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie I can't find something to like about it, but this was a dud. I don't understand. <br /><br />The worst thing about it all, it had a big cliff hanger at the end. It had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow, this film is finally going some place, then the credits roll. Good grief. <br /><br />I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting. Well said. Actually, that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well.

{"value":"All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon, and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles, about eight kilometers, of an actual movie. BOY does this thing suck. There isn't one original line, thought, shot, or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close. The magical, ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. <br /><br />Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. Usually it's in the opening credits - \"Written, Directed, and Produced by\" one guy. Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made. Here, you don't find out till the very last of the credits, where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged. <br /><br />Right now I'm watching MST's take on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth.

{"value":"I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I'm a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian. I hate art in any kind of shape or form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the kind. Let me give you a résumé in a few sentences. It starts out with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda. Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker. The housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti fascist is gay. Despite of this they make love with each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. The end. You want an even shorter résumé? BORING... That short enough? The guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the audience from this atrocity. On a side note my sister loved this movie.

{"value":"Wesley Snipes is James Dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the CIA and pure bad-ass special operative. During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.<br /><br />Enter agent Collins, his supervising officer. Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody. Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.<br /><br />The assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew. So Dial's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.<br /><br />Fortunately for Dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement...<br /><br />With a script like that need I say more? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging.

{"value":"No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for \"The House Next Door\" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. This Lifetime-like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can't find in this version we watched.<br /><br />The film's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better.<br /><br />The film has a feeling of a cross between \"Desperate Houswives\" with \"The Stepford Wives\" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.","finished_norm":["no","mention","if","ann","river","siddon","adapt","the","materi","for","the","hous","next","door","from","her","novel","of","the","same","titl","or","someon","els","do","it","thi","lifetimelik","movi","be","direct","by","canadian","director","jeff","woolnough","have","read","the","book","a","long","time","ago","we","decid","to","take","a","chanc","when","the","film","show","on","a","cabl","version","of","what","be","clearli","a","movi","make","for","televis","you","know","that","when","the","critic","moment","preced","the","commerci","which","of","cours","on","ca","not","find","in","thi","version","we","watchedbr","br","the","film","star","be","lara","flynn","boyl","who","sport","a","new","look","that","throw","thi","viewer","a","curv","becaus","of","the","cosmet","transform","thi","actress","have","go","through","from","the","new","eyebrow","to","other","part","of","her","bodi","m","boyl","be","hardli","recogniz","a","col","kennedi","the","charact","at","the","center","of","the","mysteri","thi","be","not","on","of","the","actress","well","moment","in","front","of","the","camera","that","go","for","the","rest","of","the","mainli","canadian","actor","that","deserv","betterbr","br","the","film","have","a","feel","of","a","cross","between","desper","houswiv","with","the","stepford","wife","and","other","well","know","featur","combin","with","a","mild","dose","of","creepi","the","well","thing","about","the","movi","be","the","hous","which","serv","a","the","set"],"filtered":["mention","ann","river","siddon","adapt","materi","hous","next","door","novel","titl","someon","els","thi","lifetimelik","movi","direct","canadian","director","jeff","woolnough","read","book","long","time","ago","decid","take","chanc","film","show","cabl","version","clearli","movi","make","televis","know","critic","moment","preced","commerci","cours","ca","find","thi","version","watchedbr","br","film","star","lara","flynn","boyl","sport","new","look","throw","thi","viewer","curv","becaus","cosmet","transform","thi","actress","go","new","eyebrow","part","bodi","m","boyl","hardli","recogniz","col","kennedi","charact","center","mysteri","thi","actress","well","moment","front","camera","go","rest","mainli","canadian","actor","deserv","betterbr","br","film","feel","cross","desper","houswiv","stepford","wife","well","know","featur","combin","mild","dose","creepi","well","thing","movi","hous","serv","set"],"filtered2":["mention","ann","river","siddon","adapt","materi","hous","next","door","novel","titl","someon","els","lifetimelik","direct","canadian","director","jeff","woolnough","read","book","long","time","ago","decid","take","chanc","show","cabl","version","clearli","make","televis","know","critic","moment","preced","commerci","cours","ca","find","version","watchedbr","star","lara","flynn","boyl","sport","new","look","throw","viewer","curv","becaus","cosmet","transform","actress","go","new","eyebrow","part","bodi","m","boyl","hardli","recogniz","col","kennedi","charact","center","mysteri","actress","well","moment","front","camera","go","rest","mainli","canadian","actor","deserv","betterbr","feel","cross","desper","houswiv","stepford","wife","well","know","featur","combin","mild","dose","creepi","well","thing","hous","serv","set"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,10,16,20,22,26,28,29,31,38,41,43,58,61,81,87,99,100,102,109,139,145,151,188,196,199,213,220,226,231,249,263,264,279,285,297,305,310,354,376,403,423,474,486,494,537,579,610,663,665,701,755,773,788,815,838,968,1125,1211,1221,1255,1286,1315,1529,1535,1665,1676,1871,1884,2173,2500,3008,3788,4460,4505,4652,4870,5977,6688,7253],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,10,16,20,22,26,28,29,31,38,41,43,58,61,81,87,99,100,102,109,139,145,151,188,196,199,213,220,226,231,249,263,264,279,285,297,305,310,354,376,403,423,474,486,494,537,579,610,663,665,701,755,773,788,815,838,968,1125,1211,1221,1255,1286,1315,1529,1535,1665,1676,1871,1884,2173,2500,3008,3788,4460,4505,4652,4870,5977,6688,7253],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,3.4960351200691706,1.2979240167361772,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,1.949757232424728,4.230048743045324,2.056430207256609,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,2.125691139326857,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,5.075762444685391,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,5.6865257437877545,5.667386841755453,2.5940874818617203,2.7049353070058615,2.6754694156628323,2.90

{"value":"The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium.

{"value":"Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. The plot is over-done, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old. The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth

{"value":"Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie, but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors, they've done their part of the movie very well. Good acting, but i don't think that can save the movie.. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-)<br /><br />Action sequences were shot very shabbily, no one could make out head & tail of the stunts, they've used Akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..<br /><br />Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake).<br /><br />And the movies name has been mentioned

{"value":"For the record, this film is intriguing but its hardly original. Back in 1998 a movie starring Talia Shire called The Landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters.<br /><br />The story is Amanda Lear has had a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, mental homes, etc. She's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor...who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy. (now THAT was original) The doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After moving in she falls in love with a stud named Richard, who just happens to be married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and Richard (including a roadie).<br /><br />Much of the idea's came from the previous movie, same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in, same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, same flying a bodypress. It did have some original material, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene.

{"value":"Teamo Supremo are three kids, consisting of their leader- Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! chika! woopa!) and outfit and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game. They lead normal lives as well, and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains. The villains all have rather unique and singular traits, such as Mister Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway. From an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, take revenge etc.<br /><br />The animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style appears to be simple on purpose. The backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is quite nice, and the show isn't too bad altogether, although the style isn't my favourite.<br /><br />The plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and one can't blame them for that.

{"value":"I had the \"privilege\" of attending a special screening of 'The Absence of Light' at a horror convention in Ohio.<br /><br />First off, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film, saying: \"Now keep in mind, we didn't have much money...\" Not that no-budget films are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-fest. <br /><br />Actually, 'Absence of Light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema: It's the only time I've seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me. Charismatic actors like David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no-names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so dull, you'll cease to care about anything or anyone.<br /><br />After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and walked out of the theater. Not surprisingly, so did most of the cast members in attendance. <br /><br />Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this.

{"value":"This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances from \"the next generation of beautiful losers\" are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright's) or bland under-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard's own versions by using a little restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film- like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots, shaky blurred camera work, use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments (making it harder to hear what's being said) and a spooky, pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments (an attempt at added gravitas?).

{"value":"This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this. I imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really gets you is that it could have been good. The directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. The multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is able to achieve is revenge against any Italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him, as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork. He does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains...can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there

{"value":"I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark's worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv.

{"value":"There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not acknowledge this film. It consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time. The acting is horrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film. \"A buddy film,\" \"an action/comedy,\" \"mystery.\" Seems half way through, he gives up, and is just along for the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita prior to involving themselves with this, had spent years pounding out their crafts on the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita had already been a star in his own right, acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult TV and movie classics as \"Happy Days,\" and the dismal but affable \"Mr. T and Tina.\" And won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film, \"Midway,\" \"The Karate Kid,\" and a host of others. Mr. Leno can been seen on TV shows dating back to the mid 70s. And was a top performer in the comedy clubs of America. He can be seen in countless TV spots and in major films.

{"value":"Barry, a medical transcriptionist has his mind corroding from his job coupled with memories of an abusive upbringing at the hands of his stepfather, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spirals into madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a bald mute guy) battle for control of his soul. This film is undone by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes. Not to say it's horrible or anything, just that you cal tell that it's only as known as it is on account of Bruce Campbell's rabid fan base (of which I am one) who will likely see anything he's in or involved with in some way.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary with Michael Kallio, and Bruce Campbell; Second commentary by Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport; 'Hating every minute' a 17 minute documentary; deleted and extended scenes; alternate takes; outtakes, footage of the world premiere; Poster & still gallery; Talent bios; and theatrical trailer <br /><br

{"value":"This film was so predictable, that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent, and there's some other big twist still coming. However... it doesn't. He just continues to act creepy, and she continues to ignore it. Mary found very incriminating evidence at his place, and she still trusted him? And what was that \"baiting the trap\"? There was no trap. She confronted him, he said \"excuse me. I have to go kill someone\" He left, and that was the end of it. They make attempts to use other suspects, (like that one older carnival girl at the end) but they're completely underdeveloped. Actually, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the setting is just plain strange... who hangs out in a recycling factory?? Its choppy and nothing is well developed. For example: When she leaves his place after having the beer, and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car... what was that?

{"value":"Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own play about a straight man, recently widowed, learning in the last three weeks he is HIV-positive; he tracks down the one homosexual partner he ever had, brings him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive. Intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it plays out. James Marsden's captive is realistically cynical and snotty, but the actor's own artificial mannerisms are disconcerting--it's like watching a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality-turn from shy guy to kidnapper-on-the-edge isn't convincing, and neither are the conversations the two men have. Marsden's gay party boy isn't apathetic, of course--he's momentarily sympathetic to Speedman's plight--but he doesn't react or behave the way any homosexual man would in this circumstance. The movie isn't a cop-out, exactly, but it is a fraud, handicapped further by the bad editing, the poorly-conceived flashbacks, the low-budget production, and the big finale which smacks of silly

{"value":"I tried to like this slasher, like I try to enjoy all slasher films. I mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong. But Unhinged I think is an example of that formula going wrong. The main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house. It was as if they were under sedation, and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight. The film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction saps it of those, and leaves the movie pretty dull. It's a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have have been ace. The story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls, and the daughter in the old house. There's some good nudity, and occasional splashy bloodletting, just not enough to give the film the kick it needed. The finale is pretty twisted and fearsome, and does give the film a big lift but sadly, its too little too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure slasher films. There's a fair amount of potential, but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile.","finished_norm":["i","try","to","like","thi","slasher","like","i","try","to","enjoi","all","slasher","film","i","mean","mindless","slai","mix","with","a","littl","nuditi","and","some","suspens","how","can","you","go","wrong","but","unhing","i","think","be","a","exampl","of","that","formula","go","wrong","the","main","issu","be","the","horribl","act","of","the","main","three","girl","that","land","up","in","the","hous","it","be","a","if","thei","be","under","sedat","and","it","stop","me","from","ever","get","interest","in","their","plight","the","film","aim","for","suspens","and","creepi","but","the","by","the","number","direct","sap","it","of","that","and","leav","the","movi","pretti","dull","it","a","shame","becaus","if","the","movi","be","well","execut","it","would","have","have","be","ac","the","stori","and","charact","be","pretti","creepi","and","there","be","some","dark","and","bizarr","humor","moment","of","interact","between","the","mother","the","girl","and","the","daughter","in","the","old","hous","there","some","good","nuditi","and","occasion","splashi","bloodlet","just","not","enough","to","give","the","film","the","kick","it","ne","the","final","be","pretti","twist","and","fearsom","and","doe","give","the","film","a","big","lift","but","sadli","it","too","littl","too","late","so","in","my","opinion","on","to","avoid","unless","you","realli","love","obscur","slasher","film","there","a","fair","amount","of","potenti","but","the","film","deliv","too","littl","to","be","worthwhil"],"filtered":["try","like","thi","slasher","like","try","enjoi","slasher","film","mean","mindless","slai","mix","littl","nuditi","suspens","go","wrong","unhing","think","exampl","formula","go","wrong","main","issu","horribl","act","main","three","girl","land","hous","thei","sedat","stop","ever","get","interest","plight","film","aim","suspens","creepi","number","direct","sap","leav","movi","pretti","dull","shame","becaus","movi","well","execut","ac","stori","charact","pretti","creepi","dark","bizarr","humor","moment","interact","mother","girl","daughter","old","hous","good","nuditi","occasion","splashi","bloodlet","enough","give","film","kick","ne","final","pretti","twist","fearsom","doe","give","film","big","lift","sadli","littl","late","opinion","avoid","unless","realli","love","obscur","slasher","film","fair","amount","potenti","film","deliv","littl","worthwhil"],"filtered2":["try","like","slasher","like","try","enjoi","slasher","mean","mindless","slai","mix","littl","nuditi","suspens","go","wrong","unhing","think","exampl","formula","go","wrong","main","issu","horribl","act","main","three","girl","land","hous","sedat","stop","ever","get","interest","plight","aim","suspens","creepi","number","direct","sap","leav","pretti","dull","shame","becaus","well","execut","ac","stori","charact","pretti","creepi","dark","bizarr","humor","moment","interact","mother","girl","daughter","old","hous","good","nuditi","occasion","splashi","bloodlet","enough","give","kick","ne","final","pretti","twist","fearsom","doe","give","big","lift","sadli","littl","late","opinion","avoid","unless","realli","love","obscur","slasher","fair","amount","potenti","deliv","littl","worthwhil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,10,12,13,14,17,18,20,21,22,25,30,36,44,54,60,67,74,78,82,84,88,93,102,110,150,156,179,188,200,213,224,230,307,315,335,367,368,369,397,426,435,460,517,529,538,547,574,612,662,705,731,755,772,783,806,825,869,870,877,1099,1176,1205,1383,1817,1875,1917,2016,2085,4082,4481,4509,4647,5033],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,10,12,13,14,17,18,20,21,22,25,30,36,44,54,60,67,74,78,82,84,88,93,102,110,150,156,179,188,200,213,224,230,307,315,335,367,368,369,397,426,435,460,517,529,538,547,574,612,662,705,731,755,772,783,806,825,869,870,877,1099,1176,1205,1383,1817,1875,1917,2016,2085,4082,4481,4509,4647,5033],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,3.3525245991777624,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,2.6728839783437044,2.9360366939211433,1.604729392502474,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,1.9570915389266579,1.9486336368009016,6.019259360045842,2.020196584395323,4.442538903180445,2.0317223413467334,2.035389827120098,2.087553710177271,2.1290479736304078,2.332712011146513,2.3451551414151686,5.01593744596019,2.5378812223426954,2.5308211829319704,5.6865257437877545,2.689504733779216,2.7121382192999195,2.8767855639325206,2.854312708080462,2.908534262247101,3.0791938792932125,3.1346146732346205,3.121829110937649,3

{"value":"Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The \"witty\" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a \"ho\"). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this!

{"value":"This movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind. Firstly, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs? Secondly... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? And thirdly... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released. You really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this... and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. The movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all.

{"value":"In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. A serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. \"American Nightmare\" is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday, 13th. Then, the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating Halloween. From this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of C production. However, the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting. With a better beginning and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie.

It is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater (prophetic?) and when he pops up (only twice) the blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period. There is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on - it is a left hand.","finished_norm":["what","thi","a","canadian","produc","zombi","flick","that","i","have","never","hear","of","befor","a","mortician","work","on","the","bodi","of","a","recent","deceas","young","man","thi","allow","for","a","extend","flashback","that","show","how","the","gui","get","there","basic","he","and","friend","go","to","a","cemeteri","on","fridai","the","th","and","rais","the","dead","thank","to","hi","silli","chant","cut","back","to","the","morgu","where","our","dead","bodi","come","back","to","life","and","kill","the","mortician","and","owner","who","get","hi","ey","pop","out","the","final","wtf","shoot","have","the","funer","home","owner","in","a","straight","jacket","and","scream","i","be","not","crazi","amazingli","he","have","hi","eyebal","backbr","br","run","a","scant","minut","thi","be","certainli","on","odditi","in","zombi","cinema","it","feel","a","lot","long","but","put","me","in","some","kind","of","tranc","where","i","can","not","stop","watch","the","film","conjur","have","on","of","that","if","you","see","thi","imag","turn","awai","from","the","screen","gag","it","be","the","imag","of","a","old","man","get","sick","in","a","theater","prophet","and","when","he","pop","up","onli","twice","the","blood","begin","to","flow","the","scene","be","pretti","damn","gori","for","the","time","period","there","be","a","great","gaff","where","a","zombi","chop","off","a","girl","right","hand","with","a","shovel","but","when","he","pull","the","fake","hand","into","the","frame","to","chomp","on","it","be","a","leav","hand"],"filtered":["thi","canadian","produc","zombi","flick","never","hear","befor","mortician","work","bodi","recent","deceas","young","man","thi","allow","extend","flashback","show","gui","get","basic","friend","go","cemeteri","fridai","th","rais","dead","thank","hi","silli","chant","cut","back","morgu","dead","bodi","come","back","life","kill","mortician","owner","get","hi","ey","pop","final","wtf","shoot","funer","home","owner","straight","jacket","scream","crazi","amazingli","hi","eyebal","backbr","br","run","scant","minut","thi","certainli","odditi","zombi","cinema","feel","lot","long","put","kind","tranc","stop","watch","film","conjur","see","thi","imag","turn","awai","screen","gag","imag","old","man","get","sick","theater","prophet","pop","onli","twice","blood","begin","flow","scene","pretti","damn","gori","time","period","great","gaff","zombi","chop","girl","right","hand","shovel","pull","fake","hand","frame","chomp","leav","hand"],"filtered2":["canadian","produc","zombi","flick","never","hear","befor","mortician","work","bodi","recent","deceas","young","man","allow","extend","flashback","show","gui","get","basic","friend","go","cemeteri","fridai","th","rais","dead","thank","silli","chant","cut","back","morgu","dead","bodi","come","back","life","kill","mortician","owner","get","ey","pop","final","wtf","shoot","funer","home","owner","straight","jacket","scream","crazi","amazingli","eyebal","backbr","run","scant","minut","certainli","odditi","zombi","cinema","feel","lot","long","put","kind","tranc","stop","watch","conjur","see","imag","turn","awai","screen","gag","imag","old","man","get","sick","theater","prophet","pop","onli","twice","blood","begin","flow","scene","pretti","damn","gori","time","period","great","gaff","zombi","chop","girl","right","hand","shovel","pull","fake","hand","frame","chomp","leav","hand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,8,11,19,28,34,39,42,43,45,48,51,55,59,63,67,72,74,75,76,78,79,84,96,99,117,121,122,135,137,147,155,156,159,161,192,216,228,235,257,261,268,281,286,302,303,315,355,376,385,389,409,424,521,526,544,548,562,639,651,712,740,743,778,853,889,952,998,1045,1051,1256,1400,1488,1674,1778,1863,1884,1899,2235,2430,3150,3157,3705,3927,4188,4295,4540,5239,6123,6143,6579,7195,7950,8329,8481],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,8,11,19,28,34,39,42,43,45,48,51,55,59,63,67,72,74,75,76,78,79,84,96,99,117,121,122,135,137,147,155,156,159,161,192,216,228,235,257,261,268,281,286,302,303,315,355,376,385,389,409,424,521,526,544,548,562,639,651,712,740,743,778,853,889,952,998,1045,1051,1256,1400,1488,1674,1778,1863,1884,1899,2235,2430,3150,3157,3705,3927,4188,4295,4540,5239,6123,6143,6579,7195,7950,8329,8481],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.389902141215977,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.312380678011735,1.5452294193519092,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,3.632592212924433,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.9536997889255368,1.869325444920

{"value":"Simply put, this is a simplistic and one dimensional film. The title, The Rise to Evil, should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with Hitler's character. Rather, from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background, we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian, seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show. The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? Ultimately, making him such a one-dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing (one must ask how the inept, phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Time's man of the year). This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century, and try to delve into his mind. Instead, it basically just says, \"Hey!

{"value":"This movie is easily the worst of the series. Though New Line might just be looking at sales, they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3D ending. It wasn't that the 3-D was good either, because it was 50's 3D with the red and blue lenses(anaglyph.) It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Beyond that this movie was so poorly done! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse directing. This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a \"Looney Tunes\" episode.<br /><br />Seriously, not for horror audience, because it is corny and not scary, and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds. Just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted.<br /><br />I remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten. This is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","easili","the","wrong","of","the","seri","though","new","line","mai","just","be","look","at","sale","thei","all","know","the","onli","reason","thi","on","make","much","monei","than","the","on","prior","be","due","to","it","have","end","it","be","not","that","the","have","be","good","either","becaus","it","be","have","with","the","red","and","blue","lensesanaglyph","it","be","just","the","fact","that","peopl","want","to","see","what","it","would","look","like","beyond","that","thi","movi","be","so","poorli","do","bad","script","bad","charact","bad","act","wrong","direct","thi","movi","be","try","to","push","the","camp","factor","almost","to","the","point","of","be","like","a","loonei","tune","episodebr","br","serious","not","for","horror","audienc","becaus","it","be","corni","and","not","scari","and","not","funni","or","amus","for","comedi","crowd","just","a","total","mess","with","some","realli","bad","cameo","that","be","still","try","to","plai","thi","whole","thing","a","camp","and","have","it","fall","wai","short","of","what","thei","probabl","wantedbr","br","i","rememb","much","of","u","who","have","be","fan","of","thi","seri","be","just","prai","that","it","would","end","at","thi","point","becaus","of","how","bad","it","have","get","thi","be","on","of","the","movi","that","help","take","horror","out","of","popular","and","ride","a","fad","of","belief","that","audienc","realli","want","to","laugh","with","some","stupid","comedi","than","see","a","good","and","scari","horror","film"],"filtered":["thi","movi","easili","wrong","seri","though","new","line","mai","look","sale","thei","know","onli","reason","thi","make","much","monei","prior","due","end","good","either","becaus","red","blue","lensesanaglyph","fact","peopl","want","see","look","like","beyond","thi","movi","poorli","bad","script","bad","charact","bad","act","wrong","direct","thi","movi","try","push","camp","factor","almost","point","like","loonei","tune","episodebr","br","serious","horror","audienc","becaus","corni","scari","funni","amus","comedi","crowd","total","mess","realli","bad","cameo","still","try","plai","thi","whole","thing","camp","fall","wai","short","thei","probabl","wantedbr","br","rememb","much","u","fan","thi","seri","prai","end","thi","point","becaus","bad","get","thi","movi","help","take","horror","popular","ride","fad","belief","audienc","realli","want","laugh","stupid","comedi","see","good","scari","horror","film"],"filtered2":["easili","wrong","though","new","line","mai","look","sale","know","onli","reason","make","monei","prior","due","end","good","either","becaus","red","blue","lensesanaglyph","fact","peopl","want","see","look","like","beyond","poorli","bad","script","bad","charact","bad","act","wrong","direct","try","push","camp","factor","almost","point","like","loonei","tune","episodebr","serious","horror","audienc","becaus","corni","scari","funni","amus","comedi","crowd","total","mess","realli","bad","cameo","still","try","plai","whole","thing","camp","fall","wai","short","probabl","wantedbr","rememb","u","fan","prai","end","point","becaus","bad","get","help","take","horror","popular","ride","fad","belief","audienc","realli","want","laugh","stupid","comedi","see","good","scari","horror"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,10,11,13,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,29,31,33,36,37,40,46,62,64,66,77,83,86,87,95,97,102,107,111,112,126,127,131,133,136,140,148,168,170,184,185,207,272,290,371,396,398,407,502,568,583,708,779,908,951,1002,1041,1199,1257,1389,1486,1512,1571,1720,2074,2493,3084,6153,7733],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,10,11,13,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,29,31,33,36,37,40,46,62,64,66,77,83,86,87,95,97,102,107,111,112,126,127,131,133,136,140,148,168,170,184,185,207,272,290,371,396,398,407,502,568,583,708,779,908,951,1002,1041,1199,1257,1389,1486,1512,1571,1720,2074,2493,3084,6153,7733],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,5.341785428361037,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,2.393227744058217,1.162015545335049,3.893772050208532,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,2.9360366939211433,2.975308642954861,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,3.859446346783224,1.9463902258768238,6.876956393220216,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.087553710177271,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,4.871935874217273,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985
