{"value":"Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house. They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build.<br /><br />This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel. Very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning. Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script. It's awful and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down are fine form, unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise.<br /><br />I can't really recommend this movie. While not really bad, its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away. I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end. If you're interested I'd try it on cable, but I wouldn't lay out good money to see it.","finished_norm":["tenant","two","writer","struggl","to","complet","their","book","in","a","all","but","empti","apart","hous","thei","at","help","each","other","and","then","slowli","the","tension","between","them","begin","to","buildbr","br","thi","be","base","upon","a","bernard","malamud","novel","and","unfortun","everyon","speak","a","though","thei","be","in","that","novel","veri","littl","of","the","dialog","be","natur","it","purpl","and","brim","with","shade","of","mean","it","a","if","a","colleg","english","major","with","a","head","full","of","pretens","write","the","script","it","aw","and","i","find","myself","instantli","immun","to","anyth","the","film","have","to","sai","which","be","a","shame","sinc","the","film","be","popul","with","great","perform","from","top","to","bottom","snoop","dog","on","down","be","fine","form","unfortun","none","of","them","can","over","come","the","fals","of","the","word","and","the","premisebr","br","i","ca","not","realli","recommend","thi","movi","while","not","realli","bad","it","veri","preachi","and","pretenti","to","the","point","of","make","you","want","to","walk","awai","i","lose","interest","littl","then","a","of","the","wai","in","and","have","to","struggl","to","get","to","the","end","if","you","re","interest","i","have","try","it","on","cabl","but","i","would","not","lie","out","good","monei","to","see","it"],"filtered":["tenant","two","writer","struggl","complet","book","empti","apart","hous","thei","help","slowli","tension","begin","buildbr","br","thi","base","upon","bernard","malamud","novel","unfortun","everyon","speak","though","thei","novel","veri","littl","dialog","natur","purpl","brim","shade","mean","colleg","english","major","head","full","pretens","write","script","aw","find","instantli","immun","anyth","film","sai","shame","sinc","film","popul","great","perform","top","bottom","snoop","dog","fine","form","unfortun","none","come","fals","word","premisebr","br","ca","realli","recommend","thi","movi","realli","bad","veri","preachi","pretenti","point","make","want","walk","awai","lose","interest","littl","wai","struggl","get","end","re","interest","try","cabl","lie","good","monei","see"],"filtered2":["tenant","two","writer","struggl","complet","book","empti","apart","hous","help","slowli","tension","begin","buildbr","base","upon","bernard","malamud","novel","unfortun","everyon","speak","though","novel","veri","littl","dialog","natur","purpl","brim","shade","mean","colleg","english","major","head","full","pretens","write","script","aw","find","instantli","immun","anyth","shame","sinc","popul","great","perform","top","bottom","snoop","dog","fine","form","unfortun","none","come","fals","word","premisebr","ca","realli","recommend","realli","bad","veri","preachi","pretenti","point","make","want","walk","awai","lose","interest","littl","wai","struggl","get","end","re","interest","try","cabl","lie","good","monei","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,9,13,14,15,24,33,34,36,37,38,47,51,60,65,66,68,77,81,86,88,103,104,105,126,138,147,151,155,162,185,208,213,221,227,246,258,287,294,298,334,336,344,364,370,404,432,456,464,474,572,574,588,609,630,650,689,814,842,860,887,1047,1144,1375,1533,1803,1997,3184,3428,3454,4102,4312,5064,6365,6763,7246],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,9,13,14,15,24,33,34,36,37,38,47,51,60,65,66,68,77,81,86,88,103,104,105,126,138,147,151,155,162,185,208,213,221,227,246,258,287,294,298,334,336,344,364,370,404,432,456,464,474,572,574,588,609,630,650,689,814,842,860,887,1047,1144,1375,1533,1803,1997,3184,3428,3454,4102,4312,5064,6365,6763,7246],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,2.2635883139467947,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,3.676353282473182,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.2391270689902285,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.8002454868101863,2.3074766467914385,2.3586007221245198,2.518833027372001,2.6289494000279396,2.8432628718938773,2.6423424573643777,5.201064374608725,2.673149229007135,2.7061321952397077,2.841890188081905,2.886778509330039,2.7819920465008363,2.942840385588056,2.9233055795674137,2.983093497946387,2.9878441007049847,2.9958122703541616,3.1419947805322432,3.235085203598255,3.3001658770939146,3.2872346624216657,7.293333077447711,3.4933926673701317,3.5039747767006686,3.63750

{"value":"A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment \"A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's\".<br /><br />This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.<br /><br />No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight.

{"value":"I hated this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute. That always seemed odd to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me and I wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won.

{"value":"I saw \"Myra Breckinridge\" when it first came out in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old at the time, who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. On top of that, I had read the Gore Vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie at a local drive-in and about half way through I was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe I'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It wasn't \"smart\" or \"trendy\", it was gross and sloppy. All the actors were tone deaf and the director didn't have the slightest idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history. As one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud, which would never do for the legendary Ms. West. Oh no, the plot is changed so she sexually beats HIM up, very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why?

{"value":"Nintendo!!! YOU #%$@ERS!!! How could you do this to me? I can't believe it...this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along....oh God...where do I even begin? The plot SUCKED. The voice acting SUCKED. The animation SUCKED. The ending REALLY SUCKED. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO. And to Futuramafan1987, who said this was the greatest movie ever, you are a TOOL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. This isn't a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie....and then there was Pikachu's Adventure...don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film. It is, in all truth, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. Don't go watch this at any costs.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Go out, find every copy of this movie that you can, and burn it.

{"value":"I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it scared me witless for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to (obviously) the violence. My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie. I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it ;0) I am currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it is really a great story. However I don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. Gives me a little heart palpitation every time. Yah I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids, read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content.

{"value":"This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With. Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent, stayed up late to do so, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance,4% everything else, 1% history if that. It's what I call a bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter's character. Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls, an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days, it would have either been the stockade or the infantry. Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce.

{"value":"The good thing about this that's at least fresh: Almost no movies about dance music and the club scene (if even made) hit the cinemas. And it radiates lots of energy too, from the music to the portrayal of Ibiza.<br /><br />But the main problem is that it can't decide what it wants to be. Although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap, the makers also realized they wouldn't want to play copycat. However, it fails grossly on the jokes because it's not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped. And it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes, so why not edit it down to 75? The production department and cinematography still try to save the day (e.g. Paul's home).<br /><br />In a strange way and unexpectedly so It's all gone Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous.

{"value":"This budget-starved Italian action/sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) to stop an evil businessman (Academy Award nominee John Ireland) from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. You got all that? Despite such a loopy plot, this is actually quite a bore and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS sneers at it with contempt. Honestly, the most (intentionally) creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back-to-back. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare this Ireland's worst film on his resume but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS was listed on there.

{"value":"You could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that statement wrong. Most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to. They play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a few words, but I'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film.<br /><br />I had to fast forward the parts where Jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. I'd have to say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. Quite frankly, I'd rather not spend my time watching Jack chew noisily with an open mouth. Personally, I could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.<br /><br />Outside of my own personal dementia, the film really lacked anything worth it's time. There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging.

{"value":"I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo it, but not last night). Woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast), and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB. This is really really bad. the writing is boring, but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.<br /><br />Yes it is shot video. Mind you, that is shot on VIDEO, not DIGITAL VIDEO. It does look like a soap opera. The clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror.<br /><br />I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. yes, i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not daring, not bold, not boring, just stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say \"well give me an example\". I cant.

{"value":"In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego, only beaten by the new king kong movie. Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen, from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat. He looks just silly wearing the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, He is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought....) and the acting was horrible. This movie has one good thing going for it, and it's name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. What this movie needed was the cast of \"lois and clark\" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and a different story.

{"value":"This film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot. The entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends (including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner... another girl... that's right they're lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason). Unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through. Also unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit? The acting is terrible I think but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it. I give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap.

{"value":"This film sold for one-dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I lost anything for watching this film, except my TIME. Enjoyed the acting of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script. The story is about college students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game, he stops making love to her and acts like a Monk. There are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former World Trade Center and also in the Observation floor and Roof area. It is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good film, except for Tom Hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of

{"value":"I wasn't as \"lucky\" as some of the others commenting on this film: i have never seen anything else out of the...shall we say... \"fecund\" mind of Sarno. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dancing are not really that attractive. I kinda liked Fraulein Crank(?)...she was so homely , she was cute! The acting was pretty stale, also, though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem. Trying to follow the plot was a major chore: was there one, really? I do heartily agree with one other comment: for a vampire movie, there's not much blood. Yep, if you want GOOD bloodsucking flicks, check out such Hammer classics as \"Horror of Dracula\" and (my personal favourite) \"Brides of Dracula\".<br /><br />The most (unintentionally) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats...which you never SEE!...the bats, I mean.<br /><br />Okay as a time-waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the

{"value":"I can't understand why so many peoples praised this show. Twin peaks is one of the most boring titles I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />Now I have seen all season 1 episodes, and seeing season 2 episode 1. Simply I can't take this show anymore.<br /><br />1) Where is the proper induction in criminal investigation?<br /><br />In season 1, there was a scene that agent Cooper throws stones to a bottle. Can you guess why he did that? He just want to identify murderer by doing this 'joke' while mentioning supernatural ability given by Tibet dream. Wow!!!<br /><br />2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show.<br /><br />For example, season 2 started with a 'funny' scene that a dumb old man serves agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper are laying down on the floor.( He got the gun shoots in his belly already. ) This old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments. That's all.<br /><br />This scene is really boring and even long ( 3 min 30 sec....

{"value":"Thanks to a dull, dimensionless screenplay by Neil Simon, and lackluster direction from Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a shrill showcase for Marsha Mason who received her third of four Oscar nods for Chapter Two giving the same performance here that she gave in Cinnderella Liberty(73), The Goodbye Girl(77), Audrey Rose(78) and Only When I Laugh(81);only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film for Moore having previously directed Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective(78) and Murder By Death(76). Caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and there's virtually no establishing detail. The first half is a less-than-captivating, meet cute, coy romance between a blinkered Caan and a chipper Mason, and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half. The NYC locations as well as Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction.

{"value":"As an ordinary movie-watcher I can't say I enjoyed watching this one. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible. OK, I understand, soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack into the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away, without having asked a question (in a proper way). It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war.. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs considerable work.<br /><br />It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural.<br /><br />This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why they gave it an Oscar? Why SIX?

{"value":"A teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide. It leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking a lot of questions...and blaming themselves.<br /><br />Good idea, badly handled. For starters this HAS been done before 1988--mostly in TV movies and After School Specials. Aside from some swearing and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating) this added nothing new. The outcome is predictable and Reeve's attempts at acting were truly painful to watch. He's good NOW but not in 1988. Aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy.<br /><br />That aside the movie is dull. I saw every scene coming and every \"surprise\" was telegraphed. I basically couldn't wait for this thing to get over.<br /><br />I have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it (it bombed BADLY). It still looks lousy almost 20 years later. The subject is worth handling but it's been done better (with better acting) in countless other movies. \"Ordinary People\" comes to mind.

{"value":"How many centuries will pass until the Japanese/Asian horror films abandon the long-haired ghost-woman shtick? Admittedly, they've managed to rip off \"Ringu\" a million times, and often it worked well - which just goes to show that originality isn't that much of a requirement in the horror genre (or that I'm very uncritical and easy to please?). However, this time around I found myself a little restless, somewhat bored. It's not a bad film, but it's at least half-an-hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Plus, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the ring-tone: Miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing. Even though it was played a dozen times I can't even remember it - that's how scary it was. Speaking of Miike, for him this is something of a commercial venture, so if anyone thinks they might be getting perversion of the \"Bijita Q\" or \"Audition\" kind, they're wasting their time.","finished_norm":["how","mani","centuri","will","pass","until","the","japaneseasian","horror","film","abandon","the","longhair","ghostwoman","shtick","admittedli","thei","have","manag","to","rip","off","ringu","a","million","time","and","often","it","work","good","which","just","go","to","show","that","origin","be","not","that","much","of","a","requir","in","the","horror","genr","or","that","i","be","veri","uncrit","and","easi","to","pleas","howev","thi","time","around","i","find","myself","a","littl","restless","somewhat","bore","it","not","a","bad","film","but","it","at","littl","halfanhour","long","than","it","should","be","with","it","absurd","minut","length","compar","to","mani","other","japanes","horror","film","omc","lack","atmospher","and","excit","plu","the","end","be","confus","it","make","no","sens","at","all","a","for","the","rington","miik","can","have","come","up","with","a","melodi","that","be","much","effect","than","that","forgett","littl","thing","even","though","it","be","plai","a","dozen","time","i","ca","not","even","rememb","it","that","how","scari","it","be","speak","of","miik","for","him","thi","be","someth","of","a","commerci","ventur","so","if","anyon","think","thei","mai","be","get","pervers","of","the","bijita","q","or","audit","kind","thei","re","wast","their","time"],"filtered":["mani","centuri","pass","japaneseasian","horror","film","abandon","longhair","ghostwoman","shtick","admittedli","thei","manag","rip","ringu","million","time","often","work","good","go","show","origin","much","requir","horror","genr","veri","uncrit","easi","pleas","howev","thi","time","around","find","littl","restless","somewhat","bore","bad","film","littl","halfanhour","long","absurd","minut","length","compar","mani","japanes","horror","film","omc","lack","atmospher","excit","plu","end","confus","make","sens","rington","miik","come","melodi","much","effect","forgett","littl","thing","even","though","plai","dozen","time","ca","even","rememb","scari","speak","miik","thi","someth","commerci","ventur","anyon","think","thei","mai","get","pervers","bijita","q","audit","kind","thei","re","wast","time"],"filtered2":["mani","centuri","pass","japaneseasian","horror","abandon","longhair","ghostwoman","shtick","admittedli","manag","rip","ringu","million","time","often","work","good","go","show","origin","requir","horror","genr","veri","uncrit","easi","pleas","howev","time","around","find","littl","restless","somewhat","bore","bad","littl","halfanhour","long","absurd","minut","length","compar","mani","japanes","horror","omc","lack","atmospher","excit","plu","end","confus","make","sens","rington","miik","come","melodi","effect","forgett","littl","thing","even","though","plai","dozen","time","ca","even","rememb","scari","speak","miik","someth","commerci","ventur","anyon","think","mai","get","pervers","bijita","q","audit","kind","re","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,6,8,9,12,14,15,24,28,29,34,38,40,46,48,50,53,59,68,69,81,83,86,89,98,99,106,108,113,122,158,173,183,290,344,345,346,396,400,427,467,482,487,524,596,744,749,807,825,835,843,928,989,1126,1163,1323,1391,1486,1651,2419,2735,2743,3234,3398,3777,4244,6330,7606],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,6,8,9,12,14,15,24,28,29,34,38,40,46,48,50,53,59,68,69,81,83,86,89,98,99,106,108,113,122,158,173,183,290,344,345,346,396,400,427,467,482,487,524,596,744,749,807,825,835,843,928,989,1126,1163,1323,1391,1486,1651,2419,2735,2743,3234,3398,3777,4244,6330,7606],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,3.7675747436216462,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,3.3525245991777624,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,3.43598877114071,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,1.949757232424728,6.876956393220216,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,2.2489347673732487,2.3106972614914807,2.4368824319140248,2.4885128563647294,2.8612813773965557,2.983093497946387,3.0022328381570844,3.023389038124396,3.291526514503207,3.130944944345658,3.233054746047873,3.342254038012865,3.3154667220492153,3.3220965805878846,3.4028786598293,3.485528930909917,3.700222643192818,3.7165362186843414,3.900174431363043,3.8767358583910254,3.8614098879127985,4.339813719283801,4.017463517886143,4.044492190274062,4.240607069200353,4.2860694432771105,4.383707912841026,4.429617614145104,4.558366596889411,4.6295428753573065,5.102830579804232,5.56236290918267

{"value":"This movie is just boring.<br /><br />It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in \"Amélie Poulain\", but it is too much. The dialogs are pretty bad, some of the worst I have ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I have almost never found him very convincing), his father in the movie plays very badly, the story is dumb, the ending is... stupid.<br /><br />I think I have not dislike a movie so much since \"le pacte des loups\" (brotherhood of the wolf) from Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 movies a year), but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors.<br /><br />I had never commented here (only rated), and when I saw the rating and the comments, I thought I had to write something down.<br /><br />I guess we won't have problems to sell the DVD we were offered : not such a bad movie in our (large) collection !!!<br /><br />I am open minded (I watch SF, westerns,

{"value":"I can only assume that the other reviewers of this \"film\" are stockholders in the production company, as this was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the opening shot of a Rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered \"B-Level.\" Both my wife and I were in a great mood before starting this film, and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie. We knew we hadn't rented Citizen Kane, and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever. However, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage I've ever seen, we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives.<br /><br />If a \"comedy\" with no laughs, terrible acting, thin plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this film is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better--at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene.<br /><br />I cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because I've already wasted almost an hour trying to find

{"value":"The movie has only one flaw, unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece.<br /><br />It starts with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of disputed territories. It fails to address the reason Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. This is why Israel \"occupys\" their land, because those countries lost it in a war they started.<br /><br />The film also claims that Israel has defied the U N by not complying with Resolution 242. Problem is, 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by.....the palestinians, making it void.<br /><br />Many films are put together well, and can really show footage that changes minds, but remember, when watching anything, believe none of what you hear, and only half of what you see.<br /><br />All participants in this film are known critics of Israel, and some have made many

{"value":"Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable.

{"value":"This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the \"Night Gallery\" show back in 1971. The episode starred Sue Lyon (of Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. She bolts out the door, the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. I don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one.

{"value":"There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called \"documentary\" that I found myself shouting at the television.<br /><br />Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD, but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims.<br /><br />He relies on either being inaccurate, not telling the full story, or the old favourite \"government always lies to us\" innuendos, and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims.<br /><br />What's more, his \"exclusive\" or \"unreleased\" footage is freely available over the internet from various sites.<br /><br />Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews, and

{"value":"This UK psychological thriller is known in the United States as CLOSURE. Exploitation of X-Files' Gillian Anderson, who plays an attractive middle aged businesswoman of substance named Alice. She must attend a business party and invites Adam(Danny Dyer), who just installed a security system for her, to be her escort. On the way home, speeding through the woods on a narrow lane, Alice's auto collides with a deer. After pulling the wounded animal off the road, the couple is savagely attacked by a drunken gang of thugs. Adam is beat to a pulp; Alice is gang raped and both are emotionally and physically devastated by the ruthless attack. When the identities of their attackers are discovered, Alice and Adam set out to exact revenge...brutal revenge. The couple at times find themselves at odds on how to deal with the ruthless attackers. Their final decision is to avenge with no mercy. Let there be no mistake, payback IS hell. Also in the cast: Anthony Calf, Ralph Brown, Francesca Fowler and Antony Byrne.

{"value":"I'll keep this short, as I know I don't need to say much.<br /><br />\"Alive\" is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some, but I found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning. The film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found Kitamura's \"Alive\" to be anything but - a lame, extremely boring drama disguised as a thought-provoking action sci-fi flick. I felt like I was suckered into watching this film, based by its intriguing premise and uber-exciting cover art.<br /><br />My suggestion? Pass it up for Kitamura's far more enjoyable freshman effort \"Versus\" or his 2004 riot \"Godzilla: Final Wars\".<br /><br />...And don't get me wrong, I'm always up for a good thinking man's film, but this certainly wasn't it. There was nary a moment that I actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly-preachy, dialogue-heavy movie.<br /><br />If you wanna talk about something... talk about

{"value":"Growing up with the Beast Wars transformers, I wasn't very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I have seen the awesome movie, and now that I have seen the older cartoon on which it's based, I have to say I like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than Beast Wars.<br /><br />Not that I don't like the BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal.<br /><br />I mean, \"AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!\" sounds a lot better than \"MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!\" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me a strong believer that he's a real commander, more so than Optimus Primal.<br /><br />Besides, Powermaster Optimus Prime is a lot more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the web! <br /><br />Megatron in the BW character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series.<br /><br />Besides what's cooler, robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships?

{"value":"Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot (Gee that is one lucky pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's Experiment falls solidly into the latter category. <br /><br />It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost completely plot less 43-minute wait for the money shot. Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non-descript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from the banal (slapping her 50 times, kicking her a hundred), the silly (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around), the fear factor (a bath of maggots and sheep guts) and finally the money shot. (A well executed eyeball piercing). <br /><br />That's it, no plot, no motive, just Blair Witch tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling, \"no one expects the Spanish Inquisition\" during the office chair scene I was bored silly. Staring dumbfounded at the screen, waiting for the money shot.
