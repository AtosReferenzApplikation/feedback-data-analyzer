{"value":"I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I said to him,\" You've got to be kidding. Is this some sort of joke?\" He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. \"What was it supposed to be?\" I asked. \"A propaganda movie made for children?\" The plot is stupid. The acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. Please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your DVD or Video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had made Razzies in the '40s, this would have won in every category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious sobriquet of \"Stairway to Heaven.\")","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","recent","becaus","a","friend","bring","it","with","him","from","nyc","after","minut","i","sai","to","him","you","have","get","to","be","kid","be","thi","some","sort","of","joke","he","think","it","be","good","i","tell","him","that","i","think","it","be","probabl","on","of","the","silli","movi","ever","make","what","be","it","suppos","to","be","i","ask","a","propaganda","movi","make","for","child","the","plot","be","stupid","the","act","be","the","wrong","ever","for","much","of","the","princip","and","frankli","peopl","who","look","at","thi","sort","of","tripe","and","think","it","have","anyth","to","do","with","life","love","or","even","afterlif","of","which","it","offer","a","incredibli","idiot","viewn","some","psychiatr","help","pleas","if","someon","try","to","get","you","to","stick","thi","in","your","dvd","or","video","player","consid","it","like","you","would","a","viru","introduc","into","your","computerit","wo","not","destroi","your","player","but","it","will","destroi","your","even","if","thei","have","make","razzi","in","the","thi","would","have","win","in","everi","categori","p","it","conjur","go","under","the","dubiou","sobriquet","of","stairwai","to","heaven"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","recent","becaus","friend","bring","nyc","minut","sai","get","kid","thi","sort","joke","think","good","tell","think","probabl","silli","movi","ever","make","suppos","ask","propaganda","movi","make","child","plot","stupid","act","wrong","ever","much","princip","frankli","peopl","look","thi","sort","tripe","think","anyth","life","love","even","afterlif","offer","incredibli","idiot","viewn","psychiatr","help","pleas","someon","try","get","stick","thi","dvd","video","player","consid","like","viru","introduc","computerit","wo","destroi","player","destroi","even","thei","make","razzi","thi","win","everi","categori","p","conjur","go","dubiou","sobriquet","stairwai","heaven"],"filtered2":["see","recent","becaus","friend","bring","nyc","minut","get","kid","sort","joke","think","good","tell","think","probabl","silli","ever","make","suppos","ask","propaganda","make","child","plot","stupid","act","wrong","ever","princip","frankli","peopl","look","sort","tripe","think","anyth","life","love","even","afterlif","offer","incredibli","idiot","viewn","psychiatr","help","pleas","someon","try","get","stick","dvd","video","player","consid","like","viru","introduc","computerit","wo","destroi","player","destroi","even","make","razzi","win","everi","categori","p","conjur","go","dubiou","sobriquet","stairwai","heaven"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,16,21,22,23,25,32,36,39,44,54,59,75,85,90,104,114,136,139,148,149,161,180,185,214,240,247,250,269,306,317,346,385,406,416,489,507,562,687,706,738,929,999,1332,1473,1543,1656,1716,2168,2575,2754,4184,4566,4955,6342,6769],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,16,21,22,23,25,32,36,39,44,54,59,75,85,90,104,114,136,139,148,149,161,180,185,214,240,247,250,269,306,317,346,385,406,416,489,507,562,687,706,738,929,999,1332,1473,1543,1656,1716,2168,2575,2754,4184,4566,4955,6342,6769],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,3.200185830788664,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,3.209458785004948,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.9742250248702675,2.011190219103739,2.0477128419653545,2.0728240170322856,2.4433074195966826,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.3018654096236517,2.3253197803590226,2.4323182980210873,2.7097314792693545,2.518833027372001,2.7303758068497004,2.7666071276613566,2.7303758068497004,2.6812935439488212,5.53067134334632,2.8739486825973213,2.8529247828056143,3.023389038124396,3.09496984188738,3.121829110937649,3.1401446412440817,3.3956930001684253,3.365138331846453,3.432149042129413,3.604618302480356,3.6590123745461547,7.479663562575727,3.9954846111673676,8.260518024062975,4.383707912841026,4.535724120139652,4.706176101378222,4.798834931860927,4.751432692966343,5.463272006538442,5.243909178064138,5.3064295350454715,5.878215858601149,6.0662680901040895,6.214688095222362,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.182139449309388E-5,6.140451837736474E-5,6.188187995552273E-5,6.152432579388997E-5,6.152533380069945E-5,0.04257505059234963,6.162206286596612E-5,6.141336022678195E-5,6.155143984839688E-5,0.02177758769842246,0.7967689606107924,6.13142255232256E-5,6.245862513707157E-5,6.334961114906214E-5,6.135893521685329E-5,6.118936559380169E-5,0.08951305577403798,6.16278363

{"value":"Description: Corny, utterly stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (I'm guessing this...) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world:<br /><br />Spare yourself, spare your time, life, and money, by NOT--I repeat, NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie. This movie is so corny, it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You might actually admire it. (Like I said before, IF you have a one-digit IQ)<br /><br />With about 12 actors of your own, a few puppets you bought at a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, I gaurentee you'll make a

{"value":"Mix exotic tropical locations, babes in skimpy attire, explosions, good-looking Dudley Do-Right clones, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), a little martial arts and a sexy villainess (Tracy Lor.....er, sorry...Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you'd think you'd be in for some escapist fun. Not so! This is a dreary TV movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a \"Charlie's Angels\" deal,it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent C.A. movies. This abomination is best described as a THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris film. Nowhere near as much fun as Andy's \"Hard Ticket To Hawaii\", although some of the fight scenes are decent enough. The girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while. There's better genre stuff that this out there. Oh yeah, and the \"babes\" aren't as hot as they like to think they are.

{"value":"I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, M.D.. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially inept out of choice, similar to Laurie's character House, but without the acerbic wit that Laurie brings to House. Meanwhile, Tucci's 'straight guy', the emphatic doctor Seger, is not developed into a more interesting character, like the fallible 'straight guys' Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be a co-incidence.<br /><br />Someone at CBS obviously noticed the success of House, M.D. and told his staff to get him (her) a similar show, hoping that mimicry would prove successful. However, copying a show like House demands the same high level balance of wit and suspense and Tucci and company are just not up to the challenge.<br /><br />I didn't know the show was canceled until

{"value":"I had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I have been attending this festival for over 5 years, and I have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion. However, 'First Bite' has reached a brand new low in film. In spite of being shot in beautiful locations, with the occasional, exquisite close up of fabulous food, the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until I was practically begging for it to end.<br /><br />The lead actor, David La Haye, completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie, portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end. Additional sub-plots, such as eating disorders, were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point.<br /><br />A theme of mysticism was

{"value":"\"You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive.\" Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi Yet despite the odd gem like that, Superman and the Mole-Men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. It's beyond cheap (the one shot of Superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them.

{"value":"Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they don't really run the show. First, they're broken into 2 groups - Moe, as \"Shorty\" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so there's not a whole lot of full team work. The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tiresome, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is silly, and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first stroke, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all the non-Curley stuff, but this little dogie is pretty lousy.","finished_norm":["have","just","see","thi","on","tmc","it","fresh","in","my","mind","it","obviou","that","while","the","stoog","be","featur","star","thei","do","not","realli","run","the","show","thei","re","break","into","group","moe","a","shorti","and","larri","and","curli","a","a","pair","of","vagrant","so","there","not","a","whole","lot","of","full","team","work","the","love","stori","that","fuel","the","plot","be","uninterest","the","two","ladi","be","the","onli","on","with","ani","act","abil","there","anoth","group","of","music","stoog","that","be","unfunni","unless","you","consid","their","attempt","at","be","funni","to","be","sadli","buffoonish","the","music","be","tiresom","thei","drive","car","to","the","ranch","and","then","depend","on","hors","the","dorki","western","wear","be","silli","and","there","a","aw","lot","of","the","movi","with","no","stoog","on","camera","by","the","wai","thi","be","obvious","after","curlei","stroke","and","hi","reduc","energi","level","be","clear","vernon","dent","appear","earli","on","in","a","uncredit","role","i","love","everyth","thi","gui","ever","do","includ","all","the","noncurlei","stuff","but","thi","littl","dogi","be","pretti","lousi"],"filtered":["see","thi","tmc","fresh","mind","obviou","stoog","featur","star","thei","realli","run","show","thei","re","break","group","moe","shorti","larri","curli","pair","vagrant","whole","lot","full","team","work","love","stori","fuel","plot","uninterest","two","ladi","onli","ani","act","abil","anoth","group","music","stoog","unfunni","unless","consid","attempt","funni","sadli","buffoonish","music","tiresom","thei","drive","car","ranch","depend","hors","dorki","western","wear","silli","aw","lot","movi","stoog","camera","wai","thi","obvious","curlei","stroke","hi","reduc","energi","level","clear","vernon","dent","appear","earli","uncredit","role","love","everyth","thi","gui","ever","includ","noncurlei","stuff","thi","littl","dogi","pretti","lousi"],"filtered2":["see","tmc","fresh","mind","obviou","stoog","featur","star","realli","run","show","re","break","group","moe","shorti","larri","curli","pair","vagrant","whole","lot","full","team","work","love","stori","fuel","plot","uninterest","two","ladi","onli","ani","act","abil","anoth","group","music","stoog","unfunni","unless","consid","attempt","funni","sadli","buffoonish","music","tiresom","drive","car","ranch","depend","hors","dorki","western","wear","silli","aw","lot","stoog","camera","wai","obvious","curlei","stroke","reduc","energi","level","clear","vernon","dent","appear","earli","uncredit","role","love","everyth","gui","ever","includ","noncurlei","stuff","littl","dogi","pretti","lousi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,11,13,14,17,21,27,28,32,33,44,47,48,54,55,62,68,72,73,78,100,111,118,128,137,138,169,177,193,231,238,266,284,301,305,317,336,341,360,361,383,385,410,445,460,461,472,514,590,705,723,770,847,948,1117,1126,1248,1373,1442,1658,1970,2014,2237,2388,2847,4150,4433,5441,5670,6078,6563,7159,8362],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,11,13,14,17,21,27,28,32,33,44,47,48,54,55,62,68,72,73,78,100,111,118,128,137,138,169,177,193,231,238,266,284,301,305,317,336,341,360,361,383,385,410,445,460,461,472,514,590,705,723,770,847,948,1117,1126,1248,1373,1442,1658,1970,2014,2237,2388,2847,4150,4433,5441,5670,6078,6563,7159,8362],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,3.6227786505458823,1.9536997889255368,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,3.841892750832105,1.8950689206770979,2.0064197866819473,2.1405462403177813,2.1183455303375887,4.70875905096179,2.3409902041158843,2.2939035841256437,2.2907365189289424,2.4214486257841834,2.458149992634611,2.517840471459249,2.7049353070058615,2.597304642813496,2.747702973022204,3.110998680163279,2.8309760279012264,2.8612813773965557,2.8529247828056143,2.9233055795674137,2.933776879434709,3.028335462059722,3.0399731661399314,3.0433232530252132,3.09496984188738,6.414054501606195,3.241201430615691,3.216957819005698,3.358217889001879,3.4222967456864013,3.405285399859865,3.4986697244709752,3.6284289511740746,3.865219416329466,4.0536665665501035,3.900174431363043,4.049068857301474,4.224077767249142,4.456830177669989,4.327618446189983,4.443131333311827,4.477736862489302,4.637773374493822,4.869215728622727,4.9227044135737135,5.290429193699031,5.089758498236879,18.304078229746075,5.907203395474402,5.999576715605417,6.489124940924123,6.660975197850782,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353,6.725513718988353,6.94

{"value":"What boob at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place the studly Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army worker?? Ironically enough, another handsome future star, Cary Grant, also played a Salvation Army guy just two years later in the highly overrated SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I guess in hindsight it's pretty easy to see the folly of these roles, but I still wonder WHO thought that Salvation Army guys are \"HOT\" and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. A long time ago, I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the Volunteers of America) and I NEVER saw any studly guys working there (and that includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I should have gotten a job with the Salvation Army instead!<br /><br />So, for the extremely curious, this is a good film to look out for, but for everyone else, it's poor writing, sloppy dialog

{"value":"Going into a movie like I this, I was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills.....what I got was even less.<br /><br />Christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit. Horrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday joe.....cept for the fact he's obsessed with Santa. After his boss makes fun of him he goes insane, dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss. An unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, he drives his van off a cliff.....into the moon. Not the best ending I've seen but it was original.<br /><br />It was a slow paced, boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when Harry went apeshyt on the church goers.

{"value":"I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally make for an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again. The acting was so awful that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them. The script was so poor, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I shouldn't be in the least surprised. The direction and production is so amateur, I wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again, I can't imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst film I have seen in my entire

{"value":"This apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking; but FEEDING THE MASSES comes off lame as some of the stiff-legged zombies stalking the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus Virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations. A couple of brave, but dumb, souls at Channel 5 TV News feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand. An eager reporter(Racheal Morris)and her cameraman(William Garberina), with the aid of a military escort(Patrick Cohen), risk life and limb to present a 'live' broadcast to show the doom at hand. Do yourself a favor and don't watch. This thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad. Acting is atrocious and the flesh-hungry zombies are almost comical. Also appearing are: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan.

{"value":"Skippy from \"Family Ties\" plays Eddie, a wussy 'metal' nerd who gets picked on. When his favorite wussy 'metal' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn't want to take it as far as Sammi does. Which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say, \"Rock Star\". OK, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from \"Family Ties\" I haven't a clue. The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency, I applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy:Elise Richards gets topless, an

{"value":"It's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\" is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I was left shaking my head and asking, why? The acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; \"Well they got your money!\" She's right, don't let them get yours.

{"value":"There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it only hints at both.

{"value":"I had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of 2004's worst films back to back this morning: first, the incoherent CGI-driven emptiness of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then, the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. One cost multimillions and the other cost pennies, but they're both bad. Really, really bad. <br /><br />Up front I should state I'm not the world's biggest Neil Young fan, but he has contributed his share of classic tunes: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest, and Mirror Ball, the man has penned some really great songs. Sadly, there are no great songs in Greendale, and precious few good ones, and the film around which they are built is truly cringeworthy and simplistic political sloganeering. Completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic, Greendale is best left forgotten.

{"value":"I sat through this movie this evening, forcing myself to stick with it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two leads, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were major film stars of their era and I wanted to see them in \"something different,\" which this certainly was. They both gave fine performances, but of distasteful characters.<br /><br />Indeed, the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is, of course, the major exception). What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained.<br /><br />This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that, if Sartre's work is anything like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating Camus' masterful novel The Plague, which dealt with a plague in North

{"value":"Scary Movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words. It makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material, lets just say that.<br /><br />The original Scary Movie was great fun, one of the better 90s spoof movies, coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with Dont Be A Menace to South Central Whilst Drinking Your Juice in the Hood. But what the hell happened?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, i thought the cast and crew change would help matters, but its even worse.<br /><br />Within 20mins i'd smiled twice. Not one laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor. The fact that at this point in writing, the majority of people on this site have voted it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill. When there's great flicks like School of Rock out, which actually have jokes that are *gasp* funny, anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined.<br /><br />no

{"value":"Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director. He had done a remake/reworking of Godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded tremendously. Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd.<br /><br />Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake.<br /><br />The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain Babban.<br /><br />The songs were awful and forgettable. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video.<br /><br />The worst part was the pacing, and the dialogues - which were forgettable.<br /><br />Watching the movie in a theatre, I found myself waiting for the intermission, and then for the ending. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film.

{"value":"THE TEMP (1993) didn't do much theatrical business, but here's the direct-to-video rip-off you didn't want, anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a high scale brokerage firm, who starts getting helpful hints from wide-eyed secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious daddy's girl who will stop at nothing to move up the corporate ladder, including screwing a top broker she can't stand and murdering anyone who gets on her bad side. She digs up skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to cause problems with her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills while making it look like she is responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to get her to embezzle money from the company.<br /><br />Harris and Kelley deliver competent performances, the supporting cast is alright and it's reasonably well put-together, but that doesn't fully compensate

{"value":"I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that I was soon near tears over the $3.99 I had wasted at Blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's acting and her awfully rendered Slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth. I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents. While we're on the topic of talent, Breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe. She clearly has not learned her craft. In fact, she's really quite awful. All the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their Sunday best. Turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on. Don't rent this terrible movie.

{"value":"You talking' to Me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who I have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor. He has a heavy jones for Taxi Driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! He goes from good fella to a surf's up dude over night. His friend can't believe the change (but he scores with Faith Ford and get's a cool paying gig). Can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big?<br /><br />This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution. Who knows, maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this movie.

{"value":"I like Brad Pitt enormously. He is an actor with brains and wit, not to mention face, pectorals and all the rest. Since I saw him in \"Thelma and Louise\" a thought has been bothering me, who does he remind me of? \"Troy\" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious of course. Male, American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless. He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it. \"Kalifornia\" \"12 Monkeys\" \"Fight Club\" \"Snatch\" His self deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately \"Troy\" will soon be forgotten. Only still photographs with Pitt, semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans. Strange, \"Das Boot\" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this? Well, I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot.","finished_norm":["i","like","brad","pitt","enorm","he","be","a","actor","with","brain","and","wit","not","to","mention","face","pector","and","all","the","rest","sinc","i","see","him","in","thelma","and","louis","a","think","have","be","bother","me","who","doe","he","remind","me","of","troi","do","it","for","me","he","be","the","new","brigitt","bardot","the","differ","be","obviou","of","cours","male","american","etc","but","brigitt","bardot","come","to","mind","nonetheless","he","be","so","beauti","that","he","be","at","hi","much","effect","when","he","plai","against","it","kalifornia","monkei","fight","club","snatch","hi","self","deprec","humor","make","him","human","almost","access","fortun","troi","will","soon","be","forget","onli","still","photograph","with","pitt","semi","nake","in","ravish","sprint","posit","will","decor","the","wall","of","legion","of","saliv","fan","strang","da","boot","be","on","of","the","great","film","of","the","part","of","the","th","centuri","what","be","wolfgang","petersen","do","direct","thi","good","i","suppos","it","would","be","veri","hard","to","sai","no","at","the","chanc","of","work","with","the","new","brigitt","bardot"],"filtered":["like","brad","pitt","enorm","actor","brain","wit","mention","face","pector","rest","sinc","see","thelma","louis","think","bother","doe","remind","troi","new","brigitt","bardot","differ","obviou","cours","male","american","etc","brigitt","bardot","come","mind","nonetheless","beauti","hi","much","effect","plai","kalifornia","monkei","fight","club","snatch","hi","self","deprec","humor","make","human","almost","access","fortun","troi","soon","forget","onli","still","photograph","pitt","semi","nake","ravish","sprint","posit","decor","wall","legion","saliv","fan","strang","da","boot","great","film","part","th","centuri","wolfgang","petersen","direct","thi","good","suppos","veri","hard","sai","chanc","work","new","brigitt","bardot"],"filtered2":["like","brad","pitt","enorm","actor","brain","wit","mention","face","pector","rest","sinc","see","thelma","louis","think","bother","doe","remind","troi","new","brigitt","bardot","differ","obviou","cours","male","american","etc","brigitt","bardot","come","mind","nonetheless","beauti","effect","plai","kalifornia","monkei","fight","club","snatch","self","deprec","humor","make","human","almost","access","fortun","troi","soon","forget","onli","still","photograph","pitt","semi","nake","ravish","sprint","posit","decor","wall","legion","saliv","fan","strang","da","boot","great","part","th","centuri","wolfgang","petersen","direct","good","suppos","veri","hard","chanc","work","new","brigitt","bardot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,11,12,15,18,34,40,41,48,51,61,64,87,102,106,131,140,149,162,171,199,204,223,226,232,238,251,285,292,325,369,373,383,417,429,449,486,496,509,644,649,673,851,853,893,1035,1085,1109,1163,1313,1464,1583,2576,2744,2871,2992,3035,3555,3682,4035,4403,4567,5604,5765,6257,6273,8231],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,11,12,15,18,34,40,41,48,51,61,64,87,102,106,131,140,149,162,171,199,204,223,226,232,238,251,285,292,325,369,373,383,417,429,449,486,496,509,644,649,673,851,853,893,1035,1085,1109,1163,1313,1464,1583,2576,2744,2871,2992,3035,3555,3682,4035,4403,4567,5604,5765,6257,6273,8231],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,4.230048743045324,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.2512118082053005,2.317169775997098,2.3253197803590226,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.825563294794476,2.5940874818617203,2.8377834061292515,2.597304642813496,2.6942272927333892,2.808171552082607,2.9752256367457734,2.973659465713028,3.121829110937649,3.0316467233633775,3.0433232530252132,3.1932880749197934,3.2872346624216657,3.2597778161886266,3.3066947359763783,3.293679367864308,3.360519385990158,3.5670958631572662,3.6375061693251913,3.7297814454343623,3.857614816944247,3.8962296530720266,4.017463517886143,4.2860694432771105,4.176068548062782,4.165705761027235,4.2860694432771105,4.4919214974812585,4.506310234933358,4.933754249760298,5.1994574154933035,5.3064295350454715,5.3560264761848435,5.408212229355414,5.604922523601468,11.935656034581672,5.7959777603641776,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.032366538428407,6.389041482367141,13.737229125258052,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.893904090813982E-5,4.860903351428244E-5,4.898

{"value":"I have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.<br /><br />GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the \"supporting supporting actors\" did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun.<br /><br />BAD: The escape from the ape city was terrible. The characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape. Plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?<br /><br />The story was pared down to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.<br /><br />Finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented.

{"value":"I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is...my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this. Not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. There wasn't a single 'scare' moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie 'Halloween' on the TV. All around, it seems like it could've been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could've said 'oh yeah, there she is'. I'm so glad I saw this in a hotel and didn't pay for it as I'd be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this. I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception.

{"value":"A \"friend\", clearly with no taste or class, suggested I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is representative of his oeuvre, I never want to see anything else by him. It is amateurish, self-indulgent, criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish. The \"whore mangler\" of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers. There is a little nudity and some erections, but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's noose. The lighting is appalling, the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted, and the direction is clueless. I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those featured. He spoke like there was something important about his work, but after a viewing of this, I see nothing of any import whatsoever. There is no style, either, and the horrible video effects (like solarization) only enhance the amateurishness. Not even so bad it's fun.

{"value":"Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, stale. <br /><br />The plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante (\"Batwoman\") is intruding on Batman's turf, and while Batman is trying to combat a Penguin/Bane/Rupert Thorne threesome, he's trying to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /><br />There is nothing strikingly wrong about this, but there is nothing really special about it either, noting really made it stick out. <br /><br />Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce's long lost love re surface and mess with his head.<br /><br />Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr Freeze. <br /><br />Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off, Return of the Joker, dug deep with the characters involved. <br /><br />But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in it's

{"value":"Just picked up this film for a buck at National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel like I got ripped-off.<br /><br />I don't know that I've seen a worse film than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a film had I not such enormous respect for the subject matter, that is, Stephen Foster and his music.<br /><br />First, what is it? It's a musical biography? Yeah, lot's of tunes by Foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that reek more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, somebody got PAID to write this drivel? Secondly, the REAL story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why not even come CLOSE to it? Thirdly, what did they have on the great Ray Middleton to get him to do this film? Pictures of him with small boys?? With communists?

{"value":"Demer Daves,is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and \"broken arrow\" remains in everybody's mind.As far as melodrama is concerned,he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli,George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie.Natalie Wood 's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's \"imitation of life\" (see Stahl and Sirk),but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway?Susan Kohner was more credible in \"imitation of life\")and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them:the poor officer,and the wealthy good-looking -and mean- sergeant.Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with?France is shown as a land of tolerance ,where interracial unions are

{"value":"I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews, but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent, the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie, Defoe's wife Giada included, was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers'

{"value":"I am so confused. What in the world was this movie about? What was the killer's motivation? He seemed quite angry, but I have yet to figure out why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. Which I guess would make it a hill. Or a pile. Of crap. The acting was horrible. When I searched for a few of the actors in this movie, they had been in very few things that I had heard of, and that came as absolutely no surprise. I can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad, or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. Starting . . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really, though, don't waste your time with this. There's so little substance that there's nothing there even just to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- NO, one of the worst flicks of ANY KIND, that I have ever had the misfortune to watch, and I've seen quite a

{"value":"As someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of \"Hero,\" I was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines, but better. It also featured an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed on both counts. I bought the DVD of this film sight-unseen, and that was a mistake. It was not better.<br /><br />I realize these flying-through-the-air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief. A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, that's going a little far. Also, the major male character 'Jin\" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialog, stupid look on his face and stupid laugh, that he ruined the film, too.<br /><br />Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - to me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning.

{"value":"If the crew behind \"Zombie Chronicles\" ever read this, here's some advice guys: <br /><br />1. In a \"Twist Ending\"-type movie, it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE in the opening credits. That tends to spoil the twists, y'know...? <br /><br />2. I know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please, hire people who can actually act. Or at least, walk, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you...<br /><br />3. If you're going to set a part of your movie in the past, only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time.<br /><br />4. Twist endings are supposed to be a surprise. Sure, we don't want twists that make no sense, but signposting the \"reveal\" as soon as you introduce a character?
