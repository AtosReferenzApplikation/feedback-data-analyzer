{"value":"I have three comments to make about this film, which I discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at Blockbuster. First off, it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works. Some have, as Kubrick did with \"Lolita\", gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work. Of course that can't happen here; Kraft-Ebing is long dead. Some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new, unrelated direction (the recent adaptation of \"Tristram Shandy\" comes to mind here). You can dumb it down - the film of \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is to my mind an example of that. Or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes. That would be the approach of Woody Allen's \"Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex\", and, arguably, this film. Upon consideration, it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like \"Psychopathia Sexualis\". The potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed. And so it is here.<br /><br />Point two is the cinematic style. Some would call it an \"homage\" to Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, etc., but I think it more crude than that. Its far too heavy handed and self-conscious to be effective for long. It is eventually just annoying.<br /><br />Point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation. How did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring? I found the film impossible to pay attention to, and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well. I don't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless, but I have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material, the overt copying of filmic styles, and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level (possibly for fear of being accused of titillation).<br /><br />The film is a dubious exercise from the start and doesn't really work for me, I'm sorry to say.","finished_norm":["i","have","three","comment","to","make","about","thi","film","which","i","discov","hang","out","forlornli","in","a","low","shelf","at","blockbust","off","it","be","interest","to","see","the","approach","film","maker","take","in","try","to","film","essenti","unfilm","work","some","have","a","kubrick","do","with","lolita","get","the","origin","author","to","write","a","screenplai","that","be","someth","like","the","origin","work","of","cours","that","ca","not","happen","here","krafteb","be","long","dead","some","have","us","the","premis","of","the","origin","work","a","a","launch","point","to","go","in","a","complet","new","unrel","direct","the","recent","adapt","of","tristram","shandi","come","to","mind","here","you","can","dumb","it","down","the","film","of","slaughterhous","five","be","to","my","mind","a","exampl","of","that","or","you","can","simpli","take","the","format","of","the","origin","and","try","to","render","it","in","cinemat","vignett","that","would","be","the","approach","of","woodi","allen","everyth","you","want","to","know","about","sex","and","arguabl","thi","film","upon","consider","it","be","probabl","the","onli","thing","on","can","do","with","a","scholarli","work","like","psychopathia","sexuali","the","potenti","loss","be","that","whatev","cumul","point","the","origin","work","have","be","obscur","or","destroi","and","so","it","be","herebr","br","point","two","be","the","cinemat","styl","some","would","call","it","a","homag","to","murnau","pabst","carl","dreyer","etc","but","i","think","it","much","crude","than","that","it","far","too","heavi","hand","and","selfconsci","to","be","effect","for","long","it","be","eventu","just","annoyingbr","br","point","three","be","perhap","a","littl","intellectu","observ","how","do","the","peopl","respons","for","thi","manag","to","make","a","film","about","wild","sexual","deviat","and","pervers","that","be","so","incredibli","bore","i","find","the","film","imposs","to","pai","attent","to","and","anyon","who","be","not","automat","draw","to","depict","of","sexual","devianc","will","find","it","so","a","good","i","do","not","want","to","be","complet","uncharit","and","sai","the","film","be","pointless","but","i","have","to","sai","that","whatev","point","the","film","maker","have","be","rather","obscur","by","the","natur","of","the","sourc","materi","the","overt","copi","of","filmic","styl","and","the","stubborn","refus","to","engag","the","audienc","on","a","emot","level","possibli","for","fear","of","be","accus","of","titillationbr","br","the","film","be","a","dubiou","exercis","from","the","start","and","doe","not","realli","work","for","me","i","be","sorri","to","sai"],"filtered":["three","comment","make","thi","film","discov","hang","forlornli","low","shelf","blockbust","interest","see","approach","film","maker","take","try","film","essenti","unfilm","work","kubrick","lolita","get","origin","author","write","screenplai","someth","like","origin","work","cours","ca","happen","krafteb","long","dead","us","premis","origin","work","launch","point","go","complet","new","unrel","direct","recent","adapt","tristram","shandi","come","mind","dumb","film","slaughterhous","five","mind","exampl","simpli","take","format","origin","try","render","cinemat","vignett","approach","woodi","allen","everyth","want","know","sex","arguabl","thi","film","upon","consider","probabl","onli","thing","scholarli","work","like","psychopathia","sexuali","potenti","loss","whatev","cumul","point","origin","work","obscur","destroi","herebr","br","point","two","cinemat","styl","call","homag","murnau","pabst","carl","dreyer","etc","think","much","crude","far","heavi","hand","selfconsci","effect","long","eventu","annoyingbr","br","point","three","perhap","littl","intellectu","observ","peopl","respons","thi","manag","make","film","wild","sexual","deviat","pervers","incredibli","bore","find","film","imposs","pai","attent","anyon","automat","draw","depict","sexual","devianc","find","good","want","complet","uncharit","sai","film","pointless","sai","whatev","point","film","maker","rather","obscur","natur","sourc","materi","overt","copi","filmic","styl","stubborn","refus","engag","audienc","emot","level","possibli","fear","accus","titillationbr","br","film","dubiou","exercis","start","doe","realli","work","sorri","sai"],"filtered2":["three","comment","make","discov","hang","forlornli","low","shelf","blockbust","interest","see","approach","maker","take","try","essenti","unfilm","work","kubrick","lolita","get","origin","author","write","screenplai","someth","like","origin","work","cours","ca","happen","krafteb","long","dead","us","premis","origin","work","launch","point","go","complet","new","unrel","direct","recent","adapt","tristram","shandi","come","mind","dumb","slaughterhous","five","mind","exampl","simpli","take","format","origin","try","render","cinemat","vignett","approach","woodi","allen","everyth","want","know","sex","arguabl","upon","consider","probabl","onli",

{"value":"Wow, this is very unusual in one regard: usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch. People are surprised when a sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch, or at least the first six which comprise my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey, thanks to several characters.<br /><br />Well, let's start with the good news first:<br /><br />THE GOOD - Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display, even if they are just stock footage. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called \"dwarfs\" in the movie.) Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago, I can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago. They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make a well-built handsome couple, if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema.<br /><br />The film has historical value (with so many sequels) in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language.<br /><br />The BAD - From the moment \"Jane Parker\" is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics, shrieking and screaming scene after scene. It's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film. Thankfully, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. The movie also does no favors for \"The Great White Hunter\" image as C. Aubrey Smith, playing Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as \"Harry Holt,\" the safari guide, shoot at every animal within sight, whether the beasts is threatening or not. These people are kill- happy, particularly Smith. On another note, it's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place. There is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up. He's just there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in

{"value":"Something to Sing About was produced at Grand National Studios where James Cagney was working while under a contract dispute with the brothers Warner. He did two films for this B studio, neither of which rank high in the Cagney credits.<br /><br />One of the great losses to cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney did so few films that utilized his terrific dancing abilities. The two that come to mind immediately are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two lesser films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement. So why did he make so few of them?<br /><br />Well this one was all wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About concerns a hoofer who fronts for a band who's discovered and given a movie contract. There are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract calls for a no- marriage clause, so Cagney and band girl singer lady Evelyn Daw marry in secret. Then we get the complication of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady Mona Barrie. I think you can figure where this is going.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers such as they were. I'm sure the movie-going public was paying their tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /><br />Also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in The West Point Story. Weren't Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available?<br /><br />No memorable songs came out of this. And Daw's voice is waisted as well. She has a Jeanette MacDonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band.<br /><br />No wonder Cagney went running back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.","finished_norm":["someth","to","sing","about","be","produc","at","grand","nation","studio","where","jame","cagnei","be","work","while","under","a","contract","disput","with","the","brother","warner","he","do","two","film","for","thi","b","studio","neither","of","which","rank","high","in","the","cagnei","creditsbr","br","on","of","the","great","loss","to","cinema","be","the","fact","that","jimmi","cagnei","do","so","few","film","that","util","hi","terrif","danc","abil","the","two","that","come","to","mind","immedi","be","yanke","doodl","dandi","and","footlight","parad","two","lesser","film","be","the","west","point","stori","and","never","steal","anyth","small","cagnei","himself","sai","he","never","us","to","watch","anyth","but","hi","music","in","retir","so","why","do","he","make","so","few","of","thembr","br","good","thi","on","be","all","wrong","the","plot","of","someth","to","sing","about","concern","a","hoofer","who","front","for","a","band","who","discov","and","give","a","movi","contract","there","be","the","usual","complic","of","a","conniv","studio","boss","and","a","conniv","press","agent","plai","respect","and","good","by","gene","lockhart","and","william","frawlei","hi","contract","call","for","a","no","marriag","claus","so","cagnei","and","band","girl","singer","ladi","evelyn","daw","marri","in","secret","then","we","get","the","complic","of","a","public","drive","studio","romanc","with","screen","lead","ladi","mona","barri","i","think","you","can","figur","where","thi","be","goingbr","br","the","much","disappoint","thing","about","someth","to","sing","about","be","the","lack","of","danc","number","for","cagnei","he","danc","briefli","at","the","begin","and","the","end","of","the","film","and","noth","in","the","middl","evelyn","daw","have","a","nice","sing","voic","and","the","charisma","of","a","ham","sandwich","she","get","the","music","number","such","a","thei","be","i","be","sure","the","moviego","public","be","pai","their","ticket","to","see","cagnei","danc","br","br","conjur","in","addit","to","give","him","some","danc","number","a","femal","danc","partner","would","have","be","nice","he","danc","good","with","rubi","keeler","in","footlight","parad","and","with","virginia","mayo","and","dori","dai","in","the","west","point","stori","be","not","ginger","roger","eleanor","powel","or","rubi","keeler","availablebr","br","no","memor","song","come","out","of","thi","and","daw","voic","be","waist","a","good","she","have","a","jeanett","macdonald","soprano","voic","which","be","so","out","of","place","with","a","swing","bandbr","br","no","wonder","cagnei","go","run","back","to","warner","brother","but","thei","should","have","give","him","some","decent","music"],"filtered":["someth","sing","produc","grand","nation","studio","jame","cagnei","work","contract","disput","brother","warner","two","film","thi","b","studio","neither","rank","high","cagnei","creditsbr","br","great","loss","cinema","fact","jimmi","cagnei","film","util","hi","terrif","danc","abil","two","come","mind","immedi","yanke","doodl","dandi","footlight","parad","two","lesser","film","west","point","stori","never","steal","anyth","small","cagnei","sai","never","us","watch","anyth","hi","music","retir","make","thembr","br","good","thi","wrong","plot","someth","sing","concern","hoofer","front","band","discov","give","movi","contract","usual","complic","conniv","studio","boss","conniv","press","agent","plai","respect","good","gene","lockhart","william","frawlei","hi","contract","call","marriag","claus","cagnei","band","girl","singer","ladi","evelyn","daw","marri","secret","get","complic","public","drive","studio","romanc","screen","lead","ladi","mona","barri","think","figur","thi","goingbr","br","much","disappoint","thing","someth","sing","lack","danc","number","cagnei","danc","briefli","begin","end","film","noth","middl","evelyn","daw","nice","sing","voic","charisma","ham","sandwich","get","music","number","thei","sure","moviego","public","pai","ticket","see","cagnei","danc","br","br","conjur","addit","give","danc","number","femal","danc","partner","nice","danc","good","rubi","keeler","footlight","parad","virginia","mayo","dori","dai","west","point","stori","ginger","roger","eleanor","powel","rubi","keeler","availablebr","br","memor","song","come","thi","daw","voic","waist","good","jeanett","macdonald","soprano","voic","place","swing","bandbr","br","wonder","cagnei","go","run","back","warner","brother","thei","give","decent","music"],"filtered2":["someth","sing","produc","grand","nation","studio","jame","cagnei","work","contract","disput","brother","warner","two","b","studio","neither","rank","high","cagnei","creditsbr","great","loss","cinema","fact","jimmi","cagnei","util","terrif","danc","abil","two","come","mind","immedi","yanke","doodl","dandi","footlight","parad","two","lesser","west","point","stori","never","steal","anyth","small","cagnei","never","us","watch","anyth","music","retir","make","thembr","good","wrong","pl

{"value":"(this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie, nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. That of course is the problem with taking, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. Plus it's got built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely \"psychic\", because that was the easiest way of explaining it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as added tension, there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book.<br /><br />I could nitpick for days about little things, but I also think larger things, like the art direction was a off. Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look, with its strangely darkened skies. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people on it that look like humans. The skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing. But something is a little bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is if we forget how to love. It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.<br /><br />I unfortunately did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well.<br /><br />Overall an artistic disappointment.<br /><br

{"value":"Oh if only I could give this rubbish less than one star! There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song Don't Worry, Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. That is it there was nothing more amusing than that, at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'Fans of the completely terrible \"Shrek\" might enjoy, but \"Wallace & Gromit\" fans will probably turn away in disgust.' As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I won't point out all of the others, but here are a few more to see: When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again. This is impossible. Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy's hand. There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it.<br /><br />Too many, for want of a better word, 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters, the characters were hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole film left you wanting....wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else!

{"value":"Painfully bad Christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by Vince Vaughn, who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his R rated films. Vaughn seems like he's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance. After 30 minutes into the film, you would be in touch your inner scourge and say \"Bahumbag\" at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes, you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point. Out of all the actors involved in this mess, only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film. Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he's forced to Vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. You can see in Giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film. Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film. Fortunately for her, she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face, unlike Giamatti, who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie. The direction also feels uninspiring, like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.<br /><br />I don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved (Giamatti and Weisz) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with, spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a Christmas movie of all things) and a actor who just does not care about his performance (Vaughn),

{"value":"Another FINE effort by America's most UNDERrated filmmaker. His knowledge on the subject of racism is STAGGERING, and IMPRESSES me on more than one level. Accusations that Lee is really just a devious little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood's Affirmative Action system to make movies of inferior quality is utter NONSENSE, mere Right-Wing propaganda. The very notion that Lee would resort to misusing the current climate of political correctness in America in order to produce hate-filled anti-white movies is simply FALSE and malicious.<br /><br />Some of Lee's detractors even go so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African-Americans, while putting down other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD disseminated by people who are AGAINST peaceful co-existence between different races in America and elsewhere.<br /><br />My favourite scene in the movie is a lengthy dialogue early on between the rich black Republican and the others in the bus. The views presented by that man are simply WRONG - all across the board. 100% UNTRUE. He LACKS education, unlike the brilliantly INFORMED guys who quite DESERVEDLY throw him off the bus.<br /><br />TERRIFIC performances, and an INTELLIGENT script make for a viewing experience that has been RARELY rivaled by any political movies made since.<br /><br />I also want to point out the incessant LIES that the Million-Man March had only 80,000 people taking part in it!<br /><br />(And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters...)<br /><br />So what message does Lee send here? If someone doesn't agree with your political views, you simply apply violence and throw him off the bus. I thought the movie said \"get ON the bus\"...?<br /><br />Apparently, Mr.Lee is for bus-segregation after all, i.e. is no different than those KKK lunatics before him: the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the Democratic Party's line of thinking.

{"value":"'I don't understand. None of this makes any sense!', exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder. Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie, I know exactly how he feels. The story, by the film's director Aristide Massacessi (good old Joe D'amato using his real name for a change), is a clumsy mix of the supernatural, murder/mystery, and pretentious arty rubbish, the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Franco's more bizarre efforts, but which had me struggling to remain conscious.<br /><br />Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister (with whom he had been having an incestuous affair, before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor), Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman (played by Ewa Aulin, who stars in the equally strange 'Death Laid an Egg') is seen alive and kicking, the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück. After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home, where she is tended to by creepy Dr. Sturges (Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role), the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück (meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin').<br /><br />'So far, so good', I thought to myself at this point, 'we've had hunchbacks, incest, some blood and guts, and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy Euro-horror; what follows, however, is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings, ghostly goings on, and even elements from Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Black Cat', to tell a very silly, utterly bewildering, and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave.<br /><br />This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb, but given the choice, I would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career; I guess incomprehensible, meandering, surreal 70s Gothic horror just ain't my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for

{"value":"I have yesterday seen the second part. And I must say, it was actually better then the first one. At the begin, I realized, It is actually a sequel, not a remake but not a good one. I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica, because the cylons saw like toasters (just as it was mentioned in this new movie) and were completely harmless for the old galactica. This movie turns the sides - the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid. Many scenes were unnecessary, for instance the story of the \"computer expert\" - completely a crap. If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house, killed by the cylon woman. And the evacuation from the planet? Oh, please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons (why exactly 50 MT??) nukes, they would be dead killed by the radiation. And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack? Aha, it was possibly this computer virus, created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy. The good side of the movie is, that the humans are at last defeated!! Really defeated, the population is near the extinction (children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie: 1. a baby!!! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence...). And the bad-asses won and I think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie. I also appreciate the design of the cylons (not only of the humanoid cylon:-) a good job with these ships - I like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons. The human ships are a good never version of the old ones. And galactica - really pretty with these docks, I liked that. But this is all, only the design is not enough. The acting was really bad, the whole plot was expectable (only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end).The dialogs were trivial (and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid, but that is not fault of the movie). The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series, but who would shoot such series? What it would be about? One star for the design the second one for the near extinction of

{"value":"In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy, but I can see why she does go crazy. If I lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has I would go crazy too. Everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it. She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the sharpest knifes in the drawer.<br /><br />To start with the one person closest to her in her life, her husband, Nick, is a little off his rocker. He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile. The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support. The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is, he is just making her feel worse. She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her. When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act, instead of comforting her, he just yells at her and tells her what to do.<br /><br />The other major people in her life are her parents. Her parents do nothing in her life for her. Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her. In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesn't understand, and when he does get it he still does nothing. They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period. The only person that tries to do something for her is Nick's mom. Nick's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed. She doesn't want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her. It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore. They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isn't. That is why she went crazy, and why she had to be committed, it was her family's entire

{"value":"I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I didn't care for his delivery. He just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited, contrived juvenile smear campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc... The camera would be focused on him, and you'd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog. Add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot, which is a film no-no.<br /><br />This documentary hits a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the movie is just so easily done. Picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid. It is so easy it is just wrong. I mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags? To make them contradict themselves, you just let them recite more then a verse or two. I do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves.<br /><br />I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out. It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs, or sex, or ???? He could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the Passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone into the history of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had quite the colorful past. Delve into science v.s. religion. One is a very methodical, very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid bottom up, a new layer on top of a more proved layer. An enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way. The other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims. It is so, because well I said so.<br /><br />Done right I'd say turn it into an HBO original series hit a different religion every week.<br /><br />It was an eye opener about one thing. I must have been blind. Good ole G.W.Bush... no wonder he got elected. He had the religious majority. And well... now that is the blind leading the blind.<br /><br />Bill Moyer..

{"value":"I'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a Saw-type movie or 12 Angry Men (people piecing together the facts to get at the truth). Whatever it was, it was poorly done and not worth watching.<br /><br />I don't watch movies for blood and gore, but because this film had little else going for it, it should have shown the actual killing more. Most were off-camera, minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths.<br /><br />It also bugged me that the cop was among the victims; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence (given to him by MJH) into the evidence room. (And wouldn't MJH a the prosecuting attorney, have had access to that evidence--taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back--anyway, so she wouldn't have needed the cop's help?). The others, while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming, still played larger roles in his ultimate demise. The gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent. The insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need, etc. But the cop's crime seemed minor in comparison since he didn't know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged MJH to plant the evidence, which would have made him more culpable. And MJH's yelling that he (the cop) got her in that mess doesn't make any sense at all.<br /><br />It would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he/she was there and deserved to die. The insurance guy, for example, could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them; the Oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violent that the gun deaths, but more interesting.<br /><br />The dialog wasn't witty, there were no twists, and the ending was one of the worse (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The ending along knocked three stars off my rating.<br /><br />The actors did a decent job, especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with.<br /><br />Overall, a waste of time.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","sure","if","the","filmmak","be","after","a","sawtyp","movi","or","angri","man","peopl","piec","togeth","the","fact","to","get","at","the","truth","whatev","it","be","it","be","poorli","do","and","not","worth","watchingbr","br","i","do","not","watch","movi","for","blood","and","gore","but","becaus","thi","film","have","littl","els","go","for","it","it","should","have","show","the","actual","kill","much","much","be","offcamera","minim","the","horror","that","we","be","suppos","to","feel","by","the","deathsbr","br","it","conjur","bug","me","that","the","cop","be","among","the","victim","he","unwittingli","contribut","to","the","innoc","young","man","go","to","prison","by","accept","plant","evid","give","to","him","by","mjh","into","the","evid","room","and","would","not","mjh","a","the","prosecut","attornei","have","have","access","to","that","evidencetak","it","out","and","putt","the","wrong","evid","backanywai","so","she","would","not","have","ne","the","cop","help","the","other","while","often","conjur","not","realiz","it","be","thi","particular","person","thei","be","harm","still","plai","larg","role","in","hi","ultim","demis","the","gun","dealer","should","have","know","hi","gun","would","be","us","for","evil","intent","the","insur","gui","reject","a","person","obvious","in","ne","etc","but","the","cop","crime","seem","minor","in","comparison","sinc","he","do","not","know","exactli","what","he","be","do","the","filmmak","can","have","take","it","a","step","far","and","have","him","be","the","on","that","encourag","mjh","to","plant","the","evid","which","would","have","make","him","much","culpabl","and","mjh","yell","that","he","the","cop","get","her","in","that","mess","doe","not","make","ani","sens","at","allbr","br","it","would","be","much","intrigu","if","each","person","die","in","a","wai","that","offer","the","other","a","clue","to","why","hesh","be","there","and","deserv","to","die","the","insur","gui","for","exampl","can","have","have","the","applic","he","reject","ram","down","hi","throat","so","he","choke","on","them","the","orient","woman","can","have","have","her","ey","goug","out","becaus","she","be","a","fals","wit","etc","ye","much","violent","that","the","gun","death","but","much","interestingbr","br","the","dialog","be","not","witti","there","be","no","twist","and","the","end","be","on","of","the","wrong","if","not","the","wrong","i","have","ever","see","the","end","along","knock","three","star","off","my","ratingbr","br","the","actor","do","a","decent","job","especi","give","the","garbag","line","and","motiv","thei","have","to","work","withbr","br","overal","a","wast","of","time"],"filtered":["sure","filmmak","sawtyp","movi","angri","man","peopl","piec","togeth","fact","get","truth","whatev","poorli","worth","watchingbr","br","watch","movi","blood","gore","becaus","thi","film","littl","els","go","show","actual","kill","much","much","offcamera","minim","horror","suppos","feel","deathsbr","br","conjur","bug","cop","among","victim","unwittingli","contribut","innoc","young","man","go","prison","accept","plant","evid","give","mjh","evid","room","mjh","prosecut","attornei","access","evidencetak","putt","wrong","evid","backanywai","ne","cop","help","often","conjur","realiz","thi","particular","person","thei","harm","still","plai","larg","role","hi","ultim","demis","gun","dealer","know","hi","gun","us","evil","intent","insur","gui","reject","person","obvious","ne","etc","cop","crime","seem","minor","comparison","sinc","know","exactli","filmmak","take","step","far","encourag","mjh","plant","evid","make","much","culpabl","mjh","yell","cop","get","mess","doe","make","ani","sens","allbr","br","much","intrigu","person","die","wai","offer","clue","hesh","deserv","die","insur","gui","exampl","applic","reject","ram","hi","throat","choke","orient","woman","ey","goug","becaus","fals","wit","etc","ye","much","violent","gun","death","much","interestingbr","br","dialog","witti","twist","end","wrong","wrong","ever","see","end","along","knock","three","star","ratingbr","br","actor","decent","job","especi","give","garbag","line","motiv","thei","work","withbr","br","overal","wast","time"],"filtered2":["sure","filmmak","sawtyp","angri","man","peopl","piec","togeth","fact","get","truth","whatev","poorli","worth","watchingbr","watch","blood","gore","becaus","littl","els","go","show","actual","kill","offcamera","minim","horror","suppos","feel","deathsbr","conjur","bug","cop","among","victim","unwittingli","contribut","innoc","young","man","go","prison","accept","plant","evid","give","mjh","evid","room","mjh","prosecut","attornei","access","evidencetak","putt","wrong","evid","backanywai","ne","cop","help","often","conjur","realiz","particular","person","harm","still","plai","larg","role","ultim","demis","gun","dealer","know","gun","us","evil","intent","insur","gui","reject","person","obvious","ne","etc","cop","crime","seem","minor","comparison","sinc","know","exactli","filmmak","

{"value":"When Rodney Dangerfield is on a roll, he's hilarious. In My 5 Wives, he's not on a roll. The timing of the one-liners is off, but they're the best thing going for the movie. The five women who play the wives don't add up to one whole actress between them. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is pretty weak; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the movie could play the same way even if Rodney's character had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we're supposed to accept that Rodney's character is an athletic skier.<br /><br />Jerry Stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor, and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work.<br /><br />The odd nods to political correctness later in the movie don't really do anything for the movie. For those who like their movies politically correct, the non-PC humor is still there in the first place, and the seeming apologies for it still don't get the point. For those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness, the PC add-ins are just annoying digressions.<br /><br />This has to be the mildest R-rated movie I've ever seen. There are some racy jokes, and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking TV 40 years ago, but that's about it. Maybe it was the topless men (kidding).<br /><br />The DVD features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles. I kept wondering if they were serious or kidding. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, \"They must be kidding!\" There's also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the Mormons or the Church of Latter-Day Saints, that somehow it's not about them. Never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in Utah, and makes reference to Brigham Young.<br /><br />In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping for Rodney on a roll, but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.","finished_norm":["when","rodnei","dangerfield","be","on","a","roll","he","hilari","in","my","wife","he","not","on","a","roll","the","time","of","the","onelin","be","off","but","thei","re","the","well","thing","go","for","the","movi","the","five","woman","who","plai","the","wife","do","not","add","up","to","on","whole","actress","between","them","the","plot","be","veri","weak","even","the","premis","be","pretti","weak","there","be","a","few","joke","about","have","multipl","wife","but","the","situat","have","littl","to","do","with","anyth","els","in","the","movi","much","of","the","movi","can","plai","the","same","wai","even","if","rodnei","charact","have","onli","on","wife","so","the","premis","seem","much","like","a","old","man","fantasi","than","a","kei","part","of","the","comedi","anoth","old","man","fantasi","we","re","suppos","to","accept","that","rodnei","charact","be","a","athlet","skierbr","br","jerri","still","seem","to","be","phone","in","hi","role","just","to","do","a","buddi","a","favor","and","the","rest","of","the","name","actor","must","simpli","be","desper","for","workbr","br","the","odd","nod","to","polit","correct","late","in","the","movi","do","not","realli","do","anyth","for","the","movi","for","that","who","like","their","movi","polit","correct","the","nonpc","humor","be","still","there","in","the","place","and","the","seem","apologi","for","it","still","do","not","get","the","point","for","that","who","hate","see","a","movi","cave","in","to","polit","correct","the","pc","addin","be","just","annoi","digressionsbr","br","thi","have","to","be","the","mild","rrate","movi","i","have","ever","see","there","be","some","raci","joke","and","the","bedroom","scene","would","have","make","shock","tv","year","ago","but","that","about","it","mayb","it","be","the","topless","man","kiddingbr","br","the","dvd","featur","interview","where","the","cast","member","seem","to","find","depth","and","import","in","thi","movi","and","in","their","role","i","keep","wonder","if","thei","be","seriou","or","kid","thei","seem","to","be","seriou","but","i","keep","think","thei","must","be","kid","there","conjur","a","peculiar","disclaim","suggest","that","sinc","the","movi","never","actual","name","the","mormon","or","the","church","of","latterdai","saint","that","somehow","it","not","about","them","never","mind","that","the","movi","featur","a","polygam","religion","in","utah","and","make","refer","to","brigham","youngbr","br","in","short","my","wife","be","a","disappoint","i","be","hope","for","rodnei","on","a","roll","but","the","well","i","can","sai","for","the","movi","be","that","rodnei","be","look","pretti","good","for","a","gui","who","be","push","at","the","time"],"filtered":["rodnei","dangerfield","roll","hilari","wife","roll","time","onelin","thei","re","well","thing","go","movi","five","woman","plai","wife","add","whole","actress","plot","veri","weak","even","premis","pretti","weak","joke","multipl","wife","situat","littl","anyth","els","movi","much","movi","plai","wai","even","rodnei","charact","onli","wife","premis","seem","much","like","old","man","fantasi","kei","part","comedi","anoth","old","man","fantasi","re","suppos","accept","rodnei","charact","athlet","skierbr","br","jerri","still","seem","phone","hi","role","buddi","favor","rest","name","actor","must","simpli","desper","workbr","br","odd","nod","polit","correct","late","movi","realli","anyth","movi","like","movi","polit","correct","nonpc","humor","still","place","seem","apologi","still","get","point","hate","see","movi","cave","polit","correct","pc","addin","annoi","digressionsbr","br","thi","mild","rrate","movi","ever","see","raci","joke","bedroom","scene","make","shock","tv","year","ago","mayb","topless","man","kiddingbr","br","dvd","featur","interview","cast","member","seem","find","depth","import","thi","movi","role","keep","wonder","thei","seriou","kid","thei","seem","seriou","keep","think","thei","must","kid","conjur","peculiar","disclaim","suggest","sinc","movi","never","actual","name","mormon","church","latterdai","saint","somehow","never","mind","movi","featur","polygam","religion","utah","make","refer","brigham","youngbr","br","short","wife","disappoint","hope","rodnei","roll","well","sai","movi","rodnei","look","pretti","good","gui","push","time"],"filtered2":["rodnei","dangerfield","roll","hilari","wife","roll","time","onelin","re","well","thing","go","five","woman","plai","wife","add","whole","actress","plot","veri","weak","even","premis","pretti","weak","joke","multipl","wife","situat","littl","anyth","els","plai","wai","even","rodnei","charact","onli","wife","premis","seem","like","old","man","fantasi","kei","part","comedi","anoth","old","man","fantasi","re","suppos","accept","rodnei","charact","athlet","skierbr","jerri","still","seem","phone","role","buddi","favor","rest","name","actor","must","simpli","desper","workbr","odd","nod","polit","correct","late","realli","anyth","like","polit","correct","nonpc","humor","still"

{"value":"Franco Rossi's 1985 six-hour Italian mini-series of Quo Vadis is a very curious beast, creating an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world shot in matter of fact fashion (very few long shots, no big cityscapes), but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background.<br /><br />The shifting structure (much of episode one is played out via voice over letters) and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six-hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding, and certainly far too often uninvolving, but it has something going for it. The two main strengths are the characterisation of Petronius (a thankfully dubbed Frederic Forrest, whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue) as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he's become incapable of experiencing emotion, and Klaus Maria Brandauer's unique take on Nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his 'audience' will receive it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appears in a few episodes, being rewarded with the show's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave Rome. It's the kind of thing the show could do with more of, but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional, inspiring or exciting moment under it's relentlessly low-key direction.<br /><br />Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero, blending in with the walls and coming over less as a Roman officer than that quiet, slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties - you know, the one who you think is called Dave or something like that. The budgetary limitations are very visible once its Meet the Lions time for the Christians and Ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends.<br /><br />Not a trip I can particularly recommend, I'm afraid, but if you do embark on it it's one not entirely without its small

{"value":"and rent a GOOD horror movie. It's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like \"Scream\" and \"Scary Movie\".<br /><br />In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written. Stupid \"we're going to the prom\" junk. I wanted to claw my ears off. Honestly, \"The Hills\" has better dialog.<br /><br />There really was no need to make this movie. Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking \"Her? Really? Guy is obsessed with her? Really?\" <br /><br />All the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) <br /><br />The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). The people are like mentally disabled sheep.<br /><br />By the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (So boo hoo for you!) <br /><br />None of the killings is the least bit interesting. Most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.<br /><br />The only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. \"Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer -- AIIEEEE!\" <br /><br />And then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore.<br /><br />The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. Don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.<br /><br />(Oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. No tiara. No bucket of blood.) <br /><br />So save your money and rent \"Carrie\" or \"Friday the 13th\" or \"Halloween\" or \"Scream\" or \"Scary Movie\" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.","finished_norm":["and","rend","a","good","horror","movi","it","like","the","writer","have","never","see","a","horror","movi","befor","and","do","not","realiz","everi","singl","thing","he","write","be","clichéd","and","hacknei","and","have","be","parodi","to","perfect","in","movi","like","scream","and","scari","moviebr","br","in","between","the","scari","bit","be","the","much","banal","and","bore","dialog","ever","write","stupid","we","re","go","to","the","prom","junk","i","want","to","claw","my","ear","off","honestli","the","hill","have","well","dialogbr","br","there","realli","be","no","ne","to","make","thi","movi","lead","ladi","be","uninterest","and","i","keep","think","her","realli","gui","be","obsess","with","her","realli","br","br","all","the","charact","act","in","stupid","wai","includ","the","polic","cover","the","place","in","team","of","front","and","back","not","on","sleepi","cop","sit","in","hi","car","with","the","window","roll","down","just","wait","for","hi","throat","to","be","slash","br","br","the","serial","killer","just","swan","about","murder","everyon","he","want","without","the","littl","bite","of","problem","no","resist","from","victim","or","door","nobodi","have","ani","protect","or","the","littl","idea","of","fight","back","or","flip","the","secur","lock","on","the","hotel","room","door","the","peopl","be","like","mental","disabl","sheepbr","br","by","the","by","if","you","re","a","gore","fan","you","will","be","disappoint","too","all","the","kill","be","keep","offscreen","and","be","ahem","tastefulli","do","so","boo","hoo","for","you","br","br","none","of","the","kill","be","the","littl","bite","interest","much","of","the","time","thei","have","alreadi","happen","by","the","time","we","find","outbr","br","the","onli","cliché","miss","be","the","cat","that","alwai","pop","out","in","thi","kind","of","movi","oh","kitti","you","scare","me","i","think","you","be","the","killer","aiieeee","br","br","and","then","at","the","end","when","it","time","for","the","killer","to","die","good","let","just","sai","it","the","easi","and","much","obviou","choic","snorebr","br","the","audienc","be","jeer","and","talk","back","to","the","screen","throughout","it","be","too","dumb","to","believ","and","not","realli","scari","enough","do","not","encourag","thi","kind","of","lazi","filmmakingbr","br","oh","and","by","the","wai","no","crown","of","a","prom","king","or","queen","no","tiara","no","bucket","of","blood","br","br","so","save","your","monei","and","rend","carri","or","fridai","the","th","or","halloween","or","scream","or","scari","movi","ani","of","them","to","get","a","good","scare","with","some","origin","twist"],"filtered":["rend","good","horror","movi","like","writer","never","see","horror","movi","befor","realiz","everi","singl","thing","write","clichéd","hacknei","parodi","perfect","movi","like","scream","scari","moviebr","br","scari","bit","much","banal","bore","dialog","ever","write","stupid","re","go","prom","junk","want","claw","ear","honestli","hill","well","dialogbr","br","realli","ne","make","thi","movi","lead","ladi","uninterest","keep","think","realli","gui","obsess","realli","br","br","charact","act","stupid","wai","includ","polic","cover","place","team","front","back","sleepi","cop","sit","hi","car","window","roll","wait","hi","throat","slash","br","br","serial","killer","swan","murder","everyon","want","without","littl","bite","problem","resist","victim","door","nobodi","ani","protect","littl","idea","fight","back","flip","secur","lock","hotel","room","door","peopl","like","mental","disabl","sheepbr","br","re","gore","fan","disappoint","kill","keep","offscreen","ahem","tastefulli","boo","hoo","br","br","none","kill","littl","bite","interest","much","time","thei","alreadi","happen","time","find","outbr","br","onli","cliché","miss","cat","alwai","pop","thi","kind","movi","oh","kitti","scare","think","killer","aiieeee","br","br","end","time","killer","die","good","let","sai","easi","much","obviou","choic","snorebr","br","audienc","jeer","talk","back","screen","throughout","dumb","believ","realli","scari","enough","encourag","thi","kind","lazi","filmmakingbr","br","oh","wai","crown","prom","king","queen","tiara","bucket","blood","br","br","save","monei","rend","carri","fridai","th","halloween","scream","scari","movi","ani","get","good","scare","origin","twist"],"filtered2":["rend","good","horror","like","writer","never","see","horror","befor","realiz","everi","singl","thing","write","clichéd","hacknei","parodi","perfect","like","scream","scari","moviebr","scari","bit","banal","bore","dialog","ever","write","stupid","re","go","prom","junk","want","claw","ear","honestli","hill","well","dialogbr","realli","ne","make","lead","ladi","uninterest","keep","think","realli","gui","obsess","realli","charact","act","stupid","wai","includ","polic","cover","place","team","front","back","sleepi","cop","sit","car","window","roll","wait","throat","slash","serial","killer","swan","murder"

{"value":"First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I as just hoping that this movie would be all right. It had lots of chances, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, it has PAM GRIER!<br /><br />How could it fail?<br /><br />There may be spoilers within.<br /><br />First of all, it was dumbed down. Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book...gone. Everything that made you squirm...gone.<br /><br />And then there's the acting. Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. And, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship wasn't addressed. It was more like they were acquaintaces. <br /><br />You'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it's like they just don't care. All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. <br /><br />Pam Grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wasn't well pulled off. She's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book. <br /><br />And everything that was left out of the book. The ballon night chase, the marking of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more. <br /><br />And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn't really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /><br />I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Don't see this movie but read the book. It's a classic of Bradbury.","finished_norm":["and","foremost","i","love","the","novel","by","rai","bradburi","it","the","kind","of","horror","that","get","under","your","skin","and","stick","with","you","late","it","be","on","of","hi","well","book","with","you","know","fahrenheit","and","dandelion","wine","i","a","just","hope","that","thi","movi","would","be","all","right","it","have","lot","of","chanc","with","a","great","cast","like","jason","robard","and","jonathn","pryc","and","bradburi","even","write","the","script","himself","and","on","top","of","all","that","it","have","pam","grierbr","br","how","can","it","failbr","br","there","mai","be","spoiler","withinbr","br","of","all","it","be","dumb","down","much","of","the","horror","from","the","book","be","lose","a","bradburi","must","have","be","forc","to","keep","the","violenc","to","a","minimum","all","the","visual","from","the","bookgon","everyth","that","make","you","squirmgonebr","br","and","then","there","the","act","like","a","lot","of","movi","that","disnei","throw","out","in","the","the","kid","in","thi","movi","cannot","act","and","thi","bug","me","a","lot","neither","of","them","look","but","or","their","strong","friendship","be","not","address","it","be","much","like","thei","be","acquaintac","br","br","you","have","think","jason","robard","and","jonathan","pryc","can","pull","thi","off","in","their","role","of","mr","hallowai","and","mr","dark","but","here","it","like","thei","just","do","not","care","all","thei","want","to","do","be","somehow","pai","off","some","mortgag","or","someth","thi","be","far","from","be","some","of","their","well","perform","br","br","pam","grier","be","fine","a","the","witch","but","the","charect","of","the","dust","witch","herself","be","not","good","pull","off","she","a","lot","littl","evil","and","doe","not","have","the","presenc","a","she","do","in","the","book","br","br","and","everyth","that","be","leav","out","of","the","book","the","ballon","night","chase","the","mark","of","jim","hous","the","real","death","of","mr","dark","what","happen","to","mr","coogan","on","the","merrygoround","the","fate","of","the","lighten","rod","salesman","the","real","death","of","the","witch","and","oh","so","much","much","br","br","and","the","special","effect","be","bad","even","for","the","the","merrygoround","of","doom","for","on","thing","with","the","superimpos","hors","go","around","be","not","realli","creepi","and","that","weird","green","mist","that","realli","have","noth","to","do","with","anyth","br","br","i","can","keep","go","about","how","thi","movi","rip","apart","the","origin","novel","but","it","make","blood","boil","do","not","see","thi","movi","but","read","the","book","it","a","classic","of","bradburi"],"filtered":["foremost","love","novel","rai","bradburi","kind","horror","get","skin","stick","late","hi","well","book","know","fahrenheit","dandelion","wine","hope","thi","movi","right","lot","chanc","great","cast","like","jason","robard","jonathn","pryc","bradburi","even","write","script","top","pam","grierbr","br","failbr","br","mai","spoiler","withinbr","br","dumb","much","horror","book","lose","bradburi","must","forc","keep","violenc","minimum","visual","bookgon","everyth","make","squirmgonebr","br","act","like","lot","movi","disnei","throw","kid","thi","movi","act","thi","bug","lot","neither","look","strong","friendship","address","much","like","thei","acquaintac","br","br","think","jason","robard","jonathan","pryc","pull","thi","role","mr","hallowai","mr","dark","like","thei","care","thei","want","somehow","pai","mortgag","someth","thi","far","well","perform","br","br","pam","grier","fine","witch","charect","dust","witch","good","pull","lot","littl","evil","doe","presenc","book","br","br","everyth","leav","book","ballon","night","chase","mark","jim","hous","real","death","mr","dark","happen","mr","coogan","merrygoround","fate","lighten","rod","salesman","real","death","witch","oh","much","much","br","br","special","effect","bad","even","merrygoround","doom","thing","superimpos","hors","go","around","realli","creepi","weird","green","mist","realli","noth","anyth","br","br","keep","go","thi","movi","rip","apart","origin","novel","make","blood","boil","see","thi","movi","read","book","classic","bradburi"],"filtered2":["foremost","love","novel","rai","bradburi","kind","horror","get","skin","stick","late","well","book","know","fahrenheit","dandelion","wine","hope","right","lot","chanc","great","cast","like","jason","robard","jonathn","pryc","bradburi","even","write","script","top","pam","grierbr","failbr","mai","spoiler","withinbr","dumb","horror","book","lose","bradburi","must","forc","keep","violenc","minimum","visual","bookgon","everyth","make","squirmgonebr","act","like","lot","disnei","throw","kid","act","bug","lot","neither","look","strong","friendship","address","like","acquaintac","think","jason","robard","jonathan","pryc","pull","role","mr","hallowai","mr","dark","like","care","want","somehow","pai","mortgag","som

{"value":"Being a fan of movies like \"Fire Sale\", \"Where's Poppa\", \"Airplane\" I saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned. Well, WRONG CONCLUSION!<br /><br />Not only is this not funny, it makes you angry because it isn't bad in a schlocky, likable way but in a really bad way. It's bad-bad. The script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you're trying to entertain your audience with humour.<br /><br />Adam Arkin's speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie. Still this cruelty of nature doesn't prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera. This amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story - if you can find one.<br /><br />Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, another late night talk show person, who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen a few Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon.<br /><br />Kenneth Mars is good, though. In the few lines that he's given. I'm not easily frightened by bad comedies so I kept watching and looking for all the quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />The movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he literally does: Starting 75 minutes into the movie he's in every scene. But it's too little, too late.<br /><br />When movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you're supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that haven't prepared for an exam. In those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an 'F'. (But please don't assume I'm a teacher. That is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester).<br /><br />If you actually look for a likable schlocky horror/scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try \"Man with the Screaming Brain\" by Bruce Campbell.

{"value":"I can't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and I feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs. When one of the main characters announces that he's gay twice in the first five minutes, don't ignore it as typical PC nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won't. If his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn't make you sick, then be thankful the freak who wrote and/or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint. I mean, get real. It's one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick's supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of \"closure\" over the sudden death of her daughter. What does one thing have to do with the other, one might be tempted to ask? Apparently, the two issues are inextricably interwoven. And if that weren't bad enough, there's the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor. I mean, seriously, hasn't that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis? Why must she go around like that? At the very least, how about shaving the ugly thing off, and while you're at it, have those horrible moles removed, too. Would YOU slurp up some ice cream she just served you? I think not. It must be a New Jersey thing. <br /><br />You'd think Diane Keaton might save this piece of drek, but think again. Was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse? I don't even wanna think about it. So what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter. This grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that's all there is to it. One wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going. None of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant. Trust me -- pass this piece of crap up. It's not about death, a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter, or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it. It's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless

{"value":"I caught this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I hadn't heard much about it; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller, shot digitally on a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I have to say, I was severely disappointed. \"This Is Not A Love Song\" follows two criminals, who, after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer's young daughter, become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down.<br /><br />The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film. The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story, as are the over the top performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty, which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(Cue a pathetic, obligatory drug scene, and countless, pointless camera zooms). No amount of cliche's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story.<br /><br />We've seen this kind of thing many times before, and made a hundred times better, particularly in John Boorman's masterful \"Deliverance.\" But while in the latter film, we actually cared about the characters, in this film, I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible. Even this wouldn't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile, but instead, are merely a collection of stereotypical, inbred-looking countryfolk. Again, another offensive, overused cliche' coming to the fore. Surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers?<br /><br />In its defense, \"This Is Not A Love Song\" does contain a couple of good, suspenseful moments, but it's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or, at a push, getting a very limited cinema release. It's not a patch on last year's Low-Budget hunted in the hills movie, \"Dog soldiers\". Maybe British Cinema could actually get kick-started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong

{"value":"Alone in the Dark is Uwe Boll's kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Dead's punch in the face.<br /><br />If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is. After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film-making ability, plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie's framework.<br /><br />But then that's the point, isn't it. Boll isn't trying to make a coherent film because he isn't trying to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are \"announced\" or in \"pre-production\".<br /><br />These aren't movies to be directed, but investment portfolios. Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time-frame, the more money he and his investors can gain. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie's making you a mint anyway? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark, like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy film-making.<br /><br />And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, by making a cult figure out of the man, you're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.<br /><br />For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside, just don't ask me how he's getting his cast-lists together. Unless the actors are in on the investment-scam somehow, that mystery has still to be uncovered.","finished_norm":["alon","in","the","dark","be","uw","boll","kick","in","the","nut","to","hollywood","after","hous","of","the","dead","punch","in","the","facebr","br","if","anyth","it","prove","just","how","much","of","a","master","manipul","boll","be","after","forc","artisan","out","of","busi","over","the","flop","that","be","hous","of","the","dead","on","can","onli","assum","the","normal","credibl","lion","gate","film","onli","releas","aitd","under","contractu","oblig","after","acquir","artisan","asset","becaus","aitd","be","a","even","big","exampl","of","complet","lack","of","coher","filmmak","abil","plot","exposit","and","just","plain","steal","poorli","from","other","movi","becaus","it","be","suppos","to","look","cool","instead","of","becaus","it","fit","within","the","movi","frameworkbr","br","but","then","that","the","point","be","not","it","boll","be","not","try","to","make","a","coher","film","becaus","he","be","not","try","to","direct","alon","in","the","dark","he","just","try","to","manipul","hollywoodbr","br","alon","in","the","dark","like","hous","of","the","dead","dungeon","sieg","far","cry","bloodrayn","and","the","other","or","project","that","be","announc","or","in","preproductionbr","br","thi","be","not","movi","to","be","direct","but","invest","portfolio","everi","singl","on","of","them","rush","into","product","under","the","pretenc","that","the","tax","law","boll","and","hi","investor","be","exploit","mai","be","close","within","the","next","to","year","the","much","bomb","project","he","can","releas","within","that","timefram","the","much","monei","he","and","hi","investor","can","gain","why","bother","make","a","good","movi","when","a","bad","movi","make","you","a","mint","anywai","the","result","be","movi","like","the","aw","of","alon","in","the","darkbr","br","alon","in","the","dark","like","all","hi","other","movi","be","just","a","cynic","exploit","of","hollywood","current","trend","for","lazi","filmmakingbr","br","and","to","that","who","support","boll","by","call","him","misunderstand","or","the","next","ed","wood","congratul","by","make","a","cult","figur","out","of","the","man","you","re","just","make","it","easi","for","him","to","get","investor","but","give","him","notorietybr","br","for","much","inform","read","here","httpwwwcinemablendcomfeaturephpid","httpwwwcinemablendcomforumshowthreadphpsthreadid","a","a","asid","just","do","not","ask","me","how","he","get","hi","castlist","togeth","unless","the","actor","be","in","on","the","investmentscam","somehow","that","mysteri","have","still","to","be","uncov"],"filtered":["alon","dark","uw","boll","kick","nut","hollywood","hous","dead","punch","facebr","br","anyth","prove","much","master","manipul","boll","forc","artisan","busi","flop","hous","dead","onli","assum","normal","credibl","lion","gate","film","onli","releas","aitd","contractu","oblig","acquir","artisan","asset","becaus","aitd","even","big","exampl","complet","lack","coher","filmmak","abil","plot","exposit","plain","steal","poorli","movi","becaus","suppos","look","cool","instead","becaus","fit","within","movi","frameworkbr","br","point","boll","try","make","coher","film","becaus","try","direct","alon","dark","try","manipul","hollywoodbr","br","alon","dark","like","hous","dead","dungeon","sieg","far","cry","bloodrayn","project","announc","preproductionbr","br","thi","movi","direct","invest","portfolio","everi","singl","rush","product","pretenc","tax","law","boll","hi","investor","exploit","mai","close","within","next","year","much","bomb","project","releas","within","timefram","much","monei","hi","investor","gain","bother","make","good","movi","bad","movi","make","mint","anywai","result","movi","like","aw","alon","darkbr","br","alon","dark","like","hi","movi","cynic","exploit","hollywood","current","trend","lazi","filmmakingbr","br","support","boll","call","misunderstand","next","ed","wood","congratul","make","cult","figur","man","re","make","easi","get","investor","give","notorietybr","br","much","inform","read","httpwwwcinemablendcomfeaturephpid","httpwwwcinemablendcomforumshowthreadphpsthreadid","asid","ask","get","hi","castlist","togeth","unless","actor","investmentscam","somehow","mysteri","still","uncov"],"filtered2":["alon","dark","uw","boll","kick","nut","hollywood","hous","dead","punch","facebr","anyth","prove","master","manipul","boll","forc","artisan","busi","flop","hous","dead","onli","assum","normal","credibl","lion","gate","onli","releas","aitd","contractu","oblig","acquir","artisan","asset","becaus","aitd","even","big","exampl","complet","lack","coher","filmmak","abil","plot","exposit","plain","steal","poorli","becaus","suppos","look","cool","instead","becaus","fit","within","frameworkbr","point","boll","try","make","coher","becaus","try","direct","alon","dark","try","manipul","hollywoodbr","alon","dark","like","hous","dead","dungeon","sieg","far","cry","bloodrayn","project","announc","preproductionbr","direct","invest","portfolio","everi","si

{"value":"It's hard to tell if Noonan and Marshall are trying to ape Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry, or some other comedy team, but whoever it was they were trying to imitate, they failed miserably. There's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged \"script\") and Marshall have no chemistry whatsoever; Marshall seems to be trying for a Dean Martin type of devil-may-care coolness, but he doesn't come even remotely close. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but being funny sure wasn't it. He seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is, but not for the audience. I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. It was on the bottom of a double bill with a three-year-old Jeff Chandler western (\"Pillars of the Sky,\" which was pretty good) and a Three Stooges short (\"Sappy Bullfighters\", which wasn't), and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stayed around for the end of it (not that I wanted to, but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended), and by the time this mess was over, I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night, and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing it had going for it was Julie Newmar, who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her, this thing has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. The two of them also play Japanese soldiers, and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis' infamous playing of Japanese characters as thick-lensed, buck-toothed, gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. Marshall went on to host \"Hollywood Squares,\" and Noonan kept trying his hand at making movies, but most of them were almost as bad as this.

{"value":"Totally ridiculous. If you know anything about poker, you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless. The nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker, but I doubt he's ever played above 3-6. (I think he also knows nothing of golf.) Where to start. I've seen better productions in the Intro to Film class I took freshmen year of film school. The actors to watch in this movie are Queen Momma, Scotty Nguyen, and the loser who can never win at poker. Everyone else is as wooden as they come, like bad porn actors.<br /><br />*Spoiler* The man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made. He is a railbird who doesn't play poker and never has a line of dialogue, but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie. I can't think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production. It's fitting that he had such a useless role.<br /><br />There's very little poker in this movie. Most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren't resolved in the slightest. Queen Momma does have a show-stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out. Also the nameless Arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them. Their subtle performances are easily among the film's highlights. It makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads.<br /><br />In conclusion, complete nonsense. Plan 9 from Outer Space has slightly more coherency. If you play poker though you might want to have a laugh. Also if you're Christian you might enjoy some of the heavy-handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper. I hate movies made by religious people. Especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about. It's sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen got involved in this travesty as I can't help but think less of them. They must be envious of Johnny Chan for getting in

{"value":"First off...with names like Fred Olen Ray, Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent, plus distributors like \"Rhino\" and \"Troma\" on the video box, you know what you're getting into with this one. B movie mania! If you're actually expecting to see a thriller \"based on Edgar Allan Poe,\" then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of Roger Corman 60s Poe films. This is pure, unadulterated sleaze (with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to \"The Premature Burial\"), complete with lots of R-rated, ready-for-video sex and nudity. However, it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...<br /><br />Brinke (who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe, whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father (Hoke Howell). Her worthless husband Terry (Jay Richardson) has racked up some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster played by Robert Quarry) and, with help from his kinky, blonde, European-accented sexpot secretary Lisa (Delia Sheppard) plots to do away with Brinke for her money. Name-value actress Karen Black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist (she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this), 50s sci-fi/horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living Vicki. Jan-Michael Vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as Brinke enters and exits the home.<br /><br />The kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before, the ending is an unintentional laugh riot (concluding with a direct rip-off of the Zuni Fetish Doll segment in TRILOGY OF TERROR) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head FX for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit. Brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise of all is how good former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in her role. She stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance

{"value":"I notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the MST3K airing. That's fair enough (that is, after all, how it got its widest exposure), but, having had the misfortune of seeing \"Final Justice\" in its original form, I'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version.<br /><br />First off, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, owing primarily to an expository scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I COULD use the characters' names instead of the actors', but I just love typing the words \"Venantino Venantini\"), explaining why Venantini's fugitive character can't just leave Malta right away. (It's not a very CONVINCING plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs, I don't know.<br /><br />Another plot point missing in the original: The stripper's betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, seemingly unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. While this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really...icky. (There's no other word for it.)<br /><br />Some of the MST-worthy moments (the perpetual truncated shouts of \"Son of a--\" and the \"deja vu\" shooting of the sheriff) were purely the result of the edited-for-TV print they worked with, and were absent from the original movie.<br /><br />One scene I wish had made it into the MST3K version: Before entering the bar to question some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside, because \"they see that uniform, they won't cooperate.\" However, Joe Don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge!

{"value":"Well I just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that I'll never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movie's villains as \"subhuman cannibals\", and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. This movie isn't so controversial, I've seen this level of gore in many films. This movie plain sucks. SYNOPSIS: A blonde who thinks she's real hot (but she isn't), her admirer, and her admirer's friend (no, I don't remember their names) go into the woods. Their car breaks down. They are warned to leave by a man named Mark. The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend. Admirer impales his foot (whoops!). Don't worry, he is much more upset when his car won't start than when he gets impaled by nails. After a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. Events ensue that I cannot remember. During this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals (even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food). Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard (unsuccessfully) to work up tears. Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can \"out think them\". Mark (the man who warned them to leave) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family. Then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says he's been watching them. Before he is shot, we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing. The blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them. There's more killing, the admirer professes his love for the blonde. Then a mysterious hand covers the camera. What does that imply?

{"value":"...and even then, even they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this film (if one deigns to call it that) is of real interest only to bondage freaks. Bettie Page fans will learn absolutely nothing new (and I do mean *nothing*), nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar, loved, or cherished.<br /><br />Nevermind the abysmal screenplay, the wooden, less-than-community-theater acting, the utter absence of direction, the crappy lighting, or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values. This is definitely \"Hey, kids, let's make a movie!\" movie-making of the lowest order. I suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright *wrong*.<br /><br />It's wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page, a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs, utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged. This is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess, but not for the wretched excess itself, which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re-enacted B&D set-pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux-biographical scenes delineating Ms. Page's fall from grace (so to speak). There's actually probably more information, per se, about Page's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Do not be fooled. This is not a worthy companion film to \"The Notorious Bettie Page.\" This is not a worthy film at all. This is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and does it without class, without style, and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page whatsoever. No true Bettie Page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment, I guarantee that.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs. If free, remember that time is money, too.

{"value":"oh my god, i give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the final sequence is once again quite effectively handled and it was absolutely hilarious. that is what it gets those three points for. other than that, it was atrocious. it wasnt meant to be this funny, that much is obvious, but the dubbing, the acting of the dubbed voices, the dialogue they said, where often hilarious. the actions performed, and/or not performed also lead to much hilarity and/or throwing things at the screen. such as when the whole town is being slaughtered and one small group of people stand on a balcony looking on as if they were watching a cooking glass, or the \"attempted\" escapes from the church in which they hole up.<br /><br />evil mayor: i think something is going on outside so you should go upstairs and look out the window.<br /><br />hero: ok.<br /><br />evil mayor: now is my chance to make some idiot go outside and flail around with fire being totally ineffective and getting hacked up.<br /><br />insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />evil mayor: damn, wait, i will get this small child and she will walk outside and cry pappa seemingly obvlious to the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers but are actually zombies with no flesh or skin or anything and she will lead them away and i will flee! insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />hero (upstairs): he is trying to escape again, fool, and he has left the door open, he is silly, this is a nice view.<br /><br />woman: where is my daughter?<br /><br />hero (downstairs now): i dont know, i cannot see her anyway and she was not outside because i could not see her despite her being out there and me having a view of the entire neighbourhood and she is standing right outside, where on earth could she be?<br /><br />needless to say, anybody would be throwing things at the screen after 10 minutes of this. so, watch the first film with a couple of friends, having a few drinks, and make sure by the time you get to watching this one, you are absolutely blindly drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all. and there wasnt even any decent gore, such a shame.","finished_norm":["oh","my","god","i","give","thi","film","three","star","out","of","ten","for","the","follow","reason","the","final","sequenc","be","onc","again","quit","effect","handl","and","it","be","absolut","hilari","that","be","what","it","get","that","three","point","for","other","than","that","it","be","atroci","it","wasnt","mean","to","be","thi","funni","that","much","be","obviou","but","the","dub","the","act","of","the","dub","voic","the","dialogu","thei","sai","where","often","hilari","the","action","perform","andor","not","perform","conjur","lead","to","much","hilar","andor","throw","thing","at","the","screen","such","a","when","the","whole","town","be","be","slaughter","and","on","small","group","of","peopl","stand","on","a","balconi","look","on","a","if","thei","be","watch","a","cook","glass","or","the","attempt","escap","from","the","church","in","which","thei","hole","upbr","br","evil","mayor","i","think","someth","be","go","on","outsid","so","you","should","go","upstair","and","look","out","the","windowbr","br","hero","okbr","br","evil","mayor","now","be","my","chanc","to","make","some","idiot","go","outsid","and","flail","around","with","fire","be","total","ineffect","and","get","hack","upbr","br","insert","sequenc","in","which","thi","occursbr","br","evil","mayor","damn","wait","i","will","get","thi","small","child","and","she","will","walk","outsid","and","cry","pappa","seemingli","obvliou","to","the","fact","that","that","rotten","corps","be","not","just","spooki","stranger","but","be","actual","zombi","with","no","flesh","or","skin","or","anyth","and","she","will","lead","them","awai","and","i","will","flee","insert","sequenc","in","which","thi","occursbr","br","hero","upstair","he","be","try","to","escap","again","fool","and","he","have","leav","the","door","open","he","be","silli","thi","be","a","nice","viewbr","br","woman","where","be","my","daughterbr","br","hero","downstair","now","i","do","know","i","cannot","see","her","anywai","and","she","be","not","outsid","becaus","i","can","not","see","her","despit","her","be","out","there","and","me","have","a","view","of","the","entir","neighbourhood","and","she","be","stand","right","outsid","where","on","earth","can","she","bebr","br","needless","to","sai","anybodi","would","be","throw","thing","at","the","screen","after","minut","of","thi","so","watch","the","film","with","a","coupl","of","friend","have","a","few","drink","and","make","sure","by","the","time","you","get","to","watch","thi","on","you","be","absolut","blindli","drink","and","can","just","giggl","at","the","stupid","of","it","all","and","there","wasnt","even","ani","decent","gore","such","a","shame"],"filtered":["oh","god","give","thi","film","three","star","ten","follow","reason","final","sequenc","onc","quit","effect","handl","absolut","hilari","get","three","point","atroci","wasnt","mean","thi","funni","much","obviou","dub","act","dub","voic","dialogu","thei","sai","often","hilari","action","perform","andor","perform","conjur","lead","much","hilar","andor","throw","thing","screen","whole","town","slaughter","small","group","peopl","stand","balconi","look","thei","watch","cook","glass","attempt","escap","church","thei","hole","upbr","br","evil","mayor","think","someth","go","outsid","go","upstair","look","windowbr","br","hero","okbr","br","evil","mayor","chanc","make","idiot","go","outsid","flail","around","fire","total","ineffect","get","hack","upbr","br","insert","sequenc","thi","occursbr","br","evil","mayor","damn","wait","get","thi","small","child","walk","outsid","cry","pappa","seemingli","obvliou","fact","rotten","corps","spooki","stranger","actual","zombi","flesh","skin","anyth","lead","awai","flee","insert","sequenc","thi","occursbr","br","hero","upstair","try","escap","fool","leav","door","open","silli","thi","nice","viewbr","br","woman","daughterbr","br","hero","downstair","know","see","anywai","outsid","becaus","see","despit","view","entir","neighbourhood","stand","right","outsid","earth","bebr","br","needless","sai","anybodi","throw","thing","screen","minut","thi","watch","film","coupl","friend","drink","make","sure","time","get","watch","thi","absolut","blindli","drink","giggl","stupid","wasnt","even","ani","decent","gore","shame"],"filtered2":["oh","god","give","three","star","ten","follow","reason","final","sequenc","onc","quit","effect","handl","absolut","hilari","get","three","point","atroci","wasnt","mean","funni","obviou","dub","act","dub","voic","dialogu","often","hilari","action","perform","andor","perform","conjur","lead","hilar","andor","throw","thing","screen","whole","town","slaughter","small","group","peopl","stand","balconi","look","watch","cook","glass","attempt","escap","church","hole","upbr","evil","mayor","think","someth","go","outsid","go","upstair","look","windowbr","hero","okbr","evil","mayor","chanc","make","idiot","go","outsid","flail","around","fire","total","ineffect","get","hack","upbr","insert","sequenc","occursbr","evil",

{"value":"I'd really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it showed up in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player.<br /><br />I was very sadly disappointed, which in turn made me mad. I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop'. I watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration.<br /><br />The acting was very, very good, but that was about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his 'downfall'. While we understand that he and Cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no--nothing. We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital--but AGAIN, we don't see it.<br /><br />I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off. When Pierre, Cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble, we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different. I might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing.<br /><br />The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out-of-place and confusing pace. I can keep up with films like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other films that have flashbacks/flash-forwards left and right, but CU didn't capture and hold onto the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. It has an air of pretension in its 'we're not gonna tell you a damned thing, figure it out for yourself' presentation. It's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing.<br /><br />Good acting, like I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.","finished_norm":["i","have","realli","realli","want","to","see","thi","movi","and","wait","for","month","to","get","it","through","our","blockbust","total","access","account","when","it","show","up","in","our","mailbox","i","throw","it","straight","into","the","dvd","playerbr","br","i","be","veri","sadli","disappoint","which","in","turn","make","me","mad","i","will","give","ani","movi","a","chanc","even","if","i","want","to","walk","out","of","the","theaterpress","stop","i","watch","it","all","the","wai","through","but","do","not","get","anyth","from","it","but","frustrationbr","br","the","act","be","veri","veri","good","but","that","be","about","it","noth","be","explain","while","we","understand","that","mathieu","becom","depress","and","land","in","a","psych","ward","of","some","kind","we","re","never","give","insight","to","hi","downfal","while","we","understand","that","he","and","cedric","break","up","again","we","do","not","see","it","happen","or","why","it","happen","dure","a","interview","with","mathieu","doctor","cedric","reveal","that","he","have","cheat","on","him","onc","but","it","be","no","big","deal","i","expect","to","see","thi","in","flashback","but","nonoth","we","conjur","get","the","hint","that","cedric","be","the","on","to","bring","mat","to","the","hospitalbut","again","we","do","not","see","itbr","br","i","know","some","movi","be","a","take","it","a","it","be","basi","but","thi","movi","honestli","tick","me","off","when","pierr","cedric","ex","show","up","in","the","club","and","start","troubl","we","do","not","see","hide","nor","hair","of","him","until","near","the","end","and","it","take","me","a","good","chunk","of","time","to","figur","out","that","pierr","be","the","ex","hi","person","at","the","club","and","when","mat","find","him","be","entir","differ","i","mai","even","be","wrong","sai","thi","it","be","that","confusingbr","br","the","film","expect","you","to","know","everyth","and","move","along","with","it","disjoint","outofplac","and","confus","pace","i","can","keep","up","with","film","like","pi","citizen","kane","and","other","film","that","have","flashbacksflashforward","leav","and","right","but","cu","do","not","captur","and","hold","onto","the","styl","at","the","end","of","citizen","kane","you","know","what","go","on","and","discov","the","answer","to","the","main","mysteri","cu","just","leav","you","hang","it","have","a","air","of","pretens","in","it","we","re","not","gonna","tell","you","a","damn","thing","figur","it","out","for","yourself","present","it","like","read","a","book","with","the","chapter","switch","around","and","page","missingbr","br","good","act","like","i","sai","i","like","the","charact","but","the","whole","stori","be","just","too","disappoint"],"filtered":["realli","realli","want","see","thi","movi","wait","month","get","blockbust","total","access","account","show","mailbox","throw","straight","dvd","playerbr","br","veri","sadli","disappoint","turn","make","mad","give","ani","movi","chanc","even","want","walk","theaterpress","stop","watch","wai","get","anyth","frustrationbr","br","act","veri","veri","good","noth","explain","understand","mathieu","becom","depress","land","psych","ward","kind","re","never","give","insight","hi","downfal","understand","cedric","break","see","happen","happen","dure","interview","mathieu","doctor","cedric","reveal","cheat","onc","big","deal","expect","see","thi","flashback","nonoth","conjur","get","hint","cedric","bring","mat","hospitalbut","see","itbr","br","know","movi","take","basi","thi","movi","honestli","tick","pierr","cedric","ex","show","club","start","troubl","see","hide","hair","near","end","take","good","chunk","time","figur","pierr","ex","hi","person","club","mat","find","entir","differ","mai","even","wrong","sai","thi","confusingbr","br","film","expect","know","everyth","move","along","disjoint","outofplac","confus","pace","keep","film","like","pi","citizen","kane","film","flashbacksflashforward","leav","right","cu","captur","hold","onto","styl","end","citizen","kane","know","go","discov","answer","main","mysteri","cu","leav","hang","air","pretens","re","gonna","tell","damn","thing","figur","present","like","read","book","chapter","switch","around","page","missingbr","br","good","act","like","sai","like","charact","whole","stori","disappoint"],"filtered2":["realli","realli","want","see","wait","month","get","blockbust","total","access","account","show","mailbox","throw","straight","dvd","playerbr","veri","sadli","disappoint","turn","make","mad","give","ani","chanc","even","want","walk","theaterpress","stop","watch","wai","get","anyth","frustrationbr","act","veri","veri","good","noth","explain","understand","mathieu","becom","depress","land","psych","ward","kind","re","never","give","insight","downfal","understand","cedric","break","see","happen","happen","dure","interview","mathieu","doctor","cedric","reveal","cheat","onc","big","deal","expect","see","flashback","nonoth","conjur","get","hi

{"value":"I'm a big fan of movies that make you think. I'm still thinking long and hard about this one, fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled. What's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body, made extra-tacky by being filmed on cheap video. This happens three times and I was certain it would be explained in the end. I put my trust in the film-makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified. It was not.<br /><br />The movie has to be the most apathetic I've come across in the genre. The sets look like a cross between a 1970s Dr Who set and someone's ill-formed idea of a sponge-painted living room. The lighting is unimaginative (if your sets are going to be that bad, at least film them in semi-darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance). Of the abducted quartet, the girl stands out as being particularly lame, but none of them is given a personality. The aliens' plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved. Most of the movie consists of people running down corridors. Yes, it really is that exciting. The \"ray gun\" special effect is ... curious, to say the least (what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill, and even then the guy comes back for more?). The script is like a bad episode of The A-Team, and the ladies' hairstyles come from the same era, so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders. When we finally get to see what the aliens really look like, they're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes. The resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who's never had an idea more complex than a Saturday morning cartoon (I mean the bad ones with no plot, action, or characterization) in his or her life.<br /><br />But seriously, what is with the naked chick?! Was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the DVD cover to boost

{"value":"I am so appalled by this documentary. I am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way Puertoricans were portrayed. This documentary was not about the culture of Puertoricans. It was about the culture of Nuyoricans. Puertoricans and Nuyoricans are two different cultures. Very different cultures and should not be generalized to the Puerto Rican population. Rosie, before you make a documentary, you need to do the research. You also need to check and make sure your sources are credible. Puerto Ricans are not all loud and they do have class, which is one thing the documentary lacked to show. When I saw Rosie and Jimmie on the View and Rosie on Martha Stewart I was very excited about watching. I even made sure to let my parents know since they love Puerto Rico so much. After the first five minutes I could not believe how the documentary bashed the US and made Puerto Ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs. You need to go and visit Puerto Rico and you will see that Puerto Rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50% of the population is in poverty. Puerto Rico has colleges and well known Universities, roads, cars, shopping centers, malls (The largest Kmart and JCPenney's I've ever seen), restaurants, theaters, beaches, hotels(Ritz, Hilton,etc.), casinos, churches, agriculture, Auto Expresso, and restaurants just to name a few. Poverty? NOT 50% of the population is. Puerto Rican culture is about family, music, food, celebrating, and trying to move forward not backward. Oh, and new cousins don't just pop up out of no where. No that is not a Puerto Rican thing, that is a ghetto thing. We are not bastards. Parents of Puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about Puerto Rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what Puerto Rico is all about. They will see its beauty, people and culture. Please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity. Oh, and please don't tell your American friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the Puertorican people look ignorant.<br /><br />Yes, I am born and raised PUERTO RICAN from the island.

know!","finished_norm":["i","be","so","appal","by","thi","documentari","i","be","deepli","embarrass","and","asham","by","the","wai","puertorican","be","portrai","thi","documentari","be","not","about","the","cultur","of","puertorican","it","be","about","the","cultur","of","nuyorican","puertorican","and","nuyorican","be","two","differ","cultur","veri","differ","cultur","and","should","not","be","gener","to","the","puerto","rican","popul","rosi","befor","you","make","a","documentari","you","ne","to","do","the","research","you","conjur","ne","to","check","and","make","sure","your","sourc","be","credibl","puerto","rican","be","not","all","loud","and","thei","do","have","class","which","be","on","thing","the","documentari","lack","to","show","when","i","see","rosi","and","jimmi","on","the","view","and","rosi","on","martha","stewart","i","be","veri","excit","about","watch","i","even","make","sure","to","let","my","parent","know","sinc","thei","love","puerto","rico","so","much","after","the","five","minut","i","can","not","believ","how","the","documentari","bash","the","u","and","make","puerto","rican","look","like","a","bunch","of","guinea","pig","you","ne","to","go","and","visit","puerto","rico","and","you","will","see","that","puerto","rico","be","not","a","rd","world","countri","where","much","than","of","the","popul","be","in","poverti","puerto","rico","have","colleg","and","good","know","univers","road","car","shop","center","mall","the","larg","kmart","and","jcpennei","i","have","ever","see","restaur","theater","beach","hotelsritz","hiltonetc","casino","church","agricultur","auto","expresso","and","restaur","just","to","name","a","few","poverti","not","of","the","popul","be","puerto","rican","cultur","be","about","famili","music","food","celebr","and","try","to","move","forward","not","backward","oh","and","new","cousin","do","not","just","pop","up","out","of","no","where","no","that","be","not","a","puerto","rican","thing","that","be","a","ghetto","thing","we","be","not","bastard","parent","of","puertorican","descent","who","would","like","to","teach","their","child","about","puerto","rico","should","invest","in","a","trip","with","the","famili","so","thei","can","see","hand","what","puerto","rico","be","all","about","thei","will","see","it","beauti","peopl","and","cultur","pleas","do","not","show","them","thi","documentari","becaus","it","will","onli","cloud","their","mind","with","neg","oh","and","pleas","do","not","tell","your","american","friend","to","watch","thi","documentari","becaus","it","will","onli","make","the","puertorican","peopl","look","ignorantbr","br","ye","i","be","bear","and","rais","puerto","rican","from","the","island","just","so","you","know"],"filtered":["appal","thi","documentari","deepli","embarrass","asham","wai","puertorican","portrai","thi","documentari","cultur","puertorican","cultur","nuyorican","puertorican","nuyorican","two","differ","cultur","veri","differ","cultur","gener","puerto","rican","popul","rosi","befor","make","documentari","ne","research","conjur","ne","check","make","sure","sourc","credibl","puerto","rican","loud","thei","class","thing","documentari","lack","show","see","rosi","jimmi","view","rosi","martha","stewart","veri","excit","watch","even","make","sure","let","parent","know","sinc","thei","love","puerto","rico","much","five","minut","believ","documentari","bash","u","make","puerto","rican","look","like","bunch","guinea","pig","ne","go","visit","puerto","rico","see","puerto","rico","rd","world","countri","much","popul","poverti","puerto","rico","colleg","good","know","univers","road","car","shop","center","mall","larg","kmart","jcpennei","ever","see","restaur","theater","beach","hotelsritz","hiltonetc","casino","church","agricultur","auto","expresso","restaur","name","poverti","popul","puerto","rican","cultur","famili","music","food","celebr","try","move","forward","backward","oh","new","cousin","pop","puerto","rican","thing","ghetto","thing","bastard","parent","puertorican","descent","like","teach","child","puerto","rico","invest","trip","famili","thei","see","hand","puerto","rico","thei","see","beauti","peopl","cultur","pleas","show","thi","documentari","becaus","onli","cloud","mind","neg","oh","pleas","tell","american","friend","watch","thi","documentari","becaus","onli","make","puertorican","peopl","look","ignorantbr","br","ye","bear","rais","puerto","rican","island","know"],"filtered2":["appal","documentari","deepli","embarrass","asham","wai","puertorican","portrai","documentari","cultur","puertorican","cultur","nuyorican","puertorican","nuyorican","two","differ","cultur","veri","differ","cultur","gener","puerto","rican","popul","rosi","befor","make","documentari","ne","research","conjur","ne","check","make","sure","sourc","credibl","puerto","rican","loud","class","thing","documentari","lack","show","see","rosi","jimmi","view","rosi","martha","stewart","veri","excit","watch","even","make","sure","let","parent","know","sinc","love","puerto","rico","fiv

{"value":"Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning. While there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes. The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them. In short; they're rubbish. This isn't good considering that they're the leads, and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors. It's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't (not completely). It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created. It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare. Oh dear.<br /><br />As you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie. However, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults. First and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale. The central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience. The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas). Thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout. This is to be expected as it stars kids, but Bernard Rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best. The film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing. In fact, if I had to sum this travesty up in one word, I would choose 'painful'. Paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole.

{"value":"Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\". The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. If you think this sounds interesting, think again. The movie is boring at best, right down an embarrassment at worst.<br /><br />First of all, the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet. The only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis. The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed... you name it. They try to make us believe this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say the least.<br /><br />Second, the story is a rehash of the first one, with not one bit of originality. All the few jokes (and there's barely any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\".<br /><br />Third problem, the special effects. I'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series. You're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time.<br /><br />Fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is just boring. Only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all. The first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the bugs that live in it. In this one, the adults (which come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. Disgusting.<br /><br />I don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed Disney's executives, except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. I'm warning you: leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay: getting dust on the shop's shelves.","finished_norm":["ye","talk","about","bad","sequel","rick","morani","star","in","thi","aw","sequel","to","the","oncefunnyandentertain","honei","i","shrink","the","kid","the","concept","basic","plai","the","same","wai","a","the","film","but","with","the","adult","instead","of","the","kid","be","shrink","and","the","inner","hous","instead","of","the","garden","a","the","univers","to","explor","if","you","think","thi","sound","interest","think","again","the","movi","be","bore","at","well","right","down","a","embarrass","at","worstbr","br","of","all","the","continu","of","the","seri","have","be","complet","flush","down","the","toilet","the","onli","remain","actor","of","the","movi","be","appar","rick","morani","the","actress","plai","hi","wife","have","chang","the","actor","plai","the","kid","have","chang","the","on","plai","the","neighbor","have","chang","you","name","it","thei","try","to","make","u","believ","thi","be","the","same","famili","but","the","result","be","puzzl","to","sai","the","leastbr","br","the","stori","be","a","rehash","of","the","on","with","not","on","bite","of","origin","all","the","few","joke","and","there","bare","ani","and","the","danger","situat","present","in","the","movi","be","just","copi","straight","from","honei","i","shrink","the","kidsbr","br","problem","the","special","effect","i","be","sure","thi","have","be","do","on","a","small","budget","but","thei","be","pathet","wai","wai","wrong","than","the","on","appear","in","the","rest","of","the","seri","you","re","suppos","to","admir","in","aw","thi","tini","figur","explor","the","huge","domest","area","but","you","will","probabl","end","up","cring","much","of","the","timebr","br","problem","to","locat","the","action","insid","the","hous","be","just","bore","onli","few","thing","happen","and","when","thei","happen","thei","be","not","thrill","at","all","the","movi","be","amus","becaus","the","kid","be","deal","with","natur","the","grass","and","the","bug","that","live","in","it","in","thi","on","the","adult","which","come","up","a","rather","bore","compar","to","the","kid","deal","with","dust","a","cockroach","and","a","cockroach","trap","disgustingbr","br","i","do","not","know","why","the","idea","of","releas","such","a","trite","sequel","to","the","alreadi","moribund","seri","appeal","disnei","execut","except","mayb","becaus","thei","ne","to","cash","in","without","spend","five","minut","think","about","someth","new","i","be","warn","you","leav","thi","tasteless","cashin","garbag","where","it","should","stai","get","dust","on","the","shop","shelv"],"filtered":["ye","talk","bad","sequel","rick","morani","star","thi","aw","sequel","oncefunnyandentertain","honei","shrink","kid","concept","basic","plai","wai","film","adult","instead","kid","shrink","inner","hous","instead","garden","univers","explor","think","thi","sound","interest","think","movi","bore","well","right","embarrass","worstbr","br","continu","seri","complet","flush","toilet","onli","remain","actor","movi","appar","rick","morani","actress","plai","hi","wife","chang","actor","plai","kid","chang","plai","neighbor","chang","name","thei","try","make","u","believ","thi","famili","result","puzzl","sai","leastbr","br","stori","rehash","bite","origin","joke","bare","ani","danger","situat","present","movi","copi","straight","honei","shrink","kidsbr","br","problem","special","effect","sure","thi","small","budget","thei","pathet","wai","wai","wrong","appear","rest","seri","re","suppos","admir","aw","thi","tini","figur","explor","huge","domest","area","probabl","end","cring","much","timebr","br","problem","locat","action","insid","hous","bore","onli","thing","happen","thei","happen","thei","thrill","movi","amus","becaus","kid","deal","natur","grass","bug","live","thi","adult","come","rather","bore","compar","kid","deal","dust","cockroach","cockroach","trap","disgustingbr","br","know","idea","releas","trite","sequel","alreadi","moribund","seri","appeal","disnei","execut","except","mayb","becaus","thei","ne","cash","without","spend","five","minut","think","someth","new","warn","leav","thi","tasteless","cashin","garbag","stai","get","dust","shop","shelv"],"filtered2":["ye","talk","bad","sequel","rick","morani","star","aw","sequel","oncefunnyandentertain","honei","shrink","kid","concept","basic","plai","wai","adult","instead","kid","shrink","inner","hous","instead","garden","univers","explor","think","sound","interest","think","bore","well","right","embarrass","worstbr","continu","complet","flush","toilet","onli","remain","actor","appar","rick","morani","actress","plai","wife","chang","actor","plai","kid","chang","plai","neighbor","chang","name","try","make","u","believ","famili","result","puzzl","leastbr","stori","rehash","bite","origin","joke","bare","ani","danger","situat","present","copi","straight","honei","shrink","kidsbr","problem","special","effect","sure","small","budget","pathet","wai","wai","wrong","appear","rest","re","suppos","admir","aw","tini","figur","explor",
