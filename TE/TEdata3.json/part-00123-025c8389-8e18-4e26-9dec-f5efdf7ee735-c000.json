{"value":"In my opinion, this movie's title should be changed from \"Only the Brave\" to \"All About Lane\". I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome. Although, I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were all great. However, the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie. Sorry Lane, you are just not a film actor. Stick to what you're good at - theater acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... Why weren't they cast for that role? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers don't look like they were fighting German soldiers... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some actually fighting? This film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a major distribution.","finished_norm":["in","my","opinion","thi","movi","titl","should","be","chang","from","onli","the","brave","to","all","about","lane","i","go","to","a","screen","of","thi","film","a","few","month","ago","and","be","quit","disappoint","with","the","outcom","although","i","appreci","that","the","director","make","a","movi","about","the","man","of","nd","a","subject","matt","that","long","deserv","address","in","the","film","industri","the","act","in","some","part","of","film","be","quit","stale","the","perform","of","marc","dacasco","tamlyn","tomita","and","jason","scott","lee","be","all","great","howev","the","director","should","have","never","put","himself","a","the","main","charact","in","the","movi","sorri","lane","you","be","just","not","a","film","actor","stick","to","what","you","re","good","at","theater","act","gina","hiraizumi","perform","in","thi","film","be","conjur","horribl","she","should","never","have","be","give","a","speak","role","and","her","look","be","unfit","to","plai","the","part","of","a","miss","nisei","queen","there","be","other","young","actress","in","the","film","who","be","natur","beauti","and","whose","perform","be","wonder","why","be","not","thei","cast","for","that","role","anoth","major","problem","with","thi","film","be","it","action","sequenc","the","japaneseamerican","soldier","do","not","look","like","thei","be","fight","german","soldier","let","alon","anyon","grant","thi","be","a","low","budget","featur","but","sinc","thi","be","a","warbas","film","be","not","it","import","to","show","some","actual","fight","thi","film","be","a","worthi","attempt","but","definit","not","worth","a","major","distribut"],"filtered":["opinion","thi","movi","titl","chang","onli","brave","lane","go","screen","thi","film","month","ago","quit","disappoint","outcom","although","appreci","director","make","movi","man","nd","subject","matt","long","deserv","address","film","industri","act","part","film","quit","stale","perform","marc","dacasco","tamlyn","tomita","jason","scott","lee","great","howev","director","never","put","main","charact","movi","sorri","lane","film","actor","stick","re","good","theater","act","gina","hiraizumi","perform","thi","film","conjur","horribl","never","give","speak","role","look","unfit","plai","part","miss","nisei","queen","young","actress","film","natur","beauti","whose","perform","wonder","thei","cast","role","anoth","major","problem","thi","film","action","sequenc","japaneseamerican","soldier","look","like","thei","fight","german","soldier","let","alon","anyon","grant","thi","low","budget","featur","sinc","thi","warbas","film","import","show","actual","fight","thi","film","worthi","attempt","definit","worth","major","distribut"],"filtered2":["opinion","titl","chang","onli","brave","lane","go","screen","month","ago","quit","disappoint","outcom","although","appreci","director","make","man","nd","subject","matt","long","deserv","address","industri","act","part","quit","stale","perform","marc","dacasco","tamlyn","tomita","jason","scott","lee","great","howev","director","never","put","main","charact","sorri","lane","actor","stick","re","good","theater","act","gina","hiraizumi","perform","conjur","horribl","never","give","speak","role","look","unfit","plai","part","miss","nisei","queen","young","actress","natur","beauti","whose","perform","wonder","cast","role","anoth","major","problem","action","sequenc","japaneseamerican","soldier","look","like","fight","german","soldier","let","alon","anyon","grant","low","budget","featur","sinc","warbas","import","show","actual","fight","worthi","attempt","definit","worth","major","distribut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,10,11,16,21,28,30,39,40,41,42,45,51,52,58,61,68,73,92,99,105,113,120,124,128,129,135,158,159,162,167,175,177,179,187,192,217,219,230,233,237,255,256,264,278,305,325,344,349,355,392,404,408,416,423,424,437,456,457,538,550,570,598,600,610,657,924,930,961,1066,1083,1231,1337,1339,1469,2220,2264,2348,2470,2877,2915,3237,4544,8466],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,10,11,16,21,28,30,39,40,41,42,45,51,52,58,61,68,73,92,99,105,113,120,124,128,129,135,158,159,162,167,175,177,179,187,192,217,219,230,233,237,255,256,264,278,305,325,344,349,355,392,404,408,416,423,424,437,456,457,538,550,570,598,600,610,657,924,930,961,1066,1083,1231,1337,1339,1469,2220,2264,2348,2470,2877,2915,3237,4544,8466],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.393227744058217,2.324031090670098,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.5538940054862738,1.62849687

{"value":"This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clich√©s from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Avoid this one.

{"value":"This film was absolutely awful, I even feel uncomfortable calling it a film. Its the typical \"mumblecore\" movie, with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to \"figure stuff out\". I have tried to give mumblecore a chance, but lets be honest its just horrible.<br /><br />I am not out of sync with cinema, I appreciate Dogme95 films, Idioterne is one of my all time favorite films. So I do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some (ANY) substance.<br /><br />Everything in this film is horrid, the acting, the writing (or was it all improvised?), the direction, but MOST of all, above everything else, the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never anywhere logical, there was no consistency. I got to admit being a guy I had heard there was nudity in this film so I thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity (yea I know, I'm a jerk). Well thanks to the uber crappy camera-work you never really get to see anything, and the things you do see, TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels.<br /><br />The dialogue made me want to vomit, the camera-work made me want to vomit, but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics, well now that more than anything makes me want to

{"value":"First I liked that movie. It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments. The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best!!! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste!!! But the script writers disappointed me extremely. The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Don't like the ending. The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright. It would be OK, if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they only deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : )))... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!!

{"value":"Many moons ago when I was seven years old, I can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. It appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the wise adults that they are, they told me \"Absolutely not! It's a bunch of trash.\" Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see the \"Incredible Melting Man.\"<br /><br />Little time passed - maybe a couple of days. I forgot about \"The Incredible Melting Man\" and my disappointment faded. Twenty-five years passed until it re-entered the forefront of my thoughts. While surfing through channels on digital cable, I found this long-lost relic of a movie. My curiosity was piqued and I decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. The \"Incredible Melting Man\" is perhaps the worst movie known to man. It makes movies such as \"Def-Con 4, \"Metalstorm\", and \"Freddie Got Fingered\" look like Oscar nominees. I feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth. The story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977. How anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake that I did. Listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie.

{"value":"I really tried to like this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction.<br /><br />In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life.<br /><br />The production values are terrible; mainly the acting. Oh, you won't enjoy ANY of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick.<br /><br />Second, the plot is just non sense. How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband? How could she believe him?! The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.<br /><br />Also, the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking \"wtf?\". <br /><br />Scenes like those you will find plenty. <br /><br />Avoid this movie. Please, avoid it; it's not soft core, it's not a documental, it's not a dramatic feature. It's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.<br /><br />Only Mrs. Kinski's legs on display are worth the watch.

{"value":"If this film had a budget of 20 million I'd just like to know where the money went. A monkey could make better CGI effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage, although I must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really, really cool on an original play-station 1 game, and early PC games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made. What puzzles me is where did the money go? Pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la George Lucas circa 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or ruining in this case) for about the same 20 million. This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made! I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again. I hated it completely! I regress. I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew.

{"value":"Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you'll only hold it against them. Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed out after 10 minutes, and they were the lucky ones. The 'monsters' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien. The creators of the movie obviously didn't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters, so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didn't get to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening, if anything is. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing, and you don't pass out, you'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film. The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spewing of the 'Queen Mary of curse words' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you must see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the bargain bin at the video store. If there's any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you.","finished_norm":["obvious","a","lot","of","talent","behind","the","scene","crow","member","work","on","thi","movi","so","do","not","even","look","at","the","credit","at","the","end","you","will","onli","hold","it","against","them","nobodi","seem","interest","in","see","thi","movi","onli","be","in","the","theater","two","pass","out","after","minut","and","thei","be","the","lucki","on","the","monster","be","the","unemploi","worm","from","star","trek","the","wrath","of","khan","and","reject","design","for","the","space","creatur","in","alien","the","creator","of","the","movi","obvious","do","not","want","to","overshadow","the","rate","movi","monster","so","thei","hire","forth","rate","actor","who","appar","do","not","get","to","memor","their","line","or","in","some","case","learn","to","pronounc","the","word","befor","film","begin","some","scene","be","incredibli","inept","in","convei","just","what","be","suppos","to","be","happen","if","anyth","be","if","you","be","unfortun","enough","to","be","in","a","theater","where","thi","movi","be","show","and","you","do","not","pass","out","you","will","laugh","at","what","be","suppos","to","be","frighten","or","suspens","moment","of","the","film","the","implaus","of","sever","scene","will","just","stun","you","and","stephen","dorff","regular","spew","of","the","queen","mari","of","curs","word","convei","the","feel","of","anyon","who","pai","to","see","thi","if","you","must","see","thi","movi","do","yourself","a","favor","and","wait","until","it","in","the","bargain","bin","at","the","video","store","if","there","ani","justic","in","the","film","industri","on","of","the","main","actor","will","be","there","to","rend","it","to","you"],"filtered":["obvious","lot","talent","behind","scene","crow","member","work","thi","movi","even","look","credit","end","onli","hold","nobodi","seem","interest","see","thi","movi","onli","theater","two","pass","minut","thei","lucki","monster","unemploi","worm","star","trek","wrath","khan","reject","design","space","creatur","alien","creator","movi","obvious","want","overshadow","rate","movi","monster","thei","hire","forth","rate","actor","appar","get","memor","line","case","learn","pronounc","word","befor","film","begin","scene","incredibli","inept","convei","suppos","happen","anyth","unfortun","enough","theater","thi","movi","show","pass","laugh","suppos","frighten","suspens","moment","film","implaus","sever","scene","stun","stephen","dorff","regular","spew","queen","mari","curs","word","convei","feel","anyon","pai","see","thi","must","see","thi","movi","favor","wait","bargain","bin","video","store","ani","justic","film","industri","main","actor","rend"],"filtered2":["obvious","lot","talent","behind","scene","crow","member","work","even","look","credit","end","onli","hold","nobodi","seem","interest","see","onli","theater","two","pass","minut","lucki","monster","unemploi","worm","star","trek","wrath","khan","reject","design","space","creatur","alien","creator","obvious","want","overshadow","rate","monster","hire","forth","rate","actor","appar","get","memor","line","case","learn","pronounc","word","befor","begin","scene","incredibli","inept","convei","suppos","happen","anyth","unfortun","enough","theater","show","pass","laugh","suppos","frighten","suspens","moment","implaus","sever","scene","stun","stephen","dorff","regular","spew","queen","mari","curs","word","convei","feel","anyon","pai","see","must","see","favor","wait","bargain","bin","video","store","ani","justic","industri","main","actor","rend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,11,16,19,24,27,28,35,37,41,43,47,48,59,60,72,79,93,94,100,104,107,133,141,147,149,158,179,188,202,227,240,258,276,288,308,316,322,331,341,356,393,413,414,424,431,487,529,533,565,618,637,681,687,761,768,793,866,921,1014,1074,1083,1110,1347,1413,1424,1469,1556,1566,1613,1710,1759,1895,2024,2058,2064,2088,2260,2304,2802,2848,4104,4161,4425,6045,6075,6415,6546],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,11,16,19,24,27,28,35,37,41,43,47,48,59,60,72,79,93,94,100,104,107,133,141,147,149,158,179,188,202,227,240,258,276,288,308,316,322,331,341,356,393,413,414,424,431,487,529,533,565,618,637,681,687,761,768,793,866,921,1014,1074,1083,1110,1347,1413,1424,1469,1556,1566,1613,1710,1759,1895,2024,2058,2064,2088,2260,2304,2802,2848,4104,4161,4425,6045,6075,6415,6546],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.982619630677639,1.1966138720291084,3.9371420340352055,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,3.1375198335242067,1.6608112036218214,1.70646943531

{"value":"There are really two sections of this film. Firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'The Simpsons' Troy McClure should be doing the narration.<br /><br />Then the rest of the film begins (starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film) which, while technically OK, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters, but characters that make no sense.<br /><br />This is especially so with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the 'organisation' the whole time yet what would have happened had Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out? In that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is.<br /><br />The overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy. It's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.<br /><br />Put simply, the film fails on all levels.","finished_norm":["there","be","realli","two","section","of","thi","film","firstli","there","the","laughabl","prologu","to","the","film","which","be","so","hyster","and","cornbal","that","it","would","almost","feel","appropri","that","the","the","simpson","troi","mcclure","should","be","do","the","narrationbr","br","then","the","rest","of","the","film","begin","start","off","with","a","titl","song","which","realli","doe","not","fit","in","with","the","rest","of","the","film","which","while","technic","okai","be","kill","by","a","vagu","inconsist","and","unconvinc","plot","and","not","just","uninterest","charact","but","charact","that","make","no","sensebr","br","thi","be","especi","so","with","mickei","roonei","spiventa","who","be","supposedli","in","on","the","plot","and","part","of","the","organis","the","whole","time","yet","what","would","have","happen","have","hackman","make","the","seemingli","arbitrari","decis","to","take","him","along","when","break","out","in","that","case","he","would","have","be","a","total","superflu","and","unnecessari","charact","which","in","the","end","he","still","isbr","br","the","overal","problem","of","the","film","be","that","it","total","unwil","to","put","ani","detail","on","who","or","what","be","behind","thi","conspiraci","it","a","if","the","filmmak","do","not","have","the","courag","to","impli","that","a","particular","section","of","societi","would","be","capabl","of","creat","such","a","organis","and","instead","settl","on","the","hope","that","a","lack","of","explan","would","suffic","and","the","audienc","would","form","their","own","conclusionsbr","br","put","simpli","the","film","fail","on","all","level"],"filtered":["realli","two","section","thi","film","firstli","laughabl","prologu","film","hyster","cornbal","almost","feel","appropri","simpson","troi","mcclure","narrationbr","br","rest","film","begin","start","titl","song","realli","doe","fit","rest","film","technic","okai","kill","vagu","inconsist","unconvinc","plot","uninterest","charact","charact","make","sensebr","br","thi","especi","mickei","roonei","spiventa","supposedli","plot","part","organis","whole","time","yet","happen","hackman","make","seemingli","arbitrari","decis","take","along","break","case","total","superflu","unnecessari","charact","end","still","isbr","br","overal","problem","film","total","unwil","put","ani","detail","behind","thi","conspiraci","filmmak","courag","impli","particular","section","societi","capabl","creat","organis","instead","settl","hope","lack","explan","suffic","audienc","form","conclusionsbr","br","put","simpli","film","fail","level"],"filtered2":["realli","two","section","firstli","laughabl","prologu","hyster","cornbal","almost","feel","appropri","simpson","troi","mcclure","narrationbr","rest","begin","start","titl","song","realli","doe","fit","rest","technic","okai","kill","vagu","inconsist","unconvinc","plot","uninterest","charact","charact","make","sensebr","especi","mickei","roonei","spiventa","supposedli","plot","part","organis","whole","time","yet","happen","hackman","make","seemingli","arbitrari","decis","take","along","break","case","total","superflu","unnecessari","charact","end","still","isbr","overal","problem","total","unwil","put","ani","detail","behind","conspiraci","filmmak","courag","impli","particular","section","societi","capabl","creat","organis","instead","settl","hope","lack","explan","suffic","audienc","form","conclusionsbr","put","simpli","fail","level"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,10,13,18,24,27,31,32,43,47,61,64,71,76,94,111,131,147,152,159,167,168,181,183,184,191,194,201,215,226,264,267,288,323,324,328,360,362,393,412,445,552,676,689,740,832,944,946,1000,1049,1081,1205,1247,1399,1483,1508,1536,1748,1876,1932,2007,2097,2128,2157,2188,2202,2981,3161,3183,3212,3357,3844,4822,4905,5275,5630,5844,5891,6234,8035],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,10,13,18,24,27,31,32,43,47,61,64,71,76,94,111,131,147,152,159,167,168,181,183,184,191,194,201,215,226,264,267,288,323,324,328,360,362,393,412,445,552,676,689,740,832,944,946,1000,1049,1081,1205,1247,1399,1483,1508,1536,1748,1876,1932,2007,2097,2128,2157,2188,2202,2981,3161,3183,3212,3357,3844,4822,4905,5275,5630,5844,5891,6234,8035],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9418936859054116,3.3716610723085094,2.2635883139467947,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.9214926742550966,2.1337665533324026,2.08112281984698,2.1183455303375887,2.2512118082053005,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,4.60053593038899,2.

{"value":"To me this just comes off as a soap opera. I guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered \"social commentary.\" But in the final analysis, I simply don't care how you characterize this film. None of the characters are very likable or engaging. I felt no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in the malaise. And despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore, incomprehensible) reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in, this story is sleazy, melodramatic and trite.<br /><br />Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is Lauren Bacall's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is vile, and his is pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving, out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult children, is the most sympathetic character. Most interesting of all, however, is the severe-looking Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner. He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns, but here he is an honest, likable fellow.<br /><br />I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a few likable

{"value":"A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the \"Costume Killer\" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.<br /><br />There is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a \"lighter\" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.<br /><br />If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode).

{"value":"If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene. It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't waste your money on this. True, it's not as horrific as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's little

{"value":"I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT.<br /><br />Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.<br /><br />Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.","finished_norm":["i","have","be","look","forward","to","see","dreamgirl","for","quit","a","whilewhat","with","all","it","rave","review","nomin","and","medium","attent","and","i","must","sai","the","quarter","of","the","movi","be","good","it","realli","portrai","the","black","music","scene","back","then","howev","a","the","movi","wear","on","me","and","my","whole","famili","be","bore","out","of","our","wit","the","sing","just","keep","come","on","after","the","other","i","mean","serious","just","on","much","music","numb","and","it","would","have","break","even","with","rentbr","br","furthermor","i","notic","hardli","ani","charact","develop","in","ani","of","the","charact","i","just","do","not","care","what","happen","to","them","even","when","eddi","murphi","charact","die","of","a","drug","overdos","i","know","i","should","have","be","sad","but","i","just","can","not","feel","ani","emot","for","that","charact","the","charact","be","give","a","flimsi","background","about","sing","in","their","childhood","and","whatnot","but","there","person","be","not","reveal","enough","to","draw","me","inbr","br","final","the","conflict","be","simpli","not","signific","enough","to","make","the","viewer","care","which","go","along","with","the","lack","of","charact","develop","thi","movi","remind","me","of","a","copycat","movi","base","on","rai","chicago","and","rend","rai","and","chicago","be","wonder","movi","in","my","opinion","overal","i","think","thi","movi","would","well","suit","someon","who","doe","not","realli","care","about","a","overal","stori","yet","would","enjoi","two","hour","of","entertain","and","fun","sing","perform"],"filtered":["look","forward","see","dreamgirl","quit","whilewhat","rave","review","nomin","medium","attent","must","sai","quarter","movi","good","realli","portrai","black","music","scene","back","howev","movi","wear","whole","famili","bore","wit","sing","keep","come","mean","serious","much","music","numb","break","even","rentbr","br","furthermor","notic","hardli","ani","charact","develop","ani","charact","care","happen","even","eddi","murphi","charact","die","drug","overdos","know","sad","feel","ani","emot","charact","charact","give","flimsi","background","sing","childhood","whatnot","person","reveal","enough","draw","inbr","br","final","conflict","simpli","signific","enough","make","viewer","care","go","along","lack","charact","develop","thi","movi","remind","copycat","movi","base","rai","chicago","rend","rai","chicago","wonder","movi","opinion","overal","think","thi","movi","well","suit","someon","doe","realli","care","overal","stori","yet","enjoi","two","hour","entertain","fun","sing","perform"],"filtered2":["look","forward","see","dreamgirl","quit","whilewhat","rave","review","nomin","medium","attent","must","quarter","good","realli","portrai","black","music","scene","back","howev","wear","whole","famili","bore","wit","sing","keep","come","mean","serious","music","numb","break","even","rentbr","furthermor","notic","hardli","ani","charact","develop","ani","charact","care","happen","even","eddi","murphi","charact","die","drug","overdos","know","sad","feel","ani","emot","charact","charact","give","flimsi","background","sing","childhood","whatnot","person","reveal","enough","draw","inbr","final","conflict","simpli","signific","enough","make","viewer","care","go","along","lack","charact","develop","remind","copycat","base","rai","chicago","rend","rai","chicago","wonder","opinion","overal","think","well","suit","someon","doe","realli","care","overal","stori","yet","enjoi","two","hour","entertain","fun","sing","perform"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,10,12,13,16,17,18,19,20,26,27,30,34,43,47,63,88,93,94,105,108,111,113,118,120,134,139,141,153,156,174,175,176,182,183,194,195,200,201,205,229,259,279,293,320,324,334,360,371,412,455,469,506,514,516,533,538,576,636,644,660,665,688,697,699,801,833,851,884,1245,1331,1463,1619,1746,1807,1885,2154,2251,2532,2775,2885,3320,4188,6866,8413],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,10,12,13,16,17,18,19,20,26,27,30,34,43,47,63,88,93,94,105,108,111,113,118,120,134,139,141,153,156,174,175,176,182,183,194,195,200,201,205,229,259,279,293,320,324,334,360,371,412,455,469,506,514,516,533,538,576,636,644,660,665,688,697,699,801,833,851,884,1245,1331,1463,1619,1746,1807,1885,2154,2251,2532,2775,2885,3320,4188,6866,8413],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,6.743322144617019,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.16

{"value":"I rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an Academy Award, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it didn't. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow moving, despite having hardly any plot.<br /><br />The plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear on this), and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories. The fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot, but they're very short, and don't really seem to have any point. <br /><br />The first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life, but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that doesn't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure. Perfect metaphor for this film really. <br /><br />The photography of Skye is beautiful though, but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","film","out","have","hear","of","the","fuss","about","it","not","be","put","up","for","a","academi","award","but","after","watch","it","it","easi","to","see","why","it","do","not","despit","the","beauti","photographi","the","film","be","incredibli","slow","move","despit","have","hardli","ani","plotbr","br","the","plot","be","about","a","young","boi","try","to","come","to","term","with","hi","parent","death","in","what","mai","or","mai","not","have","be","a","accid","the","film","be","never","clear","on","thi","and","how","hi","grandfath","us","to","tell","him","fairi","stori","the","fairi","stori","contain","the","onli","bit","of","interest","in","the","plot","but","thei","re","veri","short","and","do","not","realli","seem","to","have","ani","point","br","br","the","fairi","stori","in","particular","concern","a","boi","try","to","get","a","magic","flower","to","hi","dye","girlfriend","to","save","her","life","but","the","boi","delai","by","tast","the","flower","to","make","sure","it","be","not","poison","which","result","in","him","be","a","few","second","too","late","to","save","hi","girlfriend","the","grandfath","then","pronounc","that","the","moral","be","that","the","boi","be","too","impati","but","that","doe","not","make","ani","sens","becaus","it","be","overcaut","and","slow","which","result","in","hi","failur","perfect","metaphor","for","thi","film","realli","br","br","the","photographi","of","skye","be","beauti","though","but","then","stardust","which","be","releas","thi","year","be","anoth","film","about","fairi","stori","film","in","skye","and","beautifulli","photograph","and","it","infinit","well","than","thi","on"],"filtered":["rent","thi","film","hear","fuss","put","academi","award","watch","easi","see","despit","beauti","photographi","film","incredibli","slow","move","despit","hardli","ani","plotbr","br","plot","young","boi","try","come","term","hi","parent","death","mai","mai","accid","film","never","clear","thi","hi","grandfath","us","tell","fairi","stori","fairi","stori","contain","onli","bit","interest","plot","thei","re","veri","short","realli","seem","ani","point","br","br","fairi","stori","particular","concern","boi","try","get","magic","flower","hi","dye","girlfriend","save","life","boi","delai","tast","flower","make","sure","poison","result","second","late","save","hi","girlfriend","grandfath","pronounc","moral","boi","impati","doe","make","ani","sens","becaus","overcaut","slow","result","hi","failur","perfect","metaphor","thi","film","realli","br","br","photographi","skye","beauti","though","stardust","releas","thi","year","anoth","film","fairi","stori","film","skye","beautifulli","photograph","infinit","well","thi"],"filtered2":["rent","hear","fuss","put","academi","award","watch","easi","see","despit","beauti","photographi","incredibli","slow","move","despit","hardli","ani","plotbr","plot","young","boi","try","come","term","parent","death","mai","mai","accid","never","clear","grandfath","us","tell","fairi","stori","fairi","stori","contain","onli","bit","interest","plot","re","veri","short","realli","seem","ani","point","fairi","stori","particular","concern","boi","try","get","magic","flower","dye","girlfriend","save","life","boi","delai","tast","flower","make","sure","poison","result","second","late","save","girlfriend","grandfath","pronounc","moral","boi","impati","doe","make","ani","sens","becaus","overcaut","slow","result","failur","perfect","metaphor","realli","photographi","skye","beauti","though","stardust","releas","year","anoth","fairi","stori","skye","beautifulli","photograph","infinit","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,11,13,15,17,18,20,22,27,32,34,35,36,42,46,56,57,60,66,68,73,75,86,90,119,135,150,159,173,189,216,245,272,275,282,325,327,390,391,447,590,661,665,670,677,687,711,730,744,832,858,872,874,878,947,1004,1022,1230,1269,1312,1325,1372,1382,1880,2295,2778,2883,2931,2965,3007,4161,4454,4831,5233,5724],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,11,13,15,17,18,20,22,27,32,34,35,36,42,46,56,57,60,66,68,73,75,86,90,119,135,150,159,173,189,216,245,272,275,282,325,327,390,391,447,590,661,665,670,677,687,711,730,744,832,858,872,874,878,947,1004,1022,1230,1269,1312,1325,1372,1382,1880,2295,2778,2883,2931,2965,3007,4161,4454,4831,5233,5724],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,5.108214776042387,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,3.9008101766037884,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,2.9360366939211433,1.6219954307453837,3.311542587503466

{"value":"This film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems like the powers that be couldn't leave well enough alone. They couldn't decide if this was to be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and also how much they should soft-pedal whoever's story it turned out to be. So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Ms. Graham)personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either. Added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959. Clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing. However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr has never looked lovelier, and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They truly make a beautiful, mature couple, and I only wish they had better material to work with. There is one scene that does work - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs. Other than that, the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other Wald produced soaps of the 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF

{"value":"They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99% guesswork. It's only a couple of lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged. <br /><br />So it's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel \"The True History of the Kelly Gang\" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger's much derided 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality, and a better movie overall, which isn't saying a whole lot for it.<br /><br />Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.","finished_norm":["thei","construct","thi","on","a","a","kind","of","fantasi","man","from","snowi","river","meet","butch","cassidi","and","the","sundanc","kid","and","just","for","a","romant","touch","ned","and","joe","get","to","plai","awai","with","high","class","talent","the","bore","young","wife","of","wealthi","old","man","okai","there","be","lot","of","myth","about","ned","kelli","but","there","be","conjur","a","lot","of","good","docum","fact","still","leav","space","for","artist","creativ","in","produc","a","good","histor","dramaticis","i","mean","thi","be","not","the","robin","hood","stori","not","the","arthurian","legend","not","beowulf","not","someon","whose","life","be","so","shroud","in","the","mist","of","mani","mani","centuri","past","that","ani","recreat","of","their","life","and","time","be","guesswork","it","onli","a","coupl","of","lifetim","ago","my","own","grandpar","be","alreadi","of","school","ag","when","ned","be","hang","br","br","so","it","silli","me","for","fancifulli","imagin","thi","movi","be","a","seriou","attempt","to","tell","the","kelli","stori","have","recent","read","peter","carei","excel","novel","the","true","histori","of","the","kelli","gang","i","have","eagerli","anticip","that","thi","would","be","in","similar","vein","but","no","the","fact","be","that","mick","jagger","much","derid","kelli","be","probabl","far","close","to","realiti","and","a","well","movi","overal","which","be","not","sai","a","whole","lot","for","itbr","br","glad","it","onli","cost","me","two","buck","to","hire","the","dvd","i","will","give","it","and","that","onli","becaus","some","of","the","nice","shot","of","the","australian","bush","make","me","feel","gener"],"filtered":["thei","construct","thi","kind","fantasi","man","snowi","river","meet","butch","cassidi","sundanc","kid","romant","touch","ned","joe","get","plai","awai","high","class","talent","bore","young","wife","wealthi","old","man","okai","lot","myth","ned","kelli","conjur","lot","good","docum","fact","still","leav","space","artist","creativ","produc","good","histor","dramaticis","mean","thi","robin","hood","stori","arthurian","legend","beowulf","someon","whose","life","shroud","mist","mani","mani","centuri","past","ani","recreat","life","time","guesswork","onli","coupl","lifetim","ago","grandpar","alreadi","school","ag","ned","hang","br","br","silli","fancifulli","imagin","thi","movi","seriou","attempt","tell","kelli","stori","recent","read","peter","carei","excel","novel","true","histori","kelli","gang","eagerli","anticip","thi","similar","vein","fact","mick","jagger","much","derid","kelli","probabl","far","close","realiti","well","movi","overal","sai","whole","lot","itbr","br","glad","onli","cost","two","buck","hire","dvd","give","onli","becaus","nice","shot","australian","bush","make","feel","gener"],"filtered2":["construct","kind","fantasi","man","snowi","river","meet","butch","cassidi","sundanc","kid","romant","touch","ned","joe","get","plai","awai","high","class","talent","bore","young","wife","wealthi","old","man","okai","lot","myth","ned","kelli","conjur","lot","good","docum","fact","still","leav","space","artist","creativ","produc","good","histor","dramaticis","mean","robin","hood","stori","arthurian","legend","beowulf","someon","whose","life","shroud","mist","mani","mani","centuri","past","ani","recreat","life","time","guesswork","onli","coupl","lifetim","ago","grandpar","alreadi","school","ag","ned","hang","silli","fancifulli","imagin","seriou","attempt","tell","kelli","stori","recent","read","peter","carei","excel","novel","true","histori","kelli","gang","eagerli","anticip","similar","vein","fact","mick","jagger","derid","kelli","probabl","far","close","realiti","well","overal","whole","lot","itbr","glad","onli","cost","two","buck","hire","dvd","give","onli","becaus","nice","shot","australian","bush","make","feel","gener"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,8,11,17,20,22,27,30,39,40,43,45,47,50,64,67,72,74,75,88,90,97,101,108,111,114,122,135,139,145,148,155,177,191,211,225,247,253,261,262,263,276,295,296,304,330,340,350,385,412,430,440,441,442,474,493,499,562,580,589,598,610,628,637,656,724,745,760,821,836,848,864,953,996,997,1014,1125,1163,1227,1377,1407,1627,1665,1753,1802,2041,2118,2146,2155,2270,2726,2865,2866,3136,3557,3614,3652,4122,4505,4750,4883,5818,6064,6437,7384,7918,8605],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,8,11,17,20,22,27,30,39,40,43,45,47,50,64,67,72,74,75,88,90,97,101,108,111,114,122,135,139,145,148,155,177,191,211,225,247,253,26

{"value":"Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. I wish it were \"so bad it's good,\" but it's not. It's just dull, lifeless, and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it.<br /><br />In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who as a true statement on vanity, cast himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother.<br /><br />The gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy, and can act. Although you can tell she's holding back.<br /><br />All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the supporting male, Mark. I've seen less wood in a rain forest, but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really that bad a director? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in the poo, it's how I felt after watching his movie.<br /><br />Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out, you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive

{"value":"This film was terrible. OK, my favourite film is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I was always bound to be a little biased. <br /><br />The plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin, but IS allergic to bees. WOW!) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which I'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make. (How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out \"Rowan!?\" at the slightest noise. The 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. For example, certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward/Cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.<br /><br />I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, I really can't be bothered to write any more about this film.

{"value":"With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Obviously, it is not. For one reason, many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set-ups (when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen!). For another, his concealing of one important information: the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film. That is, goitre, a sickness caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research (heck, if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre') he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people (still, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, talking about them as 'cretins', again and again, dramatizing the action, setting-up scenes to create the spectacle, all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all-mighty objectivity. Bunuel talks all the time in this film, not letting one word to the people he is filming. He talks FOR them and, even then, JUDGES them. This piece is flawed to it's roots, to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film.","finished_norm":["with","thi","film","bunuel","manipul","the","viewer","with","all","of","film","mai","while","state","clearli","in","the","film","that","hi","work","be","on","of","object","obvious","it","be","not","for","on","reason","mani","scene","shoot","by","pure","chanc","be","obviou","setup","when","that","poor","goat","accid","fall","off","the","cliff","you","can","actual","see","the","gun","smoke","on","the","right","of","the","screen","for","anoth","hi","conceal","of","on","import","inform","the","hurd","peopl","be","the","wai","thei","be","for","a","specif","reason","which","be","just","hint","at","in","the","film","that","be","goitr","a","sick","caus","by","lack","of","iodin","salt","thi","goitr","be","the","caus","of","their","cretin","and","have","bunuel","onli","take","the","time","to","make","hi","research","heck","if","he","check","cretin","in","a","medic","dictionari","he","have","have","find","goitr","he","mai","have","end","up","tell","the","truth","about","thi","peopl","still","doubtfulli","instead","with","hi","film","he","judg","them","constantli","talk","about","them","a","cretin","again","and","again","dramat","the","action","settingup","scene","to","creat","the","spectacl","all","of","thi","veri","unaccept","for","a","documentarist","which","claim","to","work","for","a","allmighti","object","bunuel","talk","all","the","time","in","thi","film","not","let","on","word","to","the","peopl","he","be","film","he","talk","for","them","and","even","then","judg","them","thi","piec","be","flaw","to","it","root","to","it","ideologi","and","it","a","real","shame","it","consid","a","great","film"],"filtered":["thi","film","bunuel","manipul","viewer","film","mai","state","clearli","film","hi","work","object","obvious","reason","mani","scene","shoot","pure","chanc","obviou","setup","poor","goat","accid","fall","cliff","actual","see","gun","smoke","right","screen","anoth","hi","conceal","import","inform","hurd","peopl","wai","thei","specif","reason","hint","film","goitr","sick","caus","lack","iodin","salt","thi","goitr","caus","cretin","bunuel","onli","take","time","make","hi","research","heck","check","cretin","medic","dictionari","find","goitr","mai","end","tell","truth","thi","peopl","still","doubtfulli","instead","hi","film","judg","constantli","talk","cretin","dramat","action","settingup","scene","creat","spectacl","thi","veri","unaccept","documentarist","claim","work","allmighti","object","bunuel","talk","time","thi","film","let","word","peopl","film","talk","even","judg","thi","piec","flaw","root","ideologi","real","shame","consid","great","film"],"filtered2":["bunuel","manipul","viewer","mai","state","clearli","work","object","obvious","reason","mani","scene","shoot","pure","chanc","obviou","setup","poor","goat","accid","fall","cliff","actual","see","gun","smoke","right","screen","anoth","conceal","import","inform","hurd","peopl","wai","specif","reason","hint","goitr","sick","caus","lack","iodin","salt","goitr","caus","cretin","bunuel","onli","take","time","make","research","heck","check","cretin","medic","dictionari","find","goitr","mai","end","tell","truth","peopl","still","doubtfulli","instead","judg","constantli","talk","cretin","dramat","action","settingup","scene","creat","spectacl","veri","unaccept","documentarist","claim","work","allmighti","object","bunuel","talk","time","let","word","peopl","talk","even","judg","piec","flaw","root","ideologi","real","shame","consid","great"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,8,11,15,19,23,24,31,33,38,46,48,50,51,52,64,73,80,90,95,117,121,124,129,146,152,169,183,186,192,218,258,279,317,341,362,383,452,486,494,498,501,505,574,600,726,751,756,758,778,923,1023,1043,1156,1179,1261,1303,1325,1363,1546,1562,1662,1797,1810,1985,2872,4441,4529,4933,5310,6664,7433,8150],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,8,11,15,19,23,24,31,33,38,46,48,50,51,52,64,73,80,90,95,117,121,124,129,146,152,169,183,186,192,218,258,279,317,341,362,383,452,486,494,498,501,505,574,600,726,751,756,758,778,923,1023,1043,1156,1179,1261,1303,1325,1363,1546,1562,1662,1797,1810,1985,2872,4441,4529,4933,5310,6664,7433,8150],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,4.094543182127343,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,3.311542587503466,3.3910232448024944,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,1.9951803900462557,2.0477128419653545,4.064665311355097,2.2797301185117202,2.2190595059394194,2.2323930368088845,2.4106958340079214,2.326138445979858,2.3131195476980753

{"value":"I don't know what some of you are smoking, but i suspect it's potent.<br /><br />To call Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness. The acting is hideous and i'm not picking on Madonna here, we all know she's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious. My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines. The editing is so sloppy, it beggars description. The photography and composition (which in this era, competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget) are astonishingly inept, even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking. These are BASIC elements of filmmaking, if you can't get them right, you should seek another line of work. It's as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White, except nowhere near as well made or interesting.<br /><br />The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring breathtaking visuals - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair. The sexual tension feels real and immediate...those of you who found Guy Ritchie's version deplorable, should see it, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema.<br /><br />Those of you who

{"value":"Actress Ruth Roman's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco jump-started this all-star Warner Bros. salute to patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny Air Force Corporal (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle). Seems the Corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane carrier crew, flying to and from Honolulu (you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of harm's way, but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies). Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant. Roman is also here, looking glamorous, while James Cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone. Jane Wyman sings, too, in a hospital bedside reprise following Doris Day's lead, causing one to wonder, \"Did they run out of sets?\" For undemanding viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. Still, the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render \"Starlift\" strictly a second-biller. *1/2 from

{"value":"Now I had the best intentions when watching this one. I like some of Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard otherwise from other people. But this was simply hopeless. <br /><br />In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Allow me to elaborate. <br /><br />Miss Knightley was overacting, and not in a good way. The people who did perform well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie. <br /><br />There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality, yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain tune was used around 4 times, which really started to bug after the second time. I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once. <br /><br />Also, the editing really went out on this one, as the cutting rate is rather high. Oh, and the repetitive echoing of some of Keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, and so on. <br /><br />Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and \"somewhat\" funny, and you don't care about everything I mentioned above, you might like it. <br /><br />(On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley

{"value":"That's what I found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film. First off, the computer effects are absolutely mind-blowing! Those computer wizs' really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, though...<br /><br />None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in the aforementioned, despicable 3rd act (I promise I won't give it away, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give the viewers more credit than that!!!<br /><br />Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man from 1933. There is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned once later on. If more attention had been paid it, Kevin bacon's mad scientist might have made a little more sense. <br /><br />The movie would actually be much more successful as a porno, since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner.

{"value":"This film is something like a sequel of \"White Zombie\", since it is made by the same man (Halperin) and features zombies. Halperin, the George A. Romero of his day, fails to deliver with this one, though.<br /><br />We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, and a search to destroy the source of his power so the zombies can be sent free. Also, a love interest for the evil man.<br /><br />Where this film really excels is in the imagery. The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we don't really get to see much of the zombies in action and the love story seems to play a much too large role for a horror film (though this has a valid plot reason later on).<br /><br />I would have loved to see some 1930s zombies attack helpless city folk, but this film just did not deliver. And no strong villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to do battle against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? A nice effect, but misleading as he is never in the film... why not recreate this with the new actor's eyes? Overall, a film that could be a great one with a little script re-working and could someday be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame). Heck, if they can fix up \"The Hills Have Eyes\" then this film has hope.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","someth","like","a","sequel","of","white","zombi","sinc","it","be","make","by","the","same","man","halperin","and","featur","zombi","halperin","the","georg","a","romero","of","hi","dai","fail","to","deliv","with","thi","on","thoughbr","br","we","have","a","man","who","can","control","the","mind","of","peopl","in","cambodia","and","a","search","to","destroi","the","sourc","of","hi","power","so","the","zombi","can","be","send","free","conjur","a","love","interest","for","the","evil","manbr","br","where","thi","film","realli","excel","be","in","the","imageri","the","cambodian","templ","and","dancer","be","veri","nice","and","the","zombi","look","veri","power","in","their","larg","number","unfortun","we","do","not","realli","get","to","see","much","of","the","zombi","in","action","and","the","love","stori","seem","to","plai","a","much","too","larg","role","for","a","horror","film","though","thi","have","a","valid","plot","reason","late","onbr","br","i","would","have","love","to","see","some","zombi","attack","helpless","citi","folk","but","thi","film","just","do","not","deliv","and","no","strong","villain","like","bela","lugosi","be","wait","to","do","battl","against","our","hero","and","the","us","of","lugosi","ey","a","nice","effect","but","mislead","a","he","be","never","in","the","film","why","not","recreat","thi","with","the","new","actor","ey","overal","a","film","that","can","be","a","great","on","with","a","littl","script","rework","and","can","somedai","be","a","power","remak","especi","if","thei","keep","it","in","the","same","postwar","time","frame","heck","if","thei","can","fix","up","the","hill","have","ey","then","thi","film","have","hope"],"filtered":["thi","film","someth","like","sequel","white","zombi","sinc","make","man","halperin","featur","zombi","halperin","georg","romero","hi","dai","fail","deliv","thi","thoughbr","br","man","control","mind","peopl","cambodia","search","destroi","sourc","hi","power","zombi","send","free","conjur","love","interest","evil","manbr","br","thi","film","realli","excel","imageri","cambodian","templ","dancer","veri","nice","zombi","look","veri","power","larg","number","unfortun","realli","get","see","much","zombi","action","love","stori","seem","plai","much","larg","role","horror","film","though","thi","valid","plot","reason","late","onbr","br","love","see","zombi","attack","helpless","citi","folk","thi","film","deliv","strong","villain","like","bela","lugosi","wait","battl","hero","us","lugosi","ey","nice","effect","mislead","never","film","recreat","thi","new","actor","ey","overal","film","great","littl","script","rework","somedai","power","remak","especi","thei","keep","postwar","time","frame","heck","thei","fix","hill","ey","thi","film","hope"],"filtered2":["someth","like","sequel","white","zombi","sinc","make","man","halperin","featur","zombi","halperin","georg","romero","dai","fail","deliv","thoughbr","man","control","mind","peopl","cambodia","search","destroi","sourc","power","zombi","send","free","conjur","love","interest","evil","manbr","realli","excel","imageri","cambodian","templ","dancer","veri","nice","zombi","look","veri","power","larg","number","unfortun","realli","get","see","zombi","action","love","stori","seem","plai","larg","role","horror","though","valid","plot","reason","late","onbr","love","see","zombi","attack","helpless","citi","folk","deliv","strong","villain","like","bela","lugosi","wait","battl","hero","us","lugosi","ey","nice","effect","mislead","never","recreat","new","actor","ey","overal","great","littl","script","rework","somedai","power","remak","especi","keep","postwar","time","frame","heck","fix","hill","ey","hope"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,8,13,14,15,16,17,23,32,35,39,40,41,42,45,51,53,54,56,60,77,83,86,87,95,106,128,129,132,134,150,162,181,215,227,238,262,267,268,281,305,321,331,359,365,375,387,412,483,495,517,520,564,580,595,631,680,686,721,738,786,824,1008,1018,1089,1384,1401,1546,1588,2063,2083,2167,2182,2446,2528,2578,2866,3396,3579,3870,4256,4261,4353,5084,5126,6499,8049,8365],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,8,13,14,15,16,17,23,32,35,39,40,41,42,45,51,53,54,56,60,77,83,86,87,95,106,128,129,132,134,150,162,181,215,227,238,262,267,268,281,305,321,331,359,365,375,387,412,483,495,517,520,564,580,595,631,680,686,721,738,786,824,1008,1018,1089,1384,1401,1546,1588,2063,2083,2167,2182,2446,2528,2578,2866,3396,3579,3870,4256,4261,4353,5084,5126,6499,8049,8365],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,2.26358831

{"value":"If you're watching this movie, you're either a Fred Olen Ray fan, you found it on the $4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought \"what do I have to lose?\", or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched.<br /><br />This movie is hysterically bad. It's got everything a terrible movie needs: a screenplay featuring jaw-dropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot, wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors that are not only wooden, but seems to border on befuddled, gratuitous nudity (not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for), and of course, a 5' monster played by what I assume is Fred Olen Ray's kid.<br /><br />Underneath it all, however, there is something resembling heart -- as if Mickey & Judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey! my dad can direct it! yeah!

{"value":"There has been a lot of love that has been put into Wes Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr Fox\", unfortunately all the love is for himself. Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with.<br /><br />The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. There wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog.<br /><br />The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents.

{"value":"I got a DVD of \"Bogeyman\" and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed that it was \"Boogeyman II\" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who \"assume\": it makes an \"ass-\" out of \"u-\" and \"me.\" I had read before viewing that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress Love. While watching \"Return of the Boogeyman,\" I decided to stick around through the original footage to see the notorious death-by-toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the film was over. Rip-off. I think that I thought this was BII because this has a similar title to one of BII's alternate titles. Oh well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /><br />Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie's mistakes. Many, many, mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli Whatever think he is? Does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms. There is nothing original holding Part III up. It is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic, who is giving us a gruelingly boring play-by-play as everything happens. That's the movie.

{"value":"I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith....or rather her silly, insipid role. The real problem and what's lacking in this latest version is a good script, music, and direction.<br /><br />I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn out and exceptionally boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book I felt a deep caring for Catherine Sloper and her life. The movie had just the opposite effect. I also disliked the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK.<br /><br />Watch it if you can't sleep, it's a definite snoozer. Don't watch it if you're depressed. You'll need Zoloft after this.<br /><br />Sure, \"The Heiress\" was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor who played her father was on the mark as the uncaring, cold father....still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The movie was not faithful to the book but neither is this one.<br /><br />This movie was a box office flop.

{"value":"For the initial 20 minutes or so (I was watching it on a PS2 so I've really no idea how long it took) Alienator sets up an interesting premise. I don't think I've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before. However, interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the 'alien' is a huge body-builder woman in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is patently ridiculous.<br /><br />Don't think I hold that against it. In the world of shlock-horror, patently ridiculous can often be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it. Alienator is funny as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. Actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness, potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set-pieces. By the time the movie's finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on it.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that the 'Alien' just kills people by vaporising them, as opposed to doing any 'slashing' as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot.

{"value":"Everyone in a while, Disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone. One that keeps you wondering until the very end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie is sure to turn into a ghost, and kill and rape your village. It's terrible. If you want a mindless, senseless, predictable \"action\" movie, go right ahead. I believe that young kids might enjoy this, as they like it when Good ALWAYS wins. But me, I like movies where it's a toss up who's going to win. This movie never lets the Bad Guys have the upper hand. By the end, when th heroes are left in an \"inescapeable\" pit, you just KNOW that they can get out. Everything works out perfect for Cage and his friends, he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. See this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to see good acting, or a good film. Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the kids would like it more. For instance, the scene where Cage is fleeing from armed gunmen, and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just ONE LITTLE POLE) This movie shows the decay of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull, unrealistic action, which this movie provides in

{"value":"A typical 70s Italian coming of age film, original and good music, but with some quirks, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and at times confused storyline (e.g. the role of the wolf-dog, and where does the boy come from?) with poor dialogue, nice ambiance.<br /><br />The reason it is still (relatively) well-known and sought after is probably the nude scenes (including typical 70s pseudo-coitus) involving an 11 and 13 year old girl with an older teenage boy (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it is interesting from a socio-political point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents was considered acceptable and normal in the whole of Europe (and US) 30 years ago, whereas now it is more than taboo.<br /><br />The story revolves round bullying of one girl (Laura) by the other two characters, and her discovery of sex, a quite accurate representation of an aspect teenage life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not evolve to the very end of the film and already appears very versed in the erotic arts - there is no \"coming of age\" for her: she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms, but ultimately is just used and ends the film crying like the little girl she really still is. The boy is an utterly despicable bully, while Laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim.","finished_norm":["a","typic","italian","come","of","ag","film","origin","and","good","music","but","with","some","quirk","interest","but","not","fantast","photographi","poor","and","at","time","confus","storylin","eg","the","role","of","the","wolfdog","and","where","doe","the","boi","come","from","with","poor","dialogu","nice","ambiancebr","br","the","reason","it","be","still","rel","wellknown","and","seek","after","be","probabl","the","nude","scene","includ","typic","pseudocoitu","involv","a","and","year","old","girl","with","a","old","teenag","boi","eva","ionesco","and","laura","wendel","it","be","interest","from","a","sociopolit","point","of","view","to","see","how","thi","represent","of","veri","young","adolesc","be","consid","accept","and","normal","in","the","whole","of","europ","and","u","year","ago","wherea","now","it","be","much","than","taboobr","br","the","stori","revolv","round","bulli","of","on","girl","laura","by","the","other","two","charact","and","her","discoveri","of","sex","a","quit","accur","represent","of","a","aspect","teenag","life","the","charact","of","eva","silvia","doe","not","evolv","to","the","veri","end","of","the","film","and","alreadi","appear","veri","vers","in","the","erot","art","there","be","no","come","of","ag","for","her","she","be","a","veri","vain","young","girl","who","be","alreadi","awar","of","her","sexual","charm","but","ultim","be","just","us","and","end","the","film","cry","like","the","littl","girl","she","realli","still","be","the","boi","be","a","utterli","despic","bulli","while","laura","come","across","a","a","veri","naiv","and","weak","victim"],"filtered":["typic","italian","come","ag","film","origin","good","music","quirk","interest","fantast","photographi","poor","time","confus","storylin","eg","role","wolfdog","doe","boi","come","poor","dialogu","nice","ambiancebr","br","reason","still","rel","wellknown","seek","probabl","nude","scene","includ","typic","pseudocoitu","involv","year","old","girl","old","teenag","boi","eva","ionesco","laura","wendel","interest","sociopolit","point","view","see","thi","represent","veri","young","adolesc","consid","accept","normal","whole","europ","u","year","ago","wherea","much","taboobr","br","stori","revolv","round","bulli","girl","laura","two","charact","discoveri","sex","quit","accur","represent","aspect","teenag","life","charact","eva","silvia","doe","evolv","veri","end","film","alreadi","appear","veri","vers","erot","art","come","ag","veri","vain","young","girl","alreadi","awar","sexual","charm","ultim","us","end","film","cry","like","littl","girl","realli","still","boi","utterli","despic","bulli","laura","come","across","veri","naiv","weak","victim"],"filtered2":["typic","italian","come","ag","origin","good","music","quirk","interest","fantast","photographi","poor","time","confus","storylin","eg","role","wolfdog","doe","boi","come","poor","dialogu","nice","ambiancebr","reason","still","rel","wellknown","seek","probabl","nude","scene","includ","typic","pseudocoitu","involv","year","old","girl","old","teenag","boi","eva","ionesco","laura","wendel","interest","sociopolit","point","view","see","represent","veri","young","adolesc","consid","accept","normal","whole","europ","u","year","ago","wherea","taboobr","stori","revolv","round","bulli","girl","laura","two","charact","discoveri","sex","quit","accur","represent","aspect","teenag","life","charact","eva","silvia","doe","evolv","veri","end","alreadi","appear","veri","vers","erot","art","come","ag","veri","vain","young","girl","alreadi","awar","sexual","charm","ultim","us","end","cry","like","littl","girl","realli","still","boi","utterli","despic","bulli","laura","come","across","veri","naiv","weak","victim"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,10,13,14,15,17,18,19,24,34,47,56,57,60,64,66,67,69,75,84,95,111,112,118,120,128,135,146,148,170,241,248,254,262,282,301,312,317,330,379,382,427,442,503,515,519,535,610,613,645,693,700,735,741,797,816,856,1030,1165,1238,1372,1392,1480,1500,1601,1625,1865,2016,2199,2244,2426,2427,2457,2936,2980,3263,3568,3807,3886,3887,4275,4343,6067,7638],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,10,13,14,15,17,18,19,24,34,47,56,57,60,64,66,67,69,75,84,95,111,112,118,120,128,135,146,148,170,241,248,254,262,282,301,312,317,330,379,382,427,442,503,515,519,535,610,613,645,693,700,735,741,797,816,856,1030,1165,1238,1372,1392,1480,1500,1601,1625,1865,2016,2199,2244,2426,2427,2457,2936,2980,3263,3568,3807,3886,3887,4275,4343,6067,7638],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081

{"value":"Cash (Now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland (after her protector has died from old age, said protector was played by Elias Koteas, an actual decent actor) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little to do. Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second one is just dull.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B-movie stuff and it is competently made, that's the only thing positive I can say about it.<br /><br />*1/2 out of
