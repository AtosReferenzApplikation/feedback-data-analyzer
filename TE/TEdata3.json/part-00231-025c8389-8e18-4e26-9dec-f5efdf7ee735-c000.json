{"value":"I don't know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the weirdest movies I've seen in a long time. It is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore & splatter. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite unsettling.<br /><br />The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for.<br /><br />If you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment, give it a try!<br /><br />My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)","finished_norm":["i","do","not","know","how","to","describ","thi","movi","it","definit","on","of","the","weird","movi","i","have","see","in","a","long","time","it","be","veri","unsettl","at","time","but","conjur","bore","in","other","place","the","scene","of","dental","tortur","be","veri","elabor","and","mai","attract","anyon","who","into","gore","splatter","i","find","myself","hold","my","tooth","dure","some","of","the","aforement","scene","the","clever","thing","about","the","movi","be","that","it","plai","with","our","fear","and","the","dentist","be","therefor","quit","unsettlingbr","br","the","humor","of","the","film","be","somehow","hide","and","mai","not","be","recogn","by","everyon","but","if","you","re","a","fan","of","weird","and","strang","entertain","and","tooth","get","drill","to","dust","thi","be","just","the","film","you","be","look","forbr","br","if","you","read","the","comment","and","feel","somehow","attract","by","thi","kind","of","entertain","give","it","a","trybr","br","my","rate","mayb","a","littl","too","weird","for","my","tast"],"filtered":["know","describ","thi","movi","definit","weird","movi","see","long","time","veri","unsettl","time","conjur","bore","place","scene","dental","tortur","veri","elabor","mai","attract","anyon","gore","splatter","find","hold","tooth","dure","aforement","scene","clever","thing","movi","plai","fear","dentist","therefor","quit","unsettlingbr","br","humor","film","somehow","hide","mai","recogn","everyon","re","fan","weird","strang","entertain","tooth","get","drill","dust","thi","film","look","forbr","br","read","comment","feel","somehow","attract","thi","kind","entertain","give","trybr","br","rate","mayb","littl","weird","tast"],"filtered2":["know","describ","definit","weird","see","long","time","veri","unsettl","time","conjur","bore","place","scene","dental","tortur","veri","elabor","mai","attract","anyon","gore","splatter","find","hold","tooth","dure","aforement","scene","clever","thing","plai","fear","dentist","therefor","quit","unsettlingbr","humor","somehow","hide","mai","recogn","everyon","re","fan","weird","strang","entertain","tooth","get","drill","dust","look","forbr","read","comment","feel","somehow","attract","kind","entertain","give","trybr","rate","mayb","littl","weird","tast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,14,15,16,19,26,29,30,38,39,40,43,46,68,99,108,120,122,140,145,158,163,164,195,202,239,246,280,358,369,392,414,417,549,625,648,668,707,802,812,872,955,1212,1229,1568,2368,2393,2538,2805,3641,4341,4362,5005],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,14,15,16,19,26,29,30,38,39,40,43,46,68,99,108,120,122,140,145,158,163,164,195,202,239,246,280,358,369,392,414,417,549,625,648,668,707,802,812,872,955,1212,1229,1568,2368,2393,2538,2805,3641,4341,4362,5005],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,2.62476135602347,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,3.311542587503466,2.0064197866819473,2.056430207256609,2.138507503627933,2.2044500422972613,2.2489347673732487,2.317169775997098,2.34599021453259,2.3106972614914807,2.4000574358028657,2.3930275298746078,5.02578483168376,2.597304642813496,2.6593400337329487,2.673149229007135,2.8028805344481915,3.2030824725120812,3.121829110937649,3.0670934723591254,3.1254654785810323,3.1932880749197934,6.894223829612251,10.85830016479649,7.221036049215089,3.5813614403160887,3.6375061693251913,3.8883864756110005,3.952924996748572,3.857614816944247,4.017463517886143,9.101523995008385,4.3095999406873045,4.597282013139085,5.064116067623542,5.290429193699031,5.170884043049248,5.408212229355414,6.032366538428407,5.967828017290836,5.999576715605417,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.861929464769162E-4,1.860279514939992E-4,1.860738832322552E-4,1.8603647642975686E-4,1.8605408257553718E-4,1.8602692579199601E-4,1.860847827485872E-4,1.859992480195119E-4,1.8602799080910502E-4,1.8622023057954302E-4,1.8769783390787698E-4,1.860282980792403E-4,1.862044786333068E-4,1.862238779274418E-4,1.8613928128212594E-4,1.8603720920051155E-4,1.8610121319542606E-4,1.861887930590495E-4,1.860468134994877E-4,1.860461332938786E-4,1.8621351007268007E-4,1.8606477321704614E-4,1.860650548099555E-4,1.8618425007623402E-4,1.8604688061125803E-4,1.8622610376242823E-4,1.8609343812280897E-4,1.860275345667599E-4,1.861118715010594E-4,1.861686755269842E-4,1.8606568589487268E-4,1.8616533862436817E-4,1.8625674115804855E-4,1.8642961629456624E-4,1.860931165481161E-4,1.8603709636599503E-4,1.8610417324549044E-4,1.860559901704266E-4,1.8599944653923108E-4,1.8604675588381714E-4,1.8623320652672113E-4,1.861310458

{"value":"I was VERY disappointed with this film. I expected more of a Thelma and Louise female-buddy crime movie. Instead, the women prison escapees in this flick, had no sense of loyalty to one another. They were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas, who beat each other up, double-crossed each other, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film.<br /><br />Instead of being shrewed thieves, who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money, the women escapees were too selfish and vicious, to trust each other for long. These women weren't liberated in a positive sense. They just ended up being a bunch of loose-cannons, incapable of respect for themselves, or each other.

{"value":"First off, let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie: \"This entire movie had to have been a dare. You know, like, 'DUDE, I BET YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER'\". With this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title. The effects are, of course, poor. The plot/dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made. The actors, I'm assuming, are supposed to be in college. Yet parts of it (especially at the beginning) make it seem like they're supposed to be in high or middle school. It makes no sense. The Scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable.

{"value":"I gave this movie a 2, and though I consider myself a science fiction fan, I found this movie very difficult to take seriously. It was on AMC one late night, and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more.<br /><br />The special effects are about average for the time period - not awful, but not great, either. Of course we know more about Mars now than we did back then, but we really can't hold that against this film. The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story.<br /><br />There were several parts of this movie that I wish would have been explored in a little more detail - the astronaut's injury/condition, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. Overall, the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits - complete with a cheesy ending.","finished_norm":["i","give","thi","movi","a","and","though","i","consid","myself","a","scienc","fiction","fan","i","find","thi","movi","veri","difficult","to","take","serious","it","be","on","amc","on","late","night","and","i","be","glad","i","see","it","for","free","thi","movi","be","probabl","good","for","a","few","laugh","but","not","much","morebr","br","the","special","effect","be","about","averag","for","the","time","period","not","aw","but","not","great","either","of","cours","we","know","much","about","mar","now","than","we","do","back","then","but","we","realli","ca","not","hold","that","against","thi","film","the","main","reason","i","do","not","like","thi","movi","be","becaus","of","the","storybr","br","there","be","sever","part","of","thi","movi","that","i","wish","would","have","be","explor","in","a","littl","much","detail","the","astronaut","injurycondit","the","citi","on","mar","the","creatur","in","the","lake","etc","overal","the","movi","be","much","like","a","lengthi","episod","of","the","version","of","the","outer","limit","complet","with","a","cheesi","end"],"filtered":["give","thi","movi","though","consid","scienc","fiction","fan","find","thi","movi","veri","difficult","take","serious","amc","late","night","glad","see","free","thi","movi","probabl","good","laugh","much","morebr","br","special","effect","averag","time","period","aw","great","either","cours","know","much","mar","back","realli","ca","hold","thi","film","main","reason","like","thi","movi","becaus","storybr","br","sever","part","thi","movi","wish","explor","littl","much","detail","astronaut","injurycondit","citi","mar","creatur","lake","etc","overal","movi","much","like","lengthi","episod","version","outer","limit","complet","cheesi","end"],"filtered2":["give","though","consid","scienc","fiction","fan","find","veri","difficult","take","serious","amc","late","night","glad","see","free","probabl","good","laugh","morebr","special","effect","averag","time","period","aw","great","either","cours","know","mar","back","realli","ca","hold","main","reason","like","becaus","storybr","sever","part","wish","explor","littl","detail","astronaut","injurycondit","citi","mar","creatur","lake","etc","overal","like","lengthi","version","outer","limit","complet","cheesi","end"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,13,14,15,22,24,26,30,31,38,51,61,63,81,86,95,103,106,133,138,140,148,150,179,199,203,207,210,220,316,317,371,399,412,414,429,543,595,643,686,740,743,761,803,910,916,1027,1227,1291,1438,1930,2405,2481,3402,3559,3937],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,13,14,15,22,24,26,30,31,38,51,61,63,81,86,95,103,106,133,138,140,148,150,179,199,203,207,210,220,316,317,371,399,412,414,429,543,595,643,686,740,743,761,803,910,916,1027,1227,1291,1438,1930,2405,2481,3402,3559,3937],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.519311641348122,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.949757232424728,2.031112399272319,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,2.332712011146513,2.507968722980095,2.558331832813986,2.569760528637609,2.5531798379045583,2.687151791517189,2.8336934208777267,2.878207028279898,2.8529247828056143,3.0466846007279185,3.129115117668582,3.107414446935464,3.1254654785810323,3.2872346624216657,3.477726550625732,3.6284289511740746,3.5813614403160887,3.6016814428070463,3.7165362186843414,3.7568101178222815,3.9405024767500145,3.7636829971100436,4.096025840389245,4.100845126825194,4.072271754381138,4.246178114249808,4.449957298382227,4.828393734102471,4.848596441419991,10.678438715736926,5.143104478942172,5.9370563586240825,5.672363804397,5.770002273960917]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079183E-4,1.9803239209117182E-4,1.9808128781854335E-4,1.9804146714364084E-4,1.980602094193923E-4,1.9803130020030468E-4,1.9809289068399734E-4,1.9800183637269832E-4,1.980324339432934E-4,1.9823707900490462E-4,1.998100325278664E-4,1.980327610416645E-4,1.9822031058076085E-4,1.9824096171727868E-4,1.9815090602457095E-4,1.980422472003164E-4,1.9811038139259514E-4,1.982036128116001E-4,1.9805247126764247E-4,1.980517471681574E-4,1.982299248216787E-4,1.9807158993126703E-4,1.9807188969545294E-4,1.9819877666871428E-4,1.9805254271015583E-4,1.9824333118607742E-4,1.9810210459216446E-4,1.9803194825949026E-4,1.981217274819503E-4,1.9818219708903867E-4,1.980725615044728E-4,1.981786448550764E-4,1.9827594562220604E-4,1.9845997644414836E-4,1.981017622661583E-4,1.98042127084554E-4,1.

{"value":"**Possible Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />Gerald Mohr, a busy B-movie actor during the Forties and Fifties, leads an expedition to Mars. Before we get to the Red Planet we're entertained by romantic patter between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist sporting a billy-goat beard. The Martian exteriors feature fake backdrops and tints ranging from red to pink-the \"Cinemagic\" process touted in the ads. Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, an oversized Venus Fly-Trap, and the unforgettable rat/bat/spider. The whole bizarre adventure is recalled by survivor Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE ANGRY RED PLANET reportedly has quite a cult following, and it probably picked up most of its adherents during the psychedelic

{"value":"There is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film. There's not one scary, funny, or even interesting scene in this film. It advertises itself as a horror, then goes on to call itself a comedy. It doesn't even ATTEMPT humor. Neither does it attempt to be scary.<br /><br />In order to not be bored by this film, you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. If you like this movie even a LITTLE BIT than you have no standard for what you watch at all. I'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this. Its not funny, scary, shocking, or intriguing. So was it supposed to be a drama?

{"value":"The deceptive cover, title and very small hidden print of Power of Prayer tricked me into renting this movie.<br /><br />It started out really well and pulled me in. I REALLY liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4's of it, the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense. My first thought was, \"This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story.\" I ended up re-watching parts of the movie, thinking I had missed something.<br /><br />By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the movie, it was all BORING, ANNOYING, RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG that made no sense, said nothing, and was annoying to listen to; I turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the

Slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period...and i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head....and then you don't even get to see what Jigsaw even does with his so called \"new jigsaw puzzle\"....Unless you have nothing better to do...Id watch paint dry before Id recommend this God-forsaken movie to anyone else...oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window..that was funny as hell and probably the only

{"value":"Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake-looking than they were.<br /><br />The plot had no sense whatsoever. I mean, first they're on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they're on a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. It sounds stupid even when you think about it.<br /><br />The only reason for which I gave this a 3, is because it's still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (haven't watched the second yet). Just, don't rent it.

{"value":"I just couldn't stop laughing!! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But, never mind that, it is very entertaining! In this film, you don't need to pay attention to anything! The acting is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, my I could see the stick that holds T-Rex head for a moment.) The raptors are the same from the Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but... in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten. Action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually I talk about fast editing, they edited it so fast, so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! to late, they are rubber!

{"value":"This film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure It had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN(2002) i guess no one had the guts to do something like that<br /><br />The film as the title suggests is based on the Kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring<br /><br />Even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes, wonder which soldier does that?<br /><br />Direction by JP Dutta pales front of BORDER Music is okay<br /><br />Amongst the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part and also it's his first film with kareena, Abhishek is likable Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna does his

{"value":"Unfortunately, the realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes. Where's Blade when you need him? While as dismal as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as nightmarish as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies. While the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe Jeffery Dalmers hearts race a little faster, it wasn't nearly as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it about as interesting as late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you might be able to endure this, otherwise, for no one.

{"value":"As far as the movie goes, it's an OK science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched...<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the \"team\" behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch...<br /><br />I gave this a 3*** because of the backstabbing of the original. This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommendable for fans of the

{"value":"This documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation. There is no denying the grinding poverty in India and desperation of even their wealthier clients. However, as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably. Although Indian clients mention having seen \"aleopathic\" doctors, those doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value-- \"the doctor said there was no cure,\" \"the doctor said it was cancer\" etc. Well, \"no cure\" doesn't mean \"no treatment,\" and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have? The film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in America. There it is reduced, apparently, to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered Wall Street job can make your stomach

{"value":"I don't know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. This could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of timidity, even cowardice, that hung over each scene. Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world? If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old.

{"value":"Don't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re: Death On The Nile. Everyone has done this one! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. The sets were terrific and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. I hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! I honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. Somehow I don't think so. I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way.

{"value":"Anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film. This film is NOT under-rated...it is a bad movie. <br /><br />There should be no comparisons between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny. Class Reunion is neither of those things. The sad thing is it had such potential (good cast, good story lines) but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing. The stoner guys, the vampire, the blind girl...NOT FUNNY. The only funny character were Delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil).<br /><br />National Lampoon has made some really good films (Animal House, Vacation) but this isn't one of them.

{"value":"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway.

{"value":"This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches. The daughter who secretly drops out of college, an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with fairly demeaning work), the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance, the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs, etc. There is nothing really wrong with any of these, i.e. they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in

{"value":"This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad. And indeed, we couldn't take most of it. There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). CRIPES. I've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. I last saw the film a couple months ago, but I can't stop laughing as I type. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is absolute genius.

{"value":"Am I wrong,or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? I have to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst films I have ever seen.....bad acting,bad editing etc....the only \"exploitation \" aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap. It is nothing more than a light-weight porn flick...no real gore, no scary images, just a cheaply done bit of garbage. If anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors,some slimy gore and a decent storyline...get Baby Blood...also done on a cheap budget but well made...and an actual story too!I Spit was a waste of money but I'll keep it just for a laugh....it is pathetic!

{"value":"I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded. Unfortunately it really isn't a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts, but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard. The actors put in a good effort, but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as Band of Brothers, not as action packed as...well, anything. I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much, nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions.

{"value":"Thank G_d it bombed, or we might get treated to such delights as \"Skate Fu\" where we can see the likes of Brian Boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but I digress. One thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little T & A from Ms. Agbayani. It's not like the world would have seen anything new (at least that part of the world who saw her Playboy spread.) I truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents' much better, although Aubrey Hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer. One explanation for Kurt Thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury, possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts. It's a good thing the IOC wasn't as diligent on 'doping' as they are now, or Kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals.

{"value":"When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to believe it would be as heart-warming as some of the first Lassie films were. Not.<br /><br />The story was abysmal, the songs by the Sherman brothers were way below their usual level, the characters were uninspired and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had both seen much better days.<br /><br />Then too, I was interested in seeing what ALICE FAYE's contribution would be like, since she'd been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so fetching in her earlier roles at Fox. Alice too, was letdown by the foolish script and the unflattering photography. Another disappointment.<br /><br />Nothing original here, nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy--and clearly, no magic present for anyone.

{"value":"Don't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re: Death On The Nile. Everyone has done this one! We know who dies. We know why they die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb. The sets were terrific and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how 'awful' he looked. I hope he doesn't look that way in 'real' life! I honestly can't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same. Somehow I don't think so. I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way.

{"value":"I don't want to go too far into detail, because I can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film, but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie. The animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not work after being translated. It was a total chore to watch this movie, and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I wasn't expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel, but I was expecting something entertaining, and it simply didn't achieve this.

{"value":"Jack Black is an annoying character.This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds.Do I have to write eight more lines?Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at,as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black.This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film.I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture.This movie explores Mexican culture-deeply. I just choke on its cultural rudeness:Jack Black is just so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary into Mexican culture, as it were.Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy, such as myself could seek.I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here.<br /><br />I think IMDb changed my review.Has anyone else had his review changed as well?Just a

{"value":"I won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but couldn't hold up the rest. I felt like I was stoned for the first time again, having semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents.<br /><br />What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights. I'd rather watch Jesus is een Palestijn, without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves.<br /><br />Gert de

{"value":"Wow, this was a very bad movie... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result.<br /><br />The editing of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening.<br /><br />All in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this.<br /><br />Unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find, do not watch this.

Kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on. Then he gets run over (\"Crushed\", one of the meaning of the title) by a truck. And dies.<br /><br />\"And then he gets run over by a truck.\" Can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element? Up to then, its a comedy that intends to be frothy, but lacks any real fizz. Everybody but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive.

{"value":"Some people don't like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done. There are lots of older cartoons that I just love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was constructed. The characters are all just... well, goofy. And for this movie, they shouldn't be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (for starters.) Just the way they acted in general annoyed me. My two sisters and I were laughing through most of this movie. I think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have gone. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it. There are few movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, although it ranks up there.

{"value":"What a joke. I am watching it on Channel 1 and I think watching paint dry is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that got him roped into this nightmare. Terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It so terrible, it's funny. It's suppose to be full of suspense, but it more a comedy. If you want to see terrible acting, ridiculous script writing and sub-par plot, check this movie out. If I was Van Dien, I would not only ask for my 10% from my agent, but fire the bastard in the process. What a turkey. It's not even fit to be on MST 3K!! It would be a good movie to cure you insomnia. I especially love the part where Van Dien is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes! I can only image that this was written by non-union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike.
