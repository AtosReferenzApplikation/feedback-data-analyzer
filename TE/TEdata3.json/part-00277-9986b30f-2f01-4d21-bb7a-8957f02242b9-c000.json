{"value":"\"Semana Santa\" or \"Angel Of Death\" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people. Mira has an Italian accent which falters from time to time. Couldn't she just speak English? All the other characters have a forced Mexican\\English accent which is distracting. The dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden. The cinematography looks nice, but that's not enough to save this tripe. THIS NEXT PART OF THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!! <br /><br />During the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away, but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing. That just shows this script has no originality whatsoever.

{"value":"This film is another example of the curse of east Asian cinema: two or more separate stories rolled into one film. Other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the \"first part\" and \"second part\". How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? I was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didn't \"end\", it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!)

{"value":"These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that it's only a few more minutes, and I lasted to the very end which I'm kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for human's patience and crap tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if you're strong willed enough, you may even last to the end... The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all. All happenings in the movie, you can be sure you saw somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel.","finished_norm":["thi","be","over","minut","of","semi","unexpect","boredom","i","be","wonder","how","it","be","possibl","to","produc","someth","like","that","then","reach","th","minut","i","be","convinc","myself","that","it","onli","a","few","much","minut","and","i","last","to","the","veri","end","which","i","be","kinda","proud","of","a","i","consid","watch","thi","movi","a","a","great","test","for","human","patienc","and","crap","toler","be","it","worth","watch","at","all","good","a","i","write","abov","if","you","want","to","test","yourself","give","it","a","try","and","if","you","re","strong","will","enough","you","mai","even","last","to","the","end","the","movi","lack","coher","and","charact","seem","to","have","no","common","sens","at","all","all","happen","in","the","movi","you","can","be","sure","you","see","somewher","befor","and","thei","seem","to","be","put","in","thi","movi","just","to","fill","the","film","reel"],"filtered":["thi","minut","semi","unexpect","boredom","wonder","possibl","produc","someth","like","reach","th","minut","convinc","onli","much","minut","last","veri","end","kinda","proud","consid","watch","thi","movi","great","test","human","patienc","crap","toler","worth","watch","good","write","abov","want","test","give","try","re","strong","enough","mai","even","last","end","movi","lack","coher","charact","seem","common","sens","happen","movi","sure","see","somewher","befor","thei","seem","put","thi","movi","fill","film","reel"],"filtered2":["minut","semi","unexpect","boredom","wonder","possibl","produc","someth","like","reach","th","minut","convinc","onli","minut","last","veri","end","kinda","proud","consid","watch","great","test","human","patienc","crap","toler","worth","watch","good","write","abov","want","test","give","try","re","strong","enough","mai","even","last","end","lack","coher","charact","seem","common","sens","happen","sure","see","somewher","befor","seem","put","fill","reel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,10,11,15,24,30,35,36,37,46,51,53,59,65,68,79,93,94,119,144,159,173,175,183,219,261,292,313,317,402,478,553,631,704,804,853,934,939,1306,1397,1673,1766,1850,2649,2681,2815,3427,4567],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,10,11,15,24,30,35,36,37,46,51,53,59,65,68,79,93,94,119,144,159,173,175,183,219,261,292,313,317,402,478,553,631,704,804,853,934,939,1306,1397,1673,1766,1850,2649,2681,2815,3427,4567],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.6420723132238515,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,5.607976334760217,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.035389827120098,2.08112281984698,2.1653408989309972,4.586221753978809,2.300267965194495,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.4885128563647294,2.5792094178355414,2.7085302779237206,2.9752256367457734,2.907069060519773,2.8529247828056143,3.084424928710765,3.3243163373261977,3.454678155189441,3.607563812710113,3.5900195030592035,3.7740817043309423,3.8962296530720266,3.9405024767500145,3.969732115064953,8.998179973919743,4.422928625994308,4.654440426979034,4.715065048795469,4.789173020949191,5.339219357868463,5.243909178064138,5.339219357868463,5.583416318380505,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.832911047380383E-5,7.78009189700278E-5,7.840574692801997E-5,7.795271768698549E-5,7.795399485449982E-5,7.784503074787796E-5,7.807655277642033E-5,7.781212179399306E-5,7.79870718096687E-5,8.652239902631718E-5,0.9938009763868357,7.768651587373967E-5,7.913649616800711E-5,8.026539567498313E-5,7.774316407069687E-5,7.752831550822237E-5,7.946216235860958E-5,7.808386796006893E-5,7.78416130639028E-5,7.790612992112964E-5,7.865991742098046E-5,7.816122931428861E-5,7.825022773142384E-5,7.833453357532826E-5,7.893571087639547E-5,7.85228993306152E-5,8.182385284689089E-5,7.77096113626041E-5,7.771169027669443E-5,7.790857240454961E-5,7.956450087241411E-5,7.807934366669933E-5,8.381156119062826E-5,7.829896933853118E-5,7.779419477987929E-5,7.815326627124963E-5,7.771624305264714E-5,7.776216763434296E-5,7.752792599969683E-5,7.754804032051414E-5,7.772259153462944E-5,7.854240018590436E-5,7.814329324455867E-5,7.78343365071699E-5,7.878010531001802E-5,7.78642097508451E-5,8.045125078228402E-5,7.926819168933616E-5,7.756731524792577E-5,7.773874375819058E-5,7.77117810330348E-5,7.989888267316867E-5,7.773990036249537E-5,7.754115582659145E-5,7.839228098173158E-5,7.775992409711106E-5,8.362225232973414E-5,7.769583981572753E-5,7.756641822642389E-5,7.793677510771175E-5,7.870984241562744E-5,7.793161914672666E-5,7.755206826564263E-5,7.77326363789332E-5,7.

{"value":"A difficult film to categorize. I was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared I couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the American FBI characters & what their roles were. Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows, not acted out.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show, with a largely insignificant sub plot going on, which just seemed to get in the way. However as any Irwin show is always worth a watch, this film is well worth a look too, but not on Christmas Day. Talking of which, I've better things to do too than be on here.<br /><br />A high

{"value":"Having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'Husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. I won't say the new footage was grade A material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what \"could have been\" a good all-original film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of one day shooting schedules. After the new footage, Jules White decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'Brideless Groom' into this short, making for a not-so-smooth story transition, which Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.<br /><br

{"value":"Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing \"Apocalypse Now\" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /><br />You have to wonder what the director of \"The Godfather\" and \"The Conversation\" was thinking when he made this flabby film. It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle, playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her, and Turner, the trooper that she is, does what she can with it, but this movie couldn't be saved by anyone.<br /><br />It doesn't even have any style to it, and, given its director, one would expect that even if it had nothing else, it would have that.<br /><br />Grade:

{"value":"I'm not a huge Freddy Krueger fan,but that doesn't mean that I don't like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies.I think that Robert is a very good actor.Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does.But,no offense Robert, this movie sucked.The acting is terrible,the plot is really weak,and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth watching.Sometimes sequels can be better than the first,such as the Friday the 13th franchise(I thought the remake was the best in the series.)But this isn't one of those movies.The original was good,the 2nd in my opinion was better,the 3rd was okay but I haven,t seen the others.Whatever you do,don,t make the same mistake I did by watching this piece of

{"value":"I suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it wasn't there. The pacing was practically backward, plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of dread, or tension, or ANYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's not scary. It doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Terrible film.","finished_norm":["i","suppos","if","you","like","endless","dialogu","that","doe","not","forward","the","stori","and","flashi","camera","effect","like","the","scene","transit","in","the","televis","show","angel","you","will","enjoi","the","film","me","all","i","want","be","a","nice","tight","littl","stori","and","it","be","not","there","the","pace","be","practic","backward","plot","point","be","buri","under","a","sea","of","unneed","dialogu","and","there","be","absolut","no","sens","of","dread","or","tension","or","anythingbr","br","be","it","the","redneck","be","it","the","wendigo","no","it","a","cameraman","on","spe","that","not","scari","it","doe","not","gener","a","singl","note","of","tension","or","atmospher","unless","you","re","scare","by","mtv","like","that","review","befor","me","i","too","notic","that","by","the","end","the","movi","invok","deris","laughter","from","the","audiencebr","br","terribl","film"],"filtered":["suppos","like","endless","dialogu","doe","forward","stori","flashi","camera","effect","like","scene","transit","televis","show","angel","enjoi","film","want","nice","tight","littl","stori","pace","practic","backward","plot","point","buri","sea","unneed","dialogu","absolut","sens","dread","tension","anythingbr","br","redneck","wendigo","cameraman","spe","scari","doe","gener","singl","note","tension","atmospher","unless","re","scare","mtv","like","review","befor","notic","end","movi","invok","deris","laughter","audiencebr","br","terribl","film"],"filtered2":["suppos","like","endless","dialogu","doe","forward","stori","flashi","camera","effect","like","scene","transit","televis","show","angel","enjoi","want","nice","tight","littl","stori","pace","practic","backward","plot","point","buri","sea","unneed","dialogu","absolut","sens","dread","tension","anythingbr","redneck","wendigo","cameraman","spe","scari","doe","gener","singl","note","tension","atmospher","unless","re","scare","mtv","like","review","befor","notic","end","invok","deris","laughter","audiencebr","terribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,14,17,18,19,24,28,32,37,66,68,79,106,149,166,173,176,200,222,225,231,248,262,396,443,460,546,560,623,663,688,699,835,886,917,995,1036,1321,1433,1597,1732,1767,2593,2995,3188,3486,3504,3688,3814,4503,5281,5296,8489],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,14,17,18,19,24,28,32,37,66,68,79,106,149,166,173,176,200,222,225,231,248,262,396,443,460,546,560,623,663,688,699,835,886,917,995,1036,1321,1433,1597,1732,1767,2593,2995,3188,3486,3504,3688,3814,4503,5281,5296,8489],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.159084361316692,2.3253197803590226,2.4423870329693536,2.4368824319140248,2.5040471493269134,2.5308211829319704,2.5771019354959765,2.641219492619754,2.7049353070058615,5.379009467558432,2.726701583487816,3.291526514503207,3.239158528985891,3.216957819005698,3.4572130107926293,3.4623020803001006,3.607563812710113,3.7297814454343623,3.6016814428070463,3.5813614403160887,3.8614098879127985,7.889252387867754,3.9363956947973615,4.030886538218284,4.327618446189983,4.370968887063596,4.535724120139652,4.751432692966343,4.760735085628657,4.77960356993304,5.214056214914456,5.444579873526289,5.5623629091826725,5.695894301807195,5.604922523601468,5.7446844659766265,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.214688095222362,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.301789607564376E-5,6.259295167002425E-5,6.307955218380313E-5,6.271507785927614E-5,6.271610537521757E-5,6.262844079297558E-5,6.281470655095052E-5,6.260196464607014E-5,6.274271668371734E-5,6.960961917063188E-5,0.38929626607467827,6.250091127292275E-5,6.366745978781283E-5,6.457569009172074E-5,6.254648628541972E-5,6.237363478359465E-5,6.392946708025618E-5,6.282059181480904E-5,6.262569117342465E-5,6.267759673674914E-5,6.328403924632678E-5,6.288283112470287E-5,6.295443276766804E-5,6.302225910806182E-5,6.350592256922622E-5,6.317380447247462E-5,6.582951119990849E-5,6.25194922207756E-5,6.25211647636055E-5,6.267956178097592E-5,0.06183612385308089,6.281695189795494E-5,0.3379933469454976,6.299364671396043E-5,6.258754187648252E-5,6.287642464037488E-5,6.252482759547104E-5,6.256177516833532E-5,6.237332141341038E-5,6.238950393062817E-5,6.252993512159229E-5,6.318949344001893E-5,6.286840106962615E-5,6.261983698596855E-5,6.338073366625707E-5,6.264387082158828E-5,6.472521557166263E-5,0.05746800688441439,6.24050111330609E-5,6.254293002399331E-5,6.252123777954542E-5,6.428082043063299E-5,6.254386054355928E-5,6.238396516834774E-5,6.306871846440264E-5,6.255997018171839E-5,6.727637241187399E

{"value":"In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. It suggests that kids are brainless. It insults children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. It did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in your Sprite. It seems as if today's television producers are only interested in making money, rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money! Lately, my children are tuning in to the old shows (60's) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television to look to its past and recycle children's programing from days gone

{"value":"Lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires. As the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together.<br /><br />Great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film. Yes its a sexy vampire story. No it is not remotely interesting beyond the women. To be honest there is a reason that I've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great, but other than that...<br /><br />For those who want to see sexy vampires only.","finished_norm":["lesbian","vampir","film","about","a","coupl","on","holidai","who","be","stai","on","the","ground","of","what","thei","think","be","a","empti","manor","hous","but","be","realli","be","us","a","a","pair","of","lesbian","vampir","a","the","vampir","bring","in","the","occasion","victim","the","coupl","go","about","their","busi","until","the","two","group","come","crash","togetherbr","br","great","look","film","with","two","veri","sexi","woman","a","the","vampir","there","be","noth","beyond","the","ey","candi","that","thei","provid","to","recommend","thi","cult","film","ye","it","a","sexi","vampir","stori","no","it","be","not","remot","interest","beyond","the","woman","to","be","honest","there","be","a","reason","that","i","have","be","see","still","of","thi","film","in","horror","book","and","magazin","it","look","great","but","other","than","thatbr","br","for","that","who","want","to","see","sexi","vampir","onli"],"filtered":["lesbian","vampir","film","coupl","holidai","stai","ground","thei","think","empti","manor","hous","realli","us","pair","lesbian","vampir","vampir","bring","occasion","victim","coupl","go","busi","two","group","come","crash","togetherbr","br","great","look","film","two","veri","sexi","woman","vampir","noth","beyond","ey","candi","thei","provid","recommend","thi","cult","film","ye","sexi","vampir","stori","remot","interest","beyond","woman","honest","reason","see","still","thi","film","horror","book","magazin","look","great","thatbr","br","want","see","sexi","vampir","onli"],"filtered2":["lesbian","vampir","coupl","holidai","stai","ground","think","empti","manor","hous","realli","us","pair","lesbian","vampir","vampir","bring","occasion","victim","coupl","go","busi","two","group","come","crash","togetherbr","great","look","two","veri","sexi","woman","vampir","noth","beyond","ey","candi","provid","recommend","cult","ye","sexi","vampir","stori","remot","interest","beyond","woman","honest","reason","see","still","horror","book","magazin","look","great","thatbr","want","see","sexi","vampir","onli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,11,12,13,15,16,17,34,37,47,49,51,56,60,64,70,83,95,151,209,213,250,253,281,298,365,410,485,502,535,694,790,883,933,1087,1099,1103,1144,1183,1239,1442,1589,1788,2031,2367,3615,4774,5641],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,11,12,13,15,16,17,34,37,47,49,51,56,60,64,70,83,95,151,209,213,250,253,281,298,365,410,485,502,535,694,790,883,933,1087,1099,1103,1144,1183,1239,1442,1589,1788,2031,2367,3615,4774,5641],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,3.412938870621443,1.6920303308087352,3.4279798616619646,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,4.189351572503368,2.292318797740072,2.0323326556775485,2.8002454868101863,2.6026896854443837,2.8432628718938773,2.6812935439488212,5.414661035463633,2.832333801361687,2.7819920465008363,3.008694896185175,3.2070272508030975,24.9633861691609,6.626533002279225,3.4986697244709752,3.6715125373103863,3.749984152751882,3.8614098879127985,4.091229668125752,12.528205644188345,4.135246553542527,4.160564361526816,4.229557233013768,4.315570107673808,9.147503031457783,4.477736862489302,4.558366596889411,4.828393734102471,5.156897801074508,5.185068678041204,5.695894301807195,6.0662680901040895,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.283612247433825E-5,6.241240381060754E-5,6.28976007369407E-5,6.253417772981208E-5,6.253520228190856E-5,6.244779056603967E-5,6.263351904492826E-5,6.242139078894141E-5,6.25617368307308E-5,6.940883190304424E-5,0.19594283611551278,6.232062890181155E-5,6.348381253564635E-5,6.438942307114819E-5,6.236607245428421E-5,6.219371953844715E-5,6.374506407437397E-5,6.263938733288515E-5,6.244504887770003E-5,6.2496804720679E-5,6.310149796146452E-5,6.270144711499072E-5,6.277284222474371E-5,6.284047292169454E-5,6.332274126727066E-5,6.29915811571588E-5,6.56396275625902E-5,6.233915625336848E-5,6.234082397178893E-5,6.249876409678312E-5,6.382716069654121E-5,6.26357579152834E-5,0.35217034753978554,6.281194305935383E-5,6.240700962148479E-5,6.269505911001225E-5,6.23444762383043E-5,6.238131723678579E-5,6.219340707217162E-5,6.22095429113088E-5,6.234956903188962E-5,6.300722487025462E-5,0.0451955064706483,6.243921157650644E-5,6.319791346867268E-5,6.246317608710699E-5,0.07447915956974606,6.35894595404125E-5,6.222500538359013E-5,6.23625264508081E-5,6.234089677711614E-5,6.40954039544859E-5,6.236345428631283E-5,6.220402012545458E-5,6.288679826714254E-5,6.237951745660921E-5,0.327500795267324,6.232810862878852E-5,6.222428578710022E-5,6.252138848890609E-5,6.314154811726475E-5,6.251725234343E-5,6.2212774155119

{"value":"OK. So it's a low-budget \"film\" (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The acting is universally horrid, the makeup is laughable (the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they used someone's borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors.<br /><br />I might be able to forgive these low-budget traits if there were some actual content, if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of video footage can boast of no plot, no real characters, and no momentum. It's a self-indulgent mess.<br /><br />And don't worry -- no spoilers here, 'cause there's absolutely nothing to

Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) job just so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides that he'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead. A documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with snide captions. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank appear dumb and pathetic, instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured.<br /><br />Essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is. It left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","enjoy","to","watch","frank","put","all","hi","dream","on","the","back","burner","and","get","a","normal","bore","job","just","so","hi","stepson","can","go","to","film","school","but","hi","stepson","decid","that","he","will","make","a","humili","documentari","about","the","man","instead","a","documentari","filmmak","should","point","the","camera","and","simpli","shoot","not","manipul","and","comment","with","snide","caption","the","bitter","and","resent","of","the","filmmak","toward","hi","stepfath","be","obviou","and","sad","the","goal","seem","to","be","to","make","frank","appear","dumb","and","pathet","instead","he","come","across","a","the","much","human","of","the","peopl","featuredbr","br","essenti","a","smear","campaign","all","dress","up","a","someth","much","smart","and","edgi","than","it","realli","be","it","leav","me","with","a","intens","dislik","for","the","filmmak"],"filtered":["thi","enjoy","watch","frank","put","hi","dream","back","burner","get","normal","bore","job","hi","stepson","go","film","school","hi","stepson","decid","make","humili","documentari","man","instead","documentari","filmmak","point","camera","simpli","shoot","manipul","comment","snide","caption","bitter","resent","filmmak","toward","hi","stepfath","obviou","sad","goal","seem","make","frank","appear","dumb","pathet","instead","come","across","much","human","peopl","featuredbr","br","essenti","smear","campaign","dress","someth","much","smart","edgi","realli","leav","intens","dislik","filmmak"],"filtered2":["enjoy","watch","frank","put","dream","back","burner","get","normal","bore","job","stepson","go","school","stepson","decid","make","humili","documentari","man","instead","documentari","filmmak","point","camera","simpli","shoot","manipul","comment","snide","caption","bitter","resent","filmmak","toward","stepfath","obviou","sad","goal","seem","make","frank","appear","dumb","pathet","instead","come","across","human","peopl","featuredbr","essenti","smear","campaign","dress","someth","smart","edgi","realli","leav","intens","dislik","filmmak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,13,23,34,35,45,53,63,66,74,108,117,152,159,169,201,231,249,280,289,292,296,323,383,420,455,503,563,601,607,624,700,736,873,1119,1197,1350,1435,1515,1799,2236,2850,2886,3231,4108,5623,6617,7380],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,13,23,34,35,45,53,63,66,74,108,117,152,159,169,201,231,249,280,289,292,296,323,383,420,455,503,563,601,607,624,700,736,873,1119,1197,1350,1435,1515,1799,2236,2850,2886,3231,4108,5623,6617,7380],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.364847727375781,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.8162961064622165,1.7003182735607676,1.8729627573220065,1.929723173391612,1.9486336368009016,2.138507503627933,2.2797301185117202,4.6262390953961505,2.300267965194495,2.4214486257841834,2.561435818751577,2.7049353070058615,2.6754694156628323,2.8028805344481915,2.8282659991423613,2.9752256367457734,2.9504565686333644,9.129969759075639,3.0433232530252132,3.3023374306074227,3.2787058260741455,3.3490645070153917,3.459754308221302,3.506637894120152,3.68099128126493,7.8483511669251715,3.616452760127359,3.68099128126493,3.892300374932137,4.235066888824737,4.240607069200353,4.470719289830655,9.394730943392135,4.605250182788262,4.8085911068062925,5.051537285416681,5.390512652256013,5.390512652256013,5.5623629091826725,5.822646007446338,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.743905437885374E-5,6.698429706921326E-5,6.750503610610717E-5,6.711499128833085E-5,6.711609089190007E-5,6.702227600919087E-5,6.722160964873212E-5,6.699394237030272E-5,0.05105490618077679,0.1990014885807209,0.4053492250273411,6.688579937678428E-5,6.813418965367976E-5,6.910613884062575E-5,6.693457180394388E-5,6.674959352702624E-5,6.84145786406674E-5,6.722790780614621E-5,6.701933348406763E-5,6.707488059569134E-5,6.772386940566308E-5,6.729451365092709E-5,6.737113866372895E-5,6.744372350935194E-5,6.796131943828262E-5,0.03969701433465506,0.061077829076565816,6.690568391166554E-5,6.690747379539509E-5,6.70769835018929E-5,6.850268908333384E-5,6.722401252296563E-5,0.23883421117502154,6.741310375017437E-5,6.697850773977576E-5,6.728765770568171E-5,6.691139360123983E-5,6.69509333118733E-5,6.674925817167143E-5,6.676657600877166E-5,6.691685945702497E-5,6.762269053156621E-5,6.727907122378162E-5,6.701306858328894E-5,6.782734763406955E-5,6.703878856520241E-5,6.926615460758694E-5,6.82475756141565E-5,6.678317115290134E-5,6.693076604522046E-5,6.690755193392795E-5,6.879058195365985E-5,6.69317618474214E-5,6.676064866251158E-5,6.749344232343157E-5,6.694900169247321E-5,7.199629343465095E-5,6.689

{"value":"This 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. But these two have other plans in mind, when they find out George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying up the George, killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening. Bizarre and disturbing movie, but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends.

{"value":"\"Problem Child\" is one of the goofiest movies ever made. It's not the worst (though some people will disagree with me on that), but it's not the best either. It's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who foolishly adopts him. This film is too silly and unbelievable because I don't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film. It's asinine and preposterous although I did laugh several times throughout (I really don't know why). But I can't recommend this film. I know I'm being too kind to it. If there is one positive thing about \"Problem Child\" is that it's better than the sequel which was just awful. <br /><br />** (out of

{"value":"Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />The Plot - Even for a Seagal film, the plot is just stupid. I mean its not just bad, its barely coherent.<br /><br />The Acting - Unbelievably wooden. Literally seen better acting in porno's. Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a 'lesbian love scene' which is utterly cringe-worthy.<br /><br />Special Effects - wouldn't look out of place in a 60's sword and sorcery flick.<br /><br />Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures, don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD, as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back.","finished_norm":["unless","you","be","mental","ill","or","the","much","die","hard","segal","fan","you","will","tire","of","thi","horrend","excus","for","a","film","in","under","minutesbr","br","the","plot","even","for","a","seagal","film","the","plot","be","just","stupid","i","mean","it","not","just","bad","it","bare","coherentbr","br","the","act","unbeliev","wooden","liter","see","well","act","in","porno","iron","thi","film","try","to","cash","in","on","thi","audienc","which","a","lesbian","love","scene","which","be","utterli","cringeworthybr","br","special","effect","would","not","look","out","of","place","in","a","sword","and","sorceri","flickbr","br","unless","you","suffer","from","insomnia","and","have","exhaust","all","other","cure","do","not","make","the","same","mistak","a","i","do","and","bui","thi","dvd","a","you","will","be","ask","for","that","hour","and","a","half","of","your","life","back"],"filtered":["unless","mental","ill","much","die","hard","segal","fan","tire","thi","horrend","excus","film","minutesbr","br","plot","even","seagal","film","plot","stupid","mean","bad","bare","coherentbr","br","act","unbeliev","wooden","liter","see","well","act","porno","iron","thi","film","try","cash","thi","audienc","lesbian","love","scene","utterli","cringeworthybr","br","special","effect","look","place","sword","sorceri","flickbr","br","unless","suffer","insomnia","exhaust","cure","make","mistak","bui","thi","dvd","ask","hour","half","life","back"],"filtered2":["unless","mental","ill","die","hard","segal","fan","tire","horrend","excus","minutesbr","plot","even","seagal","plot","stupid","mean","bad","bare","coherentbr","act","unbeliev","wooden","liter","see","well","act","porno","iron","try","cash","audienc","lesbian","love","scene","utterli","cringeworthybr","special","effect","look","place","sword","sorceri","flickbr","unless","suffer","insomnia","exhaust","cure","make","mistak","bui","dvd","ask","hour","half","life","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,9,16,19,20,21,32,36,54,63,75,88,106,136,140,164,168,171,174,203,206,247,293,306,347,460,571,589,593,617,633,816,890,897,900,911,1239,1246,1401,1453,1489,1686,1941,2315,2320,2810,3622,4048,4248,4474,7343],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,9,16,19,20,21,32,36,54,63,75,88,106,136,140,164,168,171,174,203,206,247,293,306,347,460,571,589,593,617,633,816,890,897,900,911,1239,1246,1401,1453,1489,1686,1941,2315,2320,2810,3622,4048,4248,4474,7343],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,1.8113893252729412,1.8729627573220065,1.9742250248702675,2.0317223413467334,2.159084361316692,2.346825985579986,2.317169775997098,2.3930275298746078,2.4894767118610357,2.373087554090762,2.456282578459816,2.569760528637609,2.597304642813496,2.7303758068497004,2.9012296278682137,2.8739486825973213,3.0151989841543516,6.433915638011396,3.467417180966871,3.496027715008137,3.5227672760500357,3.5119855004467477,3.550241531602284,3.7881170224473255,3.8767358583910254,3.8844878351953436,3.9201351739255808,3.969732115064953,4.573751515728891,4.315570107673808,5.583416318380505,4.506310234933358,4.5432147918688095,4.662879295624898,5.0768550934009715,5.214056214914456,5.116075806554253,5.3064295350454715,6.255510089742618,5.7959777603641776,5.907203395474402,5.999576715605417,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.922940831881439E-5,6.876257823400616E-5,6.929714171127786E-5,6.889674208822292E-5,6.889787088377296E-5,6.880156542870281E-5,6.90061909242792E-5,6.877247959596372E-5,6.892710520063776E-5,0.046951986919525054,0.509697630398391,6.866146565123892E-5,6.994299785859938E-5,7.094075009204888E-5,6.871153287572228E-5,6.852164384508875E-5,7.023083053726092E-5,6.901265628348823E-5,6.879854478621129E-5,6.885556654766608E-5,0.06905904733789725,6.908103036238398E-5,6.915968959548791E-5,6.923420140413758E-5,6.976553833105829E-5,6.940068420608901E-5,7.231815712819122E-5,6.868187807542254E-5,6.86837154765056E-5,6.885772528125784E-5,7.032128011234302E-5,6.900865758937382E-5,0.36903253646879797,6.920276875980039E-5,6.875663521100247E-5,6.907399240734183E-5,6.868773934430529E-5,6.872832874457884E-5,6.852129958680987E-5,6.853907717320774E-5,6.86933503061648E-5,6.941791959488906E-5,6.90651779738217E-5,6.87921135665259E-5,6.962800987929543E-5,6.881851635562548E-5,7.110501391470233E-5,7.005939395916403E-5,6.855611288077578E-5,6.870762608273633E-5,6.86837956894393E-5,7.061681588542651E-5,6.870864832122718E-5,6.853299246934786E-5,6.928524013996726E-5,6.872634584506464E-5,7.390763173558814E-5,6.866970640596106E-5,6.855532006865971E-5,6.88826516010015E-5,6.95659096131746

{"value":"I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case, it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like \"Dead Again\", I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though his best performance was not \"Tender Mercies\", but \"The Great Santini\". This movie was truly a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of

{"value":"This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.","finished_norm":["thi","film","have","a","lot","of","promis","and","the","plot","be","rel","interest","howev","the","actor","director","and","editor","serious","let","thi","film","downbr","br","i","feel","bad","for","the","writer","it","can","have","be","good","the","act","be","wooden","veri","few","of","the","charact","be","believablebr","br","who","ever","edit","thi","clearli","just","learn","some","new","edit","techniqu","and","want","to","splash","them","all","over","the","film","there","be","lot","of","quick","flashi","edit","in","almost","everi","scene","which","be","clearli","mean","to","be","symbol","but","just","end","up","a","annoyingbr","br","i","want","to","like","thi","film","and","expect","there","to","be","a","decent","resolut","to","the","breakdown","of","equilibrium","but","ala","no","it","leav","me","feel","like","i","have","wast","my","time","and","the","film","maker","have","wast","their","monei"],"filtered":["thi","film","lot","promis","plot","rel","interest","howev","actor","director","editor","serious","let","thi","film","downbr","br","feel","bad","writer","good","act","wooden","veri","charact","believablebr","br","ever","edit","thi","clearli","learn","new","edit","techniqu","want","splash","film","lot","quick","flashi","edit","almost","everi","scene","clearli","mean","symbol","end","annoyingbr","br","want","like","thi","film","expect","decent","resolut","breakdown","equilibrium","ala","leav","feel","like","wast","time","film","maker","wast","monei"],"filtered2":["lot","promis","plot","rel","interest","howev","actor","director","editor","serious","let","downbr","feel","bad","writer","good","act","wooden","veri","charact","believablebr","ever","edit","clearli","learn","new","edit","techniqu","want","splash","lot","quick","flashi","edit","almost","everi","scene","clearli","mean","symbol","end","annoyingbr","want","like","expect","decent","resolut","breakdown","equilibrium","ala","leav","feel","like","wast","time","maker","wast","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,9,10,15,19,21,24,32,37,41,43,44,58,60,72,74,85,87,88,89,113,124,126,130,131,287,309,348,371,430,494,683,762,890,1165,1173,1558,1736,1797,2373,2376,3814,3904,5013,5062,5800,7676],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,9,10,15,19,21,24,32,37,41,43,44,58,60,72,74,85,87,88,89,113,124,126,130,131,287,309,348,371,430,494,683,762,890,1165,1173,1558,1736,1797,2373,2376,3814,3904,5013,5062,5800,7676],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,2.975308642954861,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,3.841892750832105,1.9486336368009016,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,3.9880092219144876,2.1521782565202803,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.841890188081905,2.848772527704847,9.03095086967113,3.0466846007279185,3.2189558216683714,6.648632674652395,3.6105180246075443,3.749984152751882,3.8767358583910254,4.246178114249808,4.2574141875167335,4.573751515728891,4.9676558014359795,4.798834931860927,5.156897801074508,5.143104478942172,5.7959777603641776,5.770002273960917,6.255510089742618,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.627788066209922E-5,7.57635210804819E-5,7.635251021264189E-5,7.59113445952227E-5,7.591258831713726E-5,7.580647768890365E-5,7.603193677502092E-5,7.577443053246383E-5,7.594479907535699E-5,8.425660891087424E-5,0.56798432539119,7.565211389516785E-5,7.706412308535924E-5,7.816345973493624E-5,7.570727862742494E-5,7.54980563739138E-5,7.738126094984147E-5,7.603906039358362E-5,7.580314950492684E-5,7.586597683829594E-5,0.05636857472999577,7.611439586093837E-5,7.620106364766916E-5,7.628316174710578E-5,7.686859582327728E-5,7.646659470728741E-5,7.9681105083603E-5,7.56746045749774E-5,7.567662904787043E-5,7.586835535961069E-5,7.748091949180499E-5,7.603465457935135E-5,0.30128645501423,7.624852884250828E-5,7.575697297888092E-5,7.610664134868921E-5,7.568106259880317E-5,7.572578453858854E-5,7.54976770655743E-5,7.551726464615093E-5,7.568724483102951E-5,7.648558488735658E-5,7.609692948888165E-5,7.579606350174429E-5,7.671706515031672E-5,7.582515444510192E-5,7.834444779428464E-5,7.719236985337315E-5,7.553603481478916E-5,7.57029740710754E-5,7.567671742754509E-5,7.780654472793051E-5,7.570410038700828E-5,7.551056043870269E-5,7.633939690345483E-5,7.572359975359353E-5,8.143240929611511E-5,7.566119366806388E-5,7.553516128388017E-5,7.589581950944128E-5,0.0685588225201926,7.589079856927818E-5,7.552118711017441E-5,7.569702662773877E-5,7.549859022334272E-5,7.72454711158377E-5,7.6148975

{"value":"What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh!

{"value":"This relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver's license. It quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars.<br /><br />Such things as dune buggies, drag racing, custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed. It often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull, drawn out and even sexist at times. None of the people in the film are actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and voiceovers. Sorry, but I can't stand that.<br /><br />There is nothing educational or interesting about \"Dad, Can I Borrow The Car?\".

{"value":"Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself, and quit producing. There is no way you can watch this and enjoy. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature. I am so sorry I rented this movie. I will never watch anything with the name Spurlock on it. It is completely garbage. Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal. The film states that the American Consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products, making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy

{"value":"No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire,

{"value":"Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence. I wouldn't say blood-soaked; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after. There is always a producer's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition...Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shot away.

{"value":"This movie sucks ass. Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete trash. There's nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it. I regret it it's very boring. I would rate it zero but i can't. No body in their right mind should see this. i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did. How could they think up something this bad. Even Mystery men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. That movie wasn't worth being made. complete waste of time.

{"value":"I dunno what the hype around this is... This is really a bad movie...it did nothing to me, the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party, and a nice song is playing, uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move....that was the best part of the movie... Otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in There's no story, there's nothing to think about like some people say, there's no cohesion between the different stories...it was more of an attempt to re-do Anderson's 'Magnolia' which was brilliant, but it fails blatantly... Okay it's light and easy to watch, but that are movieclips too. Maybe first write a story before you make a movie... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've

{"value":"Badly made. Dreadful acting and an ending that the Director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival.<br /><br />Everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as I - what was the point of even making the film? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. I am astonished that this film has been given a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake. What a pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the film - now that could have been

{"value":"I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second time. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the \"single digit bracket\" kids and don't expect a lot from this film.<br /><br

{"value":"No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire,

{"value":"This movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure, and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it, and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Admittedly, the storyline was decent...but i found the acting terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, i thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight, without her, i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film. Every time i hear somebody say \"daarling\" i cringe! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said \"it\".

{"value":"This is an in-name-only sequel to \"A Christmas Story,\" originally entitled \"A Summer Story.\" Ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small hick-town in the middle of nowhere. Hilarity, unfortunately, does not ensue.<br /><br />The original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it. This one is simply stupid and not very funny at all. Charles Grodin's last movie - no wonder! It's one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Steenburgen is given little to do, everything's formulaic, and you have to wonder why they even bothered.<br /><br />And I mean, come on - a competition with spinning tops?!

{"value":"The only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining. I would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again. Even for a TV movie it is flat. The cast is boring. The screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century. There is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in slo-mo and cut short at the anticipated pay-off. If you are tempted to see this, pop it in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy. With any luck you'll doze off quickly, and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over. Namely, this

{"value":"This movie was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you still had to continue to watch. My boyfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Now don't get me wrong, the acting is good. Just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us. There wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario. After this movie, I had to go rent something else that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. Her character seems manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, though over played, she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in. More than once I found myself yelling at the TV telling her to fight back or to get violent.
