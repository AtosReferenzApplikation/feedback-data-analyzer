{"value":"I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup. The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in \"On Deadly Ground\" as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing. On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies. Beware and be safe avoid at all costs.","finished_norm":["i","have","some","time","to","kill","befor","watch","footbal","so","i","see","thi","movi","be","offer","on","the","scifi","channel","and","it","liter","after","watch","it","i","think","i","have","encount","my","version","of","mental","walk","the","bataan","death","march","a","my","consciou","be","beat","into","submiss","by","the","aw","movi","which","rip","off","the","mummi","seri","and","jurass","park","it","be","so","bad","that","i","think","the","open","credit","be","the","highlight","of","the","movi","and","then","it","go","into","such","a","abysm","descent","that","it","make","the","recent","drop","in","the","stock","market","seem","like","a","hiccup","the","act","be","so","bad","that","i","be","hope","that","on","and","all","would","be","buri","at","the","end","the","lead","by","casper","van","dien","make","me","long","for","the","high","calib","act","of","steven","seagal","in","on","deadli","grind","a","hi","line","read","be","so","wooden","that","woodi","woodpeck","be","think","of","make","a","cameo","to","sit","on","hi","shoulder","i","conjur","notic","that","hi","emot","rang","be","so","limit","that","i","be","under","the","impress","my","kitten","be","much","express","when","ask","for","popcorn","to","eat","the","direct","be","so","abysm","i","look","back","yearn","to","my","nephew","grade","plai","recit","which","have","much","pace","and","well","vision","and","the","fact","that","thi","movi","seem","to","be","have","splice","togeth","from","afterthought","of","the","aforement","movi","franchis","it","can","not","even","be","think","of","a","a","homag","the","fx","of","the","movi","be","so","bad","that","i","think","the","director","and","produc","be","enviorment","friendli","by","recycl","cheap","special","effect","from","grade","z","horror","flick","from","yesteryear","what","robert","wagner","tom","boslei","and","geoffrei","lewi","be","do","in","thi","movi","be","beyond","me","and","thei","should","look","at","litig","against","their","agent","for","misrepresent","for","get","them","involv","with","such","a","dreck","of","a","movi","my","warn","to","on","and","all","be","watch","thi","movi","at","your","peril","a","thi","movi","mai","caus","your","iq","to","diminish","with","prolong","view","on","a","side","note","i","notic","at","imdb","that","sometim","salari","for","movi","be","publish","i","be","wonder","if","their","be","a","wai","that","actor","that","should","give","the","salari","back","for","their","poor","perform","in","such","movi","bewar","and","be","safe","avoid","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["time","kill","befor","watch","footbal","see","thi","movi","offer","scifi","channel","liter","watch","think","encount","version","mental","walk","bataan","death","march","consciou","beat","submiss","aw","movi","rip","mummi","seri","jurass","park","bad","think","open","credit","highlight","movi","go","abysm","descent","make","recent","drop","stock","market","seem","like","hiccup","act","bad","hope","buri","end","lead","casper","van","dien","make","long","high","calib","act","steven","seagal","deadli","grind","hi","line","read","wooden","woodi","woodpeck","think","make","cameo","sit","hi","shoulder","conjur","notic","hi","emot","rang","limit","impress","kitten","much","express","ask","popcorn","eat","direct","abysm","look","back","yearn","nephew","grade","plai","recit","much","pace","well","vision","fact","thi","movi","seem","splice","togeth","afterthought","aforement","movi","franchis","even","think","homag","fx","movi","bad","think","director","produc","enviorment","friendli","recycl","cheap","special","effect","grade","z","horror","flick","yesteryear","robert","wagner","tom","boslei","geoffrei","lewi","thi","movi","beyond","thei","look","litig","agent","misrepresent","get","involv","dreck","movi","warn","watch","thi","movi","peril","thi","movi","mai","caus","iq","diminish","prolong","view","side","note","notic","imdb","sometim","salari","movi","publish","wonder","wai","actor","give","salari","back","poor","perform","movi","bewar","safe","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["time","kill","befor","watch","footbal","see","offer","scifi","channel","liter","watch","think","encount","version","mental","walk","bataan","death","march","consciou","beat","submiss","aw","rip","mummi","jurass","park","bad","think","open","credit","highlight","go","abysm","descent","make","recent","drop","stock","market","seem","like","hiccup","act","bad","hope","buri","end","lead","casper","van","dien","make","long","high","calib","act","steven","seagal","deadli","grind","line","read","wooden","woodi","woodpeck","think","make","cameo","sit","shoulder","conjur","notic","emot","rang","limit","impress","kitten","express","ask","popcorn","eat","direct","abysm","look","back","yearn","nephew","grade","plai","recit","pace","well","vision","fact","seem","splice","togeth","afterthought","aforement","franchis","even","think","homag","fx","bad","think","director","produc","enviorment","friendli","recycl","cheap

{"value":"Usually I love Lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased, I guess! <br /><br />But this one is just the pits. Yes, the scenery and the buildings are beautiful, and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high/stoned/passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy, and Ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie. At no time are we given any insight into why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn.<br /><br />If there had at least been some kind of closure in the (potentially romantic? we don't even know!) relationship between the two, there might have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella \"why do you love me?\" Ella doesn't even acknowledge this. It's never really clear whether this is anything more than an (ill-behaved) Lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman.<br /><br />Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey, which could have been lively and informative, are instead flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible.<br /><br />There is one good joke in the movie, although I'm sure it was unintentional. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a middling sized trunk. Yet when they set up camp, they have an enormous tent, cots, sleeping gear, and even a table, chair, and typewriter! On top of that, when they board a ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably theirs, presumably also carried in the little Ford's trunk! <br /><br />And through the entire film, we never see one gas station, or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel?<br /><br />There may not be too many Lesbian films out there, good or bad, but there are plenty that are better than this, and very few that are worse. Leave this one in the rack.","finished_norm":["usual","i","love","lesbian","movi","even","when","thei","be","not","veri","good","i","be","bia","i","guess","br","br","but","thi","on","be","just","the","pit","ye","the","sceneri","and","the","build","be","beauti","and","there","be","a","brief","but","beauti","erot","interlud","but","otherwis","thi","movi","be","just","a","complet","wast","of","time","annamari","altern","between","sulk","and","get","highstonedpass","out","on","whatev","drug","or","booz","be","handi","and","ella","inexplic","put","up","with","thi","abomin","behavior","through","the","entir","movi","at","no","time","be","we","give","ani","insight","into","why","thi","be","so","or","even","why","annamari","be","so","depress","and","withdrawnbr","br","if","there","have","at","littl","be","some","kind","of","closur","in","the","potenti","romant","we","do","not","even","know","relationship","between","the","two","there","mai","have","be","some","kind","of","satisfact","but","although","annamari","at","on","point","ask","ella","why","do","you","love","me","ella","doe","not","even","acknowledg","thi","it","never","realli","clear","whether","thi","be","anyth","much","than","a","illbehav","lesbian","on","a","bore","road","trip","with","a","straight","womanbr","br","even","the","interact","between","the","two","woman","and","the","local","peopl","thei","meet","on","the","journei","which","can","have","be","live","and","inform","be","instead","flat","tediou","and","mostli","incomprehensiblebr","br","there","be","on","good","joke","in","the","movi","although","i","be","sure","it","be","unintent","the","woman","travel","in","a","twoseat","ford","coup","with","a","middl","size","trunk","yet","when","thei","set","up","camp","thei","have","a","enorm","tent","cot","sleep","gear","and","even","a","tabl","chair","and","typewrit","on","top","of","that","when","thei","board","a","ferri","we","see","pile","of","luggag","presum","their","presum","conjur","carri","in","the","littl","ford","trunk","br","br","and","through","the","entir","film","we","never","see","on","ga","station","or","anywher","that","look","like","it","would","actual","have","ani","place","to","bui","gasolin","mostli","thei","travel","through","endless","mile","of","desol","desert","so","where","do","thei","get","fuelbr","br","there","mai","not","be","too","mani","lesbian","film","out","there","good","or","bad","but","there","be","plenti","that","be","well","than","thi","and","veri","few","that","be","wrong","leav","thi","on","in","the","rack"],"filtered":["usual","love","lesbian","movi","even","thei","veri","good","bia","guess","br","br","thi","pit","ye","sceneri","build","beauti","brief","beauti","erot","interlud","otherwis","thi","movi","complet","wast","time","annamari","altern","sulk","get","highstonedpass","whatev","drug","booz","handi","ella","inexplic","put","thi","abomin","behavior","entir","movi","time","give","ani","insight","thi","even","annamari","depress","withdrawnbr","br","littl","kind","closur","potenti","romant","even","know","relationship","two","mai","kind","satisfact","although","annamari","point","ask","ella","love","ella","doe","even","acknowledg","thi","never","realli","clear","whether","thi","anyth","much","illbehav","lesbian","bore","road","trip","straight","womanbr","br","even","interact","two","woman","local","peopl","thei","meet","journei","live","inform","instead","flat","tediou","mostli","incomprehensiblebr","br","good","joke","movi","although","sure","unintent","woman","travel","twoseat","ford","coup","middl","size","trunk","yet","thei","set","camp","thei","enorm","tent","cot","sleep","gear","even","tabl","chair","typewrit","top","thei","board","ferri","see","pile","luggag","presum","presum","conjur","carri","littl","ford","trunk","br","br","entir","film","never","see","ga","station","anywher","look","like","actual","ani","place","bui","gasolin","mostli","thei","travel","endless","mile","desol","desert","thei","get","fuelbr","br","mai","mani","lesbian","film","good","bad","plenti","well","thi","veri","wrong","leav","thi","rack"],"filtered2":["usual","love","lesbian","even","veri","good","bia","guess","pit","ye","sceneri","build","beauti","brief","beauti","erot","interlud","otherwis","complet","wast","time","annamari","altern","sulk","get","highstonedpass","whatev","drug","booz","handi","ella","inexplic","put","abomin","behavior","entir","time","give","ani","insight","even","annamari","depress","withdrawnbr","littl","kind","closur","potenti","romant","even","know","relationship","two","mai","kind","satisfact","although","annamari","point","ask","ella","love","ella","doe","even","acknowledg","never","realli","clear","whether","anyth","illbehav","lesbian","bore","road","trip","straight","womanbr","even","interact","two","woman","local","peopl","meet","journei","live","inform","instead","flat","tediou","mostli","incomprehensiblebr","good","joke","although","sure","unintent","woman","travel","twoseat","ford","coup","middl","size","trunk","yet",

{"value":"*Spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*<br /><br />When this show first started, I found it tolerable and fun. Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and his team shoved into the show.<br /><br />First off, toilet humor isn't all that funny. You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke. Next there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing. LOLOLOL!!! I just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this show wouldn't suck that bad if it weren't for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. But now... Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all... OVER-USED JOKES!!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame. I hated how they kept on mentioning \"Super Toilet\" (which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well) and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode? You know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would utter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? Yes, it may be first class humor to some people, but it is pure s*** to others.<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken, I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God! Everyone around my area says it's, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show ever. I just can't agree with it I think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday, only worse.","finished_norm":["spoiler","and","extrem","bash","lie","aheadbr","br","when","thi","show","start","i","find","it","toler","and","fun","fairli","oddpar","be","the","kind","of","cartoon","that","kid","and","adult","like","it","conjur","have","high","rate","along","with","spongebob","but","it","start","to","fall","becaus","of","the","follow","crap","that","butch","hartman","and","hi","team","shove","into","the","showbr","br","off","toilet","humor","be","not","all","that","funni","you","can","easili","pull","off","a","fast","laugh","from","a","littl","kiddi","with","a","burp","but","that","pretti","much","the","onli","audienc","that","would","laugh","at","such","a","cliché","joke","next","there","be","the","kiddi","joke","lol","we","can","see","peopl","in","their","underwear","and","we","can","see","peopl","crossdress","lololol","i","just","ca","not","stop","laugh","at","such","gai","bliss","somebodi","help","me","but","of","cours","thi","show","would","not","suck","that","bad","if","it","be","not","for","stereotyp","do","you","see","how","the","team","portrai","australian","thei","see","them","a","noth","but","kangaroolov","boomerangthrow","simpleton","who","live","in","a","hot","desert","but","now","be","the","coup","de","grace","of","why","thi","show","truli","suck","the","loud","of","them","all","overus","joke","the","show","constantli","pull","up","the","same","joke","the","major","of","them","be","unfunni","think","it","be","like","the","great","thing","ever","cosmo","be","mostli","the","on","to","blame","i","hate","how","thei","keep","on","mention","super","toilet","which","conjur","have","a","blend","of","kiddish","humor","in","it","just","a","good","and","cosmo","would","freak","out","and","who","can","forget","that","dumb","batteri","ram","joke","that","everi","goddamn","parent","in","dimmsdal","would","us","in","that","on","email","episod","you","know","the","on","in","which","everi","singl","parent","oblivi","to","other","parent","sai","it","would","utter","the","exact","same","sentenc","befor","break","into","their","kid","room","ye","it","mai","be","class","humor","to","some","peopl","but","it","be","pure","to","othersbr","br","if","i","be","not","mistak","i","do","believ","butch","hartman","sai","someth","about","end","the","show","thank","god","everyon","around","my","area","sai","it","like","the","funni","nickelodeon","show","ever","i","just","ca","not","agre","with","it","i","think","it","just","anoth","pile","of","hors","dung","that","we","get","on","our","cartoon","station","everydai","onli","wrong"],"filtered":["spoiler","extrem","bash","lie","aheadbr","br","thi","show","start","find","toler","fun","fairli","oddpar","kind","cartoon","kid","adult","like","conjur","high","rate","along","spongebob","start","fall","becaus","follow","crap","butch","hartman","hi","team","shove","showbr","br","toilet","humor","funni","easili","pull","fast","laugh","littl","kiddi","burp","pretti","much","onli","audienc","laugh","cliché","joke","next","kiddi","joke","lol","see","peopl","underwear","see","peopl","crossdress","lololol","ca","stop","laugh","gai","bliss","somebodi","help","cours","thi","show","suck","bad","stereotyp","see","team","portrai","australian","thei","see","noth","kangaroolov","boomerangthrow","simpleton","live","hot","desert","coup","de","grace","thi","show","truli","suck","loud","overus","joke","show","constantli","pull","joke","major","unfunni","think","like","great","thing","ever","cosmo","mostli","blame","hate","thei","keep","mention","super","toilet","conjur","blend","kiddish","humor","good","cosmo","freak","forget","dumb","batteri","ram","joke","everi","goddamn","parent","dimmsdal","us","email","episod","know","everi","singl","parent","oblivi","parent","sai","utter","exact","sentenc","befor","break","kid","room","ye","mai","class","humor","peopl","pure","othersbr","br","mistak","believ","butch","hartman","sai","someth","end","show","thank","god","everyon","around","area","sai","like","funni","nickelodeon","show","ever","ca","agre","think","anoth","pile","hors","dung","get","cartoon","station","everydai","onli","wrong"],"filtered2":["spoiler","extrem","bash","lie","aheadbr","show","start","find","toler","fun","fairli","oddpar","kind","cartoon","kid","adult","like","conjur","high","rate","along","spongebob","start","fall","becaus","follow","crap","butch","hartman","team","shove","showbr","toilet","humor","funni","easili","pull","fast","laugh","littl","kiddi","burp","pretti","onli","audienc","laugh","cliché","joke","next","kiddi","joke","lol","see","peopl","underwear","see","peopl","crossdress","lololol","ca","stop","laugh","gai","bliss","somebodi","help","cours","show","suck","bad","stereotyp","see","team","portrai","australian","see","noth","kangaroolov","boomerangthrow","simpleton","live","hot","desert","coup","de","grace","show","truli","suck","loud","overus","joke","show","constantli","pull","joke","major","unfunni","think","like","great","thing","ever","cosmo","mostli","blame"

{"value":"Sadly,this is not 'the best British gore film since hellraiser', though the DVD cover claims this, which is what tricked me into buying it. It is, however, an homage to many of the great horrors of old, films from most notably the Amicus stable.<br /><br />Cradle... is shot on mini dv, which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie, can be done so much better. Every scene, set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, rear setup), which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece. The gore content is, quite frankly, laughable. From the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart, through to tacky cheap prop hammers, the creature effects and the terrible cg, there was nothing in there that impressed me at all.<br /><br />The acting is abominable, from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf, via Dani Filth, the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have ever witnessed. Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs. Look out for the 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell I have seen.<br /><br />It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering (nay, running) away at any available opportunity. I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running.<br /><br />It does, however, mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I guess is one (um, two) things it has going for it. Once that's out of the way though, it is all downhill.<br /><br />I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I would love to believe them, but on this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead.<br /><br />Currently battling it out with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have ever

{"value":"This is one of the silliest movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it, after seeing the first two, but I keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of \"Maybe they did it right this time\". Nope - not even close.<br /><br />Where do I begin? How about with the special effects... To give you an idea of what passes for SFX in this movie, at one point a soldier is shooting at a \"Raptor\" as it runs down a hallway. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around. Bad bad bad bad.<br /><br />How about the acting? If that's what you can call it. There is one character who, I suppose, is supposed to be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years now, I have never heard this way of talking. Perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one.<br /><br />How about the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them down. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey? Oh well, at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them.<br /><br />Other things - Let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. Would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine? And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? How about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - Split up into groups of two. Didn't they ever watch any horror movies (Or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the dumber movies out there. Miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","silli","movi","i","have","ever","have","the","misfortun","to","watch","i","should","have","expect","it","after","see","the","two","but","i","keep","get","sucker","into","thi","typ","of","movi","with","the","idea","of","mayb","thei","do","it","right","thi","time","no","not","even","closebr","br","where","do","i","begin","how","about","with","the","special","effect","to","give","you","a","idea","of","what","pass","for","sfx","in","thi","movi","at","on","point","a","soldier","be","shoot","at","a","raptor","a","it","run","down","a","hallwai","even","with","littl","than","a","of","screen","time","the","viewer","can","easili","see","that","it","be","just","a","man","with","a","tail","appar","tape","to","him","run","around","bad","bad","bad","badbr","br","how","about","the","act","if","that","what","you","can","call","it","there","be","on","charact","who","i","suppos","be","suppos","to","be","from","the","south","howev","after","live","in","the","south","for","six","year","now","i","have","never","hear","thi","wai","of","talk","perhap","he","have","some","sort","of","weird","disabl","the","inabl","to","talk","normal","i","find","it","fascin","that","the","charact","doe","noth","that","requir","him","to","have","that","accent","therefor","there","be","no","reason","for","the","actor","to","try","to","do","onebr","br","how","about","the","plot","it","pretti","basic","raptor","escap","peopl","with","gun","must","hunt","them","down","i","be","start","to","wonder","why","the","dinosaur","in","thi","movi","alwai","seem","to","run","into","the","near","system","of","tunnel","would","not","thei","stai","outsid","to","hunt","prei","oh","good","at","littl","thei","have","the","good","sens","to","appear","veri","veri","littl","in","the","movi","which","supposedli","revolv","around","thembr","br","other","thing","let","sai","you","be","in","a","build","and","you","know","that","there","be","man","eat","raptor","run","around","in","it","would","you","decid","to","take","time","out","to","have","a","argum","about","who","be","well","armi","or","marin","and","then","decid","to","have","a","arm","wrestl","contest","to","settl","it","how","about","the","idiot","idea","that","thei","have","to","track","down","the","raptor","split","up","into","group","of","two","do","not","thei","ever","watch","ani","horror","movi","or","at","littl","a","episod","of","scoobi","doo","in","short","thi","be","on","of","the","dumb","movi","out","there","miss","it","unless","you","want","to","groan","your","wai","through","a","movi"],"filtered":["thi","silli","movi","ever","misfortun","watch","expect","see","two","keep","get","sucker","thi","typ","movi","idea","mayb","thei","right","thi","time","even","closebr","br","begin","special","effect","give","idea","pass","sfx","thi","movi","point","soldier","shoot","raptor","run","hallwai","even","littl","screen","time","viewer","easili","see","man","tail","appar","tape","run","around","bad","bad","bad","badbr","br","act","call","charact","suppos","suppos","south","howev","live","south","six","year","never","hear","thi","wai","talk","perhap","sort","weird","disabl","inabl","talk","normal","find","fascin","charact","doe","noth","requir","accent","therefor","reason","actor","try","onebr","br","plot","pretti","basic","raptor","escap","peopl","gun","must","hunt","start","wonder","dinosaur","thi","movi","alwai","seem","run","near","system","tunnel","thei","stai","outsid","hunt","prei","oh","good","littl","thei","good","sens","appear","veri","veri","littl","movi","supposedli","revolv","around","thembr","br","thing","let","sai","build","know","man","eat","raptor","run","around","decid","take","time","argum","well","armi","marin","decid","arm","wrestl","contest","settl","idiot","idea","thei","track","raptor","split","group","two","thei","ever","watch","ani","horror","movi","littl","episod","scoobi","doo","short","thi","dumb","movi","miss","unless","want","groan","wai","movi"],"filtered2":["silli","ever","misfortun","watch","expect","see","two","keep","get","sucker","typ","idea","mayb","right","time","even","closebr","begin","special","effect","give","idea","pass","sfx","point","soldier","shoot","raptor","run","hallwai","even","littl","screen","time","viewer","easili","see","man","tail","appar","tape","run","around","bad","bad","bad","badbr","act","call","charact","suppos","suppos","south","howev","live","south","six","year","never","hear","wai","talk","perhap","sort","weird","disabl","inabl","talk","normal","find","fascin","charact","doe","noth","requir","accent","therefor","reason","actor","try","onebr","plot","pretti","basic","raptor","escap","peopl","gun","must","hunt","start","wonder","dinosaur","alwai","seem","run","near","system","tunnel","stai","outsid","hunt","prei","oh","good","littl","good","sens","appear","veri","veri","littl","supposedli","revolv","around","thembr","thing","let","build","know","man","eat","raptor","run","around","decid","take","time","arg

{"value":"Now please don't start calling me names like, \"unpatriotic\" , \"weirdo\" and more .<br /><br />The very length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake . No editing at all - seems like J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much . Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and gave a message as well .<br /><br />It's based on true incidents and real people . Kudos to it , but were the repetitive war scenes really needed ? On top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all .<br /><br />Between the skirmishes , there were songs about loneliness , lovesickness and related stuff . There were chummy conversations . In the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk .<br /><br />Why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle , fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near? And when they were shot , it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place .<br /><br />Music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie . Better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie .<br /><br />Acting was the saving grace : From seasoned veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan , to relative newbies like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna , everyone acted like a pro . Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary .<br /><br />Dialogues ranged from brilliant (\"From Madhuri .. with Love!!\") to illogical / monotonous (\"Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain\") .

{"value":"What starts out as a gentle country yarn, inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as Edward Norton's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister, as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western.<br /><br />An amiable rancher (Norton) wanders into town and charms a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance, but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye.<br /><br />Edward Norton  a real chameleon actor (with changing facial hair to match) playing a country hick, accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent. He certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where Harlan is coming from, and what seemed like a good performance from Norton gradually becomes confused. Evan Rachel Wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at Norton.<br /><br />Down in the Valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace, and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain. Should we like this drifter or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear. This ambiguity is to the film's detriment, as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch-potch. Had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film, but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone. Completist fans of Norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the San Fernando valley), give this a

{"value":"No, I've never seen any of the \"Santa Slasher\" series, i.e. 'Silent Night, Deadly Night,' the original 'Black Christmas' or this one, 'Christmas Evil.' I've heard all about their reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I would rent this one as I've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment.<br /><br />Mothers should be against this, but not for the ooooohhhh \"killer\" Santa, but for the fact this movie was just plain crap. Boring, long  even at only 92 minutes, crap.<br /><br />Little boy sees Santa arrive down a chimney in 1947, deliver presents, eat some goodies and miraculously, float up the chimney. Boy goes to bed, but returns to living room to witness Mommy and Santa (sort of) getting it on. Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life, though the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphie's dad got the \"Leg Lamp\" in 'A Christmas Story.' He was sooo disturbed, he went to the attic and, well cut his own hand.<br /><br />Fast forward to the future! Now, it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory. We get a whiff of him being a little off-kilter, and he stalks both kids and parents alike. Who's naughty, who's nice, blah blah. It takes a good two-thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one. NO MOVIE should take that long.<br /><br />I will admit, this movie had its tension building, but only because I kept expecting him to do something, anything to anyone. When he finally does, well, punish \"who's naughty,\" it's as graphic as a \"Garbage Pail Kid\" card. And I haven't mentioned the WTF ending. I'm thinking it was a metaphor, but in reality, it's just as weird as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing, and his solution isuh, killing.) Don't open this mess, even on Christmas Eve, or Evil. Again, I didn't watch the other \"Santa-Slashers\" but this one sucked bad. It built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent

{"value":"I honestly have to say that I could not stop watching this movie from the second that it started. Simply for how bad it was!!! It's kinda like watching paint dry only a lot more confusing. I mean you sit there and just wait for something to happen, anything in fact, preferably something that makes the whole film make sense! At the end of the film I actually sat there wondering if there was any chance at all that I may have missed the first hour that explained everything or whether I may have inadvertently passed out during the film and missed the parts that glued the plot(if there was in fact one)together! The main thing that really confused me about this movie, is nearly at the end the main girl (if there was indeed a main girl) was in some sort of alternate reality, i mean what the hell was going on at this point?! all of a sudden she awoke and was in a mental institute, chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something, then quicker than it would have taken me to slit my wrists, it flipped back and she was getting eaten out by some random vampire!it made no sodding sense! I'm tempted to email the makers and demand my time back, i mean i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish!i am kinda interested to know if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about! just seemed someone had edited out all the bits that could have made it make sense though i think the film would have had to have been 4hrs long to make that happen! I side completely with the other person who wrote the other review, i was duped royally with this film by its title, and that alone. I'm just so sodding grateful i didn't actually buy the film, no matter how many times iv seen it in the local pound shop. You would have thought that would have given me a clue that the film was a complete pile of steaming movie rubbish but to be honest I think £1 was way too much money to spend on this film!!!! what a

{"value":"I'm kinda torn on DARK ANGEL. The film appears to be a \"loving\" tribute to the greatest pin-up to ever live - but there is so little actual \"content\" that the film itself is virtually pointless. I can't really see what the motivation or \"point\" of this film is - as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative - so those who don't know much about Bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching DARK ANGEL either...<br /><br />The film basically chronicles the last few years of Bettie's career in bondage modeling. Almost the entire film is comprised of \"re-enactments\" of some of Bettie's more \"famous\" photo-shoots and loops. These re-enactments take up literally 75% of the films run-time, and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person. The film touches briefly on her short-lived legitimate acting pursuits, and her subsequent decision to leave the \"business\" and become religious - but all of this is pretty much glossed-over in favor of showing long and drawn-out re-enactment scenes...<br /><br />DARK ANGEL isn't a horrible film - there's just no substance to it. The other problem is that the actress that plays Bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots - up-close it's a no-go. The other thing that irritated me, is that although Bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits. The film itself is obviously extremely low-budget, but does what it can set and costume-wise within it's limitations - so no gripes from me there. The acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved. In fact - the most memorable thing about the whole film for me, was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played Irving Klaw's real name is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the cast list. Can't say that I recommend this one too highly unless you are a true Bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her.

{"value":"This movie was a rather odd viewing experience. The movie is obviously based on a play. Now I'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch. The movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie. Instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play, with over-the-top characters and staged dialog. Because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.<br /><br />It takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching. At first you think its a drama you're watching, with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy, that leans really more toward the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre.<br /><br />The characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable. Sure, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough'.<br /><br />The story feels totally disorientated. Basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story even about? The movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. Like I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out.<br /><br />The editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences. <br /><br />More was to expect from director J. Lee Thompson, who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed, stage-play translated to screen, project.<br /><br />Really not worth your time.<br /><br

{"value":"Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little if anything from the original book. I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these.<br /><br />This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito's Way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role.<br /><br />What's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a ho-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though Eric Bana's performance was spot-on). Now we will never get to see Carlito's real initial rise and fall.<br /><br />The three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but he could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres).<br /><br />The fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.","finished_norm":["why","oh","why","do","peopl","take","good","materi","and","feel","the","ne","to","chang","it","some","how","have","read","the","book","on","which","thi","film","be","allegedli","base","a","coupl","of","year","ago","i","can","sai","that","there","be","littl","if","anyth","from","the","origin","book","i","go","into","thi","film","with","low","expect","i","know","it","would","have","a","crappi","telemovi","feel","to","it","but","it","even","fail","to","meet","thesebr","br","thi","be","not","a","prequel","the","onli","relationship","it","have","with","the","origin","be","the","name","thi","be","not","the","stori","of","carlito","brigant","it","be","the","stori","of","a","total","differ","charact","who","be","give","the","same","name","thei","have","just","total","spit","in","the","face","of","everi","carlito","wai","fan","out","there","add","insult","to","injuri","by","cast","lui","guzman","who","plai","a","crucial","charact","in","the","origin","movi","in","a","differ","rolebr","br","what","much","disappoint","be","that","now","that","thi","film","have","be","make","no","other","film","will","be","make","address","the","origin","untouch","materi","of","the","book","carlito","wai","someth","i","realli","would","have","like","to","have","see","i","feel","the","same","wai","about","chopper","thei","have","four","book","a","good","a","interview","worth","of","fantast","nonfict","materi","and","can","have","make","a","brilliant","biographi","of","australia","much","fear","underworld","figur","instead","thei","make","a","hohum","film","about","a","derang","but","strang","pathet","small","time","crook","though","eric","bana","perform","be","spoton","now","we","will","never","get","to","see","carlito","real","initi","rise","and","fallbr","br","the","three","star","be","becaus","look","at","it","pure","a","a","standalon","flick","it","be","not","so","appal","there","be","some","decent","perform","jai","hernandez","be","no","carlito","but","he","can","be","good","in","other","role","and","the","stori","be","not","too","bad","even","puffi","comb","suit","hi","role","but","thei","total","misunderstand","the","natur","of","the","underworld","at","that","time","i","be","a","bite","of","a","crimenonfict","buff","someth","which","the","origin","film","and","the","book","get","right","have","be","write","by","then","attornei","and","now","judg","edwin","torresbr","br","the","fact","be","though","it","not","a","stand","alon","it","perhap","the","much","disappoint","prequel","ever","film"],"filtered":["oh","peopl","take","good","materi","feel","ne","chang","read","book","thi","film","allegedli","base","coupl","year","ago","sai","littl","anyth","origin","book","go","thi","film","low","expect","know","crappi","telemovi","feel","even","fail","meet","thesebr","br","thi","prequel","onli","relationship","origin","name","thi","stori","carlito","brigant","stori","total","differ","charact","give","name","thei","total","spit","face","everi","carlito","wai","fan","add","insult","injuri","cast","lui","guzman","plai","crucial","charact","origin","movi","differ","rolebr","br","much","disappoint","thi","film","make","film","make","address","origin","untouch","materi","book","carlito","wai","someth","realli","like","see","feel","wai","chopper","thei","four","book","good","interview","worth","fantast","nonfict","materi","make","brilliant","biographi","australia","much","fear","underworld","figur","instead","thei","make","hohum","film","derang","strang","pathet","small","time","crook","though","eric","bana","perform","spoton","never","get","see","carlito","real","initi","rise","fallbr","br","three","star","becaus","look","pure","standalon","flick","appal","decent","perform","jai","hernandez","carlito","good","role","stori","bad","even","puffi","comb","suit","hi","role","thei","total","misunderstand","natur","underworld","time","bite","crimenonfict","buff","someth","origin","film","book","get","right","write","attornei","judg","edwin","torresbr","br","fact","though","stand","alon","perhap","much","disappoint","prequel","ever","film"],"filtered2":["oh","peopl","take","good","materi","feel","ne","chang","read","book","allegedli","base","coupl","year","ago","littl","anyth","origin","book","go","low","expect","know","crappi","telemovi","feel","even","fail","meet","thesebr","prequel","onli","relationship","origin","name","stori","carlito","brigant","stori","total","differ","charact","give","name","total","spit","face","everi","carlito","wai","fan","add","insult","injuri","cast","lui","guzman","plai","crucial","charact","origin","differ","rolebr","disappoint","make","make","address","origin","untouch","materi","book","carlito","wai","someth","realli","like","see","feel","wai","chopper","four","book","good","interview","worth","fantast","nonfict","materi","make","brilliant","biographi","australia","fear","underworld","figur","instead","make","hohum","derang","strang","pathet","small","time","crook","though","eric","bana","perfo

{"value":"Listening to the director's commentary confirmed what I had suspected whilst watching the film: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that \"I could write a book/screenplay/award winning sitcom\" phase. There's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there (probably because its a sequel to some-one else's movie), but it is totally buried under an underwritten, badly executed and laughably un-thought-out script.<br /><br />The lines are dire, and the performances are un-engaging, though again, I'm inclined to blame the director. He does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required, rather plonked the script in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these actors could have acquitted themselves better (say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man).<br /><br />As it stands, the cast have no chemistry whatsoever. A beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when, in order to infect Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his ailing co-hunter, he is given a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Mind you, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leads, is by the directors own admittance accidental. He had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition - so, I suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse. But not a lot.<br /><br />Frankly, as movies go, this is badly plotted, silly and forgettable. Even as trashy movies go it's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and bloody little romp, but the director has left with more of a comedy, for all the wrong reasons.","finished_norm":["listen","to","the","director","commentari","confirm","what","i","have","suspect","whilst","watch","the","film","thi","be","a","movi","make","by","a","gui","who","want","to","plai","at","make","a","movi","the","plot","be","the","kind","of","thing","that","delud","teenag","churn","out","when","thei","re","go","through","that","i","can","write","a","bookscreenplayaward","win","sitcom","phase","there","a","germ","of","a","interest","idea","buri","in","there","probabl","becaus","it","a","sequel","to","someon","els","movi","but","it","be","total","buri","under","a","underwrit","badli","execut","and","laughabl","unthoughtout","scriptbr","br","the","line","be","dire","and","the","perform","be","unengag","though","again","i","be","inclin","to","blame","the","director","he","doe","not","appear","to","have","consult","the","actor","at","all","about","what","be","requir","rather","plonk","the","script","in","their","hand","point","the","camera","at","them","and","tell","them","to","get","on","with","it","who","know","with","a","littl","coach","thi","actor","can","have","acquit","themselv","well","sai","what","you","like","about","musician","in","movi","jon","bon","jovi","be","excel","in","row","your","boat","and","much","than","accept","in","the","lead","manbr","br","a","it","stand","the","cast","have","no","chemistri","whatsoev","a","beauti","opportun","to","us","the","classic","sex","and","vampir","parallel","be","pass","up","when","in","order","to","infect","bon","jovi","charact","with","vampir","blood","from","hi","ail","cohunt","he","be","give","a","transfus","she","should","have","bite","him","mind","you","thei","should","have","look","vagu","interest","in","each","other","throughout","the","rest","of","the","film","too","the","onli","real","moment","of","sexual","tension","between","the","two","femal","lead","be","by","the","director","own","admitt","accident","he","have","origin","intend","to","us","thi","silent","sequenc","a","a","excus","for","much","pointless","plot","exposit","so","i","suppos","the","finish","product","can","have","conceiv","be","wrong","but","not","a","lotbr","br","frankli","a","movi","go","thi","be","badli","plot","silli","and","forgett","even","a","trashi","movi","go","it","not","sexi","enough","or","gori","enough","to","be","entertain","it","can","have","be","a","fun","and","bloodi","littl","romp","but","the","director","have","leav","with","much","of","a","comedi","for","all","the","wrong","reason"],"filtered":["listen","director","commentari","confirm","suspect","whilst","watch","film","thi","movi","make","gui","want","plai","make","movi","plot","kind","thing","delud","teenag","churn","thei","re","go","write","bookscreenplayaward","win","sitcom","phase","germ","interest","idea","buri","probabl","becaus","sequel","someon","els","movi","total","buri","underwrit","badli","execut","laughabl","unthoughtout","scriptbr","br","line","dire","perform","unengag","though","inclin","blame","director","doe","appear","consult","actor","requir","rather","plonk","script","hand","point","camera","tell","get","know","littl","coach","thi","actor","acquit","themselv","well","sai","like","musician","movi","jon","bon","jovi","excel","row","boat","much","accept","lead","manbr","br","stand","cast","chemistri","whatsoev","beauti","opportun","us","classic","sex","vampir","parallel","pass","order","infect","bon","jovi","charact","vampir","blood","hi","ail","cohunt","give","transfus","bite","mind","thei","look","vagu","interest","throughout","rest","film","onli","real","moment","sexual","tension","two","femal","lead","director","admitt","accident","origin","intend","us","thi","silent","sequenc","excus","much","pointless","plot","exposit","suppos","finish","product","conceiv","wrong","lotbr","br","frankli","movi","go","thi","badli","plot","silli","forgett","even","trashi","movi","go","sexi","enough","gori","enough","entertain","fun","bloodi","littl","romp","director","leav","much","comedi","wrong","reason"],"filtered2":["listen","director","commentari","confirm","suspect","whilst","watch","make","gui","want","plai","make","plot","kind","thing","delud","teenag","churn","re","go","write","bookscreenplayaward","win","sitcom","phase","germ","interest","idea","buri","probabl","becaus","sequel","someon","els","total","buri","underwrit","badli","execut","laughabl","unthoughtout","scriptbr","line","dire","perform","unengag","though","inclin","blame","director","doe","appear","consult","actor","requir","rather","plonk","script","hand","point","camera","tell","get","know","littl","coach","actor","acquit","themselv","well","like","musician","jon","bon","jovi","excel","row","boat","accept","lead","manbr","stand","cast","chemistri","whatsoev","beauti","opportun","us","classic","sex","vampir","parallel","pass","order","infect","bon","jovi","charact","vampir","blood","ail","cohunt","give","transfus","bite","mind","look","vagu","interest","throughout","rest","onli","real","moment","sexual","tension","t

{"value":"I happen to have bought one of those \"Legacy of Horror\" 50 movie pack collections and would you believe I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock's films (some aren't horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter.<br /><br />So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea. The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine (the one standing feature of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates. Carradine gives a good enough performance as always, but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre/terrible performances. The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes. Given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited. It's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes. Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and I'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who-done-it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film. You aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack \"Chilling\" containing films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horror's with Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead over it.

{"value":"The folks at Disney have a lot to explain. First and foremost, why anyone thought this lesser-sitcom material would ever make even a half-decent motion picture. In the kooky 60's teleplay, the unique idea of Martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated X-Files treatment. Quaint visions of little green men have long since been dispelled by the likes of E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3.<br /><br />Any charm the property had was mainly due to the endearing relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the unworldly visitor. The conceit that Martians have antenna seemed dopey back then. Now it seems positively idiotic. Yet, Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Martin sports the metallic appendages. In an early shot, the antenna on a sign for the TV station Tim works at is supposed to make us think \"martian\"! When's the last time you saw a TV with rabbit ears, eh?<br /><br />Disney doesn't trust quaint or relationships and crams this flick with youth-wooing special effects that include a talking space suit named Zoot! Yes, you read that correctly - Uncle Martin's silver space suit speaks. He is supposed to be a real hilarious cut-up! Figure again. I got stretch socks that are funnier than Zoot. Whenever the action lags (and it lags constantly), computer graphics are put into play to liven things up. Tim is here played by the amiable Jeff Daniels, who can't (or won't) do anything to save this floudering mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings some comic zeal to her neighbor lady role. Even Ray Walston himself is dragged painfully into the procedings - all to no avail. This alien visitor is dead on arrival.<br /><br />Constant talk of sitcoms turning to screen makes me only hope that the I DREAM OF JEANNIE movie won't feature a talking harem outfit. I pray that Samantha's cat in the movie BEWITCHED doesn't have lines. I live in fear that I LOVE LUCY - THE MOVIE will proudly feature a CG Conga Drum named Bongo.<br /><br />Paging Michael Eisner!

{"value":"The Good:<br /><br />Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top notch set production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Horrible mixture of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Flawed logic. A giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it, no one really even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out, nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate Jill?<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />Awful script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialog was almost laughable at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Dull characters. Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing to her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose, any goals (besides the obvious one of Horus), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There are no stakes - the key to screen writing. Horus will not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy. One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character, never brings one to fruition. They are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces. First time director pacing. Slow, slow, slow. I am still watching the movie as I write this. I cannot pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat.

{"value":"Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me. It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the (non)action - and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to Serbo-Croat indie and find them fascinating.<br /><br />The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over-orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue, apart from the set pieces where characters 'collide' in a very structured setting (to make this work, the film needed to feel more conceptual, which it didn't). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems two-dimensional.<br /><br />The worse for this is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic. At one point, I even stopped the film because I got so annoyed by the character's aggressive, violent and monotonal delivery, the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary \"on\" switch (which gets really predictable after a while) and I so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. However, one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film (supposedly 70s, it feels and looks more early noughties). If it had been more securely fixed in the 70s, his character might have seemed more understandable.<br /><br />The lighting of the film was also awkward. All the way through, the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty, jazz-infused atmosphere that just did not come off, largely because the set was too well-lit.<br /><br />The Tenants, to me, is an unbelievable film. It doesn't depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race, identity or the life of a writer, be they white or black.<br /><br />Strangely, I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his eerie, clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable.","finished_norm":["watch","the","tenant","have","be","a","interest","experi","for","me","it","be","the","film","i","have","ever","see","where","i","have","shuttl","at","spe","through","part","of","the","nonact","and","i","can","normal","watch","anyth","from","turgid","action","movi","to","serbocroat","indi","and","find","them","fascinatingbr","br","the","tenant","be","frustratingli","sluggish","and","overorchestr","on","of","the","main","problem","of","the","script","be","there","be","littl","realist","charact","dialogu","apart","from","the","set","piec","where","charact","collid","in","a","veri","structur","set","to","make","thi","work","the","film","ne","to","feel","much","conceptu","which","it","do","not","thi","lead","to","a","lack","of","realist","charact","develop","everyon","seem","twodimensionalbr","br","the","wrong","for","thi","be","the","charact","of","bill","spear","aka","snoop","dogg","i","find","hi","character","veri","uncomfort","and","veri","unsympathet","at","on","point","i","even","stop","the","film","becaus","i","get","so","annoi","by","the","charact","aggress","violent","and","monoton","deliveri","the","lack","of","ani","other","person","layer","apart","from","that","of","the","reactionari","on","switch","which","get","realli","predict","after","a","while","and","i","so","desper","want","him","to","have","some","redeem","qualiti","howev","on","reason","for","thi","jar","mai","be","the","nebul","time","scape","of","the","film","supposedli","it","feel","and","look","much","earli","noughti","if","it","have","be","much","secur","fix","in","the","hi","charact","mai","have","seem","much","understandablebr","br","the","light","of","the","film","be","conjur","awkward","all","the","wai","through","the","soundtrack","attempt","to","provid","a","certain","gritti","jazzinfus","atmospher","that","just","do","not","come","off","larg","becaus","the","set","be","too","welllitbr","br","the","tenant","to","me","be","a","unbeliev","film","it","doe","not","depict","real","peopl","or","propos","ani","interest","wai","of","think","about","race","ident","or","the","life","of","a","writer","be","thei","white","or","blackbr","br","strang","i","come","awai","with","the","feel","that","thi","project","ne","david","lynch","hi","eeri","clastrophob","and","obsess","look","and","feel","would","have","lift","both","the","actor","and","the","script","into","someth","quit","remark"],"filtered":["watch","tenant","interest","experi","film","ever","see","shuttl","spe","part","nonact","normal","watch","anyth","turgid","action","movi","serbocroat","indi","find","fascinatingbr","br","tenant","frustratingli","sluggish","overorchestr","main","problem","script","littl","realist","charact","dialogu","apart","set","piec","charact","collid","veri","structur","set","make","thi","work","film","ne","feel","much","conceptu","thi","lead","lack","realist","charact","develop","everyon","seem","twodimensionalbr","br","wrong","thi","charact","bill","spear","aka","snoop","dogg","find","hi","character","veri","uncomfort","veri","unsympathet","point","even","stop","film","becaus","get","annoi","charact","aggress","violent","monoton","deliveri","lack","ani","person","layer","apart","reactionari","switch","get","realli","predict","desper","want","redeem","qualiti","howev","reason","thi","jar","mai","nebul","time","scape","film","supposedli","feel","look","much","earli","noughti","much","secur","fix","hi","charact","mai","seem","much","understandablebr","br","light","film","conjur","awkward","wai","soundtrack","attempt","provid","certain","gritti","jazzinfus","atmospher","come","larg","becaus","set","welllitbr","br","tenant","unbeliev","film","doe","depict","real","peopl","propos","ani","interest","wai","think","race","ident","life","writer","thei","white","blackbr","br","strang","come","awai","feel","thi","project","ne","david","lynch","hi","eeri","clastrophob","obsess","look","feel","lift","actor","script","someth","quit","remark"],"filtered2":["watch","tenant","interest","experi","ever","see","shuttl","spe","part","nonact","normal","watch","anyth","turgid","action","serbocroat","indi","find","fascinatingbr","tenant","frustratingli","sluggish","overorchestr","main","problem","script","littl","realist","charact","dialogu","apart","set","piec","charact","collid","veri","structur","set","make","work","ne","feel","conceptu","lead","lack","realist","charact","develop","everyon","seem","twodimensionalbr","wrong","charact","bill","spear","aka","snoop","dogg","find","character","veri","uncomfort","veri","unsympathet","point","even","stop","becaus","get","annoi","charact","aggress","violent","monoton","deliveri","lack","ani","person","layer","apart","reactionari","switch","get","realli","predict","desper","want","redeem","qualiti","howev","reason","jar","mai","nebul","time","scape","supposedli","feel","look","earli","noughti","secur","fix","charact","mai","seem","understandablebr","light","conjur","awkward","wai","soundtrack","attempt","provi

{"value":"In contrast to my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something redeeming in any film I see.Yes, the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal, the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping.Something must be lost in the translation of the word \"Bloodsucker\" from the Italian in the title; almost as if the producers were originally going to film a Gothic Vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence, so tacked it onto the film anyway.<br /><br />This film made in 1975 has recently been issued on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film!Now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect - Italian softporn from the mid 1970s.I bought it because I am attracted to Christa Nelli (credited most often as \"Krista Nell\").The absence of a cast of characters I find most frustrating in a lot of these Eurosleaze films from the 60s & 70s.I had hoped Imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list, it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned.I think Krista Nell played \"Cora\" but underneath that massive hair style, costume and make-up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure.<br /><br />There is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out.Maybe something is lost in the dubbing process.What were the positive points?Well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there.The external locations used were good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island.It purports to be set in \"Ireland\" (North or the Republic?)in 1902, so everyone sports period piece costumes.Some of the scenes I found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes!!Anyway an enjoyable romp.I rated it

{"value":"It occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films. I'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging, controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your sanity. If they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be \"Stroker Ace\". This film is awful with a capital 'A'. It is the worst film Burt Reynolds ever starred in.... quite a feat for for a man with \"Cannonball Run II\", \"Cop And A Half\" and \"Rent-A-Cop\" on his CV!<br /><br />The wafer-thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing up as a giant chicken. Thrown into the mix are Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's dim-witted pal, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by Ace.<br /><br />Hal Needham, the director of this low-grade garbage, was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases/races. Some of these films were OK, like \"Hooper\" and \"Stunts Unlimited\", but with \"Stroker Ace\" he reaches a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them. Anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair. The humour is weak and infantile throughout, and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable. Even the out-takes during the closing credits (which can be found in all the Reynolds-Needham collaborations) are generally unfunny, which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't much fun to make. \"Stroker Ace\" is a stinker of considerable

{"value":"The film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are, and who the characters are. And that is the moment i started to dislike the movie. With all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand, i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything. I actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept.<br /><br />I hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are, which date we are at, and especially what the characters feel and think. I believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /><br />But after the bad influencing intro, a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time. The lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way. I think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations. For example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well. I think the director is a very good observer about real life.<br /><br />But that is it. After a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story-telling. I really felt like I'm having a big headache because of the non-stop talking characters. It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs. It is realistic really, but characters always asking \"really, is that so\" etc. to each other, or characters saying \"no\" or \"are you listening to me,\" ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache.<br /><br />I also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be. I understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot, but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.","finished_norm":["the","film","start","with","a","voic","over","tell","the","audienc","where","thei","be","and","who","the","charact","be","and","that","be","the","moment","i","start","to","dislik","the","movi","with","all","the","endless","possibl","ani","film","director","have","in","hand","i","realli","find","it","a","veri","easi","and","cheap","solut","to","express","the","situat","with","a","voic","over","tell","everyth","i","actual","believ","voic","over","be","betray","to","the","film","make","conceptbr","br","i","hate","to","hear","from","a","voic","over","sai","where","we","be","which","date","we","be","at","and","especi","what","the","charact","feel","and","think","i","believ","that","a","director","have","to","find","a","visual","wai","to","transmit","the","feel","and","the","thought","of","the","charact","to","the","audienc","br","br","but","after","the","bad","influenc","intro","a","veri","strike","movi","begin","and","keep","go","for","a","fairli","long","enough","time","the","live","of","a","middl","class","famili","and","all","the","member","individu","be","depict","in","a","perfect","realist","wai","i","think","the","director","have","a","talent","for","captur","real","life","situat","for","exampl","a","father","who","have","to","make","hi","privat","call","from","the","bathroom","mai","seem","abnorm","at","but","life","itself","lead","u","some","situat","which","mai","seem","abnorm","but","conjur","veri","normal","a","good","i","think","the","director","be","a","veri","good","observ","about","real","lifebr","br","but","that","be","it","after","a","while","the","realism","in","the","movi","begin","to","sacrific","the","storytel","i","realli","feel","like","i","be","have","a","big","headach","becaus","of","the","nonstop","talk","charact","it","be","a","if","the","actor","and","actress","be","give","the","subject","and","be","allow","to","improvis","the","dialog","it","be","realist","realli","but","charact","alwai","ask","realli","be","that","so","etc","to","each","other","or","charact","sai","no","or","be","you","listen","to","me","ten","time","when","sai","it","onli","onc","be","just","enough","caus","me","to","have","a","headachebr","br","i","conjur","think","the","plai","practic","and","book","read","scene","be","much","then","thei","should","be","i","understand","that","the","plai","and","the","book","in","the","movi","be","veri","much","relat","to","the","plot","but","i","think","the","director","have","miss","the","point","where","he","should","stop","show","thi","scene"],"filtered":["film","start","voic","tell","audienc","thei","charact","moment","start","dislik","movi","endless","possibl","ani","film","director","hand","realli","find","veri","easi","cheap","solut","express","situat","voic","tell","everyth","actual","believ","voic","betray","film","make","conceptbr","br","hate","hear","voic","sai","date","especi","charact","feel","think","believ","director","find","visual","wai","transmit","feel","thought","charact","audienc","br","br","bad","influenc","intro","veri","strike","movi","begin","keep","go","fairli","long","enough","time","live","middl","class","famili","member","individu","depict","perfect","realist","wai","think","director","talent","captur","real","life","situat","exampl","father","make","hi","privat","call","bathroom","mai","seem","abnorm","life","lead","u","situat","mai","seem","abnorm","conjur","veri","normal","good","think","director","veri","good","observ","real","lifebr","br","realism","movi","begin","sacrific","storytel","realli","feel","like","big","headach","becaus","nonstop","talk","charact","actor","actress","give","subject","allow","improvis","dialog","realist","realli","charact","alwai","ask","realli","etc","charact","sai","listen","ten","time","sai","onli","onc","enough","caus","headachebr","br","conjur","think","plai","practic","book","read","scene","much","thei","understand","plai","book","movi","veri","much","relat","plot","think","director","miss","point","stop","show","thi","scene"],"filtered2":["start","voic","tell","audienc","charact","moment","start","dislik","endless","possibl","ani","director","hand","realli","find","veri","easi","cheap","solut","express","situat","voic","tell","everyth","actual","believ","voic","betray","make","conceptbr","hate","hear","voic","date","especi","charact","feel","think","believ","director","find","visual","wai","transmit","feel","thought","charact","audienc","bad","influenc","intro","veri","strike","begin","keep","go","fairli","long","enough","time","live","middl","class","famili","member","individu","depict","perfect","realist","wai","think","director","talent","captur","real","life","situat","exampl","father","make","privat","call","bathroom","mai","seem","abnorm","life","lead","u","situat","mai","seem","abnorm","conjur","veri","normal","good","think","director","veri","good","observ","real","lifebr","realism","begin","sacrific","storytel","realli","feel","like","big","headach","becaus","nonstop","talk","

{"value":"This week, I just thought it would be fun to catch up with Corey Haim, with just having seen the two \"Lost Boys\" films last week and all. Not that I'm a fan-boy - not by far - but I did like those two Coreys in some films back in my early teen days.<br /><br />So, I prepared myself for three films starring him. Unfortunately, I picked \"Dream Machine\" as a first (never seen it before), and it was so godawfully horrible, I just decided to lock Corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first, before I pop in something else of his. But I managed to struggle my way through this film first. I had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986) but got caught up in its own delusions. Practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller. The only good thing about \"Dream Machine\" is the premise: A dead body in the trunk of a Porsche. All the rest fails so badly, it's embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. I can dig him being his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he comes with some form of directorial guidelines. This clearly wasn't the case in \"Dream Machine\". So, we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film. The perfect murder... almost? Some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film, trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the trunk, never really succeeds, and then at the end of the film thinks he's Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner mask) and mistakes Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't think they could have made this flick any lamer if they tried. A stupid, unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that doesn't know how to direct his cast. Great accomplishment!<br /><br />One last question for Mr. Haim: Who's idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie? Yours or the director's?

{"value":"Seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, I figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by Lungren, and all of the other thrown-in Oriental actors, and I found the movie so awful that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie EVER.<br /><br />Lungren beats out his previous efforts in \"The Punisher\" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's movies, Seagal's movies, and Stallone's non-Rocky movies, for this distinct honor. This movie has the absolute worst acting (check out Tia Carrere's face when she is in any scene with Dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment about little Dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (Dolph in full Japanese attire). Picture \"Tango and Cash\" with worse acting, meets \"Commando,\" meets \"Friday the 13th\" (because of the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very Jason Voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.<br /><br />The good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and Carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). Brandon Lee is just there being Lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.<br /><br />An awful, awful movie. Fear it and avoid it. If you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots.

{"value":"Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is an upper-class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting Kenneth. On the Christmas Eve, she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts, and she does not find any parking space available. When she sees an old car parked on two spots, she leaves a message to the owner calling him \"selfish jerk\". When the mall closes, Della's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  Chuckie (Lukas Haas), the Afro-American Huey (Jamie Starr), the Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and the Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the security guard of the mall protects her, he is shot on the head by Chuckie, Della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals. However she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang. She takes the toolbox and hides in the wood, fighting against the gang to survive.<br /><br />A couple of days ago, I saw the trailer of \"While She Was Out\" and I was anxious to watch the DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and I am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés. Della Myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family. She is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the Batman's utility belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that irritates. The gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of American movies, with an Afro-American, a Chinese-American and a Latin together with an American lord to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent acting, but their children are too young for a fifty-five year-old woman.

{"value":"The original is a relaxing watch, with some truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, while not the worst of the DTV sequels completely lacks the sparkle.<br /><br />The biggest letdown is a lack of a story. Like Belle's Magical World, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magical World, while marginally better, still manages to make a mess of the story. In between the vignettes, we see the mice at work, and I personally think the antics of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming merits of this movie.<br /><br />The first vignette is the best, about Cinderella getting used to being to being a princess. This is the best, because the mice were at their funniest here. The worst of the vignettes, when Jaq turns into a human, is cute at times, but has a lack of imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also cute. The problem was, I couldn't imagine Anastasia being friendly with Cinderella, as I considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters. This was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about Lucifer falling in love with PomPom.<br /><br />The incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however I hated the songs, they were really uninspired, and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original.<br /><br />The characters were the strongest development here. Cinderella while still caring, had lost her sincerity, and a lot of her charm from the original, though she does wear some very pretty clothes. The Duke had some truly funny moments but they weren't enough to save the film, likewise with Prudence and the king. As I mentioned, the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie, as they alone contributed to the film's cuteness. I have to say also the animation is colourful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good.<br /><br />All in all, a cute, if unoriginal sequel, that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story. 4/10 for the mice, the voice acting, the animation and some pretty dresses.

{"value":"There are just so many things wrong with this movie.<br /><br />To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten. The overall movie is (mercifully) short already, but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did the miss a reference to \"The Wiz\" on that one?) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot. In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of reworking.<br /><br />Second, it could have done without the crude humor. The original also had some that it could have done without, but at least there it was almost an afterthought -- here, flatulence and urination abound.<br /><br />Third, the show is a little too self-aware. The original series had that well enough, as did the first movie, but here it's just way, way too much. The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top (and why no mention of the \"new Ursula\"?). Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also exceed good sense.<br /><br />Fourth, a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work. In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant (except by behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad, and they at least do succeed on that count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there.<br /><br />All that said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison -- he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie but wasn't here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original.<br /><br />Most other performances were pretty standard, not standing out in my mind as either good or bad.","finished_norm":["there","be","just","so","mani","thing","wrong","with","thi","moviebr","br","to","begin","with","the","twenti","minut","of","the","film","can","have","be","compress","into","just","five","or","mayb","ten","the","overal","movi","be","mercifulli","short","alreadi","but","thi","can","have","be","make","up","for","by","give","a","littl","much","attent","to","the","mean","lion","how","do","the","miss","a","refer","to","the","wiz","on","that","on","and","work","hi","subplot","a","littl","much","close","into","the","main","plot","in","short","the","script","have","the","se","of","a","good","idea","but","ne","quit","a","bite","of","reworkingbr","br","it","can","have","do","without","the","crude","humor","the","origin","conjur","have","some","that","it","can","have","do","without","but","at","littl","there","it","be","almost","a","afterthought","here","flatul","and","urin","aboundbr","br","the","show","be","a","littl","too","selfawar","the","origin","seri","have","that","good","enough","a","do","the","movi","but","here","it","just","wai","wai","too","much","the","brendan","fraser","injok","be","just","a","bite","over","the","top","and","why","no","mention","of","the","new","ursula","other","gag","with","the","narrat","especi","a","coupl","of","interact","near","the","end","conjur","exc","good","sensebr","br","a","bite","much","attent","can","have","be","give","to","the","cgi","work","in","the","it","be","hard","to","tell","that","shemp","be","not","a","real","eleph","except","by","behavior","of","cours","but","here","the","cgi","stand","out","like","a","sore","thumb","ideal","special","effect","should","mere","tell","the","stori","whether","thei","re","good","or","bad","and","thei","at","littl","do","succ","on","that","count","so","it","a","rel","small","problem","but","it","still","therebr","br","all","that","sai","christoph","showerman","perform","a","georg","be","decent","enough","it","lack","brendan","fraser","charm","but","christoph","onli","realli","fail","in","that","specif","comparison","he","even","manag","to","give","georg","a","bite","of","person","depth","which","should","have","be","a","major","foul","in","a","jai","wardinspir","movi","but","be","not","here","juli","benz","a","the","new","ursula","surpris","me","a","be","even","well","than","lesli","mann","in","the","originalbr","br","much","other","perform","be","pretti","standard","not","stand","out","in","my","mind","a","either","good","or","bad"],"filtered":["mani","thing","wrong","thi","moviebr","br","begin","twenti","minut","film","compress","five","mayb","ten","overal","movi","mercifulli","short","alreadi","thi","make","give","littl","much","attent","mean","lion","miss","refer","wiz","work","hi","subplot","littl","much","close","main","plot","short","script","se","good","idea","ne","quit","bite","reworkingbr","br","without","crude","humor","origin","conjur","without","littl","almost","afterthought","flatul","urin","aboundbr","br","show","littl","selfawar","origin","seri","good","enough","movi","wai","wai","much","brendan","fraser","injok","bite","top","mention","new","ursula","gag","narrat","especi","coupl","interact","near","end","conjur","exc","good","sensebr","br","bite","much","attent","give","cgi","work","hard","tell","shemp","real","eleph","except","behavior","cours","cgi","stand","like","sore","thumb","ideal","special","effect","mere","tell","stori","whether","thei","re","good","bad","thei","littl","succ","count","rel","small","problem","still","therebr","br","sai","christoph","showerman","perform","georg","decent","enough","lack","brendan","fraser","charm","christoph","onli","realli","fail","specif","comparison","even","manag","give","georg","bite","person","depth","major","foul","jai","wardinspir","movi","juli","benz","new","ursula","surpris","even","well","lesli","mann","originalbr","br","much","perform","pretti","standard","stand","mind","either","good","bad"],"filtered2":["mani","thing","wrong","moviebr","begin","twenti","minut","compress","five","mayb","ten","overal","mercifulli","short","alreadi","make","give","littl","attent","mean","lion","miss","refer","wiz","work","subplot","littl","close","main","plot","short","script","se","good","idea","ne","quit","bite","reworkingbr","without","crude","humor","origin","conjur","without","littl","almost","afterthought","flatul","urin","aboundbr","show","littl","selfawar","origin","good","enough","wai","wai","brendan","fraser","injok","bite","top","mention","new","ursula","gag","narrat","especi","coupl","interact","near","end","conjur","exc","good","sensebr","bite","attent","give","cgi","work","hard","tell","shemp","real","eleph","except","behavior","cours","cgi","stand","like","sore","thumb","ideal","special","effect","mere","tell","stori","whether","re","good","bad","littl","succ","count","rel","small","problem","still","therebr","christoph","showerman","perform","georg","decent","enough","lack","brendan","fraser","charm","christoph","onli","realli","fail","specif","co

{"value":"\"Washington Square\" is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. Moreover its simple, eventless story seems unsuited to make it into a film (although William Wyler, with his \"The Heiress\", gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /><br />Anyway, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, but nonetheless she is a sound, intelligent young woman, and she's not as naive as it may seem. Her attachment for her father is dignified and respectful, with no morbid sides in it. Along three quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just seems to be mentally retarded, poor thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity as a woman, and all that.<br /><br />The director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has, well, troubles with her vesica. The second scene, when we see on the background a sort of open-air brothel, with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and demure even for the standards of the Victorian age. I defy anyone to find any coarseness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James' huge literary production. I really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes.<br /><br />Yes, I know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel. But if a director utterly ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (here Henry James), I don't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /><br />The acting is adequate to the movie: poor and flat, in spite of the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. \"Washington Square\" is definitely a non-recommendable film.","finished_norm":["washington","squar","be","a","flat","shabbi","adapt","of","the","short","novel","by","henri","jame","ind","the","novel","be","veri","good","but","far","from","the","level","of","jame","masterpiec","moreov","it","simpl","eventless","stori","seem","unsuit","to","make","it","into","a","film","although","william","wyler","with","hi","the","heiress","give","in","a","beauti","version","of","the","novel","br","br","anywai","the","movi","complet","betrai","the","spirit","of","thi","work","of","the","great","american","writer","in","the","novel","the","heroin","catherin","be","shy","not","veri","attract","and","somewhat","clumsi","but","nonetheless","she","be","a","sound","intellig","young","woman","and","she","not","a","naiv","a","it","mai","seem","her","attach","for","her","father","be","dignifi","and","respect","with","no","morbid","side","in","it","along","three","quarter","of","the","movi","catherin","jennif","jason","leigh","just","seem","to","be","mental","retard","poor","thing","in","the","last","quarter","she","suddenli","and","incredibli","becom","intellig","awar","of","her","digniti","a","a","woman","and","all","thatbr","br","the","director","agnieszka","holland","have","add","two","vulgar","scene","to","the","stori","the","when","the","nervou","child","catherin","have","good","troubl","with","her","vesica","the","scene","when","we","see","on","the","background","a","sort","of","openair","brothel","with","prostitut","take","their","custom","behind","tent","and","so","on","noth","can","be","much","contrari","to","the","spirit","and","artist","ideal","of","henri","jame","it","be","notori","that","the","writer","be","extrem","decent","and","demur","even","for","the","standard","of","the","victorian","ag","i","defi","anyon","to","find","ani","coars","anywher","in","the","thousand","of","page","of","jame","huge","literari","product","i","realli","be","particularli","annoi","by","thi","two","scenesbr","br","ye","i","know","that","a","director","ne","reason","freedom","in","the","screen","adapt","of","a","novel","but","if","a","director","utterli","ignor","or","misunderstand","the","art","of","a","author","here","henri","jame","i","do","not","see","the","point","of","us","hi","work","to","make","a","bad","movi","br","br","the","act","be","adequ","to","the","movi","poor","and","flat","in","spite","of","the","talent","of","albert","finnei","and","maggi","smith","washington","squar","be","definit","a","nonrecommend","film"],"filtered":["washington","squar","flat","shabbi","adapt","short","novel","henri","jame","ind","novel","veri","good","far","level","jame","masterpiec","moreov","simpl","eventless","stori","seem","unsuit","make","film","although","william","wyler","hi","heiress","give","beauti","version","novel","br","br","anywai","movi","complet","betrai","spirit","thi","work","great","american","writer","novel","heroin","catherin","shy","veri","attract","somewhat","clumsi","nonetheless","sound","intellig","young","woman","naiv","mai","seem","attach","father","dignifi","respect","morbid","side","along","three","quarter","movi","catherin","jennif","jason","leigh","seem","mental","retard","poor","thing","last","quarter","suddenli","incredibli","becom","intellig","awar","digniti","woman","thatbr","br","director","agnieszka","holland","add","two","vulgar","scene","stori","nervou","child","catherin","good","troubl","vesica","scene","see","background","sort","openair","brothel","prostitut","take","custom","behind","tent","noth","much","contrari","spirit","artist","ideal","henri","jame","notori","writer","extrem","decent","demur","even","standard","victorian","ag","defi","anyon","find","ani","coars","anywher","thousand","page","jame","huge","literari","product","realli","particularli","annoi","thi","two","scenesbr","br","ye","know","director","ne","reason","freedom","screen","adapt","novel","director","utterli","ignor","misunderstand","art","author","henri","jame","see","point","us","hi","work","make","bad","movi","br","br","act","adequ","movi","poor","flat","spite","talent","albert","finnei","maggi","smith","washington","squar","definit","nonrecommend","film"],"filtered2":["washington","squar","flat","shabbi","adapt","short","novel","henri","jame","ind","novel","veri","good","far","level","jame","masterpiec","moreov","simpl","eventless","stori","seem","unsuit","make","although","william","wyler","heiress","give","beauti","version","novel","anywai","complet","betrai","spirit","work","great","american","writer","novel","heroin","catherin","shy","veri","attract","somewhat","clumsi","nonetheless","sound","intellig","young","woman","naiv","mai","seem","attach","father","dignifi","respect","morbid","side","along","three","quarter","catherin","jennif","jason","leigh","seem","mental","retard","poor","thing","last","quarter","suddenli","incredibli","becom","intellig","awar","digniti","woman","thatbr","director","agnieszka","holland","add","two","vulgar","scene","stori","nervou","child","catherin","good"

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened Alcatraz. He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage.<br /><br />Steven Seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel, the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.) But there's a reason he hasn't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners. Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along.

{"value":"Horror fans (I'm speaking to the over 12's, although if you're under 12 I apologise for what you might deem an insult): In short, if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written, original storytelling, punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares, and delivered via convincing performances, then I can heartily recommend - AVOIDING THESE STEAMERS - made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date. It's no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980's. Not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys (or indeed the 80's) because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (Actually Clive, WTF are you doing in there?! Glad to see Romero had the good sense to give it a miss as I'm sure he was asked to partake...). More perhaps we should point the finger at creator Mick Garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised TV remake of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'The Shining'.<br /><br />Perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today. Are we so starved of good TV horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets? Sadly, maybe so.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't argue the faults and merits of a production, I'd just rate it accordingly. However, as this series is woefully lacking in any merit (with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune) I write this as more of a warning than a review: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you disagree with me then it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start, but if these 'Masters' of Horror were being assessed on these works alone, they'd never have been allowed to graduate with even their Bachelor's degree. Unless of course they were studying for a degree from the University Of

{"value":"While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie, called \"The Making of 10 Items or Less\":<br /><br />Producer: I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman!<br /><br />Writer: That's great! But what's the bad news?<br /><br />Producer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I guess we'll have to get someone else.<br /><br />Writer: So we hire him for one day. A movie is an hour and a half long. A work day is eight hours long. I fail to see a problem.<br /><br />Producer: But... he'll have to spend time getting into character.<br /><br />Writer: So we have him play a character who is essentially himself.<br /><br />Producer: But he'll still need to understand his motivation and all that. You're not saying we have him play a big-name actor that's doing a low-budget movie, are you?<br /><br />Writer: Why not?<br /><br />Producer: That's ridiculous! But fine, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I guess we have to set the movie in Los Angeles too.<br /><br />Writer: Of course.<br /><br />Producer: This script is a load of crap. We'd better make money on this. Just in case, have Morgan Freeman's character plug Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs.<br /><br />Writer: Sure thing!<br /><br />Producer: Wait a second... what's this about a tiny bodega with a \"ten items or less\" express lane?<br /><br />Writer: Oh, I guess that is pretty weird. But we can't change the title now!<br /><br />I doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality, but then neither did \"10 Items or Less\". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. When watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some sort of message. I think they might have been trying for the tired old \"don't let anything hold you back\" message that has been done to death in much better films. In any case, with \"10 Items or Less\", the only message I got was \"Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!\"","finished_norm":["while","watch","thi","movi","i","come","up","with","a","script","for","a","movi","call","the","make","of","item","or","lessbr","br","produc","i","have","get","good","new","and","bad","new","the","good","new","be","we","can","get","morgan","freemanbr","br","writer","that","great","but","what","the","bad","newsbr","br","produc","we","can","onli","afford","to","hire","him","for","on","dai","i","guess","we","will","have","to","get","someon","elsebr","br","writer","so","we","hire","him","for","on","dai","a","movi","be","a","hour","and","a","half","long","a","work","dai","be","eight","hour","long","i","fail","to","see","a","problembr","br","produc","but","he","will","have","to","spend","time","get","into","characterbr","br","writer","so","we","have","him","plai","a","charact","who","be","essenti","himselfbr","br","produc","but","he","will","still","ne","to","understand","hi","motiv","and","all","that","you","re","not","sai","we","have","him","plai","a","bignam","actor","that","do","a","lowbudget","movi","be","youbr","br","writer","why","notbr","br","produc","that","ridicul","but","fine","at","littl","we","will","have","morgan","freeman","in","our","movi","and","i","guess","we","have","to","set","the","movi","in","lo","angel","toobr","br","writer","of","coursebr","br","produc","thi","script","be","a","load","of","crap","we","have","well","make","monei","on","thi","just","in","case","have","morgan","freeman","charact","plug","walmart","or","target","or","on","of","that","store","so","at","littl","someon","will","want","to","sell","the","dvdsbr","br","writer","sure","thingbr","br","produc","wait","a","what","thi","about","a","tini","bodega","with","a","ten","item","or","littl","express","lanebr","br","writer","oh","i","guess","that","be","pretti","weird","but","we","ca","not","chang","the","titl","nowbr","br","i","doubt","my","script","actual","bear","much","resembl","to","realiti","but","then","neither","do","item","or","littl","thi","be","a","case","of","good","act","but","bad","write","and","i","hate","to","see","it","happen","when","watch","a","independ","movi","you","expect","it","to","try","to","convei","some","sort","of","messag","i","think","thei","mai","have","be","try","for","the","tire","old","do","not","let","anyth","hold","you","back","messag","that","have","be","do","to","death","in","much","well","film","in","ani","case","with","item","or","littl","the","onli","messag","i","get","be","look","look","at","morgan","freeman"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","come","script","movi","call","make","item","lessbr","br","produc","get","good","new","bad","new","good","new","get","morgan","freemanbr","br","writer","great","bad","newsbr","br","produc","onli","afford","hire","dai","guess","get","someon","elsebr","br","writer","hire","dai","movi","hour","half","long","work","dai","eight","hour","long","fail","see","problembr","br","produc","spend","time","get","characterbr","br","writer","plai","charact","essenti","himselfbr","br","produc","still","ne","understand","hi","motiv","re","sai","plai","bignam","actor","lowbudget","movi","youbr","br","writer","notbr","br","produc","ridicul","fine","littl","morgan","freeman","movi","guess","set","movi","lo","angel","toobr","br","writer","coursebr","br","produc","thi","script","load","crap","well","make","monei","thi","case","morgan","freeman","charact","plug","walmart","target","store","littl","someon","want","sell","dvdsbr","br","writer","sure","thingbr","br","produc","wait","thi","tini","bodega","ten","item","littl","express","lanebr","br","writer","oh","guess","pretti","weird","ca","chang","titl","nowbr","br","doubt","script","actual","bear","much","resembl","realiti","neither","item","littl","thi","case","good","act","bad","write","hate","see","happen","watch","independ","movi","expect","try","convei","sort","messag","think","thei","mai","try","tire","old","let","anyth","hold","back","messag","death","much","well","film","ani","case","item","littl","onli","messag","get","look","look","morgan","freeman"],"filtered2":["watch","come","script","call","make","item","lessbr","produc","get","good","new","bad","new","good","new","get","morgan","freemanbr","writer","great","bad","newsbr","produc","onli","afford","hire","dai","guess","get","someon","elsebr","writer","hire","dai","hour","half","long","work","dai","eight","hour","long","fail","see","problembr","produc","spend","time","get","characterbr","writer","plai","charact","essenti","himselfbr","produc","still","ne","understand","motiv","re","plai","bignam","actor","lowbudget","youbr","writer","notbr","produc","ridicul","fine","littl","morgan","freeman","guess","set","lo","angel","toobr","writer","coursebr","produc","script","load","crap","well","make","monei","case","morgan","freeman","charact","plug","walmart","target","store","littl","someon","want","sell","dvdsbr","writer","sure","thingbr","produc","wait","tini","bodega","ten","item","littl","express","lanebr","writer","oh","guess","pretti",

{"value":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The plot and message are horrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that it's impossible to keep up. I don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee portrays a angry/irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad. Pros: He's angry alright. Cons: When it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the sadness/disappointment he has in his father. The crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes.<br /><br />2) To connect the movie to the title, there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not... but it's just sooo dumb! 3) WHY THE HECK DID THE COPS NOT SHOOT THE KILLER? What the heck is wrong with this movie. When the killer started stabbing an officer, SHOOT him. He's already dead! What the heck? There were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed, but I do not know why he wasn't! 4) During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt. In the scene, it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was hurt, so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot? And this is the actress nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are off sync.<br /><br />6) I am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia, so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight? 7) This movie is just too violent without a purpose. Cops are beating CI to a pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? This is overall the worst movie.

{"value":"Disney's done it again. The company that made \"Mr. Magoo\" and \"George of the Jungle\" has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and keeps none of the spirit of the original.<br /><br />\"Inspector Gadget\" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one, and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then. Now that that movie does exist, I was severely disappointed, even outraged.<br /><br />First we have the characters.<br /><br />Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon (with well-done special effects accompanying them), and he even has some of the naivete of the original Gadget, but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch.<br /><br />Penny has little to do; while she played a major role in the cartoon, discovering the crime and halting it, and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents, now she is simply introduced and then forgotten, although she does at least sneak into Claw's base.<br /><br />Claw is the movie's version of Dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister, raspy-voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view, as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand, with no mystery behind the character.<br /><br />Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie, but are rather insignificant to it.<br /><br />Even small parts of the cartoon aren't spared in this butchering. The famous expression \"Wowsers!\" was mysteriously changed to \"Wowser\", and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks.<br /><br />There is even product endorsements everywhere. Why is \"Yahoo!\" advertised on a sign? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M&M's or Skittles?<br /><br />Fans of the cartoon will hate it, others might will likely find the movie below par, and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old

{"value":"I was thinking that the main character, the astronaut with the bad case of the runs(in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc) could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job as the Blob. The premise of this flick is pretty lame. An astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation(I think), and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is this a puzzler, but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens, the person instantly turns into a killing machine? Why is that?<br /><br />The astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility'(which has no security whatsoever), shedding parts of himself as he goes. Apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad, maybe because he wanted to return to space. <br /><br />Thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler, with a doctor wandering around with a Geiger counter, trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off. He kills a stupid Bill Gates look-alike fisherman, scares a little girl a la the Frankenstein monster movie, and finishes off a wacky older couple(punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons). Then there's a short scene where he whacks his former General, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around. You'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away, the scene would shift. But no...we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror, even though the monster is gone. All I could think was..director's girlfriend, anyone?<br /><br />The end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it. The melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo, and then...nothing. That's it. That's the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant that there was no room for a
