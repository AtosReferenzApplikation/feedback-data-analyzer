{"value":"This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br

{"value":"How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just don't get it. Trick or Treat managed to do it. This sucks and likes it.<br /><br />Trick or Treat is one of those movies I have to warn people about. It is a vomit-inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors.<br /><br />For a movie about heavy metal, it sure doesn't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents. This movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986, probably one of heavy metal's strongest hours. That is quite a feat, however negative.<br /><br />Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it.

{"value":"This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me. The people must be warned!<br /><br />First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in \"zero\")<br /><br />I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis, and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there's no script. The dialogue is unreal and plain boring, the situations are contrived, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo.<br /><br />Never mind wasting MONEY on this movie, it's not even worth your TIME spent watching it. Please do not see it...

you!","finished_norm":["thi","be","my","movi","review","on","imdb","i","be","forc","to","regist","after","watch","thi","movi","i","cannot","in","good","conscienc","allow","thi","movi","to","be","unreview","by","me","the","peopl","must","be","warnedbr","br","of","all","my","rate","be","a","in","zerobr","br","i","love","jack","black","ben","still","rachel","wei","and","christoph","walken","and","yet","i","hate","thi","movi","there","be","a","plot","but","who","care","when","there","no","script","the","dialogu","be","unreal","and","plain","bore","the","situat","be","contriv","the","flow","of","event","be","slow","and","somewhat","arbitrari","the","charact","be","unsympathet","and","uninterest","and","the","stori","although","base","on","a","good","premis","be","stupid","thi","movi","be","a","piec","of","poobr","br","never","mind","wast","monei","on","thi","movi","it","not","even","worth","your","time","spend","watch","it","pleas","do","not","see","it","i","beg","of","you"],"filtered":["thi","movi","review","imdb","forc","regist","watch","thi","movi","good","conscienc","allow","thi","movi","unreview","peopl","must","warnedbr","br","rate","zerobr","br","love","jack","black","ben","still","rachel","wei","christoph","walken","yet","hate","thi","movi","plot","care","script","dialogu","unreal","plain","bore","situat","contriv","flow","event","slow","somewhat","arbitrari","charact","unsympathet","uninterest","stori","although","base","good","premis","stupid","thi","movi","piec","poobr","br","never","mind","wast","monei","thi","movi","even","worth","time","spend","watch","pleas","see","beg"],"filtered2":["review","imdb","forc","regist","watch","good","conscienc","allow","unreview","peopl","must","warnedbr","rate","zerobr","love","jack","black","ben","still","rachel","wei","christoph","walken","yet","hate","plot","care","script","dialogu","unreal","plain","bore","situat","contriv","flow","event","slow","somewhat","arbitrari","charact","unsympathet","uninterest","stori","although","base","good","premis","stupid","piec","poobr","never","mind","wast","monei","even","worth","time","spend","watch","pleas","see","beg"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,8,10,17,23,32,42,54,64,77,89,108,126,136,141,176,194,202,205,218,219,229,237,238,248,283,334,338,339,346,390,470,473,484,521,586,591,596,777,854,1162,1180,1247,1899,1966,2320,2400,3035,3194,3830,4721,5275],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,8,10,17,23,32,42,54,64,77,89,108,126,136,141,176,194,202,205,218,219,229,237,238,248,283,334,338,339,346,390,470,473,484,521,586,591,596,777,854,1162,1180,1247,1899,1966,2320,2400,3035,3194,3830,4721,5275],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.3711311285073675,1.6219954307453837,1.8113893252729412,1.883428577602134,1.9463902258768238,1.9940046109572438,2.138507503627933,2.2391270689902285,2.346825985579986,2.2657547357741192,2.5040471493269134,2.5378812223426954,2.597304642813496,2.571852579609833,2.5940874818617203,2.5792094178355414,2.8432628718938773,2.640097787510554,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.7678802023081546,2.942840385588056,2.9720957437368454,3.003844442051426,3.023389038124396,3.132778125427319,3.3814747511661465,3.335489637924323,3.291526514503207,3.4076979462652486,3.4572130107926293,3.509308122676031,3.485528930909917,4.086456389373095,4.291900363587903,4.383707912841026,4.263079925052412,4.327618446189983,4.828393734102471,4.85885294158718,5.521540914662417,5.373120909544144,5.482320201509136,5.626901430320244,5.719991853386255,6.0662680901040895,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961301E-4,2.116930065387446E-4,2.1174527517734903E-4,2.117027076039157E-4,2.1172274275403085E-4,2.116918393273706E-4,2.117576784283853E-4,2.1166034303434365E-4,2.1169305127789745E-4,2.119118131072543E-4,2.1359327166514615E-4,2.1169340094007584E-4,2.1189388796842007E-4,2.119159636557949E-4,2.1181969576676975E-4,2.117035414702402E-4,2.1177637567609546E-4,2.118760383584709E-4,2.1171447081128614E-4,2.1171369676217526E-4,2.1190416541618502E-4,2.1173490831315615E-4,2.1173522875559035E-4,2.1187086861014468E-4,2.1171454718202677E-4,2.1191849657462003E-4,2.1176752792775898E-4,2.1169253209079157E-4,2.1178850443817667E-4,2.1185314534259426E-4,2.1173594690714997E-4,2.1184934806943375E-4,2.1195336081055499E-4,2.1215008639459396E-4,2.1176716198751712E-4,2.1170341306868626E-4,2.117797441048321E-4,2.1172491352726227E-4,2.1166056894252505E-4,2.1171440524675981E-4,2.1192657926066708E-4,2.1181032419177943E-4,2.118498308375972E-4,2.1167110326541545E-4,2.1171445908036977E-4,2.117033334601199E-4,2.117749931190512E-4,2.1181171516755485E-4,2.1

{"value":"I would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for Jason (Herb) Evers constant harping on experiment. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overacting. Yet, as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting is exactly that.<br /><br />Most of the actors in this B classic were rather good actors, minus Evers and the showgirls. If you watch this movie, you would have noticed Evers shouting almost every line, that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose. <br /><br />The special effects were par for the course in a B movie such as this one. In hindsight, there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.","finished_norm":["i","would","have","enjoi","thi","movi","slightli","much","have","not","be","for","jason","herb","ever","constant","harp","on","experi","mani","earli","review","of","the","seven","samurai","accus","toshiro","mifun","of","overact","yet","a","much","and","much","critic","view","that","film","thei","see","it","a","be","purposefulli","do","jason","ever","be","obvious","not","toshiro","mifun","and","hi","overact","be","exactli","thatbr","br","much","of","the","actor","in","thi","b","classic","be","rather","good","actor","minu","ever","and","the","showgirl","if","you","watch","thi","movi","you","would","have","notic","ever","shout","almost","everi","line","that","be","until","he","be","smoke","and","blow","the","smoke","coolli","out","hi","nose","br","br","the","special","effect","be","par","for","the","cours","in","a","b","movi","such","a","thi","on","in","hindsight","there","be","not","much","that","stand","out","in","my","mind","a","fantast","good","or","bad","for","thi","movi"],"filtered":["enjoi","thi","movi","slightli","much","jason","herb","ever","constant","harp","experi","mani","earli","review","seven","samurai","accus","toshiro","mifun","overact","yet","much","much","critic","view","film","thei","see","purposefulli","jason","ever","obvious","toshiro","mifun","hi","overact","exactli","thatbr","br","much","actor","thi","b","classic","rather","good","actor","minu","ever","showgirl","watch","thi","movi","notic","ever","shout","almost","everi","line","smoke","blow","smoke","coolli","hi","nose","br","br","special","effect","par","cours","b","movi","thi","hindsight","much","stand","mind","fantast","good","bad","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["enjoi","slightli","jason","herb","ever","constant","harp","experi","mani","earli","review","seven","samurai","accus","toshiro","mifun","overact","yet","critic","view","see","purposefulli","jason","ever","obvious","toshiro","mifun","overact","exactli","thatbr","actor","b","classic","rather","good","actor","minu","ever","showgirl","watch","notic","ever","shout","almost","everi","line","smoke","blow","smoke","coolli","nose","special","effect","par","cours","b","hindsight","stand","mind","fantast","good","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,41,44,50,85,106,107,131,160,176,194,199,200,203,238,266,312,332,333,341,377,462,579,642,688,754,965,1339,1392,1415,1458,1509,1562,1600,1952,1967,2054,2135,2953,3227,5661,7722],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,41,44,50,85,106,107,131,160,176,194,199,200,203,238,266,312,332,333,341,377,462,579,642,688,754,965,1339,1392,1415,1458,1509,1562,1600,1952,1967,2054,2135,2953,3227,5661,7722],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,3.1375198335242067,6.418917570009896,1.717994385570355,2.011190219103739,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.2512118082053005,2.3722295531801256,2.5040471493269134,2.5378812223426954,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,2.597304642813496,2.747702973022204,2.8824835850471584,2.9705344631698933,2.948928684455311,2.933776879434709,3.0602441305135506,3.2639531875991072,3.5642670069567886,7.244845854227726,3.6016814428070463,3.7465885637507435,3.9868265484242533,9.012620469866716,4.403125998698128,8.983842994962517,4.4919214974812585,4.751432692966343,9.178753667263944,4.558366596889411,4.911775343041523,4.85885294158718,5.02684467282631,4.956227105612356,5.822646007446338,5.541743621979936,6.2980697041614135,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164663E-4,2.2324275812784215E-4,2.2329787848933365E-4,2.2325298847310004E-4,2.2327411672029318E-4,2.2324152723462223E-4,2.2331095844892402E-4,2.232083125364085E-4,2.232428053079169E-4,2.234735025565281E-4,2.2524669975505123E-4,2.2324317404730226E-4,2.2345459944065002E-4,2.2347787955470625E-4,2.2337635940358777E-4,2.2325386783430913E-4,2.2333067579914006E-4,2.2343577597443487E-4,2.2326539346890383E-4,2.2326457718847367E-4,2.2346543761534024E-4,2.2328694601974762E-4,2.2328728394518975E-4,2.2343032416998447E-4,2.2326547400635313E-4,2.2348055066696393E-4,2.2332134532680113E-4,2.2324225779449928E-4,2.2334346629394175E-4,2.2341163393927878E-4,2.2328804127835607E-4,2.2340762949082024E-4,2.2351731705956896E-4,2.237247757880987E-4,2.2332095942123795E-4,2.2325373242729917E-4,2.233342280058663E-4,2.2327640592866797E-4,2.2320855076990675E-4,2.2326532432724472E-4,2.2348907433600586E-4,2.2336647651074386E-4,2.2340813859831558E-4,2.232196598345637E-4,2.232653810979608E-4,2.2325364847537173E-4,2.2332921781121278E-4,2.2336794337671963E-4,2.233225227676383E-4,2.232871257532247E-4,2.2325420056448946E-4,2.2371161216552584E-4,2.2331037775234793E-4,2.232653299258189E-4,2.233091818425656E-4,2.2324248620167694E-4,0.9823555967090252,2.2327731575760422E-4,2.2325

{"value":"This is one of those movies where I wish I had just stayed in the bar.<br /><br />The film is quite frankly boring. What story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it. The film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film. Did I say it was boring already? If all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie I would not have cared less as I had no emotional attachment to any of them.<br /><br />There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but that was about it. This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance, but I held on believing that it had to get better. I was wrong.<br /><br />The sort of film you could threaten naughty children

Rene Z. tries hard with an underwritten part, and so does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can't remember (the one that's not Chris Penn) is a big sweaty over actor. See it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can't follow it, and so confusing you can't understand it. See it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick. See it if you love to watch Tim Roth work with an unwieldy script. See it if it comes on late at night for free. Otherwise, rent The Usual Suspects.","finished_norm":["spoiler","alertbr","br","i","love","tim","roth","i","realli","do","and","he","doe","hi","well","with","a","unbeliev","role","i","can","see","how","thi","be","a","movi","that","mai","look","good","a","a","script","but","it","convolut","unlik","and","ultim","silli","i","see","the","fake","death","end","come","a","mile","awai","rene","z","try","hard","with","a","underwrit","part","and","so","doe","patricia","arquett","the","detect","whose","name","i","ca","not","rememb","the","on","that","not","chri","penn","be","a","big","sweati","over","actor","see","it","if","you","re","not","smart","enough","to","differenti","between","a","movi","be","so","clever","you","ca","not","follow","it","and","so","confus","you","ca","not","understand","it","see","it","if","you","like","cheesi","camera","work","that","make","you","seasick","see","it","if","you","love","to","watch","tim","roth","work","with","a","unwieldi","script","see","it","if","it","come","on","late","at","night","for","free","otherwis","rend","the","usual","suspect"],"filtered":["spoiler","alertbr","br","love","tim","roth","realli","doe","hi","well","unbeliev","role","see","thi","movi","mai","look","good","script","convolut","unlik","ultim","silli","see","fake","death","end","come","mile","awai","rene","z","try","hard","underwrit","part","doe","patricia","arquett","detect","whose","name","ca","rememb","chri","penn","big","sweati","actor","see","re","smart","enough","differenti","movi","clever","ca","follow","confus","ca","understand","see","like","cheesi","camera","work","make","seasick","see","love","watch","tim","roth","work","unwieldi","script","see","come","late","night","free","otherwis","rend","usual","suspect"],"filtered2":["spoiler","alertbr","love","tim","roth","realli","doe","well","unbeliev","role","see","mai","look","good","script","convolut","unlik","ultim","silli","see","fake","death","end","come","mile","awai","rene","z","try","hard","underwrit","part","doe","patricia","arquett","detect","whose","name","ca","rememb","chri","penn","big","sweati","actor","see","re","smart","enough","differenti","clever","ca","follow","confus","ca","understand","see","like","cheesi","camera","work","make","seasick","see","love","watch","tim","roth","work","unwieldi","script","see","come","late","night","free","otherwis","rend","usual","suspect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,13,16,18,20,24,34,36,41,46,48,54,61,68,77,81,82,93,128,143,150,155,171,210,212,231,245,260,265,290,385,427,490,533,543,571,598,615,627,639,686,735,955,977,1062,1119,1140,1206,1444,2318,3191,3332,3685,4067,5229,6193,7243,8053],"values":[1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,13,16,18,20,24,34,36,41,46,48,54,61,68,77,81,82,93,128,143,150,155,171,210,212,231,245,260,265,290,385,427,490,533,543,571,598,615,627,639,686,735,955,977,1062,1119,1140,1206,1444,2318,3191,3332,3685,4067,5229,6193,7243,8053],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,3.934201232816368,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,2.7965700178917925,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,3.3910232448024944,3.6227786505458823,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,3.8927804517536475,5.849271697274184,2.020196584395323,2.035389827120098,2.3409902041158843,2.3409902041158843,2.332712011146513,2.3074766467914385,2.373087554090762,2.687151791517189,2.5983793339432615,2.7049353070058615,2.7502029743242886,2.6754694156628323,2.73529586597515,2.8612813773965557,3.09496984188738,3.233054746047873,3.3490645070153917,3.424750734647968,3.477726550625732,3.467417180966871,3.5642670069567886,3.5013187326425523,3.477726550625732,3.616452760127359,3.6016814428070463,3.7132521434831514,4.017463517886143,4.035401218572811,4.327618446189983,4.235066888824737,4.558366596889411,4.364659717870332,9.597669863721855,5.051537285416681,6.032366538428407,11.999153431210834,5.878215858601149,5.967828017290836,6.437831646536572,6.948657270302562,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5958924807382325E-4,1.5944782797301972E-4,1.5948719687345172E-4,1.594551348453432E-4,1.5947022538244314E-4,1.5944694882579885E-4,1.5949653904053545E-4,1.594232257203715E-4,1.5944786167068815E-4,1.596126337578944E-4,1.608791135498635E-4,1.5944812503732354E-4,1.5959913248782427E-4,1.596157599639062E-4,1.5954325069182591E-4,1.5945576291604064E-4,1.595106218654015E-4,1.5958568810634424E-4,1.5946399492955607E-4,1.5946341191336912E-4,1.5960687349330207E-4,1.5947938851924355E-4,1.5947962987747716E-4,1.5958179423589827E-4,1.5946405245223437E-4,1.5961766776620773E-4,1.595039577139599E-4,1.5944747061735247E-4,1.59519757286554

{"value":"The story is similar to ET: an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home. While its stay on our planet, it will create friendly ties with humans.<br /><br />But, unlike ET which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is only fun. It is indeed a pure Dysney production: its core audience are children & the movie is more more in the visual than in the message.<br /><br />Thus, you will find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the town, a \"cosmic\" stray toaster) and the casting is experimented, with special mentions to \"Doc\", who rejuvenates in a \"Mac Fly\" character, and to Hurley, who seems open to auto-derision.<br /><br />Ice on the cake: the main title is scored by Danny Elfman, and like every other great composer, you recognize his \"voice\" before he is even

{"value":"Okay, 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of James Glickenhaus' calibre.<br /><br />McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous, over the top action films I've ever seen, without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos, but how about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' Victor Argo as the much reviled 'El Presidente'! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader.

{"value":"I have never seen the 1973, older highly rated version. I am a Nicholas Cage fan (by the way, fine acting as usual). This movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot (I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining. This is, of late, the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror/mystery/thriller genre, unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh, smart, and tantalizing screenplay, they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater.

{"value":"I have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking to myself, does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn't a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. SO, either way, it is pretty bad. I actually didn't make it to the end. I had to shut it off. I am a NYC Police Officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by that, and it isn't as bad as I personally think it is.

{"value":"I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant \"A Double Life\" and the funny \"Born Yesterday\" and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as \"Adam's Rib\" and \"Pat And Mike\" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome, sad drivel as \"Bachelor Mother\", \"Some Kind Of A Nut\", and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssen's character tests Drivas's character to make sure he's not gay.

{"value":"This film lacked something I couldn't put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress. This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man. Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play. It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just don't know.<br /><br />But could it have been the screenplay? Just exactly who was the chef in love with? He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anybody or anything else.

{"value":"By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled \"The Treasure\" but was changed to \"Sharks' Treasure\" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by \"Jaws\". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this \"thriller\" was supposed to sell tickets. Didn't work. Anytime something \"good\" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. That's cause enough for celebration.","finished_norm":["by","far","the","wrong","movi","of","all","time","even","yaphet","kotto","can","not","save","thi","turkei","i","have","hear","that","the","movi","be","origin","suppos","to","be","titl","the","treasur","but","be","chang","to","shark","treasur","in","order","to","take","advantag","of","the","excit","creat","by","jaw","i","think","shark","be","in","on","scene","of","thi","movi","the","fact","that","thei","happen","to","be","includ","in","thi","thriller","be","suppos","to","sell","ticket","do","not","work","anytim","someth","good","happen","in","the","movi","the","ship","crow","toast","each","other","with","a","certain","brand","of","beer","that","have","just","be","introduc","at","the","time","the","movi","be","make","gee","do","you","think","that","beer","mai","have","be","a","sponsor","can","thei","have","make","it","ani","much","obviou","the","onli","time","anyon","should","break","out","the","beer","be","if","thei","make","it","through","thi","thing","that","caus","enough","for","celebr"],"filtered":["far","wrong","movi","time","even","yaphet","kotto","save","thi","turkei","hear","movi","origin","suppos","titl","treasur","chang","shark","treasur","order","take","advantag","excit","creat","jaw","think","shark","scene","thi","movi","fact","thei","happen","includ","thi","thriller","suppos","sell","ticket","work","anytim","someth","good","happen","movi","ship","crow","toast","certain","brand","beer","introduc","time","movi","make","gee","think","beer","mai","sponsor","thei","make","ani","much","obviou","onli","time","anyon","break","beer","thei","make","thi","thing","caus","enough","celebr"],"filtered2":["far","wrong","time","even","yaphet","kotto","save","turkei","hear","origin","suppos","titl","treasur","chang","shark","treasur","order","take","advantag","excit","creat","jaw","think","shark","scene","fact","happen","includ","thriller","suppos","sell","ticket","work","anytim","someth","good","happen","ship","crow","toast","certain","brand","beer","introduc","time","make","gee","think","beer","mai","sponsor","make","ani","obviou","onli","time","anyon","break","beer","make","thing","caus","enough","celebr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,11,12,19,25,27,29,31,46,48,53,69,93,94,97,101,149,158,189,216,264,278,301,360,362,383,439,452,524,714,768,774,861,929,987,1520,1539,1701,2035,2093,2218,2317,2537,2683,5051,5434,5756,7367],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,11,12,19,25,27,29,31,46,48,53,69,93,94,97,101,149,158,189,216,264,278,301,360,362,383,439,452,524,714,768,774,861,929,987,1520,1539,1701,2035,2093,2218,2317,2537,2683,5051,5434,5756,7367],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,2.825681057716235,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,2.127032521151058,2.035389827120098,4.16224563969396,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,4.650639560718045,2.3106972614914807,2.498193474075453,2.6070186965339692,2.757740698455715,2.8336934208777267,2.8309760279012264,3.028335462059722,3.058539100262467,3.0433232530252132,3.2872346624216657,3.2872346624216657,3.4028786598293,3.7297814454343623,3.857614816944247,3.753391311073496,3.892300374932137,3.9954846111673676,4.383707912841026,4.581533656170946,4.662879295624898,10.549361673461783,14.937649871511168,5.102830579804232,5.014723312293965,11.003476574732474,5.185068678041204,5.243909178064138,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623904E-4,1.948883410303087E-4,1.9493646046718607E-4,1.9489727200317517E-4,1.9491571671815218E-4,1.9488726647479062E-4,1.9494787912034502E-4,1.9485827042812383E-4,1.9488838221796726E-4,1.9508977824281095E-4,1.9663775885027984E-4,1.9488870412317792E-4,1.9507327604168838E-4,1.9509359931150222E-4,1.9500497338335578E-4,1.9489803967532115E-4,1.9496509213860974E-4,1.9505684337379862E-4,1.9490810142076955E-4,1.9490738881741262E-4,1.9508273764260608E-4,1.94926916547917E-4,1.9492721155291227E-4,1.9505208401168596E-4,1.9490817172902955E-4,1.9509593116155178E-4,1.9495694674437428E-4,1.9488790424509794E-4,1.9497625809236234E-4,1.9503576765685207E-4,1.949278726959909E-4,1.9503227181974915E-4,1.9512802779626706E-4,1.9530913686235496E-4,1.949566098532893E-4,1.9489792146657047E-4,1.9496819317392074E-4,1.9491771517053726E-4,1.9485847840320728E-4,1.9490804106090233E-4,1.9510337222585774E-4,1.9499634574500076E-4,1.9503271626469332E-4,1.94868176487927E-4,1.949080906210796E-4,1.9489784817751062E-4,1.949638193320436E-4,1.9499762630200034E-4,1.9495797463658156E-4,1.949270734531598E-4,1.9489833014491305E-4,1.9529764517238173E-4,1.94

The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films. It really is that offensive to the genre.","finished_norm":["st","elmo","fire","have","no","bear","on","life","after","univers","at","all","for","the","major","of","u","common","folk","anywai","why","be","thi","garbag","even","make","who","can","realli","relat","to","thi","who","live","like","thi","charact","i","truli","feel","sorri","for","the","actor","have","to","deal","with","such","a","terribl","script","there","be","some","talent","young","actor","in","thi","film","that","have","do","a","good","job","elsewher","it","must","have","just","be","on","whole","joke","to","them","on","setbr","br","i","actual","find","thi","film","insult","to","my","intellig","the","onli","joi","i","get","from","thi","be","hope","that","sir","john","hugh","have","a","good","ol","laugh","when","he","see","a","screen","of","thi","the","same","year","hi","masterpiec","of","the","breakfast","club","be","releasedbr","br","do","not","make","the","same","mistak","i","do","of","watch","thi","becaus","you","enjoi","film","it","realli","be","that","offens","to","the","genr"],"filtered":["st","elmo","fire","bear","life","univers","major","u","common","folk","anywai","thi","garbag","even","make","realli","relat","thi","live","like","thi","charact","truli","feel","sorri","actor","deal","terribl","script","talent","young","actor","thi","film","good","job","elsewher","must","whole","joke","setbr","br","actual","find","thi","film","insult","intellig","onli","joi","get","thi","hope","sir","john","hugh","good","ol","laugh","see","screen","thi","year","hi","masterpiec","breakfast","club","releasedbr","br","make","mistak","watch","thi","becaus","enjoi","film","realli","offens","genr"],"filtered2":["st","elmo","fire","bear","life","univers","major","u","common","folk","anywai","garbag","even","make","realli","relat","live","like","charact","truli","feel","sorri","actor","deal","terribl","script","talent","young","actor","good","job","elsewher","must","whole","joke","setbr","actual","find","insult","intellig","onli","joi","get","hope","sir","john","hugh","good","ol","laugh","see","screen","year","masterpiec","breakfast","club","releasedbr","make","mistak","watch","becaus","enjoi","realli","offens","genr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,10,11,13,22,38,41,43,52,57,75,77,111,112,116,133,135,141,166,181,192,200,214,276,289,291,342,386,404,437,467,468,525,551,592,603,702,709,903,913,939,1008,1035,1128,1145,1174,2180,2350,2609,2916,3875,4379],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,10,11,13,22,38,41,43,52,57,75,77,111,112,116,133,135,141,166,181,192,200,214,276,289,291,342,386,404,437,467,468,525,551,592,603,702,709,903,913,939,1008,1035,1128,1145,1174,2180,2350,2609,2916,3875,4379],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,1.2979240167361772,1.519311641348122,3.1375198335242067,1.6608112036218214,1.7122153074726136,1.834162586674748,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.2466628996789315,2.3212364753796515,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,2.4423870329693536,2.4442286541160034,2.5318267134339894,2.5308211829319704,2.7303758068497004,2.7884729505849193,2.8282659991423613,3.016831637578237,2.9705344631698933,3.0433232530252132,3.1419947805322432,3.1952392950510555,3.342254038012865,3.304513710030018,3.4149707055943286,3.528202072035993,3.5227672760500357,3.530930586689197,3.6466665387238555,3.6497387377608255,3.948766986599908,4.067587905068712,3.969732115064953,4.086456389373095,4.2860694432771105,4.315570107673808,4.2574141875167335,4.235066888824737,5.0768550934009715,5.0768550934009715,5.521540914662417,5.482320201509136,5.7959777603641776,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623885E-4,1.948883410303085E-4,1.949364604671859E-4,1.9489727200317498E-4,1.94915716718152E-4,1.9488726647479043E-4,1.9494787912034486E-4,1.9485827042812364E-4,1.9488838221796707E-4,1.950897782428108E-4,1.9663775937540096E-4,1.9488870412317775E-4,1.950732760416882E-4,1.9509359931150203E-4,1.950049733833556E-4,1.9489803967532096E-4,1.9496509213860958E-4,1.9505684337379846E-4,1.9490810142076936E-4,1.9490738881741245E-4,1.950827376426059E-4,1.949269165479168E-4,1.9492721155291208E-4,1.9505208401168577E-4,1.949081717290294E-4,1.950959311615516E-4,1.949569467443741E-4,1.9488790424509778E-4,1.9497625809236218E-4,1.950357676568519E-4,1.949278726959907E-4,1.9503227181974896E-4,1.9512802779626687E-4,1.953091368623548E-4,1.9495660985328913E-4,1.9489792146657028E-4,1.9496819317392055E-4,1.949177151705371E-4,1.9485847840320711E-4,1.9490804106090214E-4,1.9510337222585758E-4,1.9499634574500057E-4,1.950327162646

{"value":"Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point, we only wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. That is fair enough as its target market is, I assume, children under 12.

{"value":"Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted. I will try to tone this one down. Lets be real!!! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character.There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can't hang with the best any more. Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? Chuck is an awesome martial artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a fairly good actor, but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies, and this one does not. Very Disappointing for us Norris fans.

{"value":"I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue, long drawn-out far-away stares and silences, and hack editing, then you're spot on.<br /><br />Complicated story-line? Hardly. Try juvenile and amateurish. Exquisite moods and haunting memories? Hardly. Try flat-out boring and trite.<br /><br />This was awful. I could not wait for it to be over. Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of \"How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes.\" Wow! What depth of character. I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.<br /><br />As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed in this.

{"value":"This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I would have known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I am tired of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It has been several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen

{"value":"There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and \"The Man who Fell to Earth.\" I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. It completely lost me with the \"hillarious\" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn's. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing.

worst.","finished_norm":["there","be","onli","two","movi","i","would","give","a","to","thi","stinker","and","the","man","who","fall","to","earth","i","rememb","see","protocol","at","a","theater","in","the","earli","when","i","be","in","high","school","the","script","be","insult","to","anyon","includ","a","high","school","student","intellig","it","complet","lose","me","with","the","hillari","gag","of","someon","get","shoot","in","the","butt","goldi","hawn","be","suppos","to","be","charm","but","come","across","a","vapid","and","moron","then","there","be","offens","stereotyp","about","arab","follow","by","goldi","win","over","everyon","by","spout","populist","dribbl","the","act","be","terribl","includ","goldi","hawn","i","can","not","stand","to","see","anoth","movi","she","be","in","until","imo","she","redeem","herself","in","everyon","sai","i","love","you","thi","be","the","kind","of","movi","you","make","if","you","want","to","put","no","effort","into","screenplai","write","the","wrong"],"filtered":["onli","two","movi","give","thi","stinker","man","fall","earth","rememb","see","protocol","theater","earli","high","school","script","insult","anyon","includ","high","school","student","intellig","complet","lose","hillari","gag","someon","get","shoot","butt","goldi","hawn","suppos","charm","come","across","vapid","moron","offens","stereotyp","arab","follow","goldi","win","everyon","spout","populist","dribbl","act","terribl","includ","goldi","hawn","stand","see","anoth","movi","imo","redeem","everyon","sai","love","thi","kind","movi","make","want","put","effort","screenplai","write","wrong"],"filtered2":["onli","two","give","stinker","man","fall","earth","rememb","see","protocol","theater","earli","high","school","script","insult","anyon","includ","high","school","student","intellig","complet","lose","hillari","gag","someon","get","shoot","butt","goldi","hawn","suppos","charm","come","across","vapid","moron","offens","stereotyp","arab","follow","goldi","win","everyon","spout","populist","dribbl","act","terribl","includ","goldi","hawn","stand","see","anoth","imo","redeem","everyon","love","kind","make","want","put","effort","screenplai","write","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,11,21,25,30,34,37,45,47,54,65,73,77,103,117,122,139,149,158,159,166,169,211,221,246,260,266,290,296,301,377,401,424,489,503,522,603,604,626,634,703,709,797,998,1145,1387,1929,2436,2855,3749,3923,3943,4163,5392,6313,6736,7049],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,11,21,25,30,34,37,45,47,54,65,73,77,103,117,122,139,149,158,159,166,169,211,221,246,260,266,290,296,301,377,401,424,489,503,522,603,604,626,634,703,709,797,998,1145,1387,1929,2436,2855,3749,3923,3943,4163,5392,6313,6736,7049],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,2.2489347673732487,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.3106972614914807,2.300267965194495,2.4423870329693536,2.4071371113909277,5.137432284239405,2.6423424573643777,5.34629845801427,2.6754694156628323,2.747702973022204,2.8612813773965557,5.900913137266729,5.661952055802453,3.0602441305135506,3.0879275592619675,3.212973749990824,3.3956930001684253,3.3490645070153917,3.604618302480356,3.530930586689197,3.5727776966246974,3.6528204042982337,3.5119855004467477,3.6746621462132825,3.6497387377608255,3.7987743169213135,4.135246553542527,4.2574141875167335,4.422928625994308,4.8184434032493035,5.116075806554253,5.7959777603641776,5.719991853386255,18.89420911248424,5.7959777603641776,12.596139408322827,6.214688095222362,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8071558619128732E-4,1.8055544497422914E-4,1.8060002550835126E-4,1.805637191263484E-4,1.8058080734056632E-4,1.8055444944597594E-4,1.806106043864474E-4,1.8052758588871676E-4,1.8055548313277665E-4,1.8074206765953416E-4,1.8217620335957355E-4,1.805557813637444E-4,1.8072677909865365E-4,1.8074560771100248E-4,1.8066349970080478E-4,1.8056443034070418E-4,1.8062655148803238E-4,1.8071155495724396E-4,1.8057375210370474E-4,1.8057309190815113E-4,1.8073554485423878E-4,1.8059118348844736E-4,1.8059145679755304E-4,1.8070714561833993E-4,1.80573817241204E-4,1.8074776806713814E-4,1.806190051398368E-4,1.8055504031201249E-4,1.806368962512835E-4,1.8069202923584206E-4,1.805920693174304E-4,1.8068879049708354E-4,1.8077750418235444E-4,1.8094529373735552E-4,1.80618693025118E-4,1.8056432082551478E-4,1.8062942446035846E-4,1.8058265881848307E-4,1.8052777856845088E-4,1.8057369618

I thought Belushi was ridiculously silly - very unbelievable as an \"eccentric\" hit man. idk, I could go on - again, I am shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that kept me watching it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either! \"live by the sword, die by the sword...\" ridiculous.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","believ","the","posit","review","of","thi","movi","i","think","it","be","on","of","the","wrong","much","poorli","execut","and","poorli","act","movi","i","have","ever","see","and","the","plot","be","complet","ludicr","sp","she","start","make","out","with","him","while","he","tie","to","the","chair","puhleas","the","wrong","part","be","that","it","be","not","even","bad","in","a","good","laughabl","wai","just","plain","terribl","i","can","not","figur","out","why","thei","even","bother","to","show","it","on","hbo","i","think","belushi","be","ridicul","silli","veri","unbeliev","a","a","eccentr","hit","man","idk","i","can","go","on","again","i","be","shock","by","the","posit","review","the","onli","thing","that","keep","me","watch","it","be","that","it","fascin","to","see","how","a","movi","can","go","wrong","and","what","make","it","bad","and","the","end","do","not","disappoint","in","it","silli","either","live","by","the","sword","die","by","the","sword","ridicul"],"filtered":["ca","believ","posit","review","thi","movi","think","wrong","much","poorli","execut","poorli","act","movi","ever","see","plot","complet","ludicr","sp","start","make","tie","chair","puhleas","wrong","part","even","bad","good","laughabl","wai","plain","terribl","figur","thei","even","bother","show","hbo","think","belushi","ridicul","silli","veri","unbeliev","eccentr","hit","man","idk","go","shock","posit","review","onli","thing","keep","watch","fascin","see","movi","go","wrong","make","bad","end","disappoint","silli","either","live","sword","die","sword","ridicul"],"filtered2":["ca","believ","posit","review","think","wrong","poorli","execut","poorli","act","ever","see","plot","complet","ludicr","sp","start","make","tie","chair","puhleas","wrong","part","even","bad","good","laughabl","wai","plain","terribl","figur","even","bother","show","hbo","think","belushi","ridicul","silli","veri","unbeliev","eccentr","hit","man","idk","go","shock","posit","review","onli","thing","keep","watch","fascin","see","go","wrong","make","bad","end","disappoint","silli","either","live","sword","die","sword","ridicul"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,15,21,24,25,28,29,32,33,44,45,61,71,81,91,103,116,134,166,176,187,207,274,293,385,388,398,415,496,508,509,552,571,586,662,1175,1257,1394,1942,2034,3462,3506,5443,8220],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,9,11,12,15,21,24,25,28,29,32,33,44,45,61,71,81,91,103,116,134,166,176,187,207,274,293,385,388,398,415,496,508,509,552,571,586,662,1175,1257,1394,1942,2034,3462,3506,5443,8220],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,3.838916364248105,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.8818517047392527,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.2443961816702407,2.4423870329693536,5.008094298653827,2.4732161909892554,2.5531798379045583,5.497904384845272,2.9012296278682137,6.18993968377476,3.0914425013694116,6.287696698363132,3.1588018988486244,3.293679367864308,3.4149707055943286,6.721038771980316,3.424750734647968,3.467417180966871,3.4572130107926293,3.616452760127359,4.263079925052412,4.34596758485818,4.403125998698128,10.153710186801943,4.956227105612356,5.626901430320244,5.649374286172302,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8341338219946432E-4,1.8325085032897535E-4,1.8329609637950106E-4,1.8325924800101357E-4,1.8327659131506583E-4,1.8324983993907017E-4,1.8330683318340595E-4,1.8322257535166705E-4,1.832508890571692E-4,1.8344025899387438E-4,1.848958040568154E-4,1.8325119174025055E-4,1.8342474219911885E-4,1.834438518926755E-4,1.8336051814059895E-4,1.8325996983266742E-4,1.8332301834983027E-4,1.8340929078551426E-4,1.8326943075474962E-4,1.832687607035274E-4,1.8343363881348005E-4,1.832871223623162E-4,1.8328739975149175E-4,1.8340481562219993E-4,1.8326949686464804E-4,1.8344604449948903E-4,1.8331535934666966E-4,1.8325043962579598E-4,1.833335175439282E-4,1.833894735761762E-4,1.832880214153158E-4,1.8338618648820398E-4,1.8347622452756653E-4,1.8364651891350793E-4,1.8331504257257503E-4,1.832598586825906E-4,1.833259342110595E-4,1.832784704326004E-4,1.8322277090780287E-4,1.832693739991893E-4,1.834530412308184E-4,1.8335240568986673E-4,1.8338660439372627E-4,1.8323188988465938E-4,1.832694205999484E-4,1.832597897698867E-4,1.8332182154716717E-4,1.8335360978015674E-4,1.8331632585969986E-4,1.8328726989817707E-4,1.83260242957265E-4,1.8363571343408224E-4,1.8330635651333502E-4,1.832

{"value":"Ah yes the 1980s , a time of Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . At the time I couldn`t believe how movies like RAMBO , MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR ( And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up .

{"value":"This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this film, I saw it for John Candy and assumed, incorrectly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat, unfunny moments. And, to top it off, Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time. So, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, though teens will probably find a few laughs. It's really a shame--it could have been so much better.

{"value":"What can possibly said about this movie other than, \"viewer beware\". Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. I am rarely this unsatisfied with a \"b\" horror flick, but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old. The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like, like nothing can stop their maniacal rage, but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus, it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he's far too stupid to be dangerous.

{"value":"The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Thankfully, highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (rated lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, don't let the cover of this movie decieve you. Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using such high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the movie, including brief cameos by Denise Richards, a gay negro, and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl, Koji carries this movie on his own.

{"value":"You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good, and it isn't. It's a no budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I've ever seen. It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs.

{"value":"I always felt that a good film should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to finally end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it felt like four hours. Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that it was until I saw \"The Fast And The Furious\". So, don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action. I actually hate most action films out today; it's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum. Not much really happens in this movie.

{"value":"The Poverty Row horror pictures of the 1930s and '40s depress the hell out of me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but the ones produced in that period have such a dreary, shabby look about them--and, in the final analysis, just aren't very good. \"The Corpse Vanishes\" is slightly more entertaining than bottom-of-the-barrel dreck like \"The Invisible Ghost\" and \"The Ape Man\", but it's no classic. Bela Lugosi, long past his \"Dracula\" heyday, plays yet another mad doctor; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a doubtful young female reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum.

{"value":"Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers none, and seems like an exercise in boredom. The only mildly suspenseful moment is the movie's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100-plus minutes, and is resolved too simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness.

{"value":"Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate reclusive one-time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good. Might've been entitled \"Bancroft Talks\" as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic/dramatic/sentimental material for its duration. Hot-or-cold director Sidney Lumet can't get a consistent rhythm going, and Bancroft's constant overacting isn't scaled back at all by the filmmaker--he keeps her right upfront: cute, teary-eyed and ranting. Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario (not that the thinly-conceived plot has much going on besides). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming. *1/2 from

{"value":"I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the entire experience for me. Her acting was so appalling that I sat there with my jaw hanging open, not believing my eyes or ears. I could barely make it through one viewing, THAT'S how hideous she is in this.<br /><br />Cary? Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. The supporting cast does alright, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance.<br /><br />Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness, a deadness, a cluelessness that simply defies belief. Who told this creature she could ACT??

{"value":"What a horrible movie. I cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re-make. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this film? Mehki Pfifer is great in E.R and Ving Rhames probably didn't know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The music background i must say did not fit AT ALLLLL with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film. I hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was, could ever distroy such a great classic film. This film should not have been made in the first place.
