{"value":"I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off Inspector Gadget's Field Trip. I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.<br /><br />But the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget. First thing- in the film, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain, and the awesome book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came from.<br /><br />Another thing is that it's too much \"Good Guy v. Bad Guy\" in the film. It's not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon. Also, Gadget never should have a love story, but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots.<br /><br />Also I miss the true gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie it was a chic convertible. In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van. It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.<br /><br />But if anything, the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie. Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon. The movie was too serious, too overdone, had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny.<br /><br />Tip for those who haven't seen it: NEVER see it. EVER. Watch the cartoon, it's a true classic.","finished_norm":["i","grow","up","watch","inspector","gadget","it","be","and","still","be","on","of","my","favorit","cartoon","if","not","my","absolut","favorit","i","learn","a","lot","of","geographi","and","histori","from","the","spinoff","inspector","gadget","field","trip","i","want","to","slip","on","a","banana","peel","and","becom","the","great","detect","everbr","br","but","the","film","have","ruin","the","reput","of","the","wonder","cartoonbr","br","matthew","broderick","a","actor","with","potenti","be","definit","not","the","role","for","inspector","gadget","thing","in","the","film","inspector","gadget","be","smart","not","so","in","the","cartoon","in","the","film","gadget","solv","the","mysteri","mostli","by","himself","in","the","cartoon","it","be","almost","alwai","penni","brain","and","the","awesom","book","i","still","want","her","book","if","gadget","solv","the","mysteri","it","be","by","accid","gadget","in","the","film","seem","to","be","a","compet","detect","but","in","the","cartoon","be","pretti","dumb","which","be","where","the","humor","come","frombr","br","anoth","thing","be","that","it","too","much","good","gui","v","bad","gui","in","the","film","it","not","just","mean","to","be","a","silli","saturdai","morn","cartoon","conjur","gadget","never","should","have","a","love","stori","but","disnei","corpor","be","fill","with","idiotsbr","br","conjur","i","miss","the","true","gadget","that","gadget","have","and","especi","the","gadget","car","in","the","movi","it","be","a","chic","convert","in","the","cartoon","it","be","a","sedan","polic","car","and","can","turn","into","a","van","it","conjur","bare","have","ani","gadget","and","be","mainli","there","to","get","him","from","place","to","placebr","br","but","if","anyth","the","on","thing","that","be","terribl","about","the","movi","be","that","it","be","a","featur","movi","inspector","gadget","be","a","silli","saturdai","morn","cartoon","the","movi","be","too","seriou","too","overdo","have","too","much","of","a","plot","and","be","not","even","remot","a","funnybr","br","tip","for","that","who","have","not","see","it","never","see","it","ever","watch","the","cartoon","it","a","true","classic"],"filtered":["grow","watch","inspector","gadget","still","favorit","cartoon","absolut","favorit","learn","lot","geographi","histori","spinoff","inspector","gadget","field","trip","want","slip","banana","peel","becom","great","detect","everbr","br","film","ruin","reput","wonder","cartoonbr","br","matthew","broderick","actor","potenti","definit","role","inspector","gadget","thing","film","inspector","gadget","smart","cartoon","film","gadget","solv","mysteri","mostli","cartoon","almost","alwai","penni","brain","awesom","book","still","want","book","gadget","solv","mysteri","accid","gadget","film","seem","compet","detect","cartoon","pretti","dumb","humor","come","frombr","br","anoth","thing","much","good","gui","v","bad","gui","film","mean","silli","saturdai","morn","cartoon","conjur","gadget","never","love","stori","disnei","corpor","fill","idiotsbr","br","conjur","miss","true","gadget","gadget","especi","gadget","car","movi","chic","convert","cartoon","sedan","polic","car","turn","van","conjur","bare","ani","gadget","mainli","get","place","placebr","br","anyth","thing","terribl","movi","featur","movi","inspector","gadget","silli","saturdai","morn","cartoon","movi","seriou","overdo","much","plot","even","remot","funnybr","br","tip","see","never","see","ever","watch","cartoon","true","classic"],"filtered2":["grow","watch","inspector","gadget","still","favorit","cartoon","absolut","favorit","learn","lot","geographi","histori","spinoff","inspector","gadget","field","trip","want","slip","banana","peel","becom","great","detect","everbr","ruin","reput","wonder","cartoonbr","matthew","broderick","actor","potenti","definit","role","inspector","gadget","thing","inspector","gadget","smart","cartoon","gadget","solv","mysteri","mostli","cartoon","almost","alwai","penni","brain","awesom","book","still","want","book","gadget","solv","mysteri","accid","gadget","seem","compet","detect","cartoon","pretti","dumb","humor","come","frombr","anoth","thing","good","gui","v","bad","gui","mean","silli","saturdai","morn","cartoon","conjur","gadget","never","love","stori","disnei","corpor","fill","idiotsbr","conjur","miss","true","gadget","gadget","especi","gadget","car","chic","convert","cartoon","sedan","polic","car","turn","van","conjur","bare","ani","gadget","mainli","get","place","placebr","anyth","thing","terribl","featur","inspector","gadget","silli","saturdai","morn","cartoon","seriou","overdo","plot","even","remot","funnybr","tip","see","never","see","ever","watch","cartoon","true","classic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,9,17,27,29,32,34,35,37,39,41,42,44,51,54,55,64,72,73,78,88,96,104,115,128,131,151,164,166,175,197,222,255,267,284,304,305,332,369,385,392,403,420,430,471,493,499,510,547,553,561,589,653,673,710,818,822,841,883,1043,1063,1119,

{"value":"This is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie. On one hand the imagery, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly \"expensive\" look and feel. Even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot.<br /><br />In this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all.<br /><br />So 50% of the dialog consists of \"What the hell was that ?\", \"What was that ?\" and \"What the hell was that ?\". In none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though. In most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them.<br /><br />The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with. That way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to. I mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this:<br /><br />Ben: Is this real, huh ? Emily: Stop it. Ben: A mass psychosis, huh ? Jon: Somebody has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can't be controlled. Not by you, not by anybody. Emily: Not by you either. Ben: No<br /><br />Got me goosebumps.

{"value":"Even if one didn't realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film's release, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful viewing. It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmer's famous Oriental villain but it lacks any focus. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental overtones of Rohmer's concept are ignored. Indeed, the movie employs racist insults. There are hardly any actual jokes or gags, just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines. It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs. Most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well.<br /><br />And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith. Sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad; he conveys a quirky warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment. But most of the time, he plays both roles with a weary grimness, thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities. Sellers' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating; he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny. <br /><br />A few genuinely witty lines, an apt slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk (Cato in the PINK PANTHER films) as one of Manchu's minions, and Helen Mirren's amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess.

{"value":"Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit \"Love, American Style,\" decked out with flashes of nudity, \"Superchick\" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the \"lay\" in \"layover.\" What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Disappointingly, buxom '70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and I suppose that is something. Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillson's body double, however; don't think I've ever seen THAT

{"value":"Not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller \"The Sentinel\". The Sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me, not delivering the consistent action, a couple of critics promised on the back. To me it seemed like everyone was Halfassing it, and only there to make some quick cash, because this felt very much like a made for TV film. The Sentinel is a rehash of several better films, like \"In The Line Of Fire\" this does not have any originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas run around, felt kinda silly in my opinion. The Main problem besides it's unoriginality, had to be the poor pace. I often got distracted while trying to view this movie, while looking how much run time was left, more then once. Not only the miscasting with Eva Longoria, who couldn't convince worth a lick.<br /><br />Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a dependable actor, here is obviously going through the motions. He does not convince as a man on a run, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger, was also off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is only OK, nothing more then that. He tries to come across as a gruff, but managed to be more bland then anything else, and to be honest, he didn't seem that interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role, and was pure eye candy. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady. She looks bored to tears, and her role is a throw away, more then anything else. Martin Donovan has a big part in the end, but not enough to matter for me.<br /><br />Bottom line. The Sentinel is yet, another political thriller, that bored me to tears.

{"value":"1 How is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes? Did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth, in different time frames (Attilla the Hun wasn't a contemporary of preliterate Hellenic cultures, nor were the Vikings contemporary to the Pyramid builders) speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day English(except for the inflections they \"do not\" use), which has been influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /><br />2 Cultural differences can't be overcome so easily, trust has to be won, yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders. Of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods. The people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like.<br /><br />3 Historical background: none. Visually it might vaguely remind you of Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part. A small-town theater group probably has better props.<br /><br />4 Boring! Another lame Canuck production, which inexplicably ran for ten long years. As a kids show it could make the grade, but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1, like I just did. I very much wanted to believe I had found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes!","finished_norm":["how","be","it","that","everyon","can","understand","each","other","perfectli","without","devic","like","univers","translat","or","translat","microb","do","the","creator","of","thi","show","realiz","that","peopl","who","be","take","from","differ","part","of","the","earth","in","differ","time","frame","attilla","the","hun","be","not","a","contemporari","of","preliter","hellen","cultur","nor","be","the","vike","contemporari","to","the","pyramid","builder","speak","differ","languag","and","can","never","develop","a","languag","so","similar","to","modern","dai","englishexcept","for","the","inflect","thei","do","not","us","which","have","be","influenc","by","latin","ancient","greek","danish","and","french","br","br","cultur","differ","ca","not","be","overcom","so","easili","trust","have","to","be","win","yet","everywher","the","team","arriv","thei","be","welcom","without","ani","suspicion","and","start","order","peopl","around","like","thei","be","their","appoint","leader","of","cours","real","fan","would","comment","that","thei","be","perceiv","a","god","the","peopl","thei","meet","should","be","shock","by","their","technologi","and","accus","them","of","witchcraft","and","the","likebr","br","histor","background","none","visual","it","mai","vagu","remind","you","of","greek","or","vike","cultur","but","anyon","can","dress","in","a","bunch","of","tablecloth","or","run","to","a","local","costum","rental","for","a","plastic","helmet","with","horn","and","claim","to","look","the","part","a","smalltown","theater","group","probabl","have","well","propsbr","br","bore","anoth","lame","canuck","product","which","inexplic","run","for","ten","long","year","a","a","kid","show","it","can","make","the","grade","but","anyon","who","have","a","littl","knowledg","about","human","behavior","and","languag","can","not","bear","to","even","watch","the","twelv","episod","of","season","like","i","just","do","i","veri","much","want","to","believ","i","have","find","a","decent","scifi","show","otherwis","i","would","shut","it","of","and","cleans","my","comput","of","thi","refug","after","the","five","minut"],"filtered":["everyon","understand","perfectli","without","devic","like","univers","translat","translat","microb","creator","thi","show","realiz","peopl","take","differ","part","earth","differ","time","frame","attilla","hun","contemporari","preliter","hellen","cultur","vike","contemporari","pyramid","builder","speak","differ","languag","never","develop","languag","similar","modern","dai","englishexcept","inflect","thei","us","influenc","latin","ancient","greek","danish","french","br","br","cultur","differ","ca","overcom","easili","trust","win","yet","everywher","team","arriv","thei","welcom","without","ani","suspicion","start","order","peopl","around","like","thei","appoint","leader","cours","real","fan","comment","thei","perceiv","god","peopl","thei","meet","shock","technologi","accus","witchcraft","likebr","br","histor","background","none","visual","mai","vagu","remind","greek","vike","cultur","anyon","dress","bunch","tablecloth","run","local","costum","rental","plastic","helmet","horn","claim","look","part","smalltown","theater","group","probabl","well","propsbr","br","bore","anoth","lame","canuck","product","inexplic","run","ten","long","year","kid","show","make","grade","anyon","littl","knowledg","human","behavior","languag","bear","even","watch","twelv","episod","season","like","veri","much","want","believ","find","decent","scifi","show","otherwis","shut","cleans","comput","thi","refug","five","minut"],"filtered2":["everyon","understand","perfectli","without","devic","like","univers","translat","translat","microb","creator","show","realiz","peopl","take","differ","part","earth","differ","time","frame","attilla","hun","contemporari","preliter","hellen","cultur","vike","contemporari","pyramid","builder","speak","differ","languag","never","develop","languag","similar","modern","dai","englishexcept","inflect","us","influenc","latin","ancient","greek","danish","french","cultur","differ","ca","overcom","easili","trust","win","yet","everywher","team","arriv","welcom","without","ani","suspicion","start","order","peopl","around","like","appoint","leader","cours","real","fan","comment","perceiv","god","peopl","meet","shock","technologi","accus","witchcraft","likebr","histor","background","none","visual","mai","vagu","remind","greek","vike","cultur","anyon","dress","bunch","tablecloth","run","local","costum","rental","plastic","helmet","horn","claim","look","part","smalltown","theater","group","probabl","well","propsbr","bore","anoth","lame","canuck","product","inexplic","run","ten","long","year","kid","show","make","grade","anyon","littl","knowledg","human","behavior","languag","bear","even","watch","twelv","season","like","veri","want","believ","find","decent","scifi","show","otherwis","shut","cleans","comput","refug","five","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,8,14,15,16,20,23,27,28,31

{"value":"Kill Me Later\" has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to \"kill her later.\"<br /><br />The actual execution of this premise, however, falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion. Shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around. Lack of character depth especially diminishes Selma Blair's performance, whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting \"cool\" and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt. This is unfortunate, as under other circumstances Ms. Blair is an appealing and capable actress.<br /><br />Compounding matters for the worse is director Dana Lustig's insistence on using rapid cuts, incongruous special effects (e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end), and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd. Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction, but in no way does her skill help overcome the film's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.<br /><br />The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig)can be commended for their ability to realize this film: they were able to scare up $1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is no small feat for an independent film.

{"value":"Celia Johnson is good as the Nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet, though it's his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence though he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his \"yuk\" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is sympathetic.<br /><br />The sets are pretty, if not stunning as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare's.<br /><br />And that's it. The rest is weak to dreadful. Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production, and hasn't a clue about how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes real wide and whines every line in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly matched to her, and his self-regard is inexplicable. The Balcony Scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their deaths come as a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered it to them hours earlier.<br /><br />Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio, a great shock if you remember his fine work in \"Brideshead Revisited.\" He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each, and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. Awful.<br /><br />The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening brawl is notably incoherent. However there is humor when in a later fight, Romeo apparently knees Tybalt right in the cobblers. Tybalt then grabs the offended region.

{"value":"Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy, reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist, who, both living in the Big Apple, develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site. This in itself is not so unusual, but what is, is their method of communication. Foregoing the verbal, they take to writing notes and later communicating through video.<br /><br />The film is based upon the creator's (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice) own relationship, who besides writing and directing, take to acting as the lead characters as well. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot, and docudrama, the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self-indulgence.<br /><br />As the movie wears on, a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality. Focusing solely on inner conflict, or the woes of relationship, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original, nor poignant. This could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict, and a third act, to which there is none - just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere.<br /><br />What is even more aggravating is the film's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish. This would have been all fine and dandy, but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered.<br /><br />(On a side note, the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of the production.)<br /><br />But as always, watch the film and decide for yourself.","finished_norm":["four","ey","monster","follow","the","relationship","of","a","shy","reclus","videograph","and","a","equal","estrang","struggl","artist","who","both","live","in","the","big","appl","develop","a","unlik","romanc","with","the","help","of","a","internet","date","site","thi","in","itself","be","not","so","unusu","but","what","be","be","their","method","of","commun","forego","the","verbal","thei","take","to","write","note","and","late","commun","through","videobr","br","the","film","be","base","upon","the","creator","arin","crumlei","susan","buic","own","relationship","who","besid","write","and","direct","take","to","act","a","the","lead","charact","a","good","with","elem","of","avantgard","antiplot","and","docudrama","the","film","scatter","itself","to","the","wind","with","a","undecid","structur","nestl","neatli","between","narciss","and","selfindulgencebr","br","a","the","movi","wear","on","a","brief","separ","and","deterior","of","their","onc","intrigu","form","of","commun","grow","old","a","the","coupl","face","the","hardship","of","realiti","focu","sole","on","inner","conflict","or","the","woe","of","relationship","the","film","struggl","through","a","stagnant","narr","that","be","neither","origin","nor","poignant","thi","can","have","be","easili","circumv","with","the","addit","of","subplot","and","extern","conflict","and","a","act","to","which","there","be","none","just","a","montag","of","melodrama","that","lead","nowherebr","br","what","be","even","much","aggrav","be","the","film","descent","from","stori","into","realiti","that","abruptli","conclud","with","a","open","end","and","unsatisfi","finish","thi","would","have","be","all","fine","and","dandi","but","there","be","no","question","ask","and","no","mean","to","be","discov","or","ponderedbr","br","on","a","side","note","the","film","contain","beauti","anim","and","a","vivid","and","move","soundtrack","on","of","the","much","interest","aspect","of","the","productionbr","br","but","a","alwai","watch","the","film","and","decid","for","yourself"],"filtered":["four","ey","monster","follow","relationship","shy","reclus","videograph","equal","estrang","struggl","artist","live","big","appl","develop","unlik","romanc","help","internet","date","site","thi","unusu","method","commun","forego","verbal","thei","take","write","note","late","commun","videobr","br","film","base","upon","creator","arin","crumlei","susan","buic","relationship","besid","write","direct","take","act","lead","charact","good","elem","avantgard","antiplot","docudrama","film","scatter","wind","undecid","structur","nestl","neatli","narciss","selfindulgencebr","br","movi","wear","brief","separ","deterior","onc","intrigu","form","commun","grow","old","coupl","face","hardship","realiti","focu","sole","inner","conflict","woe","relationship","film","struggl","stagnant","narr","neither","origin","poignant","thi","easili","circumv","addit","subplot","extern","conflict","act","none","montag","melodrama","lead","nowherebr","br","even","much","aggrav","film","descent","stori","realiti","abruptli","conclud","open","end","unsatisfi","finish","thi","fine","dandi","question","ask","mean","discov","ponderedbr","br","side","note","film","contain","beauti","anim","vivid","move","soundtrack","much","interest","aspect","productionbr","br","alwai","watch","film","decid"],"filtered2":["four","ey","monster","follow","relationship","shy","reclus","videograph","equal","estrang","struggl","artist","live","big","appl","develop","unlik","romanc","help","internet","date","site","unusu","method","commun","forego","verbal","take","write","note","late","commun","videobr","base","upon","creator","arin","crumlei","susan","buic","relationship","besid","write","direct","take","act","lead","charact","good","elem","avantgard","antiplot","docudrama","scatter","wind","undecid","structur","nestl","neatli","narciss","selfindulgencebr","wear","brief","separ","deterior","onc","intrigu","form","commun","grow","old","coupl","face","hardship","realiti","focu","sole","inner","conflict","woe","relationship","struggl","stagnant","narr","neither","origin","poignant","easili","circumv","addit","subplot","extern","conflict","act","none","montag","melodrama","lead","nowherebr","even","aggrav","descent","stori","realiti","abruptli","conclud","open","end","unsatisfi","finish","fine","dandi","question","ask","mean","discov","ponderedbr","side","note","contain","beauti","anim","vivid","move","soundtrack","interest","aspect","productionbr","alwai","watch","decid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,10,17,21,24,31,60,65,67,69,82,88,102,116,150,157,185,197,236,242,249,251,253,260,275,277,281,306,320,325,334,370,378,413,425,464,479,514,560,561,573,577,583,606,615,619,630,645,647,656,690,711,718,724,782,796,842,892,906,972,1009,1017,1061,1185,1186,1198,1331,1409,1466,1510,1614,1790,2060,2080,2135,2347,2356,2601,2650,2724,2755,3111,3724,4031,4050,4412,4580,4685,4874,5053,5423,5443,5486,6914,7267,7282,7655,7785,8

{"value":"This movie has some of the most awesome cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely the hottest women, but I would have to say it is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />Here is the plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you have the acting as well.<br /><br />Beginning, bring in characters, hot woman singing (obvious lip sync). Music agent or producer comes in, thinks that she is awesome asks her to race. She turns down, too many bad memories. Flash to war hero, back from war, has several fights, and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone. Drive off in fast exotic car. Brother races, then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut away to getting weapons from friend. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but seems to really care about him) Are you sure you want to do this; Yes; I mean are you really sure; Yes, give me weapons; are you REALLY sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can't talk you out of it, be careful man, I love you.<br /><br />Now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove. Finds woman, decides to rescue her, She drives off, and he doesn't finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yeah, need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter, but maybe it adds a little plot. Race is not even that exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and one that should win throws in a surprise ending.<br /><br />OK, I just saved you $7.00. You can send all of your money to me, because I should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does. Don't get me wrong, the cars are awesome, and Nadija is beautiful, but it is truly an awful

{"value":"I've said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, still no one will give a damn.<br /><br />The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco (which I love), and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making. However, it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie, he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film. (SPOILER) For crying out loud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain. As far as action goes, well let's see, Sky Captain (Law) shoots down ONE robot, two or three of the flapping wing airplanes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down!!!), and a couple robots, but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie (the reviewer who comments on hers and Law's lack of chemistry is so right) and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera, showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT, both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie, one uncomically, one quite funny, although I saw it coming from 70 years away. No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen, and that's the movie's real flaw. An audience doesn't identify with robots, they need a hero to root for, and a visible, despicable villain to hate. Without that, plus a good engaging story, all the CG in the world won't help.","finished_norm":["i","have","sai","thi","in","other","review","without","a","stori","you","can","give","the","audienc","all","the","smoke","and","mirror","you","want","still","no","on","will","give","a","damnbr","br","the","director","seem","to","have","a","great","ey","for","art","deco","which","i","love","and","i","think","the","idea","of","us","all","digit","background","and","such","can","ind","be","the","wave","of","the","futur","in","movi","make","howev","it","obviou","the","director","get","so","interest","in","the","digit","render","of","hi","movi","he","forget","to","film","mani","scene","which","would","have","enorm","help","thi","surprisingli","thinnedplot","film","spoiler","for","cry","out","loud","thei","forget","to","have","a","villain","in","thi","thing","okai","thei","have","on","but","he","be","dead","for","year","by","the","time","the","movi","take","place","conran","miss","the","point","of","have","a","villain","a","far","a","action","go","good","let","see","sky","captain","law","shoot","down","on","robot","two","or","three","of","the","flap","wing","airplan","befor","dex","ribisi","tell","him","to","stop","shoot","them","down","and","a","coupl","robot","but","mostli","spend","hi","time","look","dash","and","get","other","to","fight","hi","battl","for","him","paltrow","a","polli","or","peggi","or","punki","or","whatev","be","total","wast","in","thi","movi","the","review","who","comment","on","her","and","law","lack","of","chemistri","be","so","right","and","i","for","on","get","a","littl","sick","of","see","repeat","shot","of","the","top","of","her","camera","show","she","onli","have","two","shot","leav","both","of","which","she","wast","subsequ","in","the","movi","on","uncom","on","quit","funni","although","i","see","it","come","from","year","awai","no","on","except","law","and","paltrow","have","ani","signific","time","on","screen","and","that","the","movi","real","flaw","a","audienc","doe","not","identifi","with","robot","thei","ne","a","hero","to","root","for","and","a","visibl","despic","villain","to","hate","without","that","plu","a","good","engag","stori","all","the","cg","in","the","world","wo","not","help"],"filtered":["sai","thi","review","without","stori","give","audienc","smoke","mirror","want","still","give","damnbr","br","director","seem","great","ey","art","deco","love","think","idea","us","digit","background","ind","wave","futur","movi","make","howev","obviou","director","get","interest","digit","render","hi","movi","forget","film","mani","scene","enorm","help","thi","surprisingli","thinnedplot","film","spoiler","cry","loud","thei","forget","villain","thi","thing","okai","thei","dead","year","time","movi","take","place","conran","miss","point","villain","far","action","go","good","let","see","sky","captain","law","shoot","robot","two","three","flap","wing","airplan","befor","dex","ribisi","tell","stop","shoot","coupl","robot","mostli","spend","hi","time","look","dash","get","fight","hi","battl","paltrow","polli","peggi","punki","whatev","total","wast","thi","movi","review","comment","law","lack","chemistri","right","get","littl","sick","see","repeat","shot","top","camera","show","onli","two","shot","leav","wast","subsequ","movi","uncom","quit","funni","although","see","come","year","awai","except","law","paltrow","ani","signific","time","screen","movi","real","flaw","audienc","doe","identifi","robot","thei","ne","hero","root","visibl","despic","villain","hate","without","plu","good","engag","stori","cg","world","wo","help"],"filtered2":["review","without","stori","give","audienc","smoke","mirror","want","still","give","damnbr","director","seem","great","ey","art","deco","love","think","idea","us","digit","background","ind","wave","futur","make","howev","obviou","director","get","interest","digit","render","forget","mani","scene","enorm","help","surprisingli","thinnedplot","spoiler","cry","loud","forget","villain","thing","okai","dead","year","time","take","place","conran","miss","point","villain","far","action","go","good","let","see","sky","captain","law","shoot","robot","two","three","flap","wing","airplan","befor","dex","ribisi","tell","stop","shoot","coupl","robot","mostli","spend","time","look","dash","get","fight","battl","paltrow","polli","peggi","punki","whatev","total","wast","review","comment","law","lack","chemistri","right","get","littl","sick","see","repeat","shot","top","camera","show","onli","two","shot","leav","wast","subsequ","uncom","quit","funni","although","see","come","year","awai","except","law","paltrow","ani","signific","time","screen","real","flaw","audienc","doe","identifi","robot","ne","hero","root","visibl","despic","villain","hate","without","plu","good","engag","stori","cg","world","wo","help"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,8,11,12,14,16,17,18,19,27,28,29,30,31,34,35,37,47,50,51,54,56,57,58,60,62,64,66,74,79,80,89,90,101,110,113,117,120,121,123,124,125,129,155,164,165,168,176,183,184,185,191,192,224,228,231,232,2

{"value":"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But \"the last great American Western\", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Not even close.<br /><br />A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There's so many instances of this that it's distracting. Cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often. <br /><br />If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br /><br />Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.<br /><br />3 out of

{"value":"*** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I'll make this review short and sweet. I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison's Police Force. LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T. (First Response Assault Tactics). He's teamed with an \"on-the-edge\" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs. I don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.<br /><br />You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance are pretty lackluster. The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J is terrible in this film. He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion. He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film. The ending is far from satisfying.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film.

{"value":"Bah. Another tired, desultory reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed.<br /><br />On the plus side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. There are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the filmwork, score and editing is competent, apart from a bizarre lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion.<br /><br />But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared ages. Worse, they are all speaking \"Austinese\", that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in Austen's day (think Yosemite Sam, I kid you not). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial \"Fakespearan\" that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs.<br /><br />And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She's only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart.<br /><br />In short, there is very little reason to watch Emma. It's an amiable enough adaptation, but if you're going to pack a film full of anacronisms (i.e. an appalingly thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent) then you might as well do it

{"value":"It seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays. It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. Problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds. The video store shelves are filled with these so called films. These aren't even guilty pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. However, some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some, like 'Nightmare Weekend,' didn't deserve any form of release at all. <br /><br />Pros: The cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. Some unintentional hilarity. Moves at a good pace (Should at 81 minutes).<br /><br />Cons: Awful writing, which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes. Poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't make out at all. Doesn't make a lick of sense. Badly scored. Cheap and very dated effects. Total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody. This is supposed to be a horror film, but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding.<br /><br />Final thoughts: I never expected this to be some forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be this bad. I don't know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a definite contender. Troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release. Don't make the same mistake I did and let your curiosity get the best of you.<br /><br />My rating:

{"value":"I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's 'Sunday Post' comics page.) In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him. I'll give Chase credit that his very best films -- such as 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Wooden Wedding' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but I'm positive that even the most die-hard Chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'Married to Order' just isn't funny at all.<br /><br />Chase -- eager, awkward, gormless, naff -- is a young swain hoping to court the fair Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who disdains Chase as a 'mollycoddle'. Leo White, who did more notable work as a foil for Chaplin at Essanay, is on hand here as a rival.<br /><br />There's some action involving an Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product-placement? <br /><br />Sadly, a major flaw in 'Married to Order' is the casting of Rosemary Theby as Rose: she's meant to be a standard-issue ingenue, but Theby -- flat-chested, hawk-faced -- is physically wrong for the role. Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but was never a believable ingenue. Film historian William K Everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books.<br /><br />I'll rate 'Married to Order' just 3 out of 10, and I'm being charitable ... because I keep suspecting that Charley Chase has got something that everyone else gets but I keep

{"value":"I never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke I watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed.<br /><br />For starters I'd like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more the whores. Are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? This is not the only right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of cash. A fine example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film. Money is depicted as the only important thing to young people.<br /><br />The manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. Any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs.<br /><br />And finally, why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father. She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend. I find this most strange.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascistic, degrading to women and frankly, disturbing.

{"value":"Somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed, zombie-like killers. The \"guinea pigs\" for the experiment are scantily-clad, nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons. This movie is awful, atrocious, and amazingly bad. It has little to no logic in the script. You really will have trouble following what is going on. It has no special effects. The computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old Atari screen. And what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair(looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it) named George that is like a personal servant/confidant to Jessica(the leading \"actress\"). Throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterings of this puppet. But wait...you also get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. All the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place. None of the actors are good. There are just varying degrees of bad. The gore and \"horror\" aspects are especially ineptly filmed. The film really looks like an adolescent put it together. No coincidence Henry Sala, the director by name but not by trade, has not made another film. I was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid, silly, dreck! And how bout the ending? What happened?

{"value":"It's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film. An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in \"Rabbit Test.\" So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I'd like to suggest this word: <br /><br />\"Hubiriffic\" (adj.) A combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film \"Rabbit Test.\"<br /><br />Joan Rivers and \"Hollywood Squares\" producer Jay Redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. Trying to put together an Airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags, (Note to Joan: German doctors haven't been funny since Vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the Catskills - that's is bad enough. But compounding this cinematic crime is River's directorial style, which can best be described as 'ugly', and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags.<br /><br />Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist Lionel. Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.<br /><br />I can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test.

{"value":"This movie was great the first time I saw it, when it was called \"Lost in Translation.\" But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in Translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 Items that verges on annoying. Instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in Translation, we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about. How can a character that wears hundred dollar T-shirts and has never been inside a Target department store expect to give advice to a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Don't think that stops him. If he isn't giving her clothing advice, he's telling her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand, be it washing the car, stopping at Arby's, or just laying around to list off their 10 Items or Less lists of things they love and hate. I kept wanting to yell at them saying, \"Didn't you say you had somewhere to be? What the heck are doing? A minute ago you were practically late, now you're eating roast beef and pondering your lives!\" Until I saw this movie, I never truly understood how something could \"insist upon itself,\" but I think this movie does exactly that, and undeservedly so. The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympatheticwith the exception that I felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","great","the","time","i","see","it","when","it","be","call","lose","in","translat","but","somehow","bill","murrai","turn","into","a","eccentr","black","man","plai","by","morgan","freeman","scarlett","johansson","turn","into","a","cranki","latino","woman","plai","by","paz","vega","and","tokyo","japan","turn","into","carson","california","instead","of","meaning","convers","and","silenc","we","enjoi","in","translat","we","get","meaningless","blabber","in","item","that","verg","on","annoi","instead","of","charact","that","be","pensiv","and","introspect","a","in","translat","we","get","charact","that","spew","pointless","advic","on","topic","thei","have","no","clue","about","how","can","a","charact","that","wear","hundr","dollar","tshirt","and","have","never","be","insid","a","target","depart","store","expect","to","give","advic","to","a","workingclass","woman","on","how","to","prepar","for","a","job","interview","a","a","administr","assist","do","not","think","that","stop","him","if","he","be","not","give","her","cloth","advic","he","tell","her","what","she","should","eat","the","much","annoi","part","of","the","movi","for","me","be","how","supposedli","thei","be","in","a","hurri","to","make","a","appoint","and","yet","the","charact","keep","find","time","to","run","anoth","errand","be","it","wash","the","car","stop","at","arbi","or","just","lai","around","to","list","off","their","item","or","littl","list","of","thing","thei","love","and","hate","i","keep","want","to","yell","at","them","sai","do","not","you","sai","you","have","somewher","to","be","what","the","heck","be","do","a","minut","ago","you","be","practic","late","now","you","re","eat","roast","beef","and","ponder","your","live","until","i","see","thi","movi","i","never","truli","understand","how","someth","can","insist","upon","itself","but","i","think","thi","movi","doe","exactli","that","and","undeservedli","so","the","dialogu","make","the","charact","cheesi","and","unsympatheticwith","the","except","that","i","feel","sorri","for","both","of","the","actor","for","have","sign","onto","thi","project"],"filtered":["thi","movi","great","time","see","call","lose","translat","somehow","bill","murrai","turn","eccentr","black","man","plai","morgan","freeman","scarlett","johansson","turn","cranki","latino","woman","plai","paz","vega","tokyo","japan","turn","carson","california","instead","meaning","convers","silenc","enjoi","translat","get","meaningless","blabber","item","verg","annoi","instead","charact","pensiv","introspect","translat","get","charact","spew","pointless","advic","topic","thei","clue","charact","wear","hundr","dollar","tshirt","never","insid","target","depart","store","expect","give","advic","workingclass","woman","prepar","job","interview","administr","assist","think","stop","give","cloth","advic","tell","eat","much","annoi","part","movi","supposedli","thei","hurri","make","appoint","yet","charact","keep","find","time","run","anoth","errand","wash","car","stop","arbi","lai","around","list","item","littl","list","thing","thei","love","hate","keep","want","yell","sai","sai","somewher","heck","minut","ago","practic","late","re","eat","roast","beef","ponder","live","see","thi","movi","never","truli","understand","someth","insist","upon","think","thi","movi","doe","exactli","undeservedli","dialogu","make","charact","cheesi","unsympatheticwith","except","feel","sorri","actor","sign","onto","thi","project"],"filtered2":["great","time","see","call","lose","translat","somehow","bill","murrai","turn","eccentr","black","man","plai","morgan","freeman","scarlett","johansson","turn","cranki","latino","woman","plai","paz","vega","tokyo","japan","turn","carson","california","instead","meaning","convers","silenc","enjoi","translat","get","meaningless","blabber","item","verg","annoi","instead","charact","pensiv","introspect","translat","get","charact","spew","pointless","advic","topic","clue","charact","wear","hundr","dollar","tshirt","never","insid","target","depart","store","expect","give","advic","workingclass","woman","prepar","job","interview","administr","assist","think","stop","give","cloth","advic","tell","eat","annoi","part","supposedli","hurri","make","appoint","yet","charact","keep","find","time","run","anoth","errand","wash","car","stop","arbi","lai","around","list","item","littl","list","thing","love","hate","keep","want","yell","somewher","heck","minut","ago","practic","late","re","eat","roast","beef","ponder","live","see","never","truli","understand","someth","insist","upon","think","doe","exactli","undeservedli","dialogu","make","charact","cheesi","unsympatheticwith","except","feel","sorri","actor","sign","onto","project"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,8,10,12,14,18,29,30,37,38,40,41,42,43,45,51,53,54,59,61,68,70,73,90,96,98,116,130,134,137,142,150,152,194,200,212,221,229,233,248,271,284,289,315,339,343,437,462,514,534,543,549,599,602,610,630,660,722,793,804,876,879,891,917,94

{"value":"This is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong. To cast Liev Schrieber as Hitler's longtime friend and aid, Haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. A J-W playing a Nazi supporter, bad bad bad casting. This was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background. This was Hollywood rubbish at its finest, cashing in on the strength of a strong (but sorely under utilized) supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years.<br /><br />The fake German accents (vee vill vin zis var) is insulting to German people everywhere. My mother is German and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from American/English/German all in the same sentence. The supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen. Jenna Malone as the fated Geli Raubal, was splendid though, she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in Hitler's shadow.<br /><br />If you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler's early years leading up to and including the war/holocaust, rent \"Inside the Third Reich\" 1983 starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler. It was good and made more sense then this baloney.<br /><br />As a historical researcher of the Third Reich I can honestly tell you, this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies.","finished_norm":["thi","be","by","far","on","of","the","much","bore","and","horribli","act","account","of","the","earli","dai","of","adolf","hitler","that","i","have","ever","watch","robert","carlyl","be","a","wonder","actor","but","to","cast","him","a","hitler","be","just","plain","wrong","to","cast","liev","schrieber","a","hitler","longtim","friend","and","aid","haefengst","must","have","emit","cry","of","despair","and","anguish","from","the","simon","wiesenth","centr","a","jw","plai","a","nazi","support","bad","bad","bad","cast","thi","be","not","a","enjoy","famili","film","with","a","good","histor","background","thi","be","hollywood","rubbish","at","it","fine","cash","in","on","the","strength","of","a","strong","but","sore","under","util","support","cast","of","actor","whom","seem","to","have","all","but","disappear","from","the","act","radar","in","the","past","yearsbr","br","the","fake","german","accent","vee","vill","vin","zi","var","be","insult","to","german","peopl","everywher","my","mother","be","german","and","she","sit","fume","at","the","sound","of","the","voic","which","keep","switch","from","americanenglishgerman","all","in","the","same","sentenc","the","support","cast","make","well","cardboard","cutout","at","the","local","video","store","than","thei","do","on","screen","jenna","malon","a","the","fate","geli","raubal","be","splendid","though","she","captur","the","innoc","and","confus","of","thi","tragic","young","woman","who","ultim","end","her","own","life","to","escap","what","her","futur","would","have","be","like","in","hitler","shadowbr","br","if","you","would","like","a","tremend","fantast","and","histor","accur","account","of","hitler","earli","year","lead","up","to","and","includ","the","warholocaust","rend","insid","the","reich","star","rutger","hauer","a","albert","speer","and","derek","jacobi","a","hitler","it","be","good","and","make","much","sens","then","thi","baloneybr","br","a","a","histor","research","of","the","reich","i","can","honestli","tell","you","thi","have","me","reach","for","my","book","to","confirm","it","myriad","of","inaccuraci"],"filtered":["thi","far","much","bore","horribli","act","account","earli","dai","adolf","hitler","ever","watch","robert","carlyl","wonder","actor","cast","hitler","plain","wrong","cast","liev","schrieber","hitler","longtim","friend","aid","haefengst","must","emit","cry","despair","anguish","simon","wiesenth","centr","jw","plai","nazi","support","bad","bad","bad","cast","thi","enjoy","famili","film","good","histor","background","thi","hollywood","rubbish","fine","cash","strength","strong","sore","util","support","cast","actor","seem","disappear","act","radar","past","yearsbr","br","fake","german","accent","vee","vill","vin","zi","var","insult","german","peopl","everywher","mother","german","sit","fume","sound","voic","keep","switch","americanenglishgerman","sentenc","support","cast","make","well","cardboard","cutout","local","video","store","thei","screen","jenna","malon","fate","geli","raubal","splendid","though","captur","innoc","confus","thi","tragic","young","woman","ultim","end","life","escap","futur","like","hitler","shadowbr","br","like","tremend","fantast","histor","accur","account","hitler","earli","year","lead","includ","warholocaust","rend","insid","reich","star","rutger","hauer","albert","speer","derek","jacobi","hitler","good","make","much","sens","thi","baloneybr","br","histor","research","reich","honestli","tell","thi","reach","book","confirm","myriad","inaccuraci"],"filtered2":["far","bore","horribli","act","account","earli","dai","adolf","hitler","ever","watch","robert","carlyl","wonder","actor","cast","hitler","plain","wrong","cast","liev","schrieber","hitler","longtim","friend","aid","haefengst","must","emit","cry","despair","anguish","simon","wiesenth","centr","jw","plai","nazi","support","bad","bad","bad","cast","enjoy","famili","good","histor","background","hollywood","rubbish","fine","cash","strength","strong","sore","util","support","cast","actor","seem","disappear","act","radar","past","yearsbr","fake","german","accent","vee","vill","vin","zi","var","insult","german","peopl","everywher","mother","german","sit","fume","sound","voic","keep","switch","americanenglishgerman","sentenc","support","cast","make","well","cardboard","cutout","local","video","store","screen","jenna","malon","fate","geli","raubal","splendid","though","captur","innoc","confus","tragic","young","woman","ultim","end","life","escap","futur","like","hitler","shadowbr","like","tremend","fantast","histor","accur","account","hitler","earli","year","lead","includ","warholocaust","rend","insid","reich","star","rutger","hauer","albert","speer","derek","jacobi","hitler","good","make","sens","baloneybr","histor","research","reich","honestli","tell","reach","book","confirm","myriad","inaccuraci"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,9,20,21,23,24,25,35,40,41,44,57,70,75,86,90,92,100,101,108,132,134,135,141,151,157,161,173,175

{"value":"This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee film I've seen. I say pretty much, because I have also seen Soldier, in which he plays the villain... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This, however, is. And if this is any indication of the quality of such films, I won't be seeing any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead, he's awful. He gets in a fight with random no-name characters every few minutes of the film, probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane, he barely seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it's the other way around. I can't say for sure... and I definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure. The effects are not completely horrible... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of using a time-machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws up that interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I can't think of one positive thing to say about this film... I really can't. It's simply too formulaic and pointless. If only I had a time-machine, so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no, never mind. I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to fans of Lee, and no one else.

{"value":"Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully, one is a romantic. When things are show unbearably grim, they are realistic. And when something gets the ironic treatment, they're spot on. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second catagory. This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish \"Ken Loach\" type movie, without being able to capture the comedy, and warmth between the characters, that elevate Loach movies from merely being 'depressing'. Los Lunes al Sol, is just that, only depressing. Things are unrealistically grim. The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point, and if the glum story isn't enough, Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette. The films was ridiculously over-rated at the Goyas. A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed harbour workers, does not automatically make for a good movie, even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people. This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate. In 21st century Spain, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms, and it's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class Spain, and does it no favours. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch a football match for free, has been directly copied from a film which deals much more 'realistically' with the subject of the 'poverty' trap, namely \"Purely Belter,\" which is afar more engaging, humorous, and yet

{"value":"You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me: \"Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life.\" This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around Miss Millie's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife Sophia's real name, \"Oprah,\" backwards. Spielberg isn't above such \"cuteness.\"<br /><br />It's not that Spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion. Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.","finished_norm":["you","mai","consid","a","coupl","of","fact","in","the","discuss","to","be","spoilersbr","br","i","be","sorri","but","spielberg","do","not","deserv","to","win","ani","oscar","for","thi","piec","and","i","think","the","academi","be","right","in","that","vote","other","oscar","for","well","actor","nomin","and","such","that","i","do","not","know","about","but","it","would","be","hard","to","justifi","give","what","thei","be","tell","to","do","and","what","you","see","in","the","final","product","the","wai","spielberg","direct","thi","be","so","contriv","so","meddlesom","while","watch","thi","movi","a","distinct","make","dure","a","film","a","art","cours","i","have","take","be","scream","at","me","sentim","be","honest","emot","honestli","render","sentiment","be","sugari","and","unreal","a","fals","view","of","life","thi","be","overthetop","sentiment","when","in","real","life","to","two","peopl","ever","begin","to","read","out","loud","in","synchron","a","celi","and","shug","averi","do","when","sit","on","the","bed","go","over","the","letter","from","netti","thei","have","find","there","be","exampl","of","thi","typ","of","faux","behavior","throughout","the","film","all","the","man","crowd","around","miss","milli","car","and","then","jump","in","unison","like","a","flock","of","bird","take","off","when","she","go","to","drive","awai","harpo","fall","through","the","roof","of","variou","build","he","work","on","a","cheap","slapstick","gag","the","whole","troop","of","revel","head","from","the","jook","joint","en","mass","to","the","chapel","a","if","magic","entranc","by","the","choir","sing","on","and","on","noth","ring","true","i","even","wonder","if","harpo","name","be","choos","purposefulli","becaus","it","hi","wife","sophia","real","name","oprah","backward","spielberg","be","not","abov","such","cutenessbr","br","it","not","that","spielberg","be","incap","of","honestli","render","action","and","emot","schindler","list","be","amaz","deepli","touch","for","me","and","i","greatli","admir","save","privat","ryan","too","for","it","realism","even","if","the","stori","be","a","bite","contriv"],"filtered":["mai","consid","coupl","fact","discuss","spoilersbr","br","sorri","spielberg","deserv","win","ani","oscar","thi","piec","think","academi","right","vote","oscar","well","actor","nomin","know","hard","justifi","give","thei","tell","see","final","product","wai","spielberg","direct","thi","contriv","meddlesom","watch","thi","movi","distinct","make","dure","film","art","cours","take","scream","sentim","honest","emot","honestli","render","sentiment","sugari","unreal","fals","view","life","thi","overthetop","sentiment","real","life","two","peopl","ever","begin","read","loud","synchron","celi","shug","averi","sit","bed","go","letter","netti","thei","find","exampl","thi","typ","faux","behavior","throughout","film","man","crowd","around","miss","milli","car","jump","unison","like","flock","bird","take","go","drive","awai","harpo","fall","roof","variou","build","work","cheap","slapstick","gag","whole","troop","revel","head","jook","joint","en","mass","chapel","magic","entranc","choir","sing","noth","ring","true","even","wonder","harpo","name","choos","purposefulli","becaus","hi","wife","sophia","real","name","oprah","backward","spielberg","abov","cutenessbr","br","spielberg","incap","honestli","render","action","emot","schindler","list","amaz","deepli","touch","greatli","admir","save","privat","ryan","realism","even","stori","bite","contriv"],"filtered2":["mai","consid","coupl","fact","discuss","spoilersbr","sorri","spielberg","deserv","win","ani","oscar","piec","think","academi","right","vote","oscar","well","actor","nomin","know","hard","justifi","give","tell","see","final","product","wai","spielberg","direct","contriv","meddlesom","watch","distinct","make","dure","art","cours","take","scream","sentim","honest","emot","honestli","render","sentiment","sugari","unreal","fals","view","life","overthetop","sentiment","real","life","two","peopl","ever","begin","read","loud","synchron","celi","shug","averi","sit","bed","go","letter","netti","find","exampl","typ","faux","behavior","throughout","man","crowd","around","miss","milli","car","jump","unison","like","flock","bird","take","go","drive","awai","harpo","fall","roof","variou","build","work","cheap","slapstick","gag","whole","troop","revel","head","jook","joint","en","mass","chapel","magic","entranc","choir","sing","noth","ring","true","even","wonder","harpo","name","choos","purposefulli","becaus","wife","sophia","real","name","oprah","backward","spielberg","abov","cutenessbr","spielberg","incap","honestli","render","action","emot","schindler","list","amaz","deepli","touch","greatli","admir","save","privat","ryan","realism","even","stori","bite","contriv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,12,17,20,22,23,26,27,30,31,33,38,41,44,45,46,47,48,49,75,80,90,97,98,102,111,121,129,143,145,147,154,155,156,170,171,175,189,190,199,208,218,2

{"value":"In 1993, \"the visitors\" was an enormous hit in France. So, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. <br /><br />This is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. Indeed, it's supposed to tell a sole story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard... Instead of this, the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. As a consequence, the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed, sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying. Then, why did Jean-Marie Poiré the film-maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role? He made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful. The other actors aren't better: Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable.<br /><br /> Of course, the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. Certain sequences and dialogs are affected. It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie.

{"value":"I can't figure Al Pacino out. I watch him in the Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in Two for the Money, Any Given Sunday and Revolution, and I wonder what the guy is thinking.<br /><br />I stumbled on Revolution a few nights ago, and thought I would invest the next two hours on this. Here is a news flash: Want to get prisoners to talk? Force them to watch this over and over...they'll confess to anything.<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot, but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved, but ultimately does. While he has no money, no education and dresses like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.<br /><br />Quite frankly, if \"Al Smith\" starred in this movie, instead of \"Al Pacino\", it would have ruined their career. The script was horrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was laughable. I really can't describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character, but has like 5 lines in the movie. In fact, nobody speaks much in this movie.<br /><br />One of the most laughable premise in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield.

{"value":"In 1993, \"the visitors\" was an enormous hit in France. So, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. <br /><br />This is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. Indeed, it's supposed to tell a sole story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard... Instead of this, the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. As a consequence, the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed, sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying. Then, why did Jean-Marie Poiré the film-maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role? He made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful. The other actors aren't better: Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable.<br /><br /> Of course, the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. Certain sequences and dialogs are affected. It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie.

{"value":"This film may have been the biggest let-down I've experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. Overall, I simply found this to be a second-rate movie.<br /><br />Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character with cheerful competence. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously phony that I simply could not take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween, complete with the $4.95 stick-on beard.<br /><br />The special effects were so-so, though the \"undead\" in the cellar were pretty good. The tree-tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though the POV shots from the tongue's view more closely resembled Sam Raimi's trademark shots in the more recent \"Evil Dead\" trilogy. The pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get. (In fact, it most closely reminded me of the \"Lost in Space\" episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and....) <br /><br />The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no plot twists. In fact, you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good, who is bad, and who is going to survive.<br /><br />I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was check the production date. Yep, it says 1987...not the 1967 that I thought it might be. And that pretty much sums it up: The production values and FX are typical of the 1960s. The plot and action seem much older, as Hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s.<br /><br />** out of

{"value":"A film with very little positive to say for it.<br /><br />Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.<br /><br />Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. I lost count of how many times I had seen \"that\" field at night or that bit of cracked earth.<br /><br />It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.<br /><br />And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so.<br /><br />There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson  the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on \"medication\".<br /><br />With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window?

{"value":"It was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan the original 1944 movie. That, to me and many others, is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Realizing this is simply a shortened made-for-TV film and that most people had trashed it, I didn't expect much, but you can't help but compare this with the '44 film. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at it, and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb.<br /><br />When it was all over, I found it wasn't as bad as I had expected but it's no match for the 1944 original. The two main areas in which this made-for-TV film wasn't as good were (1) the electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those leads. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as \"Walter Neff\" and \"Phyllis Dietrichson,\" respectively.<br /><br />Where this re-make held its own was in the other characters, such as \"Barton Keyes\" and \"Edward Norton.\" Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines, etc., were all early '70s instead of mid '40s. Otherwise, the storyline was very similar, just rushed.<br /><br />However, one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story

{"value":"This is not an entirely bad movie. The plot (new house built next door seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is creepy enough, and the acting is okay. The big problem I had is that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I couldn't get over how different she looks with her apparently new, big lips. I kept staring at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make her look completely different (and not better).<br /><br />Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a fine job. And Lara (as Col) is also quite good (but those lips!) as the owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriately wooden. The various characters who live in the house were also fine. I particularly liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to move into the house. The attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails, unfortunately, as the other neighbors are not particularly likable.<br /><br />For some reason the director was unable to make the \"haunted\" house particularly ominous. Other movies (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) manage to achieve that spooky feel, but it just doesn't happen here. The closest is when Col paints a depiction of the house.<br /><br />Another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that occurs with Kim, the architect. Initially, he appears to be a victim of the house like the others (it has sucked him dry of inspiration), but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad movie

{"value":"I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names make refer to some other names etc. It might be. I cannot realize such things (I don't want to do anyway) because I am not interested in, I am interested in 'cinema'. As for the movie itself, again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. Yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. As for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. It is like if you don't believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. If you agree with me about this, I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful critique. Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. I don't want to compare The Host with other monster movies, but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way, may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I like Asian cinema too, but this is the
