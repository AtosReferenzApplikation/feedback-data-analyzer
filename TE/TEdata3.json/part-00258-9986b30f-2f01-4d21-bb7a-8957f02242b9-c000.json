{"value":"Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's \"Star 80\" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful \"poodlesque\" hair-do....Very disappointing....\"Paper Moon\" and \"The Last Picture Show\" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so

{"value":"This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down, but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that \"Freddy's Dead\" is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this \"film\" into the ground. However, it doesn't stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that.

{"value":"Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anybody? This steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point; it makes \"The Violent Years\" look like \"Casablanca\"! \"Santa Claus\" also makes Keith Richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission. I've had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating bullets, that will never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being. However, I can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well. Also, if you're looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Don't check out this movie, as I've been notified the MST3K version is now available.

{"value":"Philip. K. Dickian movie. And a decent one for that matter. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But lets face it, the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me. Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending, and I was regrettably right. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. No, not at all. First half (as already many here have commented) is awesome. There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future (we will do such kind on corny sf things because we CAN) or is it simply over combining. But the paranoia is there and feeling \"out of joint\" also.

{"value":"One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) amateurish. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate<br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this

{"value":"i don't know why, but after all the hype on NPR i thought this was a new movie.....all the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs...it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader.......oops,........... James Earl Jones speak, but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film......it has been sanitized for a child audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube ....i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not

stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film, and I would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous, please don't, it's a waste of the film it was printed on.<br /><br />Then again I could be

{"value":"I saw this movie two weeks ago at the \"festival des nouvelles images du Japon\" in Paris. Though i wasn't expecting much from it, i have to say i've been disappointed just like many people in the audience... if i wanted to sum up how i felt, i'd say i've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end. Of course it's silly. But i couldn't help it. The stories are quite different, but the worlds pictured are very much alike. And from this point of view, \"a tree of palme\" definitely can't stand the comparison with Miyazaki's masterworks. Even if it's quite good technically, boredom remains... in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it.

{"value":"This movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by Bollywood. The performances were horrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, goes completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is not memorable either. And in spite trying hard, the female leads don't manage to be \"sexy\". Vivek Oberoi is capable of far better projects while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being. But this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in badly written cliché roles. It's high time for Indra Kumar to hang up his directorial hat. Hope he never directs another eyesore like this. Future of Hindi movies are in better hands now.

{"value":"I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was not it. Thank god they didn't let them use the name \"Sholay\" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash?

{"value":"I'm sorry to all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The acting is bad, even wooden, it over-hypes the fright-factor early on, and doesn't exactly work. I think there was supposed to be a twist at the end, but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing. What the hell? The dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted? Try again.<br /><br />Its hardly original, and it isn't even particularly good as a straight slasher. And that's saying something.<br /><br />I think whoever did the castings, whoever wrote the script, and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie. If someone puts this on at a party, throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie, like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.","finished_norm":["i","be","sorri","to","all","the","fan","but","thi","be","a","useless","movi","the","act","be","bad","even","wooden","it","overhyp","the","frightfactor","earli","on","and","doe","not","exactli","work","i","think","there","be","suppos","to","be","a","twist","at","the","end","but","it","just","end","up","be","maddeningli","confus","what","the","hell","the","dude","who","be","kill","everyon","be","on","of","the","hunt","try","againbr","br","it","hardli","origin","and","it","be","not","even","particularli","good","a","a","straight","slasher","and","that","sai","somethingbr","br","i","think","whoever","do","the","cast","whoever","write","the","script","and","whoever","think","of","the","concept","should","be","mercilessli","fire","and","deportedbr","br","do","not","watch","thi","movi","if","someon","put","thi","on","at","a","parti","throw","the","disc","out","the","window","and","put","on","a","good","horror","movi","like","silenc","of","the","lamb","or","the","shine"],"filtered":["sorri","fan","thi","useless","movi","act","bad","even","wooden","overhyp","frightfactor","earli","doe","exactli","work","think","suppos","twist","end","end","maddeningli","confus","hell","dude","kill","everyon","hunt","try","againbr","br","hardli","origin","even","particularli","good","straight","slasher","sai","somethingbr","br","think","whoever","cast","whoever","write","script","whoever","think","concept","mercilessli","fire","deportedbr","br","watch","thi","movi","someon","put","thi","parti","throw","disc","window","put","good","horror","movi","like","silenc","lamb","shine"],"filtered2":["sorri","fan","useless","act","bad","even","wooden","overhyp","frightfactor","earli","doe","exactli","work","think","suppos","twist","end","end","maddeningli","confus","hell","dude","kill","everyon","hunt","try","againbr","hardli","origin","even","particularli","good","straight","slasher","somethingbr","think","whoever","cast","whoever","write","script","whoever","think","concept","mercilessli","fire","deportedbr","watch","someon","put","parti","throw","disc","window","put","good","horror","like","silenc","lamb","shine"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,9,12,18,21,24,36,48,65,69,76,77,83,92,139,140,149,159,246,266,310,394,427,435,437,462,497,548,551,665,726,731,850,890,1247,1367,1427,1609,1707,1961,2109,2855,3444,3503,6034,7146,7201],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,9,12,18,21,24,36,48,65,69,76,77,83,92,139,140,149,159,246,266,310,394,427,435,437,462,497,548,551,665,726,731,850,890,1247,1367,1427,1609,1707,1961,2109,2855,3444,3503,6034,7146,7201],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,3.200185830788664,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.4680183469605717,1.6955116224012472,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,2.1337665533324026,1.9463902258768238,2.292318797740072,2.0489535369135887,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.3253197803590226,4.60053593038899,2.673149229007135,2.747702973022204,2.854312708080462,3.0967381889441223,3.233054746047873,3.2829611516442836,3.1952392950510555,3.2639531875991072,3.342254038012865,3.459754308221302,3.528202072035993,3.5929222627171646,3.7034641371169887,4.096025840389245,3.9241755834625858,3.8767358583910254,4.390138803171316,4.477736862489302,4.605250182788262,13.864138694154438,4.706176101378222,4.900964426937307,4.933754249760298,5.373120909544144,5.719991853386255,5.626901430320244,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.076728306204418E-5,7.029008272831658E-5,7.083652109648093E-5,7.042722692293873E-5,7.042838079375965E-5,7.032993599168966E-5,7.05391070754649E-5,7.03002040409403E-5,7.045826452708827E-5,7.816959832769028E-5,0.5525942976691517,7.018672401213527E-5,7.149672441043071E-5,7.251664089455178E-5,7.023790343910406E-5,7.004379617880022E-5,7.17909510568805E-5,7.054571605734638E-5,7.032684824809315E-5,7.038513670139011E-5,7.106615418068874E-5,7.061560901054105E-5,7.069601559424135E-5,0.042283384118690856,7.131532276447523E-5,7.094236370321688E-5,7.392464590261777E-5,7.020758988164456E-5,7.020946809909146E-5,7.038734338948487E-5,7.188340989537294E-5,7.054162853550927E-5,0.24192232316698645,7.074005172699201E-5,7.02840076859125E-5,7.060841471307787E-5,7.02135813538267E-5,7.025507241446452E-5,7.004344427310495E-5,7.006161677405982E-5,7.021931695861957E-5,7.095998196209728E-5,7.059940447411876E-5,7.032027416411696E-5,7.117473923052145E-5,7.03472634696045E-5,7.268455370381684E-5,7.161570615527017E-5,7.007903091595277E-5,7.02339098599039E-5,7.020955009388995E-5,7.218551075419359E-5,7.023495480658763E-5,7.005539690347507E-5,7.082435514148763E-5,7.02530454664577E-5,0.15782146210887052,7.01951478

I wish I could SALVAGE the 79 minutes of my life I just wasted. At least the Crook brothers are aptly named. The only good thing about the whole film was watching the Alicia Silverstone wanna-be get punched in the face. How this EVER made it to Sundance is completely baffling to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by slasher film standards. I mean, COME ON! Who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep?

{"value":"This is an abysmal piece of story-telling. It is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about; the characters often mumble inaudibly; actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other; nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl; a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens; the Irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason ... to continue would be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-entertaining element is the landscape photography; but anyone could point a camera at the Australian outback a get memorable shots.

{"value":"The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.<br /><br />Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much). It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.<br /><br />You want a funny Seuss adaptation?

{"value":"This is an atrocious movie. Two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man. There's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a \"spoiler\". I would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick. Much of the film involves Locke and Camp cackling obnoxiously, all the while grinning psychotically at the camera. Add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again, including a vaudevillian song about \"dear old dad\" that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees. The music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen. The theme here is of youth run amok, understandable as a reaction to the '60s, but done with little imagination or style.

{"value":"... and I have seen some bad ones.<br /><br />I have nothing good to say about this movie. The acting is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as to be expected. Daryl Hannah does an OK job, but nothing close to being able to save this movie.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer resorted to the \"stupid heroine trick\" to create a contrived suspense. When all Daryl Hannah would have to do is hide, she runs out in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what passes for a plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed. Lame.

{"value":"Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dull, bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance. Baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing. Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with. Maybe I'm expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting JJ with an actress that at least

{"value":"This \"film\" is one of the most dreadful things I have ever seen.<br /><br />Please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction.<br /><br />Shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as \"direction\", which this film needed in droves. Not that the writing was all the wonderful, rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary \"style\" prized by those who don't know how to direct).<br /><br />This film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making (which is most of them).<br /><br />Just terrible.

{"value":"The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a pretentious student makes a film and can't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the film that he made. I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to artiness, both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa. This movie stumbles to a preposterous end. I have to admit that it had consistency. This movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part. The actors all did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better.

{"value":"Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction!

{"value":"Just utter trash. I'm a huge fan of the Cusacks, this being the sole reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the reprise, in complete and depth less quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, the films' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose. And to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps. Imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the (watch if your a moron) Spartans in terms of

{"value":"Two houses, one street, one phone booth, one car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie. All you need is some blue light, ambient music and...done. Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy though! <br /><br />I like to organize \"bad movie evenings\" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get some booze, get some film-loving friends, and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer. For such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best. Laughs guaranteed!<br /><br />The bizarre thing is, van Rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement. To be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the DVD's commentary track.

{"value":"The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents. This is Bollywood at its best/worst, I honestly cannot tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet, kitschy clichés on every level, story-line, situations, dialog, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you must be a retard to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to walk away from it, because I could not take it any more. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /><br

{"value":"Picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film, throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting, and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is.<br /><br />Shot badly, bad effects, worse acting. Contrived attempt at shocking horror. Everyone I've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it. The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just foul, even before she gets to the guy.<br /><br />I'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate, which is why I picked this one up. But for your own sake, save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence. It's that bad.

{"value":"Ariauna Albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery. What could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner Lilith Stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician. This was a production that cried out for some T & A & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things. However Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation. The Tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & T & A.

{"value":"This piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the Native American Indians played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971 Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from \"The Jimmy Stewart Show\" (a short-lived series that mercifully flopped) just because Williams was black. As if that were not bad enough, this film is very dated and boring. Watch \"Dances with Wolves\" instead for a less racist view.<br /><br />Stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made, and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after 16-year-old Debra Paget.

{"value":"This is a film where the actors are all fine, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion. In other words, it feels like they are contrived movie scenes, not like real life. Even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers, it just doesn't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film. Also, when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film, it feels artificial, the way they look at each other seconds after arguing. Again, the actors are all good, and moments of this film are nice, but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","film","where","the","actor","be","all","fine","especi","brigitt","bako","and","erik","palladino","in","a","film","where","everi","on","of","the","three","coupl","meet","in","a","situat","that","feel","verrrrri","forc","to","be","either","cute","or","to","set","the","stori","in","motion","in","other","word","it","feel","like","thei","be","contriv","movi","scene","not","like","real","life","even","if","woman","who","work","at","peep","parlor","ever","go","out","with","on","of","their","custom","it","just","doe","not","seem","realist","at","all","the","wai","it","be","write","in","thi","film","conjur","when","on","of","the","charact","meet","the","overweight","woman","in","the","film","it","feel","artifici","the","wai","thei","look","at","each","other","second","after","argu","again","the","actor","be","all","good","and","moment","of","thi","film","be","nice","but","overal","yet","anoth","indi","that","can","have","us","some","rewrit","befor","product","get","roll"],"filtered":["thi","film","actor","fine","especi","brigitt","bako","erik","palladino","film","everi","three","coupl","meet","situat","feel","verrrrri","forc","either","cute","set","stori","motion","word","feel","like","thei","contriv","movi","scene","like","real","life","even","woman","work","peep","parlor","ever","go","custom","doe","seem","realist","wai","write","thi","film","conjur","charact","meet","overweight","woman","film","feel","artifici","wai","thei","look","second","argu","actor","good","moment","thi","film","nice","overal","yet","anoth","indi","us","rewrit","befor","product","get","roll"],"filtered2":["actor","fine","especi","brigitt","bako","erik","palladino","everi","three","coupl","meet","situat","feel","verrrrri","forc","either","cute","set","stori","motion","word","feel","like","contriv","scene","like","real","life","even","woman","work","peep","parlor","ever","go","custom","doe","seem","realist","wai","write","conjur","charact","meet","overweight","woman","feel","artifici","wai","look","second","argu","actor","good","moment","nice","overal","yet","anoth","indi","us","rewrit","befor","product","get","roll"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,10,16,17,18,19,33,35,39,41,43,44,48,56,65,70,73,75,79,80,85,109,188,190,194,207,224,253,258,262,267,338,350,412,464,473,795,855,947,958,1021,1181,1811,2072,2442,2629,3392,5675,7100,7626],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,10,16,17,18,19,33,35,39,41,43,44,48,56,65,70,73,75,79,80,85,109,188,190,194,207,224,253,258,262,267,338,350,412,464,473,795,855,947,958,1021,1181,1811,2072,2442,2629,3392,5675,7100,7626],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,3.1375198335242067,4.982433610865464,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.8610609350701788,1.9073850067444174,4.189351572503368,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.011190219103739,2.125691139326857,2.5378812223426954,2.558331832813986,2.5378812223426954,2.5531798379045583,2.689504733779216,2.7073305177318163,2.7061321952397077,2.726701583487816,2.7085302779237206,2.9720957437368454,6.027137983886841,3.107414446935464,3.2872346624216657,3.335489637924323,3.784589681929357,3.9201351739255808,3.9911462095687695,4.067587905068712,4.076977645418551,4.263079925052412,4.798834931860927,5.064116067623542,5.1994574154933035,5.259176650194926,5.604922523601468,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.665273419180246E-5,7.613584688520075E-5,7.672773049546146E-5,7.62843968512508E-5,7.628564668520656E-5,7.61790145959257E-5,7.64055816590017E-5,7.61468099496657E-5,7.631801573723713E-5,8.467067242413542E-5,0.5564343804178372,7.602389220988976E-5,7.744284045796166E-5,7.854757959407669E-5,7.60793280390156E-5,7.586907760145502E-5,7.776153683779423E-5,7.641274028526962E-5,7.617567005620458E-5,7.623880614287767E-5,7.697646130726884E-5,7.648844597483828E-5,7.657553967436956E-5,7.665804122972405E-5,7.724635231333146E-5,7.684237563724521E-5,8.007268312997738E-5,7.604649341598346E-5,7.604852783777391E-5,7.624119635299528E-5,7.786168513322095E-5,7.640831281947858E-5,8.201785113203034E-5,7.662323812812552E-5,7.612926660416614E-5,7.64806533544736E-5,7.60529831765723E-5,7.60979248940552E-5,7.586869642907488E-5,7.588838026919168E-5,7.605919579023492E-5,7.686145914104029E-5,7.647089376752815E-5,7.616854923017061E-5,7.709407697091858E-5,7.619778313558626E-5,7.87294570857519E-5,7.75717174709856E-5,7.590724268035036E-5,7.607500232872042E-5,7.604861665177412E-5,7.81889105943

{"value":"Ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town. There, he will fell in love to Martina, the most beautiful girl in town. They will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of Ulises at the sea. Some years later, Martina has married to Sierra, the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money. One day, the apparition of Ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part. IN addition, three quarters of the film are sexual acts, which, still being well filmed, are quite tiring, as we want to see More development of the story.

{"value":"Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (although I guess it's now called Syfy?) original movie I have ever seen. But I have seen one or two others since, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is done poorly, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place (if you have seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; I didn't want to put a spoiler in my review). Plus, there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence. That was really stupid; they just played it over and over. And it's definitely not original; I know I've heard that somewhere before (I just can't remember where).

{"value":"The filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so filming of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair. With such completely different viewpoints, any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds. The word \"peace\" did not have the same meaning to each of them. Peace to the Palestinian was freedom. Peace to the Israeli was security. With such an abyss, is this sort of film really worth much? I finished with the feeling that I had watched pointless propaganda -- both sides were unconvincing.","finished_norm":["the","film","crow","do","not","have","good","access","to","the","occupi","territori","so","film","of","the","isra","side","domin","i","be","strike","by","the","nearli","complet","opposit","point","of","view","of","the","mother","the","isra","mother","lose","a","child","who","have","the","possibl","of","a","life","of","tremend","happi","the","palestinian","mother","lose","a","child","who","have","onli","the","possibl","of","a","life","of","privat","and","despair","with","such","complet","differ","viewpoint","ani","meet","have","no","real","chanc","of","ani","meet","of","the","mind","the","word","peac","do","not","have","the","same","mean","to","each","of","them","peac","to","the","palestinian","be","freedom","peac","to","the","isra","be","secur","with","such","a","abyss","be","thi","sort","of","film","realli","worth","much","i","finish","with","the","feel","that","i","have","watch","pointless","propaganda","both","side","be","unconvinc"],"filtered":["film","crow","good","access","occupi","territori","film","isra","side","domin","strike","nearli","complet","opposit","point","view","mother","isra","mother","lose","child","possibl","life","tremend","happi","palestinian","mother","lose","child","onli","possibl","life","privat","despair","complet","differ","viewpoint","ani","meet","real","chanc","ani","meet","mind","word","peac","mean","peac","palestinian","freedom","peac","isra","secur","abyss","thi","sort","film","realli","worth","much","finish","feel","watch","pointless","propaganda","side","unconvinc"],"filtered2":["crow","good","access","occupi","territori","isra","side","domin","strike","nearli","complet","opposit","point","view","mother","isra","mother","lose","child","possibl","life","tremend","happi","palestinian","mother","lose","child","onli","possibl","life","privat","despair","complet","differ","viewpoint","ani","meet","real","chanc","ani","meet","mind","word","peac","mean","peac","palestinian","freedom","peac","isra","secur","abyss","sort","realli","worth","finish","feel","watch","pointless","propaganda","side","unconvinc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,11,13,27,43,66,75,80,88,103,180,204,219,221,238,258,269,312,350,397,402,425,486,534,573,605,611,769,1056,1309,1398,1652,1656,1690,2122,2264,2744,2860,3660,3732,4211,4534,4653,5327,5717],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,11,13,27,43,66,75,80,88,103,180,204,219,221,238,258,269,312,350,397,402,425,486,534,573,605,611,769,1056,1309,1398,1652,1656,1690,2122,2264,2744,2860,3660,3732,4211,4534,4653,5327,5717],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,2.600540117735859,1.6608112036218214,1.929723173391612,3.948450049740535,1.9951803900462557,2.0317223413467334,4.197164082437498,5.419462958538709,2.624524614047584,2.5792094178355414,5.284684914728755,2.597304642813496,2.7061321952397077,2.76533567167316,2.8824835850471584,6.027137983886841,9.953015383822589,6.16884985742153,6.453975986731272,3.3066947359763783,3.4272107604888307,3.4623020803001006,3.5474598886404074,3.520060914452293,3.857614816944247,4.100845126825194,4.513582994262438,4.436351646326448,4.646072177308517,4.798834931860927,4.74221603786142,15.230565280202914,5.143104478942172,5.3064295350454715,5.408212229355414,5.695894301807195,5.7959777603641776,19.80105172810304,5.999576715605417,5.999576715605417,6.214688095222362,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.577288438730521E-5,5.539679478924563E-5,5.582745204516569E-5,5.550488043249896E-5,5.550578981747333E-5,5.5428203815484704E-5,5.559305505984202E-5,5.540477156572179E-5,0.031008845508242296,6.160677337732489E-5,0.3895418162879382,5.531533604901187E-5,5.634776936565338E-5,0.33500108208051194,5.535567141501477E-5,5.520269222294701E-5,5.6579654327546317E-5,5.559826370946715E-5,5.5425770312894606E-5,5.547170842194984E-5,5.6008429735743325E-5,5.5653347519800755E-5,5.571671729892261E-5,5.5776745812674574E-5,5.620480368165685E-5,5.591086838126496E-5,5.826125507297497E-5,5.533178079123493E-5,5.533326104595135E-5,5.547344754990081E-5,5.6652522691099325E-5,5.559504226485338E-5,0.14517908135118127,5.575142291477355E-5,5.5392006946290664E-5,5.564767757313472E-5,5.533650277109434E-5,5.5369202572866174E-5,5.520241488015796E-5,5.521673693338552E-5,5.534102309756674E-5,5.592475362700459E-5,5.564057645247522E-5,5.542058916689476E-5,5.609400743730918E-5,5.544185989186142E-5,0.0950849089491859,5.644154087717677E-5,5.523046131109899E-5,5.535252400817104E-5,5.5333325667429215E-5,5.689061345201687E-5,5.535334754820339E-5,5.521183494890884E-5,5.5817863851696296E-5,5.536760510109742E-5,5.9541774229034465E-5,5.5321975000167795E-5,5.522982260249864E-5,5.5493528795472944E-5,5.6043977962164394E-5,5.5489857582890704E-5,5.521960496184404E-5,5.53

{"value":"I'm a Christian. I have always been skeptical about movies made by Christians, however. As a rule, they are \"know-nothings\" when it comes to movie production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a hideous job of it. The acting was horrible, and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion, one COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to get across. Not only was the movie terribly made, but the people who made it even had some facts wrong. However, in this \"critique\", those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into. In short, the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone, except for comic relief from the every day grind.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","christian","i","have","alwai","be","skeptic","about","movi","make","by","christian","howev","a","a","rule","thei","be","knownoth","when","it","come","to","movi","product","i","admir","tbn","for","try","to","present","god","and","jesu","in","a","posit","and","honest","wai","on","the","screen","howev","thei","do","a","hideou","job","of","it","the","act","be","horribl","and","unless","on","be","familiar","with","the","bibl","in","some","fashion","on","can","not","have","understand","what","the","movi","be","try","to","get","across","not","onli","be","the","movi","terribli","make","but","the","peopl","who","make","it","even","have","some","fact","wrong","howev","in","thi","critiqu","that","fact","be","irrelev","and","too","deep","to","delv","into","in","short","the","omega","code","be","the","absolut","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","and","i","would","not","recommend","it","to","anyon","except","for","comic","relief","from","the","everi","dai","grind"],"filtered":["christian","alwai","skeptic","movi","make","christian","howev","rule","thei","knownoth","come","movi","product","admir","tbn","try","present","god","jesu","posit","honest","wai","screen","howev","thei","hideou","job","act","horribl","unless","familiar","bibl","fashion","understand","movi","try","get","across","onli","movi","terribli","make","peopl","make","even","fact","wrong","howev","thi","critiqu","fact","irrelev","deep","delv","short","omega","code","absolut","wrong","movi","ever","see","recommend","anyon","except","comic","relief","everi","dai","grind"],"filtered2":["christian","alwai","skeptic","make","christian","howev","rule","knownoth","come","product","admir","tbn","try","present","god","jesu","posit","honest","wai","screen","howev","hideou","job","act","horribl","unless","familiar","bibl","fashion","understand","try","get","across","onli","terribli","make","peopl","make","even","fact","wrong","howev","critiqu","fact","irrelev","deep","delv","short","omega","code","absolut","wrong","ever","see","recommend","anyon","except","comic","relief","everi","dai","grind"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,11,21,23,25,33,34,36,44,85,97,113,132,158,190,192,197,212,222,230,233,272,289,298,352,411,460,480,503,509,684,834,1037,1064,1095,1103,1141,1153,1273,1289,1748,1823,2159,2298,2858,3770,4935,5282,5967],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,11,21,23,25,33,34,36,44,85,97,113,132,158,190,192,197,212,222,230,233,272,289,298,352,411,460,480,503,509,684,834,1037,1064,1095,1103,1141,1153,1273,1289,1748,1823,2159,2298,2858,3770,4935,5282,5967],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,2.9360366939211433,1.604729392502474,2.011190219103739,4.109111584924517,6.456534769560841,2.253494045787767,2.3106972614914807,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.558331832813986,2.5983793339432615,2.5771019354959765,2.7121382192999195,2.6102777977348763,2.8028805344481915,2.8282659991423613,2.7819920465008363,3.1236456418640466,3.229006157521873,3.216957819005698,3.43462735814388,3.3490645070153917,3.360519385990158,8.260518024062975,3.8240921249056035,4.062925891962901,4.105687751300982,4.1554492608600455,4.160564361526816,4.770124825978496,4.213208095012239,4.409683399244287,4.443131333311827,4.751432692966343,4.979216623837056,5.274680836730892,5.064116067623542,5.373120909544144,5.7446844659766265,6.101359409915359,6.255510089742618,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.919759117084452E-5,6.873097563650328E-5,6.926529343371402E-5,6.886507783034614E-5,6.886620610711297E-5,6.876994491307276E-5,6.897447636480522E-5,6.87408724478933E-5,6.889542698817631E-5,7.643571539020726E-5,0.7573775903420505,6.86299095240741E-5,6.991085275196961E-5,7.090814642840959E-5,0.04221897259142129,6.849015197863629E-5,7.019855314559291E-5,6.898093875259943E-5,6.876692565883849E-5,6.882392121365849E-5,6.948983301744201E-5,6.904928140744811E-5,6.912790448955032E-5,6.920238205331332E-5,6.973347478306355E-5,6.936878834142371E-5,7.228492042196861E-5,6.865031256691045E-5,6.865214912354224E-5,6.882607895511775E-5,7.02889611509493E-5,6.897694189624508E-5,7.40409039701597E-5,6.917096385510705E-5,6.87250353448539E-5,6.904224668698015E-5,6.865617114201228E-5,0.11421133835675161,6.84898078785751E-5,6.850757729457097E-5,6.866177952512948E-5,6.938601580901038E-5,6.903343630448604E-5,6.876049739487775E-5,6.959600953801017E-5,0.08092191385737965,7.107233475704283E-5,7.002719535804333E-5,6.852460517269712E-5,6.867604874069599E-5,6.865222929961087E-5,7.058436109872891E-5,6.867707050937619E-5,6.85014953871805E-5,6.925339733224731E-5,6.869475989
