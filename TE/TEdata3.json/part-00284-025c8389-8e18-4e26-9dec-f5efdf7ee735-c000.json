{"value":"The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release).","finished_norm":["the","have","mark","piznarski","josh","hamilton","julia","stile","jerri","o","connel","jeremi","sisto","jordana","brewster","leonard","robert","bill","smitrovich","anni","corlei","charl","dutton","nbc","miniseri","late","releas","to","videodvd","a","full","length","featur","film","about","the","treacher","a","see","through","the","ey","of","both","a","white","famili","and","a","black","famili","the","film","half","be","drive","by","the","excel","perform","of","dutton","a","reverend","willi","taylor","and","evenli","spread","the","storylin","between","the","famili","howev","dutton","charact","be","kill","halfwai","through","and","the","black","famili","be","complet","forget","in","a","dull","incoher","and","downright","aw","nd","half","rate","out","of","not","rate","late","rate","pg","for","videodvd","releas"],"filtered":["mark","piznarski","josh","hamilton","julia","stile","jerri","o","connel","jeremi","sisto","jordana","brewster","leonard","robert","bill","smitrovich","anni","corlei","charl","dutton","nbc","miniseri","late","releas","videodvd","full","length","featur","film","treacher","see","ey","white","famili","black","famili","film","half","drive","excel","perform","dutton","reverend","willi","taylor","evenli","spread","storylin","famili","howev","dutton","charact","kill","halfwai","black","famili","complet","forget","dull","incoher","downright","aw","nd","half","rate","rate","late","rate","pg","videodvd","releas"],"filtered2":["mark","piznarski","josh","hamilton","julia","stile","jerri","o","connel","jeremi","sisto","jordana","brewster","leonard","robert","bill","smitrovich","anni","corlei","charl","dutton","nbc","miniseri","late","releas","videodvd","full","length","featur","treacher","see","ey","white","famili","black","famili","half","drive","excel","perform","dutton","reverend","willi","taylor","evenli","spread","storylin","famili","howev","dutton","charact","kill","halfwai","black","famili","complet","forget","dull","incoher","downright","aw","nd","half","rate","rate","late","rate","pg","videodvd","releas"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,76,103,105,113,138,150,182,202,206,229,281,305,327,336,359,367,372,461,515,539,580,717,722,994,1224,1396,1431,1538,1557,1615,1651,2019,2482,2545,2579,2783,2838,2915,3050,3113,3147,3177,4542,6252,6309],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,76,103,105,113,138,150,182,202,206,229,281,305,327,336,359,367,372,461,515,539,580,717,722,994,1224,1396,1431,1538,1557,1615,1651,2019,2482,2545,2579,2783,2838,2915,3050,3113,3147,3177,4542,6252,6309],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.1238870241028365,2.1337665533324026,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.1521782565202803,2.2907365189289424,4.665424022293026,10.946118689696315,7.791913928440488,5.194609285626992,5.6865257437877545,2.832333801361687,2.8612813773965557,5.934838391705887,2.9233055795674137,3.2189558216683714,3.0791938792932125,3.0316467233633775,3.358217889001879,3.3956930001684253,3.6105180246075443,3.5039747767006686,3.7398317812878634,3.850067611308864,4.140259095366071,4.5432147918688095,4.409683399244287,4.890269137820559,4.550761997504193,4.550761997504193,5.1994574154933035,4.6295428753573065,5.0768550934009715,5.501738287366237,5.7446844659766265,5.583416318380505,5.482320201509136,5.373120909544144,5.408212229355414,5.907203395474402,5.649374286172302,5.7446844659766265,5.695894301807195,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.155988596824736E-4,2.1540780663323986E-4,2.1546099248468377E-4,2.1541767793321654E-4,2.154380646612074E-4,2.154066189395788E-4,2.1547361338862637E-4,2.153745699479331E-4,2.154078521574777E-4,2.156304528310064E-4,2.1734141771275785E-4,2.1540820795554652E-4,2.156122131408862E-4,2.156346762135927E-4,2.155367190105505E-4,2.1541852643227146E-4,2.1549263873662993E-4,2.1559405030503593E-4,2.1542964756197315E-4,2.1542885992980744E-4,2.1562267093784904E-4,2.1545044370220877E-4,2.1545076976778378E-4,2.155887898376922E-4,2.1542972527287157E-4,2.1563725358021154E-4,2.1548363572753687E-4,2.15407323859649E-4,2.1550498033487075E-4,2.1557075556130381E-4,2.1545150052150501E-4,2.1556689165339268E-4,2.1567272961560584E-4,2.1587290735061628E-4,2.1548326336575624E-4,2.1541839577752028E-4,2.1549606627473253E-4,2.1544027352728249E-4,2.1537479982036326E-4,2.1542958084691703E-4,2.1564547810166157E-4,2.1552718298266575E-4,2.1556738289319743E-4,2.1538551900010986E-4,2.1542963562520202E-4,2.1541831477197857E-4,2.1549123191840142E-4,2.155285983673578E-4,2.1548477184478565E-4,2.1545061712774065E-4,2.1541884748491812E-4,2.1586020571993619E-4,2.1547305307223884E-4,2.1542958624900304E-4,2.1547189913423295E-4,2.1540754425062418E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.15441151424766E-4,2.1541914990540821E-4,2.15407421290

{"value":"I just don't get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane. Someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. I also don't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doesn't the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be? There's one part I do like, when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even at its lamest, I'll always tune in. This episode though - mmm, I wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under $3.","finished_norm":["i","just","do","not","get","some","of","the","big","premis","of","thi","episod","that","miranda","be","so","remark","and","that","there","anyth","so","ugli","it","would","make","you","insan","someon","here","make","the","remark","that","mayb","it","the","frequenc","of","the","light","wave","or","someth","rather","than","it","be","ugli","miranda","be","just","a","jerk","the","episod","be","slow","inconsist","and","wai","too","talki","i","conjur","do","not","quit","understand","why","kolo","be","a","ambassador","why","doe","not","the","feder","just","leav","the","damn","medusan","be","there","on","part","i","do","like","when","kolo","be","speak","through","spock","about","the","loneli","of","the","human","experi","overal","i","love","to","and","even","at","it","lame","i","will","alwai","tune","in","thi","episod","though","mmm","i","would","not","purchas","it","except","for","a","us","copi","under"],"filtered":["get","big","premis","thi","episod","miranda","remark","anyth","ugli","make","insan","someon","make","remark","mayb","frequenc","light","wave","someth","rather","ugli","miranda","jerk","episod","slow","inconsist","wai","talki","conjur","quit","understand","kolo","ambassador","doe","feder","leav","damn","medusan","part","like","kolo","speak","spock","loneli","human","experi","overal","love","even","lame","alwai","tune","thi","episod","though","mmm","purchas","except","us","copi"],"filtered2":["get","big","premis","miranda","remark","anyth","ugli","make","insan","someon","make","remark","mayb","frequenc","light","wave","someth","rather","ugli","miranda","jerk","slow","inconsist","wai","talki","conjur","quit","understand","kolo","ambassador","doe","feder","leav","damn","medusan","part","like","kolo","speak","spock","loneli","human","experi","overal","love","even","lame","alwai","tune","though","mmm","purchas","except","us","copi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,18,33,39,53,54,56,61,74,82,86,104,120,139,160,163,197,212,232,292,333,344,353,373,390,412,484,747,889,895,1228,1285,1389,1804,1918,2157,2377,3914,5669,6793,7186],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,18,33,39,53,54,56,61,74,82,86,104,120,139,160,163,197,212,232,292,333,344,353,373,390,412,484,747,889,895,1228,1285,1389,1804,1918,2157,2377,3914,5669,6793,7186],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.2153159934048174,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,1.9486336368009016,2.020196584395323,2.031112399272319,2.0728240170322856,2.2044500422972613,2.2939035841256437,2.3722295531801256,2.4000574358028657,2.558331832813986,2.5983793339432615,2.6102777977348763,2.9752256367457734,2.948928684455311,2.983093497946387,3.0266839340212486,3.070535816550098,3.132778125427319,3.107414446935464,3.291526514503207,3.7465885637507435,3.9571003681590526,7.990969222334735,8.643152263468039,4.449957298382227,4.449957298382227,4.869215728622727,4.848596441419991,5.014723312293965,5.156897801074508,5.822646007446338,6.342521466732247,6.794506590475304,13.451027437976705]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278283E-4,2.505862069158131E-4,2.5064807858603353E-4,2.505976903047262E-4,2.506214064035924E-4,2.505848252590656E-4,2.5066276061866855E-4,2.5054754232407134E-4,2.505862598746463E-4,2.508452136206051E-4,2.528356166117189E-4,2.5058667377834775E-4,2.5082399519387317E-4,2.5085012672676965E-4,2.5073617206405766E-4,2.505986773727581E-4,2.5068489300962495E-4,2.5080286617253593E-4,2.5061161470196693E-4,2.5061069844103874E-4,2.508361608610074E-4,2.506358070744792E-4,2.5063618639005247E-4,2.5079674661457346E-4,2.5061170510388677E-4,2.508531250049423E-4,2.506744197127899E-4,2.505856453001279E-4,2.5069925012294775E-4,2.507757671478342E-4,2.5063703648367747E-4,2.507712722224067E-4,2.5089439465660816E-4,2.5112726355820133E-4,2.506739865403452E-4,2.505985253806877E-4,2.506888803013838E-4,2.506239760011385E-4,2.5054780973712956E-4,2.506115370916281E-4,2.5086269267877027E-4,2.5072507870075743E-4,2.507718436869292E-4,2.505602794736537E-4,2.506116008157933E-4,2.50598431146074E-4,2.506832564429229E-4,2.507267252329182E-4,2.50675741370145E-4,2.506360088222566E-4,2.505990508567381E-4,2.511124876152885E-4,2.50662108796618E-4,2.506115433759326E-4,2.5066076640818544E-4,2.505859016833081E-4,0.9801944567638063,2.50624997268677E-4,2.5059940266573095E-4,2.50585758642485E-4,2.50786233260484E-4,2.506855613798026E-4,2.5058565389105827E-4,2.5056017738972995E-4,2.505349807961613E-4,2.5076150407809297E-4,2.5059792990114835E-4,2.5071184239933196E-4,2.5078541996925843E-4,2.506716435043773E-4,2.5061187530261986E-4,2.505605058574261E-4,2.5062460386425056E-4,2.5056037090243435E-4,2.505735199054816E-4,2.505605129489129E-4,2.5072

{"value":"The first look on the cover of this picture, it looks like a good rock n roll movie. But don't let the cover fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie is in it. The storyline is just horrible, and so is the acting. Plain and simple: BAD<br /><br />It's not a movie about a roadie, its just a thin love story, so awful that you see right through it. The only good thing about this movie, is the soundtrack.Some good songs, and that is why I give 2 out of 10. If it wasn't for the music, it would of been 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor(at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie isn't even good looking! This movie was a huge disappointment for me, because it makes a lot of good promises.","finished_norm":["the","look","on","the","cover","of","thi","pictur","it","look","like","a","good","rock","n","roll","movi","but","do","not","let","the","cover","fool","you","or","the","fact","that","alic","cooper","and","blondi","be","in","it","the","storylin","be","just","horribl","and","so","be","the","act","plain","and","simpl","badbr","br","it","not","a","movi","about","a","roadi","it","just","a","thin","love","stori","so","aw","that","you","see","right","through","it","the","onli","good","thing","about","thi","movi","be","the","soundtracksom","good","song","and","that","be","why","i","give","out","of","if","it","be","not","for","the","music","it","would","of","be","out","of","meat","loaf","be","a","horribl","actorat","littl","he","be","in","and","the","girl","who","plai","the","groupi","be","not","even","good","look","thi","movi","be","a","huge","disappoint","for","me","becaus","it","make","a","lot","of","good","promis"],"filtered":["look","cover","thi","pictur","look","like","good","rock","n","roll","movi","let","cover","fool","fact","alic","cooper","blondi","storylin","horribl","act","plain","simpl","badbr","br","movi","roadi","thin","love","stori","aw","see","right","onli","good","thing","thi","movi","soundtracksom","good","song","give","music","meat","loaf","horribl","actorat","littl","girl","plai","groupi","even","good","look","thi","movi","huge","disappoint","becaus","make","lot","good","promis"],"filtered2":["look","cover","pictur","look","like","good","rock","n","roll","let","cover","fool","fact","alic","cooper","blondi","storylin","horribl","act","plain","simpl","badbr","roadi","thin","love","stori","aw","see","right","onli","good","thing","soundtracksom","good","song","give","music","meat","loaf","horribl","actorat","littl","girl","plai","groupi","even","good","look","huge","disappoint","becaus","make","lot","good","promis"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,11,14,16,17,21,22,29,30,40,54,72,84,97,118,121,124,138,187,230,311,328,444,491,515,582,586,683,736,795,980,1057,1629,1965,2285,2392,2413],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,11,14,16,17,21,22,29,30,40,54,72,84,97,118,121,124,138,187,230,311,328,444,491,515,582,586,683,736,795,980,1057,1629,1965,2285,2392,2413],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,3.3930723249613526,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,3.589841616087325,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.6284968758320737,1.8113893252729412,1.9209463754160525,2.2212694515902225,2.0545557924622586,2.354379525480895,2.2190595059394194,2.2323930368088845,2.2907365189289424,2.4732161909892554,5.424276438599839,2.9203338091782562,3.1550424959247185,3.2535472664379905,6.73955742280591,3.3956930001684253,3.7099788181381825,3.4572130107926293,3.6105180246075443,3.6841709341823097,3.784589681929357,4.081705786614497,4.181290492043933,4.613282354485526,5.3560264761848435,5.390512652256013,5.2288713006995975,5.243909178064138]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815707E-4,2.4557311712357507E-4,2.456337510232006E-4,2.455843707821273E-4,2.456076124297673E-4,2.4557176310749233E-4,2.4564813933516824E-4,2.455352260343838E-4,2.4557316902294296E-4,2.45826942282727E-4,2.477775075192788E-4,2.455735746463147E-4,2.458061483401666E-4,2.458317570999926E-4,2.4572008215156913E-4,2.455853381034192E-4,2.456698289576876E-4,2.4578544201440586E-4,2.4559801661553753E-4,2.4559711868482137E-4,2.458180706276573E-4,2.456217250087551E-4,2.4562209673594963E-4,2.457794448809532E-4,2.455981052089263E-4,2.458346953962617E-4,2.45659565183867E-4,2.4557256674326424E-4,2.456838988505E-4,2.457588851178834E-4,2.4562292982306926E-4,2.4575448011546105E-4,2.4587513942998134E-4,2.4610334968444515E-4,2.456591406772319E-4,2.455851891520185E-4,2.456737364818812E-4,2.456101306213586E-4,2.4553548809772355E-4,2.455979405578284E-4,2.458440716644708E-4,2.4570921071599195E-4,2.457550401475787E-4,2.4554770837155915E-4,2.4559800300716307E-4,2.4558509680261073E-4,2.4566822513123857E-4,2.4571082430853615E-4,2.4566086040087216E-4,2.4562192272047746E-4,2.455857041156842E-4,2.46088869340917E-4,2.45647500553111E-4,2.455979467164126E-4,2.456461850197629E-4,2.455728179973836E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.456111314579806E-4,2.455860488865799E-4,2.4557267781815653E-4,2.457691418512416E-4,2.4567048395681914E-4,2.455725751623292E-4,2.455476083298703E-4,2.4552291580549033E-4,2.457449073872684E-4,2.4558460558531526E-4,2.456962392127306E-4,2.4576834483027284E-4,2.456568445147525E-4,2.4559827200275715E-4,2.4554793022642235E-4,2.4561074592378666E-4,2.455477979712659E-4,2.455606839225923E-4,2.455479371760408E-4,2.45707332100202E-4,2.4563420173500804E-4,2.455729029385074E-4,2.455966912779257E-4]}}
{"value":"\"A total waste of time\" Just throw in a few explosions, non stop fighting, exotic cars a deranged millionaire, slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a Hugh Hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes, and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie. I really got a laugh out of the \"Dr. Evil\" like heavily fortified compound. The plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent. How many millionaires are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race? Answer: 4 but, didn't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility?

{"value":"Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was

{"value":"There is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film.<br /><br />It was straight up trash. At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack (burlap) of FAIL! The fighting is barely martial, the acting is teetering on the edge of par, and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made. The decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak, and did nothing but frustrate me. I think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using Yumiko Shaku.","finished_norm":["there","be","simpli","no","us","in","try","to","glorifi","ani","part","of","thi","filmbr","br","it","be","straight","up","trash","at","the","veri","begin","you","mai","think","that","you","be","in","for","a","visual","stun","piec","of","cinematographi","and","then","shortli","thereaft","you","be","hit","with","a","larg","sack","burlap","of","fail","the","fight","be","bare","martial","the","act","be","teeter","on","the","edg","of","par","and","the","music","be","not","worth","describ","there","be","onli","enough","of","a","stori","to","have","creat","a","excus","for","thi","film","to","have","be","make","the","decis","that","the","charact","make","and","the","wai","that","thei","deal","with","the","situat","be","weak","and","do","noth","but","frustrat","me","i","think","that","the","onli","reason","thi","film","come","about","be","to","act","a","a","bite","of","fan","servic","by","us","yumiko","shaku"],"filtered":["simpli","us","try","glorifi","ani","part","thi","filmbr","br","straight","trash","veri","begin","mai","think","visual","stun","piec","cinematographi","shortli","thereaft","hit","larg","sack","burlap","fail","fight","bare","martial","act","teeter","edg","par","music","worth","describ","onli","enough","stori","creat","excus","thi","film","make","decis","charact","make","wai","thei","deal","situat","weak","noth","frustrat","think","onli","reason","thi","film","come","act","bite","fan","servic","us","yumiko","shaku"],"filtered2":["simpli","us","try","glorifi","ani","part","filmbr","straight","trash","veri","begin","mai","think","visual","stun","piec","cinematographi","shortli","thereaft","hit","larg","sack","burlap","fail","fight","bare","martial","act","teeter","edg","par","music","worth","describ","onli","enough","stori","creat","excus","make","decis","charact","make","wai","deal","situat","weak","noth","frustrat","think","onli","reason","come","act","bite","fan","servic","us","yumiko","shaku"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,11,12,15,17,21,27,33,34,36,46,49,56,61,93,95,118,140,147,154,201,215,218,219,233,362,379,388,468,473,548,564,566,594,617,629,635,668,671,1366,1386,1483,1552,1556,1632,2135,2983,3717,4397,5966],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,11,12,15,17,21,27,33,34,36,46,49,56,61,93,95,118,140,147,154,201,215,218,219,233,362,379,388,468,473,548,564,566,594,617,629,635,668,671,1366,1386,1483,1552,1556,1632,2135,2983,3717,4397,5966],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.324031090670098,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,3.7221218701403576,1.8818517047392527,2.035389827120098,2.0323326556775485,2.354379525480895,2.317169775997098,2.2844323215331563,2.348499626138016,2.561435818751577,2.605934685587711,2.5940874818617203,2.5792094178355414,2.8377834061292515,3.058539100262467,3.1272886331425473,3.0914425013694116,3.304513710030018,3.335489637924323,3.459754308221302,3.469984576472117,3.439602492783994,3.496027715008137,3.5119855004467477,3.488143311483988,3.587125145032839,3.5813614403160887,3.6466665387238555,4.422928625994308,4.715065048795469,4.5432147918688095,4.597282013139085,4.589376833631972,4.6973654716960676,4.956227105612356,5.408212229355414,5.822646007446338,5.999576715605417,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247365E-4,2.1540780663323992E-4,2.1546099248468382E-4,2.154176779332166E-4,2.1543806466120747E-4,2.1540661893957886E-4,2.1547361338862642E-4,2.1537456994793314E-4,2.1540785215747775E-4,2.1563045283100646E-4,2.173414177127579E-4,2.1540820795554658E-4,2.1561221314088624E-4,2.1563467621359275E-4,2.1553671901055057E-4,2.1541852643227152E-4,2.1549263873662998E-4,2.1559405030503598E-4,2.154296475619732E-4,2.154288599298075E-4,2.156226709378491E-4,2.1545044370220882E-4,2.1545076976778384E-4,2.1558878983769225E-4,2.1542972527287163E-4,2.156372535802116E-4,2.1548363572753692E-4,2.1540732385964907E-4,2.155049803348708E-4,2.1557075556130387E-4,2.1545150052150507E-4,2.1556689165339274E-4,2.156727296156059E-4,2.1587290735061634E-4,2.154832633657563E-4,2.1541839577752034E-4,2.1549606627473255E-4,2.1544027352728254E-4,2.1537479982036332E-4,2.154295808469171E-4,2.1564547810166163E-4,2.155271829826658E-4,2.1556738289319749E-4,2.153855190001099E-4,2.1542963562520208E-4,2.1541831477197863E-4,2.1549123191840148E-4,2.1552859836735785E-4,2.154847718447857E-4,2.154506171277407E-4,2.1541884748491817E-4,2.1586020571993613E-4,2.154730530722389E-4,2.154295862490031E-4,2.15471899134233E-4,2.1540754425062423E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476606E-4,2.1541914990540827E-4,2.1540742129050469E-4,2.1557975239475935E-4,2.1549321327804532E-4

{"value":"\"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow\" was one of the many '50s movies about hot-rodding teens encountering the supernatural. In this case, the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted. With nowhere else to go, they decide on an apparently haunted house. As you may have guessed, once they arrive, some weird things start happening. And there's a twist at the end.<br /><br />There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's nice entertainment nonetheless. My favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot. Well, let me rephrase that: he didn't talk like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird. The movie's pure hokum, but harmless.","finished_norm":["ghost","of","dragstrip","hollow","be","on","of","the","mani","movi","about","hotrod","teen","encount","the","supernatur","in","thi","case","the","teen","ca","not","pai","the","rend","for","their","hangout","and","get","evict","with","nowher","els","to","go","thei","decid","on","a","appar","haunt","hous","a","you","mai","have","guess","onc","thei","arriv","some","weird","thing","start","happen","and","there","a","twist","at","the","endbr","br","there","noth","in","thi","movi","that","you","have","not","see","in","other","movi","but","it","nice","entertain","nonetheless","my","favorit","charact","be","the","foulmouth","parrot","good","let","me","rephras","that","he","do","not","talk","like","a","charact","in","a","quentin","tarantino","movi","but","he","sai","thing","that","we","do","not","expect","out","of","a","bird","the","movi","pure","hokum","but","harmless"],"filtered":["ghost","dragstrip","hollow","mani","movi","hotrod","teen","encount","supernatur","thi","case","teen","ca","pai","rend","hangout","get","evict","nowher","els","go","thei","decid","appar","haunt","hous","mai","guess","onc","thei","arriv","weird","thing","start","happen","twist","endbr","br","noth","thi","movi","see","movi","nice","entertain","nonetheless","favorit","charact","foulmouth","parrot","good","let","rephras","talk","like","charact","quentin","tarantino","movi","sai","thing","expect","bird","movi","pure","hokum","harmless"],"filtered2":["ghost","dragstrip","hollow","mani","hotrod","teen","encount","supernatur","case","teen","ca","pai","rend","hangout","get","evict","nowher","els","go","decid","appar","haunt","hous","mai","guess","onc","arriv","weird","thing","start","happen","twist","endbr","noth","see","nice","entertain","nonetheless","favorit","charact","foulmouth","parrot","good","let","rephras","talk","like","charact","quentin","tarantino","thing","expect","bird","pure","hokum","harmless"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,10,29,46,49,50,71,81,94,124,130,186,195,196,213,236,243,249,262,288,308,322,435,533,625,726,727,799,822,881,1101,1262,1288,1915,2242,2299,2316,2880,3384,4114,4436,7566,7912],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,10,29,46,49,50,71,81,94,124,130,186,195,196,213,236,243,249,262,288,308,322,435,533,625,726,727,799,822,881,1101,1262,1288,1915,2242,2299,2316,2880,3384,4114,4436,7566,7912],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,2.247774048205673,2.6390769554676132,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,2.08112281984698,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,2.571852579609833,2.51289241584188,2.478925055209576,2.8432628718938773,2.617923930016232,2.627841366673578,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.8015621426949333,2.8753661172782943,2.885344817328191,3.2829611516442836,3.424750734647968,3.6194333882654965,3.6466665387238555,4.096025840389245,3.7636829971100436,3.813163054373413,8.17291277874619,4.229557233013768,4.528289141652134,4.403125998698128,4.85885294158718,5.014723312293965,5.259176650194926,5.185068678041204,5.3560264761848435,5.695894301807195,5.850044981634453,6.101359409915359,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.409702074900607E-4,2.4075667160687806E-4,2.408161162888993E-4,2.4076770454650994E-4,2.4079049035382466E-4,2.4075534414722284E-4,2.4083022240173425E-4,2.4071952367870047E-4,2.4075672248833938E-4,2.4100551847254186E-4,2.4291782715082916E-4,2.4075712015618695E-4,2.4098513236326795E-4,2.410102388564049E-4,2.4090075419782653E-4,2.4076865289565067E-4,2.4085148662392327E-4,2.4096483215235823E-4,2.4078108274307975E-4,2.4078020242355172E-4,2.409968208179645E-4,2.4080432614165313E-4,2.4080469057813199E-4,2.4095895264117167E-4,2.4078116959887918E-4,2.410131195236303E-4,2.4084142415433329E-4,2.40756132021221E-4,2.4086528056278374E-4,2.4093879611840693E-4,2.408055073258462E-4,2.4093447751165532E-4,2.4105277032522766E-4,2.4127650467341207E-4,2.4084100797358137E-4,2.407685068656459E-4,2.408553175095271E-4,2.4079295915591952E-4,2.4071978060217063E-4,2.407810081770967E-4,2.4102231189432853E-4,2.408900959845994E-4,2.409350265598175E-4,2.407317611987817E-4,2.4078106940160745E-4,2.4076841632749454E-4,2.4084991425345285E-4,2.4089167792962183E-4,2.4084269396814202E-4,2.408045199756394E-4,2.407690117292873E-4,2.4126230833403914E-4,2.4082959614816146E-4,2.4078101421489204E-4,2.4082830641647588E-4,2.4075637834747288E-4,0.9809713522424923,2.4079394036305145E-4,2.407693497381634E-4,2.407562409175924E-4,2.4094885168561965E-4,2.4085212877650362E-4,2.4075614027516216E-4,2.407316631192186E-4,2.4070745489132735E-4,2.409250925341592E-4,2.4076793474448385E-4,2.4087737889248644E-4,2.4094807029668798E-4,

{"value":"This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp, moralistic, and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable, unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.<br /><br />Most likely two types of people will see this, francophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the latter, I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","deserv","credit","for","it","origin","approach","it","combin","elem","of","theater","film","and","epic","storytel","unfortun","it","fall","flat","on","all","level","the","film","big","weak","be","it","unwilling","to","commit","to","anyth","it","have","camp","moralist","and","epic","elem","without","ever","commit","to","ani","of","them","a","for","the","stori","itself","chretien","de","troye","be","spin","in","hi","grave","at","thi","horribl","adapt","which","turn","the","lovabl","unbear","innoc","perciv","into","a","much","ungal","and","rude","churlbr","br","much","like","two","typ","of","peopl","will","see","thi","francophil","or","arthuriophil","speak","a","on","of","the","latter","i","find","the","movi","unwatch","and","a","incredibli","shabbi","disrespect","treatment","of","a","beauti","stori"],"filtered":["thi","movi","deserv","credit","origin","approach","combin","elem","theater","film","epic","storytel","unfortun","fall","flat","level","film","big","weak","unwilling","commit","anyth","camp","moralist","epic","elem","without","ever","commit","ani","stori","chretien","de","troye","spin","hi","grave","thi","horribl","adapt","turn","lovabl","unbear","innoc","perciv","much","ungal","rude","churlbr","br","much","like","two","typ","peopl","see","thi","francophil","arthuriophil","speak","latter","find","movi","unwatch","incredibli","shabbi","disrespect","treatment","beauti","stori"],"filtered2":["deserv","credit","origin","approach","combin","elem","theater","epic","storytel","unfortun","fall","flat","level","big","weak","unwilling","commit","anyth","camp","moralist","epic","elem","without","ever","commit","ani","stori","chretien","de","troye","spin","grave","horribl","adapt","turn","lovabl","unbear","innoc","perciv","ungal","rude","churlbr","like","two","typ","peopl","see","francophil","arthuriophil","speak","latter","find","unwatch","incredibli","shabbi","disrespect","treatment","beauti","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,17,23,27,38,44,47,69,82,96,104,125,169,227,230,325,344,356,379,384,423,424,445,479,593,687,701,750,908,968,969,1078,1153,1445,1460,1567,1808,1818,1836,1961,2029,3313,3610,3879,6995,7331],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,17,23,27,38,44,47,69,82,96,104,125,169,227,230,325,344,356,379,384,423,424,445,479,593,687,701,750,908,968,969,1078,1153,1445,1460,1567,1808,1818,1836,1961,2029,3313,3610,3879,6995,7331],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.5541073880211935,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,2.127032521151058,2.020196584395323,2.0390708128715254,2.0728240170322856,2.2242236634876535,2.4071371113909277,2.6005321873043625,2.7121382192999195,2.973659465713028,2.983093497946387,3.028335462059722,3.1272886331425473,3.109204957709252,3.164467636384302,3.212973749990824,3.241201430615691,6.721038771980316,3.490764544963862,3.604618302480356,3.8240921249056035,4.030886538218284,4.081705786614497,3.9911462095687695,8.107333133100207,4.186539847930077,4.235066888824737,4.573751515728891,4.4919214974812585,9.359947457968397,4.770124825978496,4.789173020949191,4.77960356993304,4.838444069955973,4.979216623837056,5.5623629091826725,5.672363804397,5.822646007446338,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918352E-4,2.3612552253122064E-4,2.3618382374676034E-4,2.3613634324334566E-4,2.36158690747249E-4,2.361242206063243E-4,2.3619765851711915E-4,2.3608908917345183E-4,2.3612557243393595E-4,2.3636958262639038E-4,2.3824510646673104E-4,2.3612596245232122E-4,2.3634958866039743E-4,2.363742122098564E-4,2.362668335771339E-4,2.3613727335022451E-4,2.362185137048159E-4,2.3632967894044428E-4,2.3614946409949674E-4,2.3614860071362605E-4,2.3636105227822527E-4,2.361722603925212E-4,2.3617261781876998E-4,2.363239125264052E-4,2.3614954928455472E-4,2.3637703746512054E-4,2.3620864479495754E-4,2.3612499332492963E-4,2.3623204230611885E-4,2.3630414373063946E-4,2.3617341885568208E-4,2.3629990819577752E-4,2.3641592555151696E-4,2.3663535618876835E-4,2.3620823661977858E-4,2.3613713012922487E-4,2.3622227090024033E-4,2.3616111205994108E-4,2.3608934115479146E-4,2.3614939096785063E-4,2.363860530131423E-4,2.362563803832485E-4,2.3630044668255477E-4,2.361010912949481E-4,2.3614945101465846E-4,2.36137041332648E-4,2.3621697158016173E-4,2.3625793189828046E-4,2.362098901828718E-4,2.3617245049795414E-4,2.3613762528140628E-4,2.366214329274519E-4,2.3619704431003977E-4,2.361493968895041E-4,2.3619577938738506E-4,2.3612523491289706E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276115E-4,2.3613795678840857E-4,2.3612510012659135E-4,2.3631400587089337E-4,2.362191435050726E-4,2.3612500142009956E-4,2.3610099510202465E-4,2.360772525389537E-4,2.3629070374590528E-4,2.36136569013275

{"value":"Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar? I mean really, animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning, the story truly did suck.<br /><br />Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet. Yeah I know, seems stereotypical. But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to an extent. Throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil(??) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.<br /><br />I would like to say something entertained me. Maybe the hookup in the movie? Or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. But nothing did. It had the talent, but it blew up.

{"value":"Really, when it comes down to it, this movie is just not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of funny, and yet he thinks he's hilarious. The plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first, until Josh's \"look at me, I'm wacky\" approach began infesting each and every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been the least funny thing I have ever been privy to, and that is saying quite a bit, since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the incredible overuse of the Pixies' \"Debaser,\" I have just one thing to say: What did the Pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this?

{"value":"This is one seriously disturbed movie. Even Though the boys deserved some of what they got.....the sadistic gruesome executions were \"slightly\" over the top. The only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair, but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security, before the joy of what was to come. <br /><br />The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled, \"and, where is the batman?\". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /><br />Now that would have been

{"value":"I was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible directing (the shot sequences do not flow) even though the director might say that that is what he is going for, it looks very uninspired and immature) the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video. <br /><br />There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has, like through editing etc. But it is obvious that he just doesn't care. There is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich.

Sedating them into a coma-like state, he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie.<br /><br />** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth

{"value":"I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up. One of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.<br /><br />It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms. They act like everything is such a big deal, like if Billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end.<br /><br />This is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that

{"value":"I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time, or my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.","finished_norm":["i","find","the","charact","mediocr","and","the","stori","uninterest","i","never","have","to","read","thi","book","thankfulli","or","it","would","have","be","a","pain","experi","i","get","the","ticket","to","the","preview","for","free","but","it","still","be","not","worth","my","time","or","my","friend","i","think","thi","stori","be","not","worth","tell","it","like","sai","that","old","peopl","have","a","past","befor","thei","get","old","no","kid","the","live","of","the","main","charact","be","pain","to","watch","on","gener","no","well","than","the","next","at","avoid","stupid","mistak","howev","i","think","the","actor","do","the","well","thei","can","with","a","lame","stori","i","have","alwai","be","a","big","fan","of","ellen","burstyn","i","be","write","thi","review","to","counteract","the","posit","review","give","which","unfortun","convinc","me","to","give","thi","movi","a","try"],"filtered":["find","charact","mediocr","stori","uninterest","never","read","thi","book","thankfulli","pain","experi","get","ticket","preview","free","still","worth","time","friend","think","thi","stori","worth","tell","like","sai","old","peopl","past","befor","thei","get","old","kid","live","main","charact","pain","watch","gener","well","next","avoid","stupid","mistak","howev","think","actor","well","thei","lame","stori","alwai","big","fan","ellen","burstyn","write","thi","review","counteract","posit","review","give","unfortun","convinc","give","thi","movi","try"],"filtered2":["find","charact","mediocr","stori","uninterest","never","read","book","thankfulli","pain","experi","get","ticket","preview","free","still","worth","time","friend","think","stori","worth","tell","like","old","peopl","past","befor","get","old","kid","live","main","charact","pain","watch","gener","well","next","avoid","stupid","mistak","howev","think","actor","well","lame","stori","alwai","big","fan","ellen","burstyn","write","review","counteract","posit","review","give","unfortun","convinc","give","try"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,8,10,12,17,20,23,30,36,38,41,42,64,65,67,79,82,90,113,114,116,136,140,145,151,161,176,179,197,219,225,227,297,333,335,373,440,458,478,509,592,686,787,1247,1974,2218,2504,3324],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,8,10,12,17,20,23,30,36,38,41,42,64,65,67,79,82,90,113,114,116,136,140,145,151,161,176,179,197,219,225,227,297,333,335,373,440,458,478,509,592,686,787,1247,1974,2218,2504,3324],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,2.133457220525776,3.83116108203179,2.330690080046114,1.364847727375781,2.6728839783437044,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,3.9141830778533158,1.9469506069506084,2.020196584395323,2.0477128419653545,2.1521782565202803,2.4433074195966826,2.2466628996789315,2.346825985579986,2.317169775997098,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.4323182980210873,5.008094298653827,2.507968722980095,2.558331832813986,5.158418835671083,2.641219492619754,2.6005321873043625,2.813490713560207,2.948928684455311,2.908534262247101,3.070535816550098,3.212973749990824,6.565922303288567,3.3243163373261977,3.360519385990158,3.5227672760500357,3.6016814428070463,3.760240652919071,4.327618446189983,4.9909126636002465,5.014723312293965,5.156897801074508,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079215E-4,1.9803239209117214E-4,1.980812878185437E-4,1.9804146714364116E-4,1.9806020941939265E-4,1.9803130020030503E-4,1.980928906839977E-4,1.9800183637269864E-4,1.9803243394329376E-4,1.9823707900490495E-4,1.9981003252786677E-4,1.9803276104166486E-4,1.9822031058076118E-4,1.98240961717279E-4,1.981509060245713E-4,1.9804224720031672E-4,1.981103813925955E-4,1.9820361281160044E-4,1.980524712676428E-4,1.9805174716815775E-4,1.9822992482167903E-4,1.9807158993126735E-4,1.980718896954533E-4,1.9819877666871463E-4,1.980525427101562E-4,1.9824333118607777E-4,1.9810210459216479E-4,1.980319482594906E-4,1.9812172748195065E-4,1.98182197089039E-4,1.9807256150447316E-4,1.9817864485507675E-4,1.9827594562220636E-4,1.9845997644414871E-4,1.9810176226615865E-4,1.9804212708455436E-4,1.981135324555957E-4,1.980622401119636E-4,1.9800204770295603E-4,1.980524099340154E-4,1.982508922939225E-4,1.9814213920018092E-4,1.9817909647006296E-4,1.9801190224276894E-4,1.9805246029372606E-4,1.9804205261315315E-4,1.981090880523801E-4,1.9814344041586422E-4,1.981031490669217E-4,1.98071749367796E-4,1.9804254235593154E-4,1.9844829936360844E-4,1.9809237556434495E-4,1.980524149003536E-4,1.9809131470630457E-4,1.9803215087309449E-4,0.9843481445040683,1.980630471957058E-4,1.9804282038231327E-4,1.980320378312926E-4,1.9819046821197686E-4,1.981109095898443E-4,1.980319550

{"value":"i got a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek. I have to say it is pathetic and just plain painful to watch the two cops act, but i watched the movie as a joke and since it is a homage to august's underground which i happened to have seen it is in my book as an awesome movie. Its quality and everything about it is pretty bad but its entertaining and something to talk about amongst your friends. Reminds me of troma but good stuff. I recommend seeing this under two conditions, if you are bored and need a good laugh, or high, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download for sure. o and the killings are pretty funny. like when the zombie rips the Satan worshipers dick off and stabs someone in the head with it.","finished_norm":["i","get","a","copi","from","the","writer","of","thi","movi","on","soulseek","i","have","to","sai","it","be","pathet","and","just","plain","pain","to","watch","the","two","cop","act","but","i","watch","the","movi","a","a","joke","and","sinc","it","be","a","homag","to","august","underground","which","i","happen","to","have","see","it","be","in","my","book","a","a","awesom","movi","it","qualiti","and","everyth","about","it","be","pretti","bad","but","it","entertain","and","someth","to","talk","about","amongst","your","friend","remind","me","of","troma","but","good","stuff","i","recommend","see","thi","under","two","condit","if","you","be","bore","and","ne","a","good","laugh","or","high","otherwis","just","let","it","be","recommend","download","for","sure","o","and","the","kill","be","pretti","funni","like","when","the","zombi","rip","the","satan","worship","dick","off","and","stab","someon","in","the","head","with","it"],"filtered":["get","copi","writer","thi","movi","soulseek","sai","pathet","plain","pain","watch","two","cop","act","watch","movi","joke","sinc","homag","august","underground","happen","see","book","awesom","movi","qualiti","everyth","pretti","bad","entertain","someth","talk","amongst","friend","remind","troma","good","stuff","recommend","see","thi","two","condit","bore","ne","good","laugh","high","otherwis","let","recommend","download","sure","o","kill","pretti","funni","like","zombi","rip","satan","worship","dick","stab","someon","head"],"filtered2":["get","copi","writer","soulseek","pathet","plain","pain","watch","two","cop","act","watch","joke","sinc","homag","august","underground","happen","see","book","awesom","qualiti","everyth","pretti","bad","entertain","someth","talk","amongst","friend","remind","troma","good","stuff","recommend","see","two","condit","bore","ne","good","laugh","high","otherwis","let","recommend","download","sure","o","kill","pretti","funni","like","zombi","rip","satan","worship","dick","stab","someon","head"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,21,47,53,62,76,78,94,108,110,119,124,133,139,151,161,162,186,193,195,208,211,214,268,287,298,319,361,458,476,586,602,627,644,747,825,994,1587,1679,1813,1863,1976,2195,2283,2385,3539,3781,4283,6320],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,21,47,53,62,76,78,94,108,110,119,124,133,139,151,161,162,186,193,195,208,211,214,268,287,298,319,361,458,476,586,602,627,644,747,825,994,1587,1679,1813,1863,1976,2195,2283,2385,3539,3781,4283,6320],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,3.412938870621443,1.7003182735607676,2.0226120445069267,2.1337665533324026,4.012839573363895,2.08112281984698,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.1653408989309972,2.2323930368088845,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.8002454868101863,2.4323182980210873,2.3586007221245198,2.571852579609833,2.517840471459249,2.51289241584188,2.6289494000279396,2.5687161421197025,2.7303758068497004,3.6746621462132825,2.841890188081905,5.563984093001673,2.9056060024680126,3.0399731661399314,3.2829611516442836,3.6105180246075443,3.4572130107926293,3.506637894120152,3.477726550625732,3.5670958631572662,3.7465885637507435,3.8767358583910254,4.140259095366071,4.706176101378222,4.706176101378222,5.0768550934009715,5.00274712124725,4.900964426937307,5.039114765418124,5.185068678041204,5.129498826886393,5.695894301807195,5.999576715605417,6.032366538428407,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.014580719987592E-4,2.0127954981638403E-4,2.0132924729208162E-4,2.0128877367343203E-4,2.0130782326822788E-4,2.012784400216688E-4,2.0134104041092697E-4,2.012484930726174E-4,2.0127959235475922E-4,2.0148759300272535E-4,2.0308633840979498E-4,2.012799248165963E-4,2.0147054962498727E-4,2.0149153938033793E-4,2.014000070350726E-4,2.0128956652077802E-4,2.0135881791649238E-4,2.0145357806076927E-4,2.0129995823319917E-4,2.0129922226057954E-4,2.0148032151161315E-4,2.0131939038753918E-4,2.0131969506698963E-4,2.0144866261914568E-4,2.0130003084716286E-4,2.0149394770156297E-4,2.013504054005044E-4,2.0127909870714823E-4,2.0137035004885452E-4,2.0143181118237815E-4,2.0132037789173188E-4,2.014282007020662E-4,2.0152709691999214E-4,2.0171414531445803E-4,2.013500574613431E-4,2.0128944443546497E-4,2.0136202064780027E-4,2.013098872582761E-4,2.01248707868079E-4,2.0129989589387788E-4,2.0150163278967928E-4,2.013910964601511E-4,2.0142865972223032E-4,2.012587239938059E-4,2.0129994707934195E-4,2.0128936874294845E-4,2.01357503369243E-4,2.0139241901200326E-4,2.013514670016225E-4,2.0131955243836517E-4,2.0128986651609014E-4,2.0170227676361393E-4,2.013405168448037E-4,2.0129990094164965E-4,2.0133943859176371E-4,2.01279304643

{"value":"I had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining, like other sorts of its genre. However, it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing very much. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it.<br /><br />The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, maybe, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this one. The directing is lackluster, but for what it is, directing isn't that important. I guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny. See something else, don't waste your time here.","finished_norm":["i","have","hope","thi","movi","be","go","to","be","mildli","entertain","like","other","sort","of","it","genr","howev","it","be","lame","and","i","do","not","find","myself","laugh","veri","much","watch","it","on","hbo","mayb","or","if","you","have","get","a","free","rental","to","wast","and","you","ne","a","movi","to","pass","the","time","but","i","do","not","recommend","pai","to","see","itbr","br","the","plot","be","simpl","and","straightforward","and","it","can","have","be","funni","mayb","if","the","script","be","well","jason","lee","can","be","hilari","and","he","get","a","few","laugh","here","and","there","but","the","movi","fall","flat","just","do","not","go","see","thi","on","the","direct","be","lacklust","but","for","what","it","be","direct","be","not","that","import","i","guess","it","main","drawback","be","that","it","be","just","not","veri","funni","see","someth","els","do","not","wast","your","time","here"],"filtered":["hope","thi","movi","go","mildli","entertain","like","sort","genr","howev","lame","find","laugh","veri","much","watch","hbo","mayb","get","free","rental","wast","ne","movi","pass","time","recommend","pai","see","itbr","br","plot","simpl","straightforward","funni","mayb","script","well","jason","lee","hilari","get","laugh","movi","fall","flat","go","see","thi","direct","lacklust","direct","import","guess","main","drawback","veri","funni","see","someth","els","wast","time"],"filtered2":["hope","go","mildli","entertain","like","sort","genr","howev","lame","find","laugh","veri","watch","hbo","mayb","get","free","rental","wast","ne","pass","time","recommend","pai","see","itbr","plot","simpl","straightforward","funni","mayb","script","well","jason","lee","hilari","get","laugh","fall","flat","go","see","direct","lacklust","direct","import","guess","main","drawback","veri","funni","see","someth","els","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,15,20,32,38,53,62,77,89,102,110,113,133,163,169,179,181,195,196,243,269,298,322,373,430,467,487,570,593,600,632,686,736,1339,1505,1560,2741,3506,4922],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,15,20,32,38,53,62,77,89,102,110,113,133,163,169,179,181,195,196,243,269,298,322,373,430,467,487,570,593,600,632,686,736,1339,1505,1560,2741,3506,4922],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,1.5932680941439847,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,2.4001215597131385,1.165345040023057,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.7003182735607676,4.045224089013853,1.9463902258768238,3.9880092219144876,4.175107420354542,2.1290479736304078,2.1521782565202803,4.642472950759303,4.800114871605731,2.4071371113909277,2.507968722980095,2.4442286541160034,2.51289241584188,2.478925055209576,2.627841366673578,2.76533567167316,2.7819920465008363,2.885344817328191,3.070535816550098,3.1419947805322432,3.342254038012865,3.3220965805878846,3.944626193933877,3.490764544963862,3.558633189238533,3.541919708264792,3.6016814428070463,3.6841709341823097,4.506310234933358,4.535724120139652,4.573751515728891,5.259176650194926,5.649374286172302,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805374E-4,2.1925531043720617E-4,2.1930944626706052E-4,2.192653580532821E-4,2.1928610891855618E-4,2.1925410152956985E-4,2.193222925991187E-4,2.1922148009526668E-4,2.192553567745746E-4,2.1948193342720803E-4,2.2122345868647727E-4,2.1925571892772612E-4,2.1946336794909424E-4,2.194862322456888E-4,2.1938652538130787E-4,2.1926622170779212E-4,2.1934165776813414E-4,2.19444880697982E-4,2.192775414774108E-4,2.1927673977696318E-4,2.194740125378648E-4,2.1929870906764126E-4,2.192990409572324E-4,2.1943952627086758E-4,2.1927762057634146E-4,2.1948885564790878E-4,2.1933249395190846E-4,2.1925481904056096E-4,2.193542198056753E-4,2.1942116987548038E-4,2.1929978476330198E-4,2.1941723695242715E-4,2.1952496533805897E-4,2.197287185451424E-4,2.193321149391926E-4,2.1926608871935274E-4,2.1934514652716504E-4,2.1928835723826462E-4,2.192217140735603E-4,2.1927747357072455E-4,2.194972270715443E-4,2.1937681902578206E-4,2.1941773696650544E-4,2.192326247137999E-4,2.1927752932743118E-4,2.192660062669316E-4,2.1934022582203972E-4,2.193782596913498E-4,2.1933365036190105E-4,2.192988855908111E-4,2.1926654849491653E-4,2.1971579004444704E-4,2.1932172227464712E-4,2.1927747906929986E-4,2.193205477255922E-4,2.1925504336804672E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163029E-4,2.1926685631708638E-4,2.1925491821167656E-4,2.1943032740576245E-4,2.193422425717137E-4,2.1925482655736376E-4,2.1923253539347118E-4,2.1921048914035592E-4,2.1940869012321314E-4,2.1926556769286506E-4,2.1936523766456588E-4,2.1942961580067322E-4,2.1933006485397508E-4,2.1927776949505693E-4,2.1923282279271615E-4,2.1928890659939364E-4,2.1923270471120254E-4,2.1924420968899263E-4,2.192328289975514

{"value":"This is what happens when you're living in China and the local video store is running thin on English-language titlesyou are blessed with this work of what appears to be, yes, Romanian cinema. Nevertheless, I think that it has real comedic potential.<br /><br />Spoilers technically follow:<br /><br />Though I don't think that it would in fact spoil anyone's viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery, even in flashback. That mystery, and many other conundrums, remain to be exploited by desperate comedians, perhaps when they're stuck in Bucharest.<br /><br />Let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good-looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this.

{"value":"It's not the most well made slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty amusing. The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. I have to be honest, if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film, you wont find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour, in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills,most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch, drink and be

{"value":"This whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept/theme, it really did not develop as a story. Once the initial idea of a brave (stupid?) bomb disposal expert (cowboy?) are introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitious. Characters were not explored, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored. There was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe.

{"value":"Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.<br /><br />The women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialog is inane. Its a laughable mess. Great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful. I'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not. At the same time is it a put on or not? Its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to \"mean\" anything, and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson Its well made pretentious twaddle.

{"value":"David Lean's worst film. Even 'In Which We Serve' was'nt as bad as this. Usually a film with a really good reputation like this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. But after watching this I just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945! I disliked the acting, stiff upper lip British mannerisms, story, script (which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. The elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive, but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice. Just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation.

{"value":"Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the Law and Order ADA's and her acting is even worse here. Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed, as if she can't remember where she left her keys.<br /><br />This is an important true story, so it's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can't overcome Rohm's tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever actual acting is

{"value":"Okay, if you have a couple hours to waste, or if you just really hate your life, I would say watch this movie. If anything it's good for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states. Seriuosly, the rating of 'PG' is pretty humorous too, once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza. I wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew. You couldn't even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, and cliché, and dumb, and stupid. The acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful to watch I actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my TV

{"value":"The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable. The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. Most of the singing is off-key. I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it... The dialogue is really stupid and trite. The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots.

{"value":"...the first film I had to walk out on. And it was the cast and crew pre-screening (Not that I was involved, I hasten to add). I made it through the first hour, so I reckon I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit.<br /><br />Like other comments here, how did this get through any kind of QA. An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue, the epitome of wooden acting, awful casting, all wrapped together without a plot.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comic.

{"value":"Amen to Magsel. There was a lot of confusion going on. First off, how do you know which movie you are purchasing? Henry Cele stars in every one of them. I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries...WHAT A LETDOWN!! It would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) is OK for popcorn TV but he was not believable in this film (where was his English accent?) AND WHAT'S WITH THE LOVE STORY??? The movie was supposed to be about a young man's rise to military power - not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the English maiden looking for her daddy...<br /><br />If I had paid more than $7 for this movie, I would have to call the police - because that would be a crime!","finished_norm":["amen","to","magsel","there","be","a","lot","of","confus","go","on","off","how","do","you","know","which","movi","you","be","purchas","henri","cele","star","in","everi","on","of","them","i","bui","thi","movi","think","it","be","the","miniserieswhat","a","letdown","it","would","have","be","a","comedi","but","for","the","young","girl","be","rape","david","hasselhoff","spell","be","okai","for","popcorn","tv","but","he","be","not","believ","in","thi","film","where","be","hi","english","accent","and","what","with","the","love","stori","the","movi","be","suppos","to","be","about","a","young","man","rise","to","militari","power","not","the","slave","ship","captain","get","jiggli","with","the","english","maiden","look","for","her","daddybr","br","if","i","have","pai","much","than","for","thi","movi","i","would","have","to","call","the","polic","becaus","that","would","be","a","crime"],"filtered":["amen","magsel","lot","confus","go","know","movi","purchas","henri","cele","star","everi","bui","thi","movi","think","miniserieswhat","letdown","comedi","young","girl","rape","david","hasselhoff","spell","okai","popcorn","tv","believ","thi","film","hi","english","accent","love","stori","movi","suppos","young","man","rise","militari","power","slave","ship","captain","get","jiggli","english","maiden","look","daddybr","br","pai","much","thi","movi","call","polic","becaus","crime"],"filtered2":["amen","magsel","lot","confus","go","know","purchas","henri","cele","star","everi","bui","think","miniserieswhat","letdown","comedi","young","girl","rape","david","hasselhoff","spell","okai","popcorn","tv","believ","english","accent","love","stori","suppos","young","man","rise","militari","power","slave","ship","captain","get","jiggli","english","maiden","look","daddybr","pai","call","polic","becaus","crime"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,12,16,17,22,26,45,54,72,84,85,91,100,127,135,142,149,172,191,322,347,365,427,471,559,588,675,746,753,922,984,987,1395,1612,1781,2377,2394,2755,3673,5764,6126],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,12,16,17,22,26,45,54,72,84,85,91,100,127,135,142,149,172,191,322,347,365,427,471,559,588,675,746,753,922,984,987,1395,1612,1781,2377,2394,2755,3673,5764,6126],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.8162961064622165,1.8113893252729412,1.9209463754160525,2.2212694515902225,2.011190219103739,2.0105926690411424,2.1405462403177813,2.4359679371086367,4.732488142874176,2.2844323215331563,2.3253197803590226,2.5001408943598484,2.5460113484259455,2.885344817328191,3.0151989841543516,3.185521045582134,3.233054746047873,3.496027715008137,3.5727776966246974,7.275012338650383,3.749984152751882,4.00861390260916,3.8690435127678695,4.030886538218284,4.263079925052412,4.383707912841026,4.760735085628657,5.02684467282631,4.838444069955973,5.156897801074508,5.408212229355414,5.3560264761848435,5.695894301807195,6.948657270302562,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.731092965484181E-4,2.7286728059361897E-4,2.7293465363304766E-4,2.7287978503727245E-4,2.729056098721009E-4,2.72865776085753E-4,2.7295064113039643E-4,2.728251781086749E-4,2.7286733826132925E-4,2.731493170874147E-4,2.753166774155833E-4,2.7286778896761047E-4,2.7312621200724255E-4,2.7315466704635647E-4,2.7303058001336335E-4,2.7288085987125046E-4,2.729747414406555E-4,2.7310320428201753E-4,2.728949475334678E-4,2.728939498024639E-4,2.731394593944327E-4,2.729212909901959E-4,2.729217040329177E-4,2.73096540598648E-4,2.728950459735469E-4,2.731579319188389E-4,2.729633369022277E-4,2.728666690414244E-4,2.7299037512823064E-4,2.7307369572578805E-4,2.7292262971329956E-4,2.7306880113045907E-4,2.7320287109470066E-4,2.734564457215511E-4,2.7296286521390754E-4,2.7288069436468313E-4,2.729790832656608E-4,2.729084079474749E-4,2.7282546929897986E-4,2.728948630223434E-4,2.7316835031006314E-4,2.730185002747631E-4,2.730694234072082E-4,2.7283904779213373E-4,2.7289493241259395E-4,2.7288059175112323E-4,2.729729593573118E-4,2.7302029320965226E-4,2.729647760758072E-4,2.729215106765388E-4,2.7288126656385827E-4,2.7344035596381676E-4,2.729499313510652E-4,2.728948698654219E-4,2.729484696030879E-4,2.728669482211208E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.7290952002183614E-4,2.7288164965423003E-4,2.7286679246170815E-4,2.730850924412429E-4,2.729754692395038E-4,2.728666783962242E-4,2.7283893663133604E-4,2.728114996624305E-4,2.73058164443755E-4,2.728800459376027E-4,2.7300408705697456E-4,2.730842068355754E-4,2.7296031384501626E-4,2.728952313056369E-4,2.7283929430500087E-4,2.729090916375394E-4,2.728391473503778E-4,2.7285346550758277E-4,2.72839302027033E-4,2.7301641286068504E-4,2.729351544391077E-4,2.7286704260300477E-4,2.7289347489153437E-4]}}
{"value":"The shame of it! There I was, comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another splendid Muppet night of entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this? The humour was dreadful, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that's saying something) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting Treasure Island. A short tale, such as Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can weave the Muppet high jinks around it....here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun. Where do the Muppets go next?

{"value":"this film has its good points: hot chicks people die<br /><br />the problem... the hot Chicks barley get nude and you don't get to see many of the people dieing, mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes.<br /><br />also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude

{"value":"This is not so much film as big budget children's television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as 'Insomnia'. When it's first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought \"Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!\" but no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long, white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. That's not a good sign.

{"value":"I went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film, I was still bitterly disappointed! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT bad!!! The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film. It is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film... You'll live to regret it
