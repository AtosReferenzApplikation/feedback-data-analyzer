{"value":"This film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there.<br /><br />One unbelievable event followed the next (Russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time), the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible (why does she still follow him after they got off the ship? Why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? And what was the story with the younger sister about?). Still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot, the movie managed to be completely predictable.<br /><br />The saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too. So this could have been a really good film... but it wasn't.","finished_norm":["thi","film","start","out","veri","promis","with","the","stori","about","a","director","who","lose","hi","sight","and","a","blind","woman","who","be","bind","to","help","him","howev","somewher","in","the","middl","it","seem","like","the","script","writer","do","not","know","where","to","go","from","therebr","br","on","unbeliev","event","follow","the","next","russia","must","be","veri","small","becaus","thei","be","all","bump","into","each","other","all","the","time","the","motiv","of","the","femal","lead","charact","comprehens","why","doe","she","still","follow","him","after","thei","get","off","the","ship","why","doe","not","she","try","to","borrow","a","mobil","phone","on","the","ship","to","call","somebodi","the","side","stori","be","complet","ridicul","be","the","stori","with","the","mother","and","the","boyfriend","suppos","to","be","funni","and","what","be","the","stori","with","the","young","sister","about","still","with","all","thi","seem","arbitrari","of","the","plot","the","movi","manag","to","be","complet","predictablebr","br","the","sad","thing","about","it","be","that","there","be","a","lot","of","potenti","a","i","sai","the","idea","of","the","film","be","good","the","visual","and","the","score","be","veri","beauti","and","the","actor","of","the","main","charact","be","good","too","so","thi","can","have","be","a","realli","good","film","but","it","be","not"],"filtered":["thi","film","start","veri","promis","stori","director","lose","hi","sight","blind","woman","bind","help","howev","somewher","middl","seem","like","script","writer","know","go","therebr","br","unbeliev","event","follow","next","russia","must","veri","small","becaus","thei","bump","time","motiv","femal","lead","charact","comprehens","doe","still","follow","thei","get","ship","doe","try","borrow","mobil","phone","ship","call","somebodi","side","stori","complet","ridicul","stori","mother","boyfriend","suppos","funni","stori","young","sister","still","thi","seem","arbitrari","plot","movi","manag","complet","predictablebr","br","sad","thing","lot","potenti","sai","idea","film","good","visual","score","veri","beauti","actor","main","charact","good","thi","realli","good","film"],"filtered2":["start","veri","promis","stori","director","lose","sight","blind","woman","bind","help","howev","somewher","middl","seem","like","script","writer","know","go","therebr","unbeliev","event","follow","next","russia","must","veri","small","becaus","bump","time","motiv","femal","lead","charact","comprehens","doe","still","follow","get","ship","doe","try","borrow","mobil","phone","ship","call","somebodi","side","stori","complet","ridicul","stori","mother","boyfriend","suppos","funni","stori","young","sister","still","seem","arbitrari","plot","manag","complet","predictablebr","sad","thing","lot","potenti","idea","good","visual","score","veri","beauti","actor","main","charact","good","realli","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,8,10,13,15,17,18,22,26,29,32,35,36,41,58,62,64,70,71,72,77,103,113,123,135,141,142,149,157,179,185,221,260,274,287,297,325,345,363,397,422,425,455,470,518,547,554,571,585,635,683,804,902,983,987,1050,1082,1280,1493,1962,2271,2970,3679,3785,4556,5006,5275,8552],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,8,10,13,15,17,18,22,26,29,32,35,36,41,58,62,64,70,71,72,77,103,113,123,135,141,142,149,157,179,185,221,260,274,287,297,325,345,363,397,422,425,455,470,518,547,554,571,585,635,683,804,902,983,987,1050,1082,1280,1493,1962,2271,2970,3679,3785,4556,5006,5275,8552],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,3.6001823395697077,5.108214776042387,2.430631986809635,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,2.926338025798268,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,3.766857155204268,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,4.197164082437498,2.1521782565202803,2.2619070973220485,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.3253197803590226,2.3360150694757706,2.507968722980095,2.518833027372001,2.6423424573643777,5.3509388313256645,2.748952192422636,2.841890188081905,2.813490713560207,2.973659465713028,3.0022328381570844,3.0349689855553557,3.3176717946075294,3.2090054908152035,3.226987993365636,3.2787058260741455,3.3814747511661465,3.4101163271295305,3.432149042129413,3.439602492783994,3.467417180966871,3.7165362186843414,3.587125145032839,3.6105180246075443,3.7740817043309423,3.9201351739255808,4.165705761027235,8.767415825682052,4.240607069200353,4.165705761027235,4.364659717870332,

{"value":"Every new fall line-up show deserves, at least, my \"3 strikes and you're out\" policy. I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, that is, 3 complete episodes. After Episode 1, I actually said to the TV,\"Cancelled tomorrow\". It was that bad. I have now watched the first 4 episodes of \"Cavemen\" and have yet to manage even a smirk. Not a titter, a guffaw, a chortle, as a matter of fact, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this show. I'm simply not \"getting\" it, but I believe that a comedy on a major TV network in prime-time, just HAS to be funny; but there are no laughs from me YET. There's just no way that ABC would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m. I KNOW there has got to be an inside joke that just isn't jiving with my brain.

{"value":"The only thing that \"An Inconvenient Truth\" proves is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These \"unchallenged\" experts are unchallenged because a response to their inane hypotheses is generally beneath real science. This is mostly false science folks. The greatest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - is people, we exhale it and unless you're willing to start sacrificing your brethren to save the world, there's not a darn thing to be done. We've heard how the world was going to end as the result of man for more than 50 years. Fools publish a time line for their doomsday and when the time passes, nothing has happened. \"An Inconvenient Truth\" is just another vehicle with which a disingenuous faction of American society can peddle their poop.<br /><br />And as to Al leaving the tobacco business because of his sister's death from cancer, that is a load too. Al couldn't run his farm any better than he could run the country. He was losing money on the operation because he didn't care to farm when he could make more $ on speaking tours.

{"value":"There are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that, if executed clearly, could have elevated it from Spaghetti-western blandness into something special. Unfortunately, A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! Scenes start and end abruptly, characters leave for long stretches, the performances (and accents) of the actors are pretty inconsistent, etc.<br /><br />Robert Shaw is a Mexican(!) revolutionary who, after taking part in wiping out a village, stays on to become a priest(!)...ten years later the village is being run by \"mayor\" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw. They all yell at each other A LOT and they all shoot each other A LOT. Fernando Rey is in it too (as a blind man). The performances aren't bad, but they are mightily uneven. Savalas has an accent sometimes as does Landau (who is really grating here).

{"value":"I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. However, I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made a full movie, and a rather weak one at

{"value":"After watching \"The Bodyguard\" last night, I felt compelled to write a review of it.<br /><br />This could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera-work. It was beyond annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the fight sequences. The closeups were even horrible.<br /><br />The story has Sonny Chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite straight with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, as the Mob and another gang of thugs are after her.<br /><br />The story was decent, and despite horrible dubbing, this could have been a good movie. Given better direction and editing, I'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like another cheesy 70's action movie.<br /><br />Note: The opening sequence has a quote familiar to \"Pulp Fiction\" fans, and then continues to a karate school in Times Square

{"value":"Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's \"Anna and the King of Siam\", itself filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, has Deborah Kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the King's many children--and perhaps teach the Royal One a thing or two in the process! Stagy picture begins well, but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner, reprising his stage triumph as the King, is a commanding presence, but is used--per the concocted story--as a buffoon. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better, despite having to lip-synch to Marni Nixon's vocals. Perhaps having already played this part to death, Brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast. Second-half, with Anna and the moppets staging a musical version of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is quite ridiculous, and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering. Brynner won a Best Actor Oscar, but it is feisty Kerr who keeps this bauble above water.

{"value":"this movie is similar to Darkness Falls,and The Boogeyman(2005)but it's also much more graphic than both,and not as good as either.it's also slow and fairly predictable.it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus,we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory,the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that,there is some really awful clichéd dialogue.and i won't say when,but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable,given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake.it just wasn't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this

{"value":"I watch LOTS of bad films, LOTS!!!!!! It's kind of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday nite a group of friends and I get together and watch trash from around the globe - ANYTHING. Turkish super hero movies, vampire flicks from Brazil, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner films, ANYTHING (except maybe Raising Helen) but Ihave never seen a WORST film than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even entertainingly bad in an Ed Wood kinda way - it just SUCKS. Now this film was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she HATED THIS PIECE OF CRAP = she tried to get out of her contract, she whined, she moaned but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see, yikes!!!! And you can just see her seething during takes - doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him.

{"value":"Overall an extremely disappointing picture. Very, very slow build up to the basic storyline. The role of Maria Schrader searching for her families secret past. (Every take seems to last forever. There is really no rhythm in the film.) ***SPOILERS*** Her Mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis, by a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. The entire character of Ruth is so one dimensional, so stereotypical. ***SPOILERS END*** The film cuts back and forth between present day New York and Berlin and Berlin 40s something. Please when you do that, give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place. There is never a clear indication of time  very annoying. Worst part is, the end. ***SPOILERS*** The entire show and jabber about the Jews being so terribly tormented, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. That's how the Jews got out of the Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is NEVER answered. Was is Goebels who freed them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice the film won an acting award for K. Riemann, why?  I have no idea.

{"value":"OK, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.<br /><br />I pity the fools who still think so... Its absolute rubbish.<br /><br />The story is just ... ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise, im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it?<br /><br />Dean and others, are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this film, and well, maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.<br /><br />Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.<br /><br />It may've been good for its time, but, really, its drivel.<br /><br />It must've just been hype about Dean's death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.","finished_norm":["okai","so","obvious","ppl","think","thi","be","a","good","movi","in","br","br","i","piti","the","fool","who","still","think","so","it","absolut","rubbishbr","br","the","stori","be","just","ridicul","the","charact","be","absurd","caricatur","but","thi","film","be","not","mean","to","satiris","im","sure","it","mean","to","be","a","seriou","drama","be","not","itbr","br","dean","and","other","be","too","old","for","their","part","peopl","sai","dean","be","great","in","thi","film","and","good","mayb","he","do","plai","hi","part","a","good","a","he","possibli","can","have","hi","charact","be","mean","to","be","or","or","so","but","dean","be","a","year","old","man","when","he","make","thi","film","see","him","agonis","and","throw","littl","tantrum","like","a","year","old","boi","it","patheticbr","br","natali","wood","be","gorgeou","but","the","earli","scene","at","the","polic","station","where","she","be","cry","and","whine","be","veri","unconvinc","it","set","a","bad","preced","for","the","film","and","for","the","rest","of","it","you","feel","like","cring","everi","time","on","of","thi","badli","act","emot","scene","come","alongbr","br","it","mai","have","be","good","for","it","time","but","realli","it","drivelbr","br","it","must","have","just","be","hyp","about","dean","death","that","have","overinfl","the","reput","of","thi","film"],"filtered":["okai","obvious","ppl","think","thi","good","movi","br","br","piti","fool","still","think","absolut","rubbishbr","br","stori","ridicul","charact","absurd","caricatur","thi","film","mean","satiris","im","sure","mean","seriou","drama","itbr","br","dean","old","part","peopl","sai","dean","great","thi","film","good","mayb","plai","hi","part","good","possibli","hi","charact","mean","dean","year","old","man","make","thi","film","see","agonis","throw","littl","tantrum","like","year","old","boi","patheticbr","br","natali","wood","gorgeou","earli","scene","polic","station","cry","whine","veri","unconvinc","set","bad","preced","film","rest","feel","like","cring","everi","time","thi","badli","act","emot","scene","come","alongbr","br","mai","good","time","realli","drivelbr","br","must","hyp","dean","death","overinfl","reput","thi","film"],"filtered2":["okai","obvious","ppl","think","good","piti","fool","still","think","absolut","rubbishbr","stori","ridicul","charact","absurd","caricatur","mean","satiris","im","sure","mean","seriou","drama","itbr","dean","old","part","peopl","dean","great","good","mayb","plai","part","good","possibli","charact","mean","dean","year","old","man","make","see","agonis","throw","littl","tantrum","like","year","old","boi","patheticbr","natali","wood","gorgeou","earli","scene","polic","station","cry","whine","veri","unconvinc","set","bad","preced","rest","feel","like","cring","everi","time","badli","act","emot","scene","come","alongbr","mai","good","time","realli","drivelbr","must","hyp","dean","death","overinfl","reput"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,17,19,21,23,34,40,43,45,46,51,57,61,64,67,85,88,109,119,141,163,191,222,226,245,266,274,282,310,341,430,448,463,471,493,506,558,655,856,928,1057,1258,1266,1399,1589,1828,1831,1847,1867,2137,2346,2697,3799,5007,6425,6858,7053,8221],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,17,19,21,23,34,40,43,45,46,51,57,61,64,67,85,88,109,119,141,163,191,222,226,245,266,274,282,310,341,430,448,463,471,493,506,558,655,856,928,1057,1258,1266,1399,1589,1828,1831,1847,1867,2137,2346,2697,3799,5007,6425,6858,7053,8221],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,2.714457859969082,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,3.668325173349496,3.7637034094785053,1.883428577602134,5.871274616779973,2.011190219103739,6.0951670240402,2.125691139326857,2.1653408989309972,2.2657547357741192,2.4000574358028657,2.5460113484259455,2.5771019354959765,2.5940874818617203,2.7502029743242886,2.747702973022204,2.748952192422636,2.918851229218033,2.854312708080462,2.933776879434709,3.1419947805322432,3.2681460658591432,3.3467891931782563,3.496027715008137,3.342254038012865,3.449627639403373,3.4572130107926293,3.7297814454343623,3.900174431363043,4.017463517886143,4.181290492043933,4.390138803171316,4.327618446189983,4.436351646326448,4.662879295624898,4.770124825978496,4.789173020949191,20.62759120429803,4.8184434032493035,5.014723312293965,5.259176650194926,5.339219357868463,5.71999

{"value":"If you have seen very less films, this might be a big one for you. If you have seen lot of films, this is a joke. The acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are stupidily performed. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the bollywood heros/heroines, you can predict whats going to happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protray is terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies. It suppose to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show. There are times you wondering, you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them. Are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid? There were only a few characters acting that was very good, but as far it is concerned with plot, action, it is poorly directed.

{"value":"Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his skilled hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a fairly original plot (man dumps superhero, superhero gets superpower-fueled revenge), and shape it into something enjoyable. \"Girlfriend\" is an exercise in pointlessness. The one-trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a film the flip-flops between both, with neither aspect being very well done. Uma Thurman is tops, as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls off his role too, though his slacker antics quickly grow tired. What's even more maddening is that, in certain scenes (such as when a very turned on Uma knocks a headboard through a wall), you sense a witty, raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out.

{"value":"What exactly was going on during World War 11 in New Zealand when American forces were there?<br /><br />This awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view. Can you imagine casting Joan Fontaine as the older sister to Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even funnier was that Fontaine becomes pregnant in the film.<br /><br />Piper Laurie and Paul Newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in \"The Hustler,\" have no scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes off to Wellington to tramp around there, despite the fact that she is married. Woe to her when her husband comes back from the war.<br /><br />Jean Simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued Paul Newman. There is even romance for the young Miss Dee here.<br /><br />The picture has little to no meaning. Are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war?

{"value":"I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but personally I think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it, and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only \"serious\" film I recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through. Once we reached the infamous (and interminable) snake fight scene, I think everyone gave up.<br /><br />The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting. Oh, and there's also Bo's breasts, although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesn't rate much more than a Playboy pictorial.<br /><br />The \"dramatic tension\" in this film is between Bo's terrible acting and her husband's horrible direction. The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent \"action\" sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those films that's bad enough, it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst film I ever paid to

{"value":"This movie could have been a decent B-movie if 3/4 of the the movie wasn't so much focusing on the sex scenes. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure that there's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what all he had to do, which wasn't much. At one point or another, one would have to laugh at him, because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist, she could've of done more though and I'm not suggesting her having sex. The person that stood out the most to me in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife. There's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me. She played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her.<br /><br />\"Diary Of A Sex Addict\" while not Oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly

{"value":"I have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too, if you're gonna make a movie like this be sure you got the f/x to back it up. Also don't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it. Another thing, just about all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so don't blatantly copy it. All in all this movie sucked, f/x sucked, acting sucked, story unoriginal. Let's talk about the acting for just a second, the Carradine guy who's career peaked in 1984 when he did \"Revenge of the Nerds\" (which was actually a great comedy). He's not exactly z list, he can act. He just should have said no to this s--t bag. He should have did what Mark Hamill did after \"Return of the Jedi\" and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as a \"Nerd\" and that should have been that. I understand he has bills to pay, but that hardly excuses this s--t bag. Have I called this movie that yet? O.K. I just wanted to be sure. If I sound a little hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2hrs of my life I could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel, and I feel cheated. I'll close on that note.

{"value":"You've gotta hand it to Steven Seagal: whatever his other faults may be, he does have good taste in women. If you pick a Seagal movie, chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it. And usually, they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc. \"Flight of Fury\" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie's) and Katie Jones, and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling! And if it seems like I'm spending a little too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care. This being a military-type actioner, there is very little fighting in it, and he doesn't fit into his role (a stealth fighter pilot, \"the best in the world\", of course) very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.

{"value":"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her \"before\" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the \"before\" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.<br /><br />The two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. As has the \"good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence\" character been seen before. In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes.<br /><br />One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. Murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.","finished_norm":["so","i","be","wonder","while","watch","thi","film","do","the","produc","of","thi","movi","get","to","save","monei","on","sandra","bullock","wardrob","by","drag","out","her","befor","cloth","from","miss","congeni","do","m","bullock","conjur","get","to","sleepwalk","through","the","role","by","channel","the","befor","graci","hart","a","mani","review","have","note","befor","the","film","be","veri","formula","add","to","that","the","deja","vu","viewer","experi","with","the","charact","of","cassi","mayweth","a","a","somewhat","dark","graci","hart","with","much","back","stori","and","it","rapidli","becom","a","snooz","festbr","br","the","two","bad","boi","serial","killer","have","be","do","befor","and","well","in","other","film","a","have","the","good","gui","partner","try","to","protect","hi","partner","despit","the","evid","charact","be","see","befor","in","fact","none","of","the","charact","in","the","film","ever","get","beyond","two","dimens","or","try","to","be","anyth","but","trite","stereotypesbr","br","on","last","peev","us","the","term","serial","killer","be","fals","advertis","murder","on","person","even","if","it","a","premedit","murder","doe","not","make","you","a","serial","killer","you","mai","have","the","potenti","to","becom","a","serial","killer","but","you","be","not","a","serial","killer","or","even","a","spree","killer"],"filtered":["wonder","watch","thi","film","produc","thi","movi","get","save","monei","sandra","bullock","wardrob","drag","befor","cloth","miss","congeni","m","bullock","conjur","get","sleepwalk","role","channel","befor","graci","hart","mani","review","note","befor","film","veri","formula","add","deja","vu","viewer","experi","charact","cassi","mayweth","somewhat","dark","graci","hart","much","back","stori","rapidli","becom","snooz","festbr","br","two","bad","boi","serial","killer","befor","well","film","good","gui","partner","try","protect","hi","partner","despit","evid","charact","see","befor","fact","none","charact","film","ever","get","beyond","two","dimens","try","anyth","trite","stereotypesbr","br","last","peev","us","term","serial","killer","fals","advertis","murder","person","even","premedit","murder","doe","make","serial","killer","mai","potenti","becom","serial","killer","serial","killer","even","spree","killer"],"filtered2":["wonder","watch","produc","get","save","monei","sandra","bullock","wardrob","drag","befor","cloth","miss","congeni","m","bullock","conjur","get","sleepwalk","role","channel","befor","graci","hart","mani","review","note","befor","veri","formula","add","deja","vu","viewer","experi","charact","cassi","mayweth","somewhat","dark","graci","hart","back","stori","rapidli","becom","snooz","festbr","two","bad","boi","serial","killer","befor","well","good","gui","partner","try","protect","partner","despit","evid","charact","see","befor","fact","none","charact","ever","get","beyond","two","dimens","try","anyth","trite","stereotypesbr","last","peev","us","term","serial","killer","fals","advertis","murder","person","even","premedit","murder","doe","make","serial","killer","mai","potenti","becom","serial","killer","serial","killer","even","spree","killer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,15,17,18,20,36,39,44,46,47,50,55,56,63,79,97,104,115,126,128,144,153,175,176,189,252,255,261,273,279,282,299,333,368,370,391,502,547,560,596,728,764,858,879,1015,1134,1176,1221,1514,1535,1570,1752,1803,3146,3857,3891,3916,4123,4134,4352,5230,6761,8095,8284],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,15,17,18,20,36,39,44,46,47,50,55,56,63,79,97,104,115,126,128,144,153,175,176,189,252,255,261,273,279,282,299,333,368,370,391,502,547,560,596,728,764,858,879,1015,1134,1176,1221,1514,1535,1570,1752,1803,3146,3857,3891,3916,4123,4134,4352,5230,6761,8095,8284],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.389902141215977,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,3.3716610723085094,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.9360366939211433,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,3.412938870621443,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,9.734753034753043,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,4.40310717685161,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.2931108769894046,2.3409902041158843,2.3791142619576227,2.5040471493269134,2.498193474075453,18.259939518151278,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,5.934838391705887,2.7910771187233068,2.918851229218033,2.7949961309240425,2.948928684455311,3.1346146732346205,2.9958122703541616,3.109204957709252,3.3132665011396125,3.432149042129413,3.4623020803001006,3.4855289

{"value":"Just got back from a free screening and I'm very glad I didn't pay to see this very sub-par film. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults. It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick and fart jokes though (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). The movie is pretty juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and mostly annoying. The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.<br /><br />Visually, the film is about average with nothing that really stands out. They did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from Wallace and Gromit, but other than that it's very forgettable imagery.<br /><br />Although I was really bored throughout the whole film, I chuckled a couple times. It's not an absolute failure, but I most definitely would not want to watch it again.

{"value":"Effect(s) without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of Hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, it's required. The Haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st-class cinematographer-turner-director who once showed promise (Jan de Bont- Speed) but has since produced a string of big budget garbage (Twister, Speed 2).<br /><br />Actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film. Lili Taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing. Events just happen, good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non-event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity.<br /><br />There really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now.

{"value":"Looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform. However, I was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story. David Duchovny,(Dr. Eugene Sands),\"Connie & Carla\",'04, was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie,(Claire),\"Taking Lives\",'04, who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton,(Raymond Blossom),\"Kinsey\",'04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan,(Yates),\"CSI-Vegas TV Series\", plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a so-called body guard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men.

{"value":"I picked up this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how horrible his acting was, he walks and talks so stupid the whole time, it's fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there, almost ALL the characters act so badly it's laughable, the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce (David), but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again, you never even know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can't believe how such a thing gets released! I was tempted many times to stop watching, in fact I did, half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off, came to the IMDB to check what other's thought about it, I found zero comments (not surprised), so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it. The only good thing going (for me) was the high-school Rock band theme, the occasional guitar playing and singing parts, but that's not worth it.<br /><br />Very bad acting and directing...

{"value":"After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie. But it's really an awful movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap suspense), the acting is over the top en the story, oh boy, which story?<br /><br />The story doesn't seem to go in a direction, first they capture the alien (after 7 years! they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to release it (why the hell did they capture it?). Then the girlfriend, who's acting is the most over the top, wants to walk away from this madness, then suddenly she doesn't, then again, she does and then she doesn't. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race (and remember, in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens) and what do they do? They torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces.<br /><br />This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who doesn't write very soon, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, don't watch this

{"value":"I saw most of \"My Bollywood Bride\" today at the IAAC film festival in New York and had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea welling up within me. I've seen Bollywood movies, and I've seen satires of Bollywood movies. This movie couldn't decide which one it wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke on itself.<br /><br />It seems to have been liberally copied from movies like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy, lazy job at that. How can Bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused, well-trodden scripts? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real, fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people? The over-smart auto driver, the cow on the street, gratuitous scenes of foreign locations, pointless scenes of Mumbai streets, they're all in there. Every possible cliché about India has been faithfully included. So sickeningly predictable. ugh!!! Acting performances are weak across the board except for Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful.

{"value":"Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who \"accidentally\" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was stilted and felt forced. We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors. Leave the acting to actors. Not that anyone in this movie was that great.

{"value":"Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. A lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but Askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />Askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; Linden Travers going over the top as a 'mad woman'. Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who off-screen married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance.

{"value":"This sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 Broadway revival that was such a 'nostalgic' hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book extensively. I have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well. I played the 'innocent philanderer' Jimmy Smith on-stage in 1974, and thought this $1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated delight of seeing \"Topper\" Roland Young play 'my' part was a major disappointment. Three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly. Even the classic duet, \"Tea For Two\", is done as a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, just embarrasses herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the film must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called \"Tea For Two\" and is about doing the stage play (the original, of course), so those who are seeking the true \"No No Nanette\" might find a more recognizable version there.","finished_norm":["thi","sad","littl","film","bear","littl","similar","to","the","broadwai","reviv","that","be","such","a","nostalg","hit","keep","in","mind","that","when","burt","shevelov","direct","that","reviv","he","rewrit","the","book","extens","i","have","a","feel","that","thi","screenwrit","work","a","much","of","a","chang","from","the","origin","version","a","good","i","plai","the","innoc","philander","jimmi","smith","onstag","in","and","think","thi","dvd","would","bring","back","memori","not","a","chanc","even","the","anticip","delight","of","see","topper","roland","young","plai","my","part","be","a","major","disappoint","three","song","from","the","plai","remain","and","be","do","veri","poorli","even","the","classic","duet","tea","for","two","be","do","a","a","virtual","solo","the","mani","familiar","face","in","thi","fiasco","do","not","do","themselv","proud","at","all","and","the","star","anna","neagl","just","embarrass","herself","when","i","feel","gyp","by","spend","a","dollar","i","know","the","film","must","be","bad","anoth","comment","mention","the","dori","dai","version","which","be","actual","call","tea","for","two","and","be","about","do","the","stage","plai","the","origin","of","cours","so","that","who","be","seek","the","true","no","no","nanett","mai","find","a","much","recogniz","version","there"],"filtered":["thi","sad","littl","film","bear","littl","similar","broadwai","reviv","nostalg","hit","keep","mind","burt","shevelov","direct","reviv","rewrit","book","extens","feel","thi","screenwrit","work","much","chang","origin","version","good","plai","innoc","philander","jimmi","smith","onstag","think","thi","dvd","bring","back","memori","chanc","even","anticip","delight","see","topper","roland","young","plai","part","major","disappoint","three","song","plai","remain","veri","poorli","even","classic","duet","tea","two","virtual","solo","mani","familiar","face","thi","fiasco","themselv","proud","star","anna","neagl","embarrass","feel","gyp","spend","dollar","know","film","must","bad","anoth","comment","mention","dori","dai","version","actual","call","tea","two","stage","plai","origin","cours","seek","true","nanett","mai","find","much","recogniz","version"],"filtered2":["sad","littl","bear","littl","similar","broadwai","reviv","nostalg","hit","keep","mind","burt","shevelov","direct","reviv","rewrit","book","extens","feel","screenwrit","work","chang","origin","version","good","plai","innoc","philander","jimmi","smith","onstag","think","dvd","bring","back","memori","chanc","even","anticip","delight","see","topper","roland","young","plai","part","major","disappoint","three","song","plai","remain","veri","poorli","even","classic","duet","tea","two","virtual","solo","mani","familiar","face","fiasco","themselv","proud","star","anna","neagl","embarrass","feel","gyp","spend","dollar","know","must","bad","anoth","comment","mention","dori","dai","version","actual","call","tea","two","stage","plai","origin","cours","seek","true","nanett","mai","find","recogniz","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,12,14,15,26,38,40,43,46,47,48,50,52,61,63,69,73,100,102,132,134,135,141,142,151,187,199,220,224,238,247,250,251,278,280,283,285,304,328,332,388,398,404,436,455,486,525,556,589,669,682,1038,1068,1095,1153,1238,1315,1499,1528,2134,2162,2267,2270,2375,2449,2463,2667,2740,2939,3786,4278,4420,4455,4684,5130,8514],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,12,14,15,26,38,40,43,46,47,48,50,52,61,63,69,73,100,102,132,134,135,141,142,151,187,199,220,224,238,247,250,251,278,280,283,285,304,328,332,388,398,404,436,455,486,525,556,589,669,682,1038,1068,1095,1153,1238,1315,1499,1528,2134,2162,2267,2270,2375,2449,2463,2667,2740,2939,3786,4278,4420,4455,4684,5130,8514],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.3324924169710188,1.519311641348122,6.513987503328295,3.321622407243643,1.655771293751733,3.412938870621443,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,4.254065042302116,1.8950689206770979,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.8002454868101863,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,8.501080262633181,2.689504733779216,2.597304642813496,2.7303758068497004,2.6812935439488212,2.6942272927333892,2.8336934208777267,2.8028805344481915,2.7678802023081546,2.808171552082607,2.871119826396843,3.1550424959247185,2.9705344631698933,3.0914425013694116,3.143848349181566,3.1419947805322432,3.2070272508030975,3.2787058260741455,3.

{"value":"Like last year, I didn't manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather, out of all the total bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portmanif there's no director, she's gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter award.<br /><br />For helping me write this review I'd like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I'd like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven't been starving myself for a month. I'm not going to cry...thank
