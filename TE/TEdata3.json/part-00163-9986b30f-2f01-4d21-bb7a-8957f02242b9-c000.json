{"value":"I'm sure to people watching this move outside of Britian this film will be an entertaining watch, but for someone from the UK it's painful in it's errors.<br /><br />Right at the start of the film Elijah Wood gets off a tube at Bank station, which has been trashed. He says to his sister, who he's meeting, \"What happened here\" and she replies \"Oh Tottenham were in town yesterday\"!!! Tottenham are in town already.. they're part of the town, they don't have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they'd do it is Bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world.<br /><br />There are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. He clearly decided it wasn't worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke style mock-ney which made my ears bleed. It was accentuated by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way you'd expect West Ham fans to speak. This error made him unbelievable in the role and really spoilt the film.","finished_norm":["i","be","sure","to","peopl","watch","thi","move","outsid","of","britian","thi","film","will","be","a","entertain","watch","but","for","someon","from","the","uk","it","pain","in","it","errorsbr","br","right","at","the","start","of","the","film","elijah","wood","get","off","a","tube","at","bank","station","which","have","be","trash","he","sai","to","hi","sister","who","he","meet","what","happen","here","and","she","repli","oh","tottenham","be","in","town","yesterdai","tottenham","be","in","town","alreadi","thei","re","part","of","the","town","thei","do","not","have","to","go","there","and","if","tottenham","fan","want","to","fight","other","fan","the","last","place","on","earth","thei","have","do","it","be","bank","station","where","there","be","probabl","much","secur","camera","than","anywher","els","in","the","worldbr","br","there","be","sever","other","similar","error","but","the","big","fail","for","me","be","the","actor","who","plai","the","lead","hooligan","he","clearli","decid","it","be","not","worth","try","to","speak","with","a","east","end","accent","and","instead","opt","for","a","dick","van","dyk","styl","mocknei","which","make","my","ear","ble","it","be","accentu","by","the","fact","the","rest","of","hi","gang","all","speak","in","the","wai","you","have","expect","west","ham","fan","to","speak","thi","error","make","him","unbeliev","in","the","role","and","realli","spoil","the","film"],"filtered":["sure","peopl","watch","thi","move","outsid","britian","thi","film","entertain","watch","someon","uk","pain","errorsbr","br","right","start","film","elijah","wood","get","tube","bank","station","trash","sai","hi","sister","meet","happen","repli","oh","tottenham","town","yesterdai","tottenham","town","alreadi","thei","re","part","town","thei","go","tottenham","fan","want","fight","fan","last","place","earth","thei","bank","station","probabl","much","secur","camera","anywher","els","worldbr","br","sever","similar","error","big","fail","actor","plai","lead","hooligan","clearli","decid","worth","try","speak","east","end","accent","instead","opt","dick","van","dyk","styl","mocknei","make","ear","ble","accentu","fact","rest","hi","gang","speak","wai","expect","west","ham","fan","speak","thi","error","make","unbeliev","role","realli","spoil","film"],"filtered2":["sure","peopl","watch","move","outsid","britian","entertain","watch","someon","uk","pain","errorsbr","right","start","elijah","wood","get","tube","bank","station","trash","sister","meet","happen","repli","oh","tottenham","town","yesterdai","tottenham","town","alreadi","re","part","town","go","tottenham","fan","want","fight","fan","last","place","earth","bank","station","probabl","secur","camera","anywher","els","worldbr","sever","similar","error","big","fail","actor","plai","lead","hooligan","clearli","decid","worth","try","speak","east","end","accent","instead","opt","dick","van","dyk","styl","mocknei","make","ear","ble","accentu","fact","rest","gang","speak","wai","expect","west","ham","fan","speak","error","make","unbeliev","role","realli","spoil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,13,23,24,33,36,37,40,41,61,68,71,82,94,97,119,121,128,130,139,140,144,148,152,157,164,195,196,215,219,226,231,232,234,249,275,316,330,344,350,380,450,459,494,522,559,571,585,591,655,671,791,818,997,1090,1193,1259,1265,1292,1309,1789,1838,1865,1913,2200,2582,2622,3130,3458,3545,4137,4573,4807,7891],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,13,23,24,33,36,37,40,41,61,68,71,82,94,97,119,121,128,130,139,140,144,148,152,157,164,195,196,215,219,226,231,232,234,249,275,316,330,344,350,380,450,459,494,522,559,571,585,591,655,671,791,818,997,1090,1193,1259,1265,1292,1309,1789,1838,1865,1913,2200,2582,2622,3130,3458,3545,4137,4573,4807,7891],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,2.020196584395323,2.08112281984698,2.0545557924622586,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.3409902041158843,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,6.951509327991294,2.2931108769894046,2.3018654096236517,2.3131195476980753,2.3360150694757706,2.3930275298746078,2.51289241584188,2.478925055209576,2.605934685587711,2.5792094178355414,2.5940874818617203,2.7049353070058615,2.8377834061292515,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.7832848715031413,2.878207028279898,2.9292757465539174,8.949280493839161,3.0135689919434205,3.102062070196872,10.409953729416351,3.2829611516442836,3.324316337326197

{"value":"This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house. The father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California, and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best education possible.<br /><br />Things really become funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, comes to lives with the group.<br /><br />The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood.<br /><br />Jessica Walter costars as a woman who wants Murray to move in with her since she wants a companion.<br /><br />Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in towards the end. They play Murray's brother and sister-in-law respectively; they're also the parents of Tomei. In front of the children, Reiner lets loose reminding Murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along.<br /><br />The film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around Beverly Hills in their car. I guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self-esteem.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","stori","of","a","jewish","dysfunct","famili","the","parent","have","divorc","and","mom","remain","back","east","in","the","hous","the","father","murrai","abromowitz","move","with","hi","child","to","california","and","move","around","beverli","hill","so","that","hi","child","can","get","the","well","educ","possiblebr","br","thing","realli","becom","funni","when","marisa","tomei","murrai","niec","come","to","live","with","the","groupbr","br","the","film","deal","with","the","variou","adventur","of","the","famili","complic","by","the","drug","scene","of","the","affluent","neighborhoodbr","br","jessica","walter","costar","a","a","woman","who","want","murrai","to","move","in","with","her","sinc","she","want","a","companionbr","br","carl","reiner","and","rita","moreno","come","in","toward","the","end","thei","plai","murrai","brother","and","sisterinlaw","respect","thei","re","conjur","the","parent","of","tomei","in","front","of","the","child","reiner","let","loos","remind","murrai","that","he","have","be","pai","the","bill","for","them","all","alongbr","br","the","film","end","on","a","sour","note","a","the","embarrass","famili","move","out","of","their","fanci","dig","and","take","to","ride","around","beverli","hill","in","their","car","i","guess","the","film","be","promot","independ","and","some","good","old","selfesteem"],"filtered":["thi","stori","jewish","dysfunct","famili","parent","divorc","mom","remain","back","east","hous","father","murrai","abromowitz","move","hi","child","california","move","around","beverli","hill","hi","child","get","well","educ","possiblebr","br","thing","realli","becom","funni","marisa","tomei","murrai","niec","come","live","groupbr","br","film","deal","variou","adventur","famili","complic","drug","scene","affluent","neighborhoodbr","br","jessica","walter","costar","woman","want","murrai","move","sinc","want","companionbr","br","carl","reiner","rita","moreno","come","toward","end","thei","plai","murrai","brother","sisterinlaw","respect","thei","re","conjur","parent","tomei","front","child","reiner","let","loos","remind","murrai","pai","bill","alongbr","br","film","end","sour","note","embarrass","famili","move","fanci","dig","take","ride","around","beverli","hill","car","guess","film","promot","independ","good","old","selfesteem"],"filtered2":["stori","jewish","dysfunct","famili","parent","divorc","mom","remain","back","east","hous","father","murrai","abromowitz","move","child","california","move","around","beverli","hill","child","get","well","educ","possiblebr","thing","realli","becom","funni","marisa","tomei","murrai","niec","come","live","groupbr","deal","variou","adventur","famili","complic","drug","scene","affluent","neighborhoodbr","jessica","walter","costar","woman","want","murrai","move","sinc","want","companionbr","carl","reiner","rita","moreno","come","toward","end","plai","murrai","brother","sisterinlaw","respect","re","conjur","parent","tomei","front","child","reiner","let","loos","remind","murrai","pai","bill","alongbr","end","sour","note","embarrass","famili","move","fanci","dig","take","ride","around","beverli","hill","car","guess","promot","independ","good","old","selfesteem"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,13,17,19,20,24,29,31,34,37,39,40,62,63,67,68,70,98,115,116,124,162,180,182,213,243,275,284,322,342,381,468,557,560,563,644,670,682,695,697,722,773,940,942,1002,1018,1076,1121,1210,1477,1714,1800,2024,2103,2317,2462,2467,2545,2582,2675,2785,3126,3568,3812,4440,4943,5326,5481,6433,6773],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,13,17,19,20,24,29,31,34,37,39,40,62,63,67,68,70,98,115,116,124,162,180,182,213,243,275,284,322,342,381,468,557,560,563,644,670,682,695,697,722,773,940,942,1002,1018,1076,1121,1210,1477,1714,1800,2024,2103,2317,2462,2467,2545,2582,2675,2785,3126,3568,3812,4440,4943,5326,5481,6433,6773],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,2.7965700178917925,2.975308642954861,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,4.176398159347389,2.201553588425805,2.2466628996789315,2.2323930368088845,2.3586007221245198,8.129194437808064,8.209589017272236,2.8432628718938773,2.627841366673578,11.133139486012565,3.110998680163279,2.885344817328191,3.112795625839981,3.24941502915308,3.304513710030018,3.43462735814388,3.4623020803001006,3.459754308221302,3.5670958631572662,7.452907310683375,3.6497387377608255,3.6284289511740746,3.7952092507568174,3.850067611308864,3.7364704335851586,3.

{"value":"There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth. This movie, \"The Last Unicorn,\" \"Flight of Dragons\" and \"The Hobbit.\" I own copies of both \"Dragons\" and \"The Hobbit\" (both excellent) and I hadn't seen \"The Last Unicorn\" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I hadn't. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often inane. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. We're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! The story itself isn't that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent. Not even close. On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball. This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day, but it just got cut. I don't think I could ever sit through that crap fest again.

{"value":"After a quasi-Gothic, all-fruity music video, the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself. In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll. We don't live n that world. The insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence. When I say clown, I mean actual clown. He tell them they're all going to die via Cassidy's ghost (the spirit possesses Dora, one of the band-mates) We couldn't care less as the characters are all boring, vapid, and extremely horribly acted. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly apropos surname if there ever was one), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who after The attendant, and Tower of blood, HAS to know that he keeps making crap for a living), this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake. Not enough blood to appease gore-hounds, nor enough nudity to satisfy pervs. This movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Eye Candy:

{"value":"This is almost like two films--one literate and engaging, the other stupid and clichéd. It's really a shame all the problems weren't worked out with the writing, but considering how quickly most B-movies were written and produced, this isn't too unusual. It's a real shame, though, as this could have been a very good film.<br /><br />First the good. The movie is original and involves WWII code-breakers. This is pretty fascinating and I liked watching the leading man (Lee Bowman) go through his paces as a master code-breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But now for the bad, the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes. Additionally, Jean Rogers' role as the \"kooky girlfriend\" must rank as one of the worst-written and distracting roles in film history!! For every smart move made by Bowman, the idiot Rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided \"comedy relief\".

{"value":"The movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.<br /><br />I honestly didn't like the style of the movie. I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much of it. The movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all. It gives the comic book like experience. However it's visually numbing the viewer, it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs, monotonic scenes, dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises.<br /><br />The movie's storyline is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts.<br /><br />I will say openly that this

{"value":"I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene. He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good.

{"value":"This seems like two films: one a dreary, pretentious lengthy saga about an ac-tor who is taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. She drops heavy hints about the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game. I love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain, and her terrible seducing outfit of navel-revealing, puff-sleeved crochet top.<br /><br />Do actors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know they Oscars for impersonating disabled people, wearing a lot of prosthetics, or pretending to be mad. The Shakespearean scenes (which go ON and ON) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the 'going mad' scenes where Tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over.<br /><br />By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy.

{"value":"For this review,a list of good points and bad points.I'll start with the bad.<br /><br />Bad points:The casting choices(especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg),the acting of said badly chosen cast,the storyline,the idea of setting the film in the modern day,the direction,the editing,the soundtrack,and above all,the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with,despite it's popularity.<br /><br />Good points:Jessica Simpson in a red bikini............that's it!<br /><br />One might make an analogy here.In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke struts her way up to Michael Weston as Enos,and asks the question,\"Enos,where's Boss Hogg and Roscoe?\",in his clouded judgment, tells her where they are.She might just as well

{"value":"The acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg.......not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also don't BLOCK for someone. Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck.......although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped the person, which is illigal. Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates.

{"value":"I didnt think it was possible, but i have found film worse than 'Body Melt'. This film is really really bad! And what makes it worse is that its another Australian film...<br /><br />Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible 80's rock soundtrack, it just keep getting worse and worse, which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is (skinned male hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone?).<br /><br />And why do their accents keep changing? From bad New York drawl, to prissy english, then pure Aussie! And it happens to the whole cast!<br /><br />This film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (i believe it was the Utah Film Festival). This has to be a lie because no-one in their right mind would nominate this for anything (perhaps the Golden Rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell).<br /><br />Come on guys! This film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100!!!

{"value":"The cover of box of this movie has Kyle Minogue's name on it, but she has the same destiny as Drew Barrymore did in \"Scream.\" That's the first thing that makes this movie lame; they are trying to market a movie with someone that's in it for 5 minutes.<br /><br />Of course, we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around. To top it all off, Molly Ringwald of 80's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in Australia so she won't get ridiculed in the states.<br /><br />Either way, this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that's in it. Throughout the movie, we're supposed to guess who's the killer. Long story short, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day...or does she?<br /><br />This move is just plain bad, rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf.

{"value":"I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a surrogate movie about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned <br /><br />The story is about Maddox , a Chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime . The major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him Blake Shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies . You have the gut feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler , Saddam or Bin Laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it's impossible to believe he could rally any disciples . The subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means NEW PORT SOUTH is an entirely unconvincing drama

{"value":"A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but...<br /><br />Rudolph's glowing nose didn't require the \"explanation\" offered in this film - much like The Force in the Star Wars films didn't need the explanation of \"medichlorians in the bloodstream.\" But mainly, the film left me cold because of Winterbolt's over-complicated plot to destroy Santa.

Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the Frosty family...The comedically exaggerated plots of Pinky and the Brain and \"Phineas and Ferb's\" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs) seem simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt's, which we're expected to take somewhat seriously.<br /><br />There is a particularly (and amusingly) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs. I understand if they don't want to have guns being shot in a family film, but then why have guns in the first place?","finished_norm":["a","concept","with","potenti","and","it","be","fun","to","see","thi","two","holidai","icon","togeth","butbr","br","rudolph","glow","nose","do","not","requir","the","explan","offer","in","thi","film","much","like","the","forc","in","the","star","war","film","do","not","ne","the","explan","of","medichlorian","in","the","bloodstream","but","mainli","the","film","leav","me","cold","becaus","of","winterbolt","overcompl","plot","to","destroi","santa","he","get","the","power","to","put","suggest","into","peopl","mind","so","why","doe","he","do","thing","in","such","a","roundabout","wai","break","the","magic","of","rudolph","nose","frame","rudolph","threaten","to","melt","the","frosti","familyth","comed","exagger","plot","of","pinki","and","the","brain","and","phinea","and","ferb","dr","doofenshmirtz","which","be","do","that","wai","on","purpos","and","plai","for","laugh","seem","simpl","and","straightforward","compar","to","winterbolt","which","we","re","expect","to","take","somewhat","seriouslybr","br","there","be","a","particularli","and","amusingli","strang","moment","when","a","charact","throw","her","two","gun","at","the","bad","gui","like","boomerang","i","understand","if","thei","do","not","want","to","have","gun","be","shoot","in","a","famili","film","but","then","why","have","gun","in","the","place"],"filtered":["concept","potenti","fun","see","thi","two","holidai","icon","togeth","butbr","br","rudolph","glow","nose","requir","explan","offer","thi","film","much","like","forc","star","war","film","ne","explan","medichlorian","bloodstream","mainli","film","leav","cold","becaus","winterbolt","overcompl","plot","destroi","santa","get","power","put","suggest","peopl","mind","doe","thing","roundabout","wai","break","magic","rudolph","nose","frame","rudolph","threaten","melt","frosti","familyth","comed","exagger","plot","pinki","brain","phinea","ferb","dr","doofenshmirtz","wai","purpos","plai","laugh","seem","simpl","straightforward","compar","winterbolt","re","expect","take","somewhat","seriouslybr","br","particularli","amusingli","strang","moment","charact","throw","two","gun","bad","gui","like","boomerang","understand","thei","want","gun","shoot","famili","film","gun","place"],"filtered2":["concept","potenti","fun","see","two","holidai","icon","togeth","butbr","rudolph","glow","nose","requir","explan","offer","like","forc","star","war","ne","explan","medichlorian","bloodstream","mainli","leav","cold","becaus","winterbolt","overcompl","plot","destroi","santa","get","power","put","suggest","peopl","mind","doe","thing","roundabout","wai","break","magic","rudolph","nose","frame","rudolph","threaten","melt","frosti","familyth","comed","exagger","plot","pinki","brain","phinea","ferb","dr","doofenshmirtz","wai","purpos","plai","laugh","seem","simpl","straightforward","compar","winterbolt","re","expect","take","somewhat","seriouslybr","particularli","amusingli","strang","moment","charact","throw","two","gun","bad","gui","like","boomerang","understand","want","gun","shoot","famili","gun","place"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,9,10,18,22,23,29,31,32,33,35,37,40,47,55,68,74,100,110,117,130,133,159,164,182,188,212,238,259,270,310,314,338,360,366,417,482,497,501,507,547,596,646,673,726,737,738,739,794,989,1000,1022,1107,1134,1211,1400,1639,1683,1957,1982,2031,2063,2566,2876,4987,6174,7060,7296,7501],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,9,10,18,22,23,29,31,32,33,35,37,40,47,55,68,74,100,110,117,130,133,159,164,182,188,212,238,259,270,310,314,338,360,366,417,482,497,501,507,547,596,646,673,726,737,738,739,794,989,1000,1022,1107,1134,1211,1400,1639,1683,1957,1982,2031,2063,2566,2876,4987,6174,7060,7296,7501],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,3.412938870621443,1.9536997889255368,2.0064197866819473,1.9486336368009016,2.1405462403177813,2.1290479736304078,2.2797301185117202,2.2642139034199635,2.3212364753796515,2.300267965194495,2.3930275298746078,2.7365296724240786,2.5378812223426954,2.5983793339432615,2.597304642813496,2.7464553122240485,2.731603554088023,2.854312708080462,3.189397019426827,2.9720957437368454,3.028335462059722,3.185521045582134,3.1932880749197934,3.3154667220492153,3.342254038012865,10.535956501340243,3.365138331846453,3.432149042129413,3.485528930909917,3.5900195030592035,3.7297814454343623,3.7034641371169887,3.6841709341823097,3.7398317812878634,4.004218291136122,3.7465885637507435,4.044492190274062,8.12

{"value":"The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale`s brilliant QUATERMASS serial was broadcast . The trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he`d be like Victor Caroon from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT stalking the streets of London .<br /><br />No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing . I suppose if you`re a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced , there`s something lacking about THE RACING GAME . One trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way , if it`d been a trailer for THE SWEENEY you`d see Jack Regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who`d done a blag while THE PROFESSIONALS would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside .

{"value":"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting \"comedy\" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty.

{"value":"This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and quite possibly the overall worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed like they were trying way too hard to play their roles as dorks, tough guys, jerks, know it alls, etc. And the bigfoot itself was terrible. It appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At one point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches were chasing after the remaining survivors, one gets shot and as it's running it looked like a poor man's version of donkey kong himself! And one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was just awful animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Way way way too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the entire film. It was never ending. Oh yeah, the movie is boring too. Absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere.

{"value":"I shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing, preachy cinematic trash. Larded with enough Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new-age shop, Starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal-fondling idiot.<br /><br />The plot? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert Earth's impending environmental collapse. But first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a Castro street bar. Fortunately, they've got mystical grandpa Willie Nelson along to help (who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings, as well he ought to be) along with buckets of cheap F/X and reams of pointlessly swelling music.<br /><br />Sure, the clunky script helps to obscure the film's trite plot and staggering pace, but that's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg.

{"value":"Sure it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western. Instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. Make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she is only a tad bit upset by this. Her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it. The killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made. I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out

{"value":"Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity. Unacquainted with the work of the director, I am well-acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro. While not even approaching Ozu in greatness, Hou has communicated nothing of Ozu's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. One of the things he misses entirely is Ozu's attention to character - we are not even \"introduced\" by Hou to his lead character (a perfect blank page). There are no medium or close shots of his people. One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what Hou doesn't - a good look at their faces.<br /><br />There was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like \"Nothing Ever Happens\". That would be a far better title to this pointless exercise. All through the film we are given clues about an obscure Taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, add up to nothing.

{"value":"this movie was a horrible excuse for...a movie. first of all, the casting could have been better; Katelyn the main character looked nothing like her TV mom. <br /><br />also, the plot was pathedic. it was extremely cliché and predictable. the ending was very disappointing and cheesy. (but thats all i'll say about that). <br /><br />the nail in the bag though, was a scene when Katelyn (jordan hinson) was supposed to be crying, but the girl couldn't cry on command! there were no tears streaming down her face, just a few unbelievable sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie Maguire (sp?). thats when the movie went from not-so-good, to just plain bad. it really looked like she was acting. <br /><br />in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990's that everyone's sick of--only worse!<br /><br />i give it an 'F', because it was just so darn hard to sit through (b/t/w, i was babysitting when i saw it). <br /><br />however, you may like

{"value":"This is one of the worst films I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical. First off, there's no plot. The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years.

{"value":"Yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation. As with Juno and the Paycock, you can tell that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or craft to it at all. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple, who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage. Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. This might seem more believable if Fred weren't made out to be a completely insensitive, pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband.

The \"story\" can't end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin.<br /><br />What little romance, sex, or for that matter, anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all.

{"value":"There are pretty landscape shots. Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths. With lesser actors this show would be silly. 'Art must uplift humanity or it's BS.' Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. The lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side. Wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes. There wasn't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain. All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters was grade school, trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted. I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here. I had to dig deep to see those i agreed with. I figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie. I was moved only once towards the end. The kid was way too passive. The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous.

{"value":"If there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. One would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would help make up for the presences of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity)... But, no. Apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. The entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with or even tolerate them. With rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. There's no plot to speak of, no character development (these people won't EVER develop), no break-out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Its title.

{"value":"Oliver Hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is, they don't exist--Ollie apparently made them up! So, it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />This isn't a particularly unique story idea, as I've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernon's DON'T KID ME. It is much better than ONE TOO MANY--probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later--when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick. Now I am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. Sadly, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas.<br /><br />Overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment.

{"value":"Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re-imagining Scooby-Doo and company.<br /><br />Shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they're on about yet with the villain angle, but it surely isn't following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows.<br /><br />And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me; this might, too.<br /><br />It's worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly. Besides, I am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes.

{"value":"I will warn you here: I chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasn't an action film in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alright.<br /><br />I am here to tell you that they were wrong. Completely wrong.<br /><br />Well, no, not completely; it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick, they were right about that. But it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as well.<br /><br />Tom Beringer wasn't too bad, I suppose, no worse than usual; but what possessed them to cast Billy Zane in this? Was it some sort of death wish on the part of the producers? A way to made their film a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked.<br /><br />If they were actually aiming for success, then why not cast somebody who can act? Oh, and might as well go for a screenwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct.<br /><br />As someone who sat through this mess, actually believing it would shortly redeem itself, I can assure you it never did.

{"value":"I wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this might be a good show..This show is only good if you don't know what \"talent\" is..I won't even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to a lot of people) because thats not really what bothers me about the show.. What bothers me is that people watch this and think it's funny..It makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and I'm actually scared that it will one day be run by people who watch this garbage..<br /><br />Basically the plot is simple..it's about an offensive,self centered,spoiled women(Sarah Silvermen) getting through everyday life..<br /><br />Thats it..Like that hasn't been done a million times..In fact almost every joke either has been done or is racist..<br /><br />Sarah also likes to sing..I like her voice..thats it..not the lyrics..The lyrics are dreadful..which she likes to sing about a lot of things..<br /><br />If you like to see a hot women put everyone else down and make them feel like crap while at the same time farting and saying crap about every race then this

{"value":"Jason Lee's pecks are back! If that's what you are looking for, look no further. If not, better move on...<br /><br />But about the movie. Clichés galore, some poorly shot but kinda exotic fight scenes (used JKD) and lots of bad acting & cheap effects. Poor Lee looks like he's in pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. Not a pleasant comeback.<br /><br />The movie doesn't even cut it as a B-movie - sure, there was a Germanish bleached blonde Rutger-wannabe bad guy, but no gratuitous sex scene or even a single booty shots. None. Zip. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2 they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes (as for rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classic cinema excellence, please refer to our upcoming review on that mind-blowing sequel...). I did get the feeling that the writer was taking his revenge on somebody with this - thus I won't get into the \"plot\" of the movie or pretty much anything else related.

{"value":"This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone, I am writing this.<br /><br />\"Live Feed\" is like an Asian version of 1976's \"The Incredible Torture Show\" (aka \"Blood Sucking Freaks\") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it's all here along with a third-grade script, pathetic acting, and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy.<br /><br />The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace, yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.)
