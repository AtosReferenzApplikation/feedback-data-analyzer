{"value":"It used to be my thinking that movies required plots, or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on. This movie has showed me that you don't actually have to have anything like that.<br /><br />I could sum it up simply as that. But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of pretty. not compelling in the slightest. The way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days, but there is no passage of time and i'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour.<br /><br />If you are looking to entertain yourself, then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up. It would be a far better use of your time. Time that you will never get back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled off better than this movie.","finished_norm":["it","us","to","be","my","think","that","movi","requir","plot","or","some","other","mean","of","make","you","care","at","all","about","the","stori","line","or","anyth","that","be","go","on","thi","movi","have","show","me","that","you","do","not","actual","have","to","have","anyth","like","thatbr","br","i","can","sum","it","up","simpli","a","that","but","imdb","want","me","to","have","much","line","it","be","kind","of","pretti","not","compel","in","the","slight","the","wai","the","charact","talk","in","the","movi","make","you","think","it","should","have","take","place","over","a","matt","of","dai","but","there","be","no","passag","of","time","and","i","be","pretti","sure","it","all","happen","in","a","hourbr","br","if","you","be","look","to","entertain","yourself","then","bui","a","gallon","of","milk","and","see","how","fast","you","can","drink","it","befor","throw","up","it","would","be","a","far","well","us","of","your","time","time","that","you","will","never","get","back","jurass","park","be","pull","off","well","than","thi","movi"],"filtered":["us","think","movi","requir","plot","mean","make","care","stori","line","anyth","go","thi","movi","show","actual","anyth","like","thatbr","br","sum","simpli","imdb","want","much","line","kind","pretti","compel","slight","wai","charact","talk","movi","make","think","take","place","matt","dai","passag","time","pretti","sure","happen","hourbr","br","look","entertain","bui","gallon","milk","see","fast","drink","befor","throw","far","well","us","time","time","never","get","back","jurass","park","pull","well","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["us","think","requir","plot","mean","make","care","stori","line","anyth","go","show","actual","anyth","like","thatbr","sum","simpli","imdb","want","line","kind","pretti","compel","slight","wai","charact","talk","make","think","take","place","matt","dai","passag","time","pretti","sure","happen","hourbr","look","entertain","bui","gallon","milk","see","fast","drink","befor","throw","far","well","us","time","time","never","get","back","jurass","park","pull","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,10,12,16,17,20,28,31,32,33,37,42,52,56,63,78,79,88,94,101,104,107,119,122,132,164,186,195,201,205,310,347,408,542,544,592,667,935,989,1148,1254,1440,1589,3016,4320,5051,8337],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,10,12,16,17,20,28,31,32,33,37,42,52,56,63,78,79,88,94,101,104,107,119,122,132,164,186,195,201,205,310,347,408,542,544,592,667,935,989,1148,1254,1440,1589,3016,4320,5051,8337],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,2.825681057716235,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.7122153074726136,3.7221218701403576,1.8729627573220065,4.012839573363895,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,4.145648034064571,4.287906797278791,2.1653408989309972,2.2489347673732487,2.253494045787767,2.3930275298746078,2.571852579609833,2.51289241584188,2.561435818751577,2.571852579609833,2.854312708080462,3.0151989841543516,3.130944944345658,3.4471119148061256,3.4222967456864013,3.509308122676031,3.6652429242967908,4.135246553542527,4.044492190274062,4.176068548062782,4.34596758485818,4.449957298382227,4.558366596889411,5.501738287366237,5.9370563586240825,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.482940951069917E-5,8.42573849708715E-5,8.49124057954626E-5,8.442178101017427E-5,8.44231641660078E-5,8.430515745347548E-5,8.455589280398782E-5,8.426951748375306E-5,8.445898607893923E-5,9.370263462019308E-5,0.8822183182328356,8.413348790315793E-5,8.570379773331989E-5,8.692638124019785E-5,8.41948371648648E-5,8.396215896159286E-5,8.605648998884659E-5,8.456381505288892E-5,8.430145614611028E-5,8.437132706471174E-5,8.518766913884108E-5,8.464759639494305E-5,8.47439805250232E-5,8.483528265922918E-5,0.033734414882460616,8.503928032620602E-5,8.861417012023196E-5,8.415850001769464E-5,8.4160751454659E-5,8.437397224253901E-5,0.07750545847939824,8.455891530191926E-5,9.07668324453667E-5,8.479676705259269E-5,8.425010276025677E-5,8.46389725227349E-5,8.41656820518963E-5,8.421541777752524E-5,8.396173712891762E-5,8.398352067717087E-5,8.417255737544576E-5,8.506039949925837E-5,8.462817186433203E-5,8.429357572965732E-5,8.531783106198462E-5,8.432592806464247E-5,8.712765990800752E-5,8.584642227280427E-5,8.400439517326563E-5,8.419005002381988E-5,8.416084974259712E-5,8.652945241853949E-5,8.419130261126304E-5,8.397606485965031E-5,8.489782235049255E-5,8.421298805583624E-5,9.056181340726968E-5,8.414358561125595E-5,8.4003

How could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly? Will they ever get a decent job again? <br /><br />Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot, etc.<br /><br />And to the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s.

{"value":"6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens \"storywise\", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one.

{"value":"I wouldn't say this totally sucked, but if it wasn't for Netflix I wouldn't even have this in my house. Steve Martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat. He's just not funny. He's another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie. The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original. Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately. The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant. The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts, but it seems to simple simmer along, not really entertaining or creating

{"value":"I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, I write the review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichéd dialog but even dull, clichéd musical numbers. Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. They're both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty one-note.

{"value":"Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90's movie psycho killer. The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies. One of my most horrible movie experiences.

{"value":"Making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget deficiencies is an often-used strategy in low-budget horror films, but this one takes it too far. It is SO poorly lit and murky (and it takes place almost entirely at night, to boot) that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen (although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that). Alas, \"murky\" is also the best word to describe the movie's plot. The filmmakers throw in diverse (and unoriginal) horror ideas without any semblance of logic, and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror

{"value":"The bad news is it's still really dreadful. I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny.<br /><br />It's supposed to be better than \"Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker\", and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I was drinking heavily when I watched it and felt generous. Whatever, \"2\" it is.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty quick. It takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and fight scenes, hacks them up, dumbs them way down, dirties up the dialog, and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video.<br /><br />You'd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one. And get this DVD back to the video store on time!

{"value":"Now what's wrong with the actors that took part in that crap? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? Liked him there... Well, whatever - what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters is even likable, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic whatsoever for what's happening. I got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of \"Attack of the killer tomatoes\" kind of thing. Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet...<br /><br />If you happen to see it on TV, switch channels - your TV set will be

{"value":"The plot for Descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. And no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw.<br /><br />If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch \"Descent\", take a nap instead - you'll probably

{"value":"The Japenese sense of pacing, editing and musical score must be different than American tastes, but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work.<br /><br />Someone in Hollywood needs to re-make this movie and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and creepy. There's something about the edges of the city, gritty policemen, earthquakes, sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating. However, this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter.<br /><br />I do have to say that the \"sixth-sense\" effect was in full force in this movie, and that

{"value":"If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he is unable to fend for himself, so Scott takes him in.<br /><br />I have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to \"wrestle\" and Scott tells Billy that he is \"still sore from last night,\" among other things.<br /><br />Wonderful catch phrases like \"Shut the sh!t up\" and \"Ping Pang Pong, cut the sh!t\" will keep you laughing for hours. The native American guys that are supposed to be playing Mexican gang members are also top notch. As they say, it's \"party time right now. Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba.\" I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh your a$$ off.

{"value":"An absolutely wretched waste of film!! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. The constant and BRUTAL attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place, because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves them no place to stay, in a heavy storm? I think not. Oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields. umm, yeah. Sure. Or, they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality, and stay at the 'haunted' train station. A station which proved to be nothing but DEADLY BORING, utterly without ghosts, interest, or plot.<br /><br />So very terribly dull that this seems impossible.<br /><br />This ought to be added to the

{"value":"I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and movie were a ripoff of Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes he were Olivier, and Reeves wishes he were Caine. Caine even had the nerve to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one that did the remake of \"Alfie\"? <br /><br />This movie was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award winning movies such as this, and \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\". What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the $5.97 bin at Walmart.

{"value":"Neat premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all. I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all! Unfortunately, the same can't be said for his gal. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck.<br /><br />Lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper (still have nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand. I admit I was intrigued to see what the mysterious \"thing\" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HA HA HA!! The girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived.

{"value":"Terrible movie. Nuff Said.<br /><br />These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The acting sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene. The movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage.<br /><br />OK now I am just going to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum. First I waste my time watching this offal. Then feeling compelled to warn others I create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is.

{"value":"Hobgoblins....Hobgoblins....where do I begin?!?<br /><br />This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst film ever made. This one is fun to laugh at, where as Manos was just painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: \"80's cheeze\". The acting (and I am using this term loosely) is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see, and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to watch this mess. This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done. If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots.....God help you!!","finished_norm":["hobgoblinshobgoblinswher","do","i","beginbr","br","thi","film","give","mano","the","hand","of","fate","and","futur","war","a","run","for","their","monei","a","the","wrong","film","ever","make","thi","on","be","fun","to","laugh","at","where","a","mano","be","just","pain","to","watch","hobgoblin","will","end","up","in","a","time","capsul","somewher","a","the","perfect","movi","to","describ","the","term","cheez","the","act","and","i","be","us","thi","term","loos","be","atroci","the","hobgoblin","be","some","of","the","wrong","puppet","you","will","ever","see","and","the","garden","tool","fight","have","to","be","see","to","be","believ","the","movi","be","the","perfect","vehicl","for","mstk","and","that","version","be","the","onli","wai","to","watch","thi","mess","thi","movi","give","mike","and","the","bot","lot","of","ammunit","to","pull","some","of","the","funni","onelin","thei","have","ever","do","if","you","try","to","watch","thi","without","the","help","of","mike","and","the","botsgod","help","you"],"filtered":["hobgoblinshobgoblinswher","beginbr","br","thi","film","give","mano","hand","fate","futur","war","run","monei","wrong","film","ever","make","thi","fun","laugh","mano","pain","watch","hobgoblin","end","time","capsul","somewher","perfect","movi","describ","term","cheez","act","us","thi","term","loos","atroci","hobgoblin","wrong","puppet","ever","see","garden","tool","fight","see","believ","movi","perfect","vehicl","mstk","version","onli","wai","watch","thi","mess","thi","movi","give","mike","bot","lot","ammunit","pull","funni","onelin","thei","ever","try","watch","thi","without","help","mike","botsgod","help"],"filtered2":["hobgoblinshobgoblinswher","beginbr","give","mano","hand","fate","futur","war","run","monei","wrong","ever","make","fun","laugh","mano","pain","watch","hobgoblin","end","time","capsul","somewher","perfect","describ","term","cheez","act","us","term","loos","atroci","hobgoblin","wrong","puppet","ever","see","garden","tool","fight","see","believ","perfect","vehicl","mstk","version","onli","wai","watch","mess","give","mike","bot","lot","ammunit","pull","funni","onelin","ever","try","watch","without","help","mike","botsgod","help"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,11,21,24,25,30,33,36,44,56,62,72,91,125,126,133,137,185,220,232,235,259,314,407,459,544,668,677,804,844,858,940,1219,1327,1424,1547,1697,2143,2263,2345,2565,3669,4435,6263,6968],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,11,21,24,25,30,33,36,44,56,62,72,91,125,126,133,137,185,220,232,235,259,314,407,459,544,668,677,804,844,858,940,1219,1327,1424,1547,1697,2143,2263,2345,2565,3669,4435,6263,6968],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,2.6728839783437044,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,4.814188177507422,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,1.9209463754160525,2.0105926690411424,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,5.037666054744002,2.8336934208777267,2.8377834061292515,2.6457189377809835,2.7464553122240485,3.189397019426827,3.120015873813468,3.2829611516442836,3.4222967456864013,3.5813614403160887,7.311823193735813,3.7740817043309423,3.8690435127678695,7.753471716782051,3.952924996748572,4.246178114249808,9.226564708971052,4.470719289830655,4.77960356993304,4.6973654716960676,5.00274712124725,5.1994574154933035,5.214056214914456,5.274680836730892,12.596139408322827,12.132536180208179,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.662318508751206E-5,6.617392937523776E-5,6.668836857603644E-5,6.630304247194911E-5,6.630412877265113E-5,6.62114488507236E-5,6.640837097668818E-5,6.61834579886744E-5,6.633226252896494E-5,7.359202434034704E-5,0.5014209059051186,6.607662329563998E-5,6.730991070224894E-5,6.827010136882899E-5,6.612480568004245E-5,6.594206524731008E-5,6.758690757814873E-5,6.641459293977728E-5,6.62085419239033E-5,6.62634170334799E-5,6.690455445755431E-5,6.648039299533289E-5,6.655609100826103E-5,6.662779773145027E-5,6.71391318492149E-5,6.678801309075564E-5,6.959565428251483E-5,6.60962672698916E-5,6.609803549983044E-5,6.626549449898382E-5,6.767395207163957E-5,6.64107447812481E-5,7.128630875418455E-5,6.659754840631054E-5,6.616821008438768E-5,6.647361999246031E-5,6.610190788435165E-5,6.614096924848409E-5,6.594173394904264E-5,6.595884227710376E-5,6.610730761489337E-5,6.680459963289094E-5,6.64651373887502E-5,6.620235281511496E-5,0.4406218579407558,6.622776163988647E-5,6.842818128494534E-5,6.742192493347956E-5,6.597523665524396E-5,6.612104596291468E-5,6.609811269305305E-5,6.795836204983045E-5,6.612202971802444E-5,6.595298663914143E-5,6.667691505350154E-5,6.613906099757523E-5,7.11252912

Ashley is to contact Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life. When the psychic starts getting attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. Still this movie was over-hyped.","finished_norm":["the","love","eva","longoria","parker","plai","kate","who","die","after","a","ic","angel","crush","her","befor","the","i","do","with","fiancé","henrypaul","rudd","after","two","year","henri","have","yet","to","move","on","and","hi","sister","chloelindsai","sloanei","veri","concern","chloe","arrang","for","henri","to","talk","with","a","attract","psychic","ashleylak","bell","ashlei","be","to","contact","kate","spirit","hope","to","help","henri","get","on","with","hi","life","when","the","psychic","start","get","attract","to","henri","kate","ghost","appear","to","nip","the","romanc","in","the","bud","there","be","some","funni","situat","but","if","you","have","see","the","trailer","you","have","see","the","substanc","of","the","film","conjur","in","the","cast","stephen","root","jason","bigg","william","morgan","sheppard","and","wendi","mclendoncovei","i","person","think","that","bell","steal","the","show","from","parker","and","bigg","a","usual","a","pain","in","the","butt","still","thi","movi","be","overhyp"],"filtered":["love","eva","longoria","parker","plai","kate","die","ic","angel","crush","befor","fiancé","henrypaul","rudd","two","year","henri","yet","move","hi","sister","chloelindsai","sloanei","veri","concern","chloe","arrang","henri","talk","attract","psychic","ashleylak","bell","ashlei","contact","kate","spirit","hope","help","henri","get","hi","life","psychic","start","get","attract","henri","kate","ghost","appear","nip","romanc","bud","funni","situat","see","trailer","see","substanc","film","conjur","cast","stephen","root","jason","bigg","william","morgan","sheppard","wendi","mclendoncovei","person","think","bell","steal","show","parker","bigg","usual","pain","butt","still","thi","movi","overhyp"],"filtered2":["love","eva","longoria","parker","plai","kate","die","ic","angel","crush","befor","fiancé","henrypaul","rudd","two","year","henri","yet","move","sister","chloelindsai","sloanei","veri","concern","chloe","arrang","henri","talk","attract","psychic","ashleylak","bell","ashlei","contact","kate","spirit","hope","help","henri","get","life","psychic","start","get","attract","henri","kate","ghost","appear","nip","romanc","bud","funni","situat","see","trailer","see","substanc","conjur","cast","stephen","root","jason","bigg","william","morgan","sheppard","wendi","mclendoncovei","person","think","bell","steal","show","parker","bigg","usual","pain","butt","still","overhyp"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,12,15,28,39,40,47,54,57,62,64,71,75,79,92,153,169,181,185,186,194,265,275,293,459,473,578,585,648,719,727,874,892,894,950,1036,1339,1347,1362,1439,1593,1612,1947,1978,2023,2042,2087,2160,2434,2568,2900,2932,3057,3673,3817,4029,4417,5899,7028,7146,7875],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,12,15,28,39,40,47,54,57,62,64,71,75,79,92,153,169,181,185,186,194,265,275,293,459,473,578,585,648,719,727,874,892,894,950,1036,1339,1347,1362,1439,1593,1612,1947,1978,2023,2042,2087,2160,2434,2568,2900,2932,3057,3673,3817,4029,4417,5899,7028,7146,7875],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.5932680941439847,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.5452294193519092,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.0489535369135887,2.3409902041158843,2.4214486257841834,2.4442286541160034,2.518833027372001,2.571852579609833,2.5378812223426954,2.73529586597515,2.7832848715031413,2.9012296278682137,3.2829611516442836,3.335489637924323,3.575630765607104,3.7165362186843414,7.221036049215089,3.857614816944247,4.096025840389245,3.872882289075035,3.9825254665248626,4.091229668125752,4.125296222689358,4.327618446189983,4.506310234933358,4.566029469634981,4.396611317676934,4.477736862489302,15.00824136374175,20.10737869130524,10.179516996473758,4.979216623837056,10.518353300389853,5.274680836730892,4.9676558014359795,5.014723312293965,5.116075806554253,10.816424458710827,6.101359409915359,5.770002273960917,5.626901430320244,5.719991853386255,6.032366538428407,5.9370563586240825,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,6.660975197850782,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.3140875201838706E-5,4.28499661948394E-5,4.318308382245564E-5,4.293357150408469E-5,4.293427492231598E-5,4.287426138588209E-5,4.3001775446483654E-5,4.2856136309981393E-5,0.02394381465366366,4.765344577488057E-5,0.3421797778506444,4.278695705724272E-5,4.358555439278934E-5,0.04370395528993856,4.281815685997961E-5,4.269982594871379E-5,4.3764919693904797E-5,4.300580438825197E-5,4.287237904766888E-5,4.2907912627320206E-5,4.3323071847986265E-5,0.13219995686568703,4.309742940596526E-5,4.3143

{"value":"For all of the hype about this film, I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think. And, although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few \"old time\" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is in its climax. The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body. The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I was seeking most - what REALLY happened to Emma? - was not elucidated upon! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, I felt very cheated. What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible

{"value":"I first read \"Lorna Doone\" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days' journey from London and law and order was much harder to enforce. Sadly, this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The acting and production values are OK but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful. Why do television adaptations do this? Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story??? One of life's great mysteries!!! The BBC made an excellent version which was televised at Christmas in the early 1990s which I am still trying to track down a copy of!

{"value":"This has got to be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. The actors do not act. I can't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in SummersIsle.<br /><br />There is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved. The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire

{"value":"This movie is NOT funny. It just takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). You may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo.

{"value":"Visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. This tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen on the big screen. In fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film, and had me thinking about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream bluescreen. Paltrow is as wooden as they get. This could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp. My only complaint on the technique is that Black & White film (sorry, computer) would of helped because it looks like Turner colorized black and white. Just a big dull cliché mess.

{"value":"This movie is actually worse than most movies I've ever suffered through, and I've suffered through a lot. Absolute nonsense. It's got terrible, forced dialogue; pointless plot developments; really drawn out 'spooky imagery' scenes, which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving said women (forget what you know about virgins! especially ones with lop- sided fake breasts); muttered, difficult to understand speech from some of the characters; and they actually used the masks from Killer Klowns from Outer Space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny, but it isn't.

{"value":"This is the worst piece of crap I have seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is plain stupid, dialogs don't make any sense, humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor. Actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. The script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this flick, the fights. They are well choreographed as one would expect of the Hong Kong guys, and are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun. Although I believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline. However, this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end.

{"value":"I think I've seen worse films, so I'm giving this a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been!! Possibly Xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly Creep (just plain dull), but it is a struggle to think of something worse. It's difficult to know where to start. Let's just say it's a poor man's Under Siege, starring an even poorer man's Jean Claude Van Damme. The only redeeming feature was seeing Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know.<br /><br />Judging from this site, he's been stuck in TV movie hell.... Casper, be more selective.... please!!!!!!!!!!!!

{"value":"to movie,this movie felt like one of those after school specials,only lower budget and lower everything else.i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort,but it didn't work for me.yet some how it comes across as preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance,but so what?there just isn't any excitement in this movie.the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death.of course,the whole movie feels like a bad 80's cliché.the acting was less than stellar,though that has a lot to do with what the actors were given(or in this case-not)to work with.on top of that is the poor song choices,with really bad lyrics.i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved.they are all talented,but you can't tell from this movie.this is just my opinion of course,but i have to give

{"value":"This movie was absolutely ghastly! I cannot fathom how this movie made it to production. Nothing against the cast of the movie, of course, this is all the fault of the writing team. You take the old average plot - let's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or STEP in this case. But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about. With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American setting - this film falls very flat. On a positive note, the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well. Looks like the production budget was very generous as well. My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film.

{"value":"You know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the only amusing parts in it are from the Animal cast. It is a pity then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support & not the other way around, as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout.<br /><br />If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what sort of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would forget this acting lark & do something else, as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry, & awful actors to boot.<br /><br />The main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is funny as if you weren't, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy, tedious & dare I say very plain women leads in

{"value":"The Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller, and one that has improved with time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no character development here, only caricatures (the slut, the authoritative brain, the \"I'm gonna get us outta here\" fellow, the oh so sensitive bookworm). But, seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the \"star\", I guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are laughable. Mewing cherubs, stretchy doors, irritating dead children that can't speak plainly ... and an idiotically sappy ending that does it's darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows. Ill take my Skittles orally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've liked you since \"The Cowboys\".
