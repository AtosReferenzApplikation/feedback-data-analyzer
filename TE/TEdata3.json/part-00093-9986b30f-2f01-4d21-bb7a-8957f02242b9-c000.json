{"value":"The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light-years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at their prime. Sadly, due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame-rates and lovely backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted about 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the films were dirt cheap to make and they'd received several Oscars to \"prove\" that the cartoons were now mainstream. So as a result, lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn't reversed until the 1980s.<br /><br />This UPA film is one of the early ones. The characters are very simply drawn (any simpler and they would have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly--simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap-dash manner (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items).<br /><br />As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude. Some will love this, others will just find it very, very loud. It's the traditional \"Frankie and Johnny\" story and because of the shootings and all, it's probably not a great film for the kids. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, it's not a particularly good film for me, either! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank (which I am, to a degree). However, I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very, very long way and you can't seriously consider them great works of art--just very, very quickly made cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something--anything else!","finished_norm":["the","film","of","upa","be","surprisingli","good","rate","on","imdb","despit","the","fact","that","the","anim","qualiti","be","lightyear","behind","that","of","loonei","toon","disnei","and","mgm","at","their","prime","sadli","due","to","rise","cost","in","make","pretti","cartoon","with","high","framer","and","love","background","the","upa","styl","which","debut","about","begin","to","domin","in","the","late","and","after","all","the","film","be","dirt","cheap","to","make","and","thei","have","receiv","sever","oscar","to","prove","that","the","cartoon","be","now","mainstream","so","a","a","result","lousi","anim","be","becom","the","norm","and","thi","trend","be","not","revers","until","the","sbr","br","thi","upa","film","be","on","of","the","earli","on","the","charact","be","veri","simpli","draw","ani","simpl","and","thei","would","have","us","stick","figur","and","the","background","be","uglysimpl","line","drawe","with","color","add","in","a","veri","slapdash","manner","often","with","a","spong","and","rare","complet","fill","the","itemsbr","br","a","for","the","stori","it","a","jive","stori","with","a","strong","jazz","styl","attitud","some","will","love","thi","other","will","just","find","it","veri","veri","loud","it","the","tradit","franki","and","johnni","stori","and","becaus","of","the","shoot","and","all","it","probabl","not","a","great","film","for","the","kid","heck","becaus","of","the","anim","and","jazz","it","not","a","particularli","good","film","for","me","either","some","will","read","my","review","and","no","doubt","think","i","be","a","crank","which","i","be","to","a","degre","howev","i","love","anim","film","and","a","littl","of","thi","minimalist","upa","styl","go","a","veri","veri","long","wai","and","you","ca","not","serious","consid","them","great","work","of","artjust","veri","veri","quickli","make","cartoon","ignor","the","oscar","and","try","watch","some","classic","cartoon","or","somethinganyth","els"],"filtered":["film","upa","surprisingli","good","rate","imdb","despit","fact","anim","qualiti","lightyear","behind","loonei","toon","disnei","mgm","prime","sadli","due","rise","cost","make","pretti","cartoon","high","framer","love","background","upa","styl","debut","begin","domin","late","film","dirt","cheap","make","thei","receiv","sever","oscar","prove","cartoon","mainstream","result","lousi","anim","becom","norm","thi","trend","revers","sbr","br","thi","upa","film","earli","charact","veri","simpli","draw","ani","simpl","thei","us","stick","figur","background","uglysimpl","line","drawe","color","add","veri","slapdash","manner","often","spong","rare","complet","fill","itemsbr","br","stori","jive","stori","strong","jazz","styl","attitud","love","thi","find","veri","veri","loud","tradit","franki","johnni","stori","becaus","shoot","probabl","great","film","kid","heck","becaus","anim","jazz","particularli","good","film","either","read","review","doubt","think","crank","degre","howev","love","anim","film","littl","thi","minimalist","upa","styl","go","veri","veri","long","wai","ca","serious","consid","great","work","artjust","veri","veri","quickli","make","cartoon","ignor","oscar","try","watch","classic","cartoon","somethinganyth","els"],"filtered2":["upa","surprisingli","good","rate","imdb","despit","fact","anim","qualiti","lightyear","behind","loonei","toon","disnei","mgm","prime","sadli","due","rise","cost","make","pretti","cartoon","high","framer","love","background","upa","styl","debut","begin","domin","late","dirt","cheap","make","receiv","sever","oscar","prove","cartoon","mainstream","result","lousi","anim","becom","norm","trend","revers","sbr","upa","earli","charact","veri","simpli","draw","ani","simpl","us","stick","figur","background","uglysimpl","line","drawe","color","add","veri","slapdash","manner","often","spong","rare","complet","fill","itemsbr","stori","jive","stori","strong","jazz","styl","attitud","love","find","veri","veri","loud","tradit","franki","johnni","stori","becaus","shoot","probabl","great","kid","heck","becaus","anim","jazz","particularli","good","either","read","review","doubt","think","crank","degre","howev","love","anim","littl","minimalist","upa","styl","go","veri","veri","long","wai","ca","serious","consid","great","work","artjust","veri","veri","quickli","make","cartoon","ignor","oscar","try","watch","classic","cartoon","somethinganyth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,7,10,12,14,15,17,22,27,33,36,38,48,51,54,56,78,81,97,99,103,107,113,114,115,117,145,147,148,150,176,196,201,202,207,211,266,277,299,316,317,319,332,351,371,380,391,393,400,415,416,447,497,540,553,567,568,576,592,631,653,705,737,763,771,801,837,841,875,922,956,979,1013,1031,1046,1117,1406,1448,1545,1630,1672,1821,2191,2255,2264,2550,2782,2967,3697,3804,3847,3931,4025,4179,5014,6112,6153,7671,7705],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"When this play was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time. So therefor some people would have found it quite scary, and may well have been impressed with the special effects?<br /><br />Looking at the play in this day and age, It doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Would a train really be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT into a dark tunnel? I don't think so......but if you watch this play again, you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel, rushes straight through the RED LIGHT! (maybe that's how it was in dickens time)?<br /><br />You will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a poor state. Surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the Signalman to climb up or down into the cutting. (i can't help but notice things like that)<br /><br />I will not take anything away from the acting, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveller) gave wonderful performances.<br /><br />I am not at all sure what is going on......I mean was the ghost the traveller, or what??? Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story??? (well maybe i am the only one that don't)???<br /><br />To sum up.....<br /><br />The play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. It suffers from not being that scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and has some rather unusual signalling practises....<br /><br />Thanks for reading my

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten. Avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film, the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico where a top secret American super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through, only to be taken hostage, along with the crew, by a gang of terrorists.<br /><br />This cheap looking (even by 80s standards), boring little action film was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain Mr Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here, edgy and zany as ever (with 'butthorn' being his trademark put down for the bad guys), but without the material to back him up. Henry Silva has presence as a screen villain, but he's totally miscast here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden. He's just one of a host of action film character actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix. After a dull first half without much exciting action, things do pick up a bit at the end, but it's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun.

{"value":"SPOILERS. Strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film. Allow me to add balance by pointing out the following:<br /><br />Script: Dreadful. As Tom and Dan are \"getting to know each other,\" bantering about films, the talk is clearly that of one person, and I suspect it was the director, who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent. At one point, Dan asks, \"Have you heard of the HIV virus?\" and it sounds about as natural as asking, \"Have you communicated with the nine alien races?\"<br /><br />Acting: White teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make. Speedman did well enough with what he was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible -- unsympathetic, unbelievable, and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity. There is an emptiness to his performances (also see Interstate 60).<br /><br />Plot: Spare me! The moments of half-escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak. Recall Marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down: \"They don't work, man!\" Tee-hee. And beware the semi black-and-white flashbacks, which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /><br />Most important of all, most dangerous, evil, and offensive, is the homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says that Dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all -- excuse me, where was Tom while they were having sex?

{"value":"I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. \"Summer Of Sam\" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It's not. It's a gritty, earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of '77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city.<br /><br />The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood, and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat. There's Vinny and his wife Dionna; there's Richie and Ruby, and several other characters.<br /><br />The problem is that these characters are not likable. They are routinely annoying, and at times unbearable. Lee then belabors their high energy, chaotic lives, which are filled with anger, lust, and general turmoil. There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... Over and over I kept wondering: where's the film editor?<br /><br />Meanwhile, with all that bulk, the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the Son of Sam menace, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace, that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good. That, combined with 70's disco music, and lavish attention to costumes and production design, make you really feel like you are in an Italian-American neighborhood in NYC in 1977.<br /><br />The film's atmospheric authenticity, however, is not nearly enough to offset a rambling, overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people.","finished_norm":["i","wish","spike","lee","have","choos","a","differ","titl","for","hi","film","summer","of","sam","convei","the","impress","that","the","film","be","about","the","infam","serial","killer","david","berkowitz","it","not","it","a","gritti","earthi","portrait","of","nyc","street","life","dure","the","hot","summer","of","when","berkowitz","terror","that","citybr","br","the","film","follow","sever","young","fiction","charact","in","a","italianamerican","neighborhood","and","their","reaction","to","the","son","of","sam","threat","there","vinni","and","hi","wife","dionna","there","richi","and","rubi","and","sever","other","charactersbr","br","the","problem","be","that","thi","charact","be","not","likabl","thei","be","routin","annoi","and","at","time","unbear","lee","then","belabor","their","high","energi","chaotic","live","which","be","fill","with","anger","lust","and","gener","turmoil","there","be","at","littl","two","protract","fight","scene","between","vinni","and","hi","wife","redund","disco","danc","scene","countless","gabfest","over","and","over","i","keep","wonder","where","the","film","editorbr","br","meanwhil","with","all","that","bulk","the","film","pass","up","the","chanc","to","convei","ani","real","sens","of","fear","or","dread","aris","from","the","son","of","sam","menac","which","be","too","much","in","the","background","lee","be","much","success","at","show","a","differ","kind","of","menac","that","aris","from","neighborhood","vigilant","groupsbr","br","the","act","be","uniformli","good","that","combin","with","disco","music","and","lavish","attent","to","costum","and","product","design","make","you","realli","feel","like","you","be","in","a","italianamerican","neighborhood","in","nyc","in","br","br","the","film","atmospher","authent","howev","be","not","nearli","enough","to","offset","a","rambl","overblown","script","about","the","live","of","grossli","irrit","peopl"],"filtered":["wish","spike","lee","choos","differ","titl","hi","film","summer","sam","convei","impress","film","infam","serial","killer","david","berkowitz","gritti","earthi","portrait","nyc","street","life","dure","hot","summer","berkowitz","terror","citybr","br","film","follow","sever","young","fiction","charact","italianamerican","neighborhood","reaction","son","sam","threat","vinni","hi","wife","dionna","richi","rubi","sever","charactersbr","br","problem","thi","charact","likabl","thei","routin","annoi","time","unbear","lee","belabor","high","energi","chaotic","live","fill","anger","lust","gener","turmoil","littl","two","protract","fight","scene","vinni","hi","wife","redund","disco","danc","scene","countless","gabfest","keep","wonder","film","editorbr","br","meanwhil","bulk","film","pass","chanc","convei","ani","real","sens","fear","dread","aris","son","sam","menac","much","background","lee","much","success","show","differ","kind","menac","aris","neighborhood","vigilant","groupsbr","br","act","uniformli","good","combin","disco","music","lavish","attent","costum","product","design","make","realli","feel","like","italianamerican","neighborhood","nyc","br","br","film","atmospher","authent","howev","nearli","enough","offset","rambl","overblown","script","live","grossli","irrit","peopl"],"filtered2":["wish","spike","lee","choos","differ","titl","summer","sam","convei","impress","infam","serial","killer","david","berkowitz","gritti","earthi","portrait","nyc","street","life","dure","hot","summer","berkowitz","terror","citybr","follow","sever","young","fiction","charact","italianamerican","neighborhood","reaction","son","sam","threat","vinni","wife","dionna","richi","rubi","sever","charactersbr","problem","charact","likabl","routin","annoi","time","unbear","lee","belabor","high","energi","chaotic","live","fill","anger","lust","gener","turmoil","littl","two","protract","fight","scene","vinni","wife","redund","disco","danc","scene","countless","gabfest","keep","wonder","editorbr","meanwhil","bulk","pass","chanc","convei","ani","real","sens","fear","dread","aris","son","sam","menac","background","lee","success","show","differ","kind","menac","aris","neighborhood","vigilant","groupsbr","act","uniformli","good","combin","disco","music","lavish","attent","costum","product","design","make","realli","feel","like","italianamerican","neighborhood","nyc","atmospher","authent","howev","nearli","enough","offset","rambl","overblown","script","live","grossli","irrit","peopl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,8,10,13,14,19,21,23,27,28,43,47,75,77,80,93,113,116,118,122,134,135,167,173,175,190,204,211,225,232,239,252,260,263,264,271,316,399,418,434,486,487,492,532,553,570,584,611,636,664,666,675,681,776,801,812,835,916,959,968,995,1058,1133,1336,1373,1384,1438,1449,1573,1613,1727,1818,1962,2389,2456,2516,2532,2546,2591,2655,2851,3093,3103,3299,3602,4100,4158,4507,4566,4736,4946,5119,5202,5227,5377,5510,5833,5964,6013,6372,6468,7933,8459],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but I didn't think it was THAT bad. I've seen much worse, actually.<br /><br />\"The House Where Evil Dwells\" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who move into an old house in Japan. Little do they know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.<br /><br />I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was corny, but I've seen worse in my day. The ghost sequences were a little over-done, we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. I may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film \"Ju-On: The Grudge\" and the American remake of that film ripped this off a little. The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc. But I may be wrong.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot.

{"value":"I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I have ever seen is awful, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a \"sleazy\" piece of trash, he is quite right. Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know. The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits. A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role. I think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie. I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free.

{"value":"This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. The actress replacing Jean Reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101. How this pile got through no one can tell. It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries.

{"value":"With a title \"borrowed\" from Werner Herzog and liberal helpings of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our British cinema churns out. \"Robert Carmichael\" (for short) sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the Iraq war. The problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the fetid imaginings of \"extreme\" filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists. As a critique of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual)is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about. There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. Like Kubrick and Noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film. People liked \"Clockwork Orange\" and \"Irreversible\" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years. (I am not against violence in film. To do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered Alex in \"Clockwork Orange\" showing how Kubrick's supposed intent was missed by miles. Gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art-film

{"value":"With a title like \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!\", anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. It's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody splashed in. Unfortunately, it falls flat very soon.<br /><br />You're never supposed to take this movie seriously, I realize that, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? I found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (i.e, the side-by-side phone conversations, the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereal, Superman walking by Lois, etc.). \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't make it. A cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film.<br /><br />There is one good actress in the entire thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to overact, and is a natural comedienne. Unfortunately, she is put to bad use here.<br /><br />\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" is not as funny as, say, \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" or \"Kentucky Fried Movie\", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so I would still recommend seeing it once. Avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly \"lost\" footage dubbed in a pretend African dialect (it can be found in English on the out of print tape).","finished_norm":["with","a","titl","like","attack","of","the","killer","tomato","anyon","go","into","thi","thing","would","be","expect","either","a","a","bad","scienc","fiction","movi","or","b","a","comedi","make","fun","of","bad","scienc","fiction","movi","it","suppos","to","be","a","mix","of","both","with","a","dose","of","parodi","splash","in","unfortun","it","fall","flat","veri","soonbr","br","you","re","never","suppos","to","take","thi","movi","serious","i","realiz","that","but","you","re","suppos","to","think","it","funni","right","i","find","onli","a","few","of","the","joke","or","situat","be","funni","ie","the","sidebysid","phone","convers","the","russian","olymp","spy","eat","steroid","cereal","superman","walk","by","loi","etc","attack","of","the","killer","tomato","strive","to","be","a","cult","classic","but","it","doe","not","make","it","a","cult","classic","be","a","movi","that","be","so","differ","that","onli","a","select","group","of","peopl","understand","it","or","a","similar","descript","attack","of","the","killer","tomato","can","be","enjoi","by","ani","yearold","with","a","bad","sens","of","humor","so","therefor","it","doe","not","qualifi","a","a","cult","filmbr","br","there","be","on","good","actress","in","the","entir","thing","sharon","taylor","a","loi","fairchild","she","be","a","thin","gawki","report","but","have","a","endear","person","love","to","overact","and","be","a","natur","comedienn","unfortun","she","be","put","to","bad","us","herebr","br","attack","of","the","killer","tomato","be","not","a","funni","a","sai","amazon","woman","on","the","moon","or","kentucki","fry","movi","but","it","doe","have","a","few","hilari","moment","so","i","would","still","recommend","see","it","onc","avoid","the","director","cut","it","have","interrupt","by","the","produc","of","the","movi","and","some","supposedli","lose","footag","dub","in","a","pretend","african","dialect","it","can","be","find","in","english","on","the","out","of","print","tape"],"filtered":["titl","like","attack","killer","tomato","anyon","go","thi","thing","expect","either","bad","scienc","fiction","movi","b","comedi","make","fun","bad","scienc","fiction","movi","suppos","mix","dose","parodi","splash","unfortun","fall","flat","veri","soonbr","br","re","never","suppos","take","thi","movi","serious","realiz","re","suppos","think","funni","right","find","onli","joke","situat","funni","ie","sidebysid","phone","convers","russian","olymp","spy","eat","steroid","cereal","superman","walk","loi","etc","attack","killer","tomato","strive","cult","classic","doe","make","cult","classic","movi","differ","onli","select","group","peopl","understand","similar","descript","attack","killer","tomato","enjoi","ani","yearold","bad","sens","humor","therefor","doe","qualifi","cult","filmbr","br","good","actress","entir","thing","sharon","taylor","loi","fairchild","thin","gawki","report","endear","person","love","overact","natur","comedienn","unfortun","put","bad","us","herebr","br","attack","killer","tomato","funni","sai","amazon","woman","moon","kentucki","fry","movi","doe","hilari","moment","still","recommend","see","onc","avoid","director","cut","interrupt","produc","movi","supposedli","lose","footag","dub","pretend","african","dialect","find","english","print","tape"],"filtered2":["titl","like","attack","killer","tomato","anyon","go","thing","expect","either","bad","scienc","fiction","b","comedi","make","fun","bad","scienc","fiction","suppos","mix","dose","parodi","splash","unfortun","fall","flat","veri","soonbr","re","never","suppos","take","serious","realiz","re","suppos","think","funni","right","find","onli","joke","situat","funni","ie","sidebysid","phone","convers","russian","olymp","spy","eat","steroid","cereal","superman","walk","loi","etc","attack","killer","tomato","strive","cult","classic","doe","make","cult","classic","differ","onli","select","group","peopl","understand","similar","descript","attack","killer","tomato","enjoi","ani","yearold","bad","sens","humor","therefor","doe","qualifi","cult","filmbr","good","actress","entir","thing","sharon","taylor","loi","fairchild","thin","gawki","report","endear","person","love","overact","natur","comedienn","unfortun","put","bad","us","herebr","attack","killer","tomato","funni","amazon","woman","moon","kentucki","fry","doe","hilari","moment","still","recommend","see","onc","avoid","director","cut","interrupt","produc","supposedli","lose","footag","dub","pretend","african","dialect","find","english","print","tape"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,9,11,12,15,18,23,27,29,31,38,42,54,56,58,62,64,68,70,121,127,130,149,153,158,159,170,173,188,198,200,204,207,212,214,221,227,236,252,259,261,264,294,298,303,332,335,354,369,371,405,410,429,456,473,495,566,588,591,594,599,632,642,658,783,910,916,933,946,949,980,983,990,1168,1228,1234,1294,1305,1368,1403,1415,1416,1434,1615,1646,1728,2000,2035,2068,2088,2172,2270,2469,2958,3008,3106,3606,3947,3997,4593,5062,6051,6089,6761,81

{"value":"Spoilers will be in this. The movie could have been better if they had just had a different script, director, and CGI provider. Not much right? The movie has a man starting his own theme park...err...zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs...err...Sabretooths and it is called Jurra...oops...Primal Park. I do not mind rip-offs, because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies, but this one just slaps you in the face with it, R e p e a t e d l y.There is even the \"creature's shadowed head on the design\" thing. The Sabretooths, that are not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park (Just ancient killing cats), Are rather junky but the crowning accomplishment is the one I call \"Sloggy\". Because, after disposing of one big cat, a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left. Enter the weird feeding guy who says, Nah, we made three, the third being a monster who pulls itself around with its front feet. Great, groovy. A group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt, there test to get into their cliques frat or sort (Always thought that needed a short nickname). Out of the ones who do live, only one has completed their task, so I got a kick out of that. Oh yeah, the mandatory \"Evil Capitalist Must Die\" Clique is in force with not one, but two of them! Mr. Primal Park's death is the most laughable thing you will see in one of these movies as a Sabretooth statue's tooth jars loose (Courtesy of Sloggy), shrinks a few sizes, and impales the man through the throat.

{"value":"This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. The actress replacing Jean Reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101. How this pile got through no one can tell. It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries.

{"value":"Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins clone to come out from the 80s. I'm not much of a fan of the imitations.<br /><br />First it was the excellent 'Gremlins'.<br /><br />Then came the very average 'Critters'.<br /><br />Lets not forget the lousy 'Ghoulies'.<br /><br />But the complete pits would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'.<br /><br />Is there more?? <br /><br />Now 'Munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. Actually I probably found it more entertaining than 'Ghoulies', but I preferred thst one's darker tone. <br /><br />From the get-go it plays up its goofy nature (which it's better for it), but due to that nature the hammy acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok. That's where the fun occurs. Mostly light-hearted fluff though, as the story mainly centres on the munchies (who are either hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters (some moments do work) in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase. It's silly, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing. The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed, as they're basic dolls being chucked about. Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak... and with attitude.<br /><br />Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') were fair leads.

{"value":"This movie makes Canadians and Brits out to be asinine, moronic idiots. The men get stoned/drunk, and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene. The women are superfluous to the story  I do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus, or worse, milling around like mesmerized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks. It's the standard knocked-up girlfriend, her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before.<br /><br />Every character here is a carping, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower! And the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with George Wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it  but I cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this. Maybe he needed the money. Ian Tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming moment, but his talent is wasted here.<br /><br />As for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn - or Karl  who is dead, but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece  although I am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films), why even bother? Karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying.<br /><br />By the end of this wretched movie, I thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat!","finished_norm":["thi","movi","make","canadian","and","brit","out","to","be","asinin","moron","idiot","the","man","get","stoneddrunk","and","then","thei","yellbeat","each","other","up","in","almost","everi","scene","the","woman","be","superflu","to","the","stori","i","do","not","understand","what","thei","be","there","for","thei","spend","everi","scene","caus","a","rucku","or","wrong","mill","around","like","mesmer","cattl","appar","canadian","woman","be","either","quarrelsom","vulgar","tramp","or","hulk","hippi","chick","it","the","standard","knockedup","girlfriend","her","loser","boyfriend","and","hi","wick","mother","ludicr","that","we","have","see","in","countless","movi","beforebr","br","everi","charact","here","be","a","carp","infantil","stereotyp","not","to","mention","that","thei","all","look","like","thei","ne","a","shower","and","the","idea","of","ani","kind","of","scene","impli","sex","with","georg","wendt","shudder","be","enough","to","make","anyon","gag","i","watch","the","movi","becaus","samuel","west","be","in","it","but","i","cannot","understand","why","he","would","have","accept","a","role","like","thi","mayb","he","ne","the","monei","ian","tracei","be","a","superb","actor","the","onli","on","with","a","vagu","redeem","moment","but","hi","talent","be","wast","herebr","br","a","for","the","rest","of","the","plot","the","three","imbecil","try","to","get","their","dope","back","yawn","or","karl","who","be","dead","but","who","be","actual","a","charact","veri","much","aliv","in","the","mind","of","that","leav","behind","almost","like","rebecca","in","alfr","hitchcock","masterpiec","although","i","be","asham","to","even","have","think","to","compar","thi","two","film","why","even","bother","karl","be","so","gall","that","you","find","the","circumst","of","hi","death","gratifyingbr","br","by","the","end","of","thi","wretch","movi","i","think","thei","would","all","have","be","well","off","go","down","with","him","on","that","boat"],"filtered":["thi","movi","make","canadian","brit","asinin","moron","idiot","man","get","stoneddrunk","thei","yellbeat","almost","everi","scene","woman","superflu","stori","understand","thei","thei","spend","everi","scene","caus","rucku","wrong","mill","around","like","mesmer","cattl","appar","canadian","woman","either","quarrelsom","vulgar","tramp","hulk","hippi","chick","standard","knockedup","girlfriend","loser","boyfriend","hi","wick","mother","ludicr","see","countless","movi","beforebr","br","everi","charact","carp","infantil","stereotyp","mention","thei","look","like","thei","ne","shower","idea","ani","kind","scene","impli","sex","georg","wendt","shudder","enough","make","anyon","gag","watch","movi","becaus","samuel","west","understand","accept","role","like","thi","mayb","ne","monei","ian","tracei","superb","actor","onli","vagu","redeem","moment","hi","talent","wast","herebr","br","rest","plot","three","imbecil","try","get","dope","back","yawn","karl","dead","actual","charact","veri","much","aliv","mind","leav","behind","almost","like","rebecca","alfr","hitchcock","masterpiec","although","asham","even","think","compar","thi","two","film","even","bother","karl","gall","find","circumst","hi","death","gratifyingbr","br","end","thi","wretch","movi","think","thei","well","go","boat"],"filtered2":["make","canadian","brit","asinin","moron","idiot","man","get","stoneddrunk","yellbeat","almost","everi","scene","woman","superflu","stori","understand","spend","everi","scene","caus","rucku","wrong","mill","around","like","mesmer","cattl","appar","canadian","woman","either","quarrelsom","vulgar","tramp","hulk","hippi","chick","standard","knockedup","girlfriend","loser","boyfriend","wick","mother","ludicr","see","countless","beforebr","everi","charact","carp","infantil","stereotyp","mention","look","like","ne","shower","idea","ani","kind","scene","impli","sex","georg","wendt","shudder","enough","make","anyon","gag","watch","becaus","samuel","west","understand","accept","role","like","mayb","ne","monei","ian","tracei","superb","actor","onli","vagu","redeem","moment","talent","wast","herebr","rest","plot","three","imbecil","try","get","dope","back","yawn","karl","dead","actual","charact","veri","aliv","mind","leav","behind","almost","like","rebecca","alfr","hitchcock","masterpiec","although","asham","even","think","compar","two","even","bother","karl","gall","find","circumst","death","gratifyingbr","end","wretch","think","well","go","boat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,15,16,17,19,20,22,24,25,27,32,36,38,41,45,47,52,63,70,74,85,89,93,98,110,122,123,126,128,131,158,163,188,207,212,224,226,228,237,238,245,254,276,283,285,308,393,397,453,482,496,604,616,634,680,706,730,742,998,1042,1048,1050,1090,1174,1387,1394,1450,1507,1525,1585,1728,1820,1860,1884,1966,2203,2461,2485,2516,2569,2611,2753,2949,3046,3232,3327,4169,4364,4484,4597,4784,5155,5190,5336,5722,5896,6064,6159,6304,6469,6566,6714,7363],"values":[2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.

{"value":"\"Transylvania 6-5000\" is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script. Two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent, very much against their will, to Transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film, like a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The wholesome of the film, however, is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong. The Roger Corman production \"Transylvania Twist\", which came out four years after this, is a lot funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30's, so you better make sure you've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references. There's a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a mad-raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It's also revealed that he's actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah who's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure John Turturro's character in \"Mr. Deeds\" was inspired by Richards's role

{"value":"'Say Yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does. It's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers. <br /><br />The dialogue is clunky and, in several places, poorly translated. The acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple.<br /><br />The plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief. The 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. The villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. And don't even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending. Sheesh.<br /><br />The only plus point in this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress.<br /><br />Overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.","finished_norm":["sai","ye","be","on","of","that","flick","that","you","keep","hope","be","go","to","get","well","but","it","never","doe","it","the","kind","of","motiveless","psychopath","decid","to","menac","a","innoc","coupl","crapfest","so","belov","of","straight","to","video","filmmak","br","br","the","dialogu","be","clunki","and","in","sever","place","poorli","translat","the","act","be","uniformli","poor","especi","from","the","villain","of","the","piec","plai","by","joonghoon","park","he","seem","to","think","that","by","not","blink","and","try","to","talk","in","a","deep","voic","he","be","make","hi","charact","seem","threaten","when","all","it","realli","doe","be","make","him","seem","a","bite","simplebr","br","the","plot","deserv","special","mention","a","it","be","idiot","beyond","all","belief","the","hero","do","not","think","it","overli","strang","that","their","hitchhik","threaten","to","kill","them","the","heroin","twice","manag","to","miss","see","the","villain","when","he","be","no","much","than","a","foot","awai","from","her","the","villain","get","past","a","polic","checkpoint","while","wear","a","shirt","cover","in","blood","and","a","bloodi","head","bandag","by","show","the","cop","a","burn","corps","in","the","passeng","seat","of","the","car","he","be","drive","the","villain","be","punch","club","with","a","shovel","and","stick","through","with","a","pitchfork","but","never","seem","to","be","imped","by","thi","rather","seriou","injuri","and","do","not","even","get","me","start","on","that","terribl","twist","end","sheeshbr","br","the","onli","plu","point","in","thi","film","for","me","be","sing","mi","chu","who","be","veri","pretti","but","realli","no","much","than","a","mediocr","actressbr","br","overal","thi","film","come","off","like","a","poorli","write","flaccidli","act","and","shockingli","direct","attempt","to","copi","the","hitcher","and","spoorloo","but","it","fail","at","everi","turn","due","to","a","lack","of","talent","in","everyon","involv"],"filtered":["sai","ye","flick","keep","hope","go","get","well","never","doe","kind","motiveless","psychopath","decid","menac","innoc","coupl","crapfest","belov","straight","video","filmmak","br","br","dialogu","clunki","sever","place","poorli","translat","act","uniformli","poor","especi","villain","piec","plai","joonghoon","park","seem","think","blink","try","talk","deep","voic","make","hi","charact","seem","threaten","realli","doe","make","seem","bite","simplebr","br","plot","deserv","special","mention","idiot","beyond","belief","hero","think","overli","strang","hitchhik","threaten","kill","heroin","twice","manag","miss","see","villain","much","foot","awai","villain","get","past","polic","checkpoint","wear","shirt","cover","blood","bloodi","head","bandag","show","cop","burn","corps","passeng","seat","car","drive","villain","punch","club","shovel","stick","pitchfork","never","seem","imped","thi","rather","seriou","injuri","even","get","start","terribl","twist","end","sheeshbr","br","onli","plu","point","thi","film","sing","mi","chu","veri","pretti","realli","much","mediocr","actressbr","br","overal","thi","film","come","like","poorli","write","flaccidli","act","shockingli","direct","attempt","copi","hitcher","spoorloo","fail","everi","turn","due","lack","talent","everyon","involv"],"filtered2":["ye","flick","keep","hope","go","get","well","never","doe","kind","motiveless","psychopath","decid","menac","innoc","coupl","crapfest","belov","straight","video","filmmak","dialogu","clunki","sever","place","poorli","translat","act","uniformli","poor","especi","villain","piec","plai","joonghoon","park","seem","think","blink","try","talk","deep","voic","make","charact","seem","threaten","realli","doe","make","seem","bite","simplebr","plot","deserv","special","mention","idiot","beyond","belief","hero","think","overli","strang","hitchhik","threaten","kill","heroin","twice","manag","miss","see","villain","foot","awai","villain","get","past","polic","checkpoint","wear","shirt","cover","blood","bloodi","head","bandag","show","cop","burn","corps","passeng","seat","car","drive","villain","punch","club","shovel","stick","pitchfork","never","seem","imped","rather","seriou","injuri","even","get","start","terribl","twist","end","sheeshbr","onli","plu","point","sing","mi","chu","veri","pretti","realli","mediocr","actressbr","overal","come","like","poorli","write","flaccidli","act","shockingli","direct","attempt","copi","hitcher","spoorloo","fail","everi","turn","due","lack","talent","everyon","involv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,10,11,12,13,15,18,20,21,24,28,32,34,35,36,40,42,65,66,71,76,78,85,96,102,122,134,146,154,155,160,164,166,177,181,183,186,203,208,209,215,218,240,241,246,248,249,253,255,257,267,276,284,285,316,323,345,355,375,398,412,416,417,423,428,435,440,461,471,476,491,493,502,514,520,548,568,659,706,747,749,787,834,862,935,981,1035,1155,1179,1256,1308,1430,1512,1542,1575,1639,1717,1751,1818,2486,2679,3285,

{"value":"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth \"several thousand million years ago.\" In that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call \"Radium X\" - which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in Africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that.

{"value":"1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films weren't particularly good, they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona. However, by this film, the familiar \"Little Tramp\" character was still in development. Sure Charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.<br /><br />As for this very slight film, it is interesting to watch for the cast. While they are not familiar today, Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain--all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in Keystone productions--it must have been located near a race track). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie slaps Chester around and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack away--leaving Charlie with Mabel (who, oddly, didn't seem put off by Charlie's boorish behaviors).<br /><br />Unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors actually do on stage, while not unusual for a Keystone film, isn't particularly funny when seen today.","finished_norm":["be","a","amaz","year","for","charli","chaplin","it","be","hi","year","in","film","and","he","appear","in","much","than","film","while","much","of","thi","film","be","not","particularli","good","thei","do","give","him","a","chanc","to","slowli","evolv","hi","screen","persona","howev","by","thi","film","the","familiar","littl","tramp","charact","be","still","in","develop","sure","charli","look","the","part","but","hi","charact","still","lack","the","sweet","and","decenc","that","he","late","develop","instead","chaplin","often","hit","kick","or","do","other","nasti","thing","to","peopl","for","seemingli","no","reason","at","allbr","br","a","for","thi","veri","slight","film","it","be","interest","to","watch","for","the","cast","while","thei","be","not","familiar","todai","chaplin","star","along","with","mabel","normand","chester","conklin","and","mack","swainal","exception","popular","star","with","keyston","film","the","problem","with","thi","film","be","that","while","it","have","a","few","nice","scene","the","plot","seem","veri","vagu","and","improperli","develop","chester","and","mabel","get","to","the","race","track","a","veri","common","theme","in","keyston","productionsit","must","have","be","locat","near","a","race","track","charli","and","mack","show","up","and","sneak","in","mack","be","chase","by","the","polic","for","do","thi","while","charli","slap","chester","around","and","steal","hi","girl","in","the","end","for","no","appar","reason","the","cop","take","chester","and","mack","awayleav","charli","with","mabel","who","oddli","do","not","seem","put","off","by","charli","boorish","behaviorsbr","br","unless","you","be","a","huge","silent","comedi","buff","or","film","historian","thi","be","a","veri","forgett","film","that","be","onli","import","in","the","evolut","of","chaplin","what","he","and","the","other","actor","actual","do","on","stage","while","not","unusu","for","a","keyston","film","be","not","particularli","funni","when","see","todai"],"filtered":["amaz","year","charli","chaplin","hi","year","film","appear","much","film","much","thi","film","particularli","good","thei","give","chanc","slowli","evolv","hi","screen","persona","howev","thi","film","familiar","littl","tramp","charact","still","develop","sure","charli","look","part","hi","charact","still","lack","sweet","decenc","late","develop","instead","chaplin","often","hit","kick","nasti","thing","peopl","seemingli","reason","allbr","br","thi","veri","slight","film","interest","watch","cast","thei","familiar","todai","chaplin","star","along","mabel","normand","chester","conklin","mack","swainal","exception","popular","star","keyston","film","problem","thi","film","nice","scene","plot","seem","veri","vagu","improperli","develop","chester","mabel","get","race","track","veri","common","theme","keyston","productionsit","must","locat","near","race","track","charli","mack","show","sneak","mack","chase","polic","thi","charli","slap","chester","around","steal","hi","girl","end","appar","reason","cop","take","chester","mack","awayleav","charli","mabel","oddli","seem","put","charli","boorish","behaviorsbr","br","unless","huge","silent","comedi","buff","film","historian","thi","veri","forgett","film","onli","import","evolut","chaplin","actor","actual","stage","unusu","keyston","film","particularli","funni","see","todai"],"filtered2":["amaz","year","charli","chaplin","year","appear","particularli","good","give","chanc","slowli","evolv","screen","persona","howev","familiar","littl","tramp","charact","still","develop","sure","charli","look","part","charact","still","lack","sweet","decenc","late","develop","instead","chaplin","often","hit","kick","nasti","thing","peopl","seemingli","reason","allbr","veri","slight","interest","watch","cast","familiar","todai","chaplin","star","along","mabel","normand","chester","conklin","mack","swainal","exception","popular","star","keyston","problem","nice","scene","plot","seem","veri","vagu","improperli","develop","chester","mabel","get","race","track","veri","common","theme","keyston","productionsit","must","locat","near","race","track","charli","mack","show","sneak","mack","chase","polic","charli","slap","chester","around","steal","girl","end","appar","reason","cop","take","chester","mack","awayleav","charli","mabel","oddli","seem","put","charli","boorish","behaviorsbr","unless","huge","silent","comedi","buff","historian","veri","forgett","onli","import","evolut","chaplin","actor","actual","stage","unusu","keyston","particularli","funni","see","todai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,10,11,14,15,16,19,23,24,28,29,30,31,32,35,41,52,57,60,61,62,64,84,92,95,98,100,113,119,127,141,150,152,159,167,169,183,192,262,308,320,324,388,400,444,460,471,476,486,497,530,533,555,578,600,669,685,775,789,867,869,939,951,1052,1095,1123,1207,1225,1374,1388,1391,1425,1440,1490,1491,1507,2060,2171,2331,2380,2484,2964,3836,3889,4625,4831,5336,5459,6864],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.

{"value":"For a good half hour or so, I remember myself thinking: \"Hey, this could very well be Bill Rebane's best achievement ever!\". The opening sequences are atmospheric, there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker \"The Giant Spider Invasion\" in a playful way. The concept is shamelessly stolen from William Castle's \"House on Haunted Hill\", with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win $1,000,000 in an elimination game. Naturally, the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one, and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists...or there's another murderer amongst them. The film begins & ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that isn't relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there's some nice T&A to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo (Shelly, I believe she's called) is really hilarious to observe. After the first half hour, naturally the inevitable happens and \"The Cold\" turns into a textbook Rebane-production with retarded plot twists, the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement. There wasn't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi-talented director (?) tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this film, you'll live longer and happier.","finished_norm":["for","a","good","half","hour","or","so","i","rememb","myself","think","hei","thi","can","veri","good","be","bill","reban","well","achiev","ever","the","open","sequenc","be","atmospher","there","immedi","be","some","scari","moment","to","enjoi","and","our","director","even","refer","to","hi","own","notori","stinker","the","giant","spider","invas","in","a","play","wai","the","concept","be","shamelessli","steal","from","william","castl","hous","on","haunt","hill","with","three","old","and","extrem","bore","millionair","lure","nine","loser","to","a","isol","mansion","to","win","in","a","elimin","game","natur","the","particip","start","vanish","quickli","and","on","by","on","and","it","take","the","remain","greedi","bonehead","too","much","time","befor","thei","realiz","either","the","old","folk","be","sadistsor","there","anoth","murder","amongst","them","the","film","begin","end","with","a","odd","narrat","tell","a","lot","of","senseless","stuff","that","be","not","relev","or","even","interest","to","the","plot","but","there","some","nice","ta","to","admir","in","the","ten","minut","and","that","dumb","bimbo","shelli","i","believ","she","call","be","realli","hilari","to","observ","after","the","half","hour","natur","the","inevit","happen","and","the","cold","turn","into","a","textbook","rebaneproduct","with","retard","plot","twist","the","dumb","dialog","ever","and","a","total","lack","of","excit","there","be","not","ani","budget","for","bloodi","murder","sequenc","but","our","multital","director","try","to","compens","thi","with","endless","footag","of","disco","danc","girl","and","a","amateur","rock","band","the","film","conjur","have","four","or","even","five","differ","climax","and","none","of","them","be","a","slight","bite","satisfi","mayb","it","be","a","inspir","for","lotr","return","of","the","king","avoid","thi","film","you","will","live","long","and","happi"],"filtered":["good","half","hour","rememb","think","hei","thi","veri","good","bill","reban","well","achiev","ever","open","sequenc","atmospher","immedi","scari","moment","enjoi","director","even","refer","hi","notori","stinker","giant","spider","invas","play","wai","concept","shamelessli","steal","william","castl","hous","haunt","hill","three","old","extrem","bore","millionair","lure","nine","loser","isol","mansion","win","elimin","game","natur","particip","start","vanish","quickli","take","remain","greedi","bonehead","much","time","befor","thei","realiz","either","old","folk","sadistsor","anoth","murder","amongst","film","begin","end","odd","narrat","tell","lot","senseless","stuff","relev","even","interest","plot","nice","ta","admir","ten","minut","dumb","bimbo","shelli","believ","call","realli","hilari","observ","half","hour","natur","inevit","happen","cold","turn","textbook","rebaneproduct","retard","plot","twist","dumb","dialog","ever","total","lack","excit","ani","budget","bloodi","murder","sequenc","multital","director","try","compens","thi","endless","footag","disco","danc","girl","amateur","rock","band","film","conjur","four","even","five","differ","climax","none","slight","bite","satisfi","mayb","inspir","lotr","return","king","avoid","thi","film","live","long","happi"],"filtered2":["good","half","hour","rememb","think","hei","veri","good","bill","reban","well","achiev","ever","open","sequenc","atmospher","immedi","scari","moment","enjoi","director","even","refer","notori","stinker","giant","spider","invas","play","wai","concept","shamelessli","steal","william","castl","hous","haunt","hill","three","old","extrem","bore","millionair","lure","nine","loser","isol","mansion","win","elimin","game","natur","particip","start","vanish","quickli","take","remain","greedi","bonehead","time","befor","realiz","either","old","folk","sadistsor","anoth","murder","amongst","begin","end","odd","narrat","tell","lot","senseless","stuff","relev","even","interest","plot","nice","ta","admir","ten","minut","dumb","bimbo","shelli","believ","call","realli","hilari","observ","half","hour","natur","inevit","happen","cold","turn","textbook","rebaneproduct","retard","plot","twist","dumb","dialog","ever","total","lack","excit","ani","budget","bloodi","murder","sequenc","multital","director","try","compens","endless","footag","disco","danc","girl","amateur","rock","band","conjur","four","even","five","differ","climax","none","slight","bite","satisfi","mayb","inspir","lotr","return","king","avoid","live","long","happi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,8,12,13,15,20,24,27,31,32,33,36,39,44,58,59,60,67,71,72,73,79,84,90,91,94,96,99,108,116,142,147,154,163,174,183,184,188,200,204,206,207,213,224,242,256,262,273,290,329,335,349,361,370,374,396,405,420,432,435,456,488,489,492,505,524,541,545,578,582,605,606,632,658,682,715,719,722,726,768,771,835,907,909,927,974,987,1005,1018,1107,1137,1158,1164,1179,1214,1262,1273,1321,1440,1525,1574,1685,1855,1929,1960,2017,2081,2115,2196,2248,2390,2397,2798,2835,2916,2918,3133,3149,3170,3266,349

{"value":"Ironic that Dr. Seuss' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general gist of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss' story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones' animated version. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing.<br /><br />Succinctness?<br /><br />Soul?<br /><br />Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better. I give this film three cans of Who-Hash out of

{"value":"The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting. As others noted, he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate doing so, but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help. Give her an \"E\" for effort and a \"C+\" for achievement. Given Mulroney's indifference, the one thing that could've helped Messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esquire performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak-kneed, mewling, and feckless.<br /><br />If I tried to analyze this one any further, I'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less obnoxious (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much better off watching \"My Best Friend's Wedding\"

{"value":"This sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis, occult , government conspiracies. I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead you get something quite different, more psychological, more something like from David Lynch. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just awful.<br /><br />Part of the trouble is the casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid. She just doesn't do that well, even at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy. Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie, or at least acted like it, rather than simply being quirky. The only one that I thought did really well was the daughter, Siri Baruc.<br /><br />Another big part is the pacing. It starts off very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath. But shortly afterward, it all becomes a jumbled mess. Some of this was on purpose, but much of it was just needlessly confusing, monotonous, and poorly focused.<br /><br />The real problem, is it's simply not a pleasant movie to watch. It's slow, dull, none of the characters are likable. Overuse of imagery and sets. Some movies you see characters get tortured. In this, it's the viewer that does. It does have a few creepy moments, most notably the creepy Nazi paintings and the credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome.","finished_norm":["thi","sound","like","a","realli","interest","movi","from","the","blurb","nazi","occult","govern","conspiraci","i","be","expect","a","low","budget","nazi","version","of","the","davinci","code","or","the","boi","from","brazil","or","even","shockwav","instead","you","get","someth","quit","differ","much","psycholog","much","someth","like","from","david","lynch","that","be","actual","a","plu","but","the","wai","the","stori","be","tell","be","just","awfulbr","br","part","of","the","troubl","be","the","cast","andrienn","barbeau","charact","start","off","the","move","be","somewhat","timid","and","afraid","she","just","doe","not","do","that","good","even","at","her","ag","though","she","certainli","try","the","actor","cast","a","the","son","appar","think","thi","be","a","comedi","much","of","the","other","actor","conjur","seem","to","have","think","thi","be","a","campi","movi","or","at","littl","act","like","it","rather","than","simpli","be","quirki","the","onli","on","that","i","think","do","realli","good","be","the","daughter","siri","barucbr","br","anoth","big","part","be","the","pace","it","start","off","veri","slowli","so","slowli","you","mai","be","tempt","to","turn","it","off","but","then","it","get","compel","for","a","while","when","you","get","to","the","daughter","suicid","and","the","aftermath","but","shortli","afterward","it","all","becom","a","jumbl","mess","some","of","thi","be","on","purpos","but","much","of","it","be","just","needlessli","confus","monoton","and","poorli","focusedbr","br","the","real","problem","be","it","simpli","not","a","pleasant","movi","to","watch","it","slow","dull","none","of","the","charact","be","likabl","overus","of","imageri","and","set","some","movi","you","see","charact","get","tortur","in","thi","it","the","viewer","that","doe","it","doe","have","a","few","creepi","moment","much","notabl","the","creepi","nazi","paint","and","the","credit","but","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","mostli","just","tiresom"],"filtered":["thi","sound","like","realli","interest","movi","blurb","nazi","occult","govern","conspiraci","expect","low","budget","nazi","version","davinci","code","boi","brazil","even","shockwav","instead","get","someth","quit","differ","much","psycholog","much","someth","like","david","lynch","actual","plu","wai","stori","tell","awfulbr","br","part","troubl","cast","andrienn","barbeau","charact","start","move","somewhat","timid","afraid","doe","good","even","ag","though","certainli","try","actor","cast","son","appar","think","thi","comedi","much","actor","conjur","seem","think","thi","campi","movi","littl","act","like","rather","simpli","quirki","onli","think","realli","good","daughter","siri","barucbr","br","anoth","big","part","pace","start","veri","slowli","slowli","mai","tempt","turn","get","compel","get","daughter","suicid","aftermath","shortli","afterward","becom","jumbl","mess","thi","purpos","much","needlessli","confus","monoton","poorli","focusedbr","br","real","problem","simpli","pleasant","movi","watch","slow","dull","none","charact","likabl","overus","imageri","set","movi","see","charact","get","tortur","thi","viewer","doe","doe","creepi","moment","much","notabl","creepi","nazi","paint","credit","rest","movi","mostli","tiresom"],"filtered2":["sound","like","realli","interest","blurb","nazi","occult","govern","conspiraci","expect","low","budget","nazi","version","davinci","code","boi","brazil","even","shockwav","instead","get","someth","quit","differ","psycholog","someth","like","david","lynch","actual","plu","wai","stori","tell","awfulbr","part","troubl","cast","andrienn","barbeau","charact","start","move","somewhat","timid","afraid","doe","good","even","ag","though","certainli","try","actor","cast","son","appar","think","comedi","actor","conjur","seem","think","campi","littl","act","like","rather","simpli","quirki","onli","think","realli","good","daughter","siri","barucbr","anoth","big","part","pace","start","veri","slowli","slowli","mai","tempt","turn","get","compel","get","daughter","suicid","aftermath","shortli","afterward","becom","jumbl","mess","purpos","needlessli","confus","monoton","poorli","focusedbr","real","problem","simpli","pleasant","watch","slow","dull","none","charact","likabl","overus","imageri","set","see","charact","get","tortur","viewer","doe","doe","creepi","moment","notabl","creepi","nazi","paint","credit","rest","mostli","tiresom"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,7,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,18,21,33,35,36,39,41,46,52,53,60,61,71,73,80,82,86,90,92,96,109,115,120,127,130,152,160,167,178,188,201,204,217,220,226,256,275,279,282,308,356,367,370,389,390,398,407,426,427,434,442,510,546,596,675,749,752,755,794,802,868,1104,1244,1254,1372,1374,1438,1721,1733,1807,1823,1848,1934,2130,2246,2312,2388,2579,2626,2734,2863,2983,3468,3497,4535,4536,4992,6130,7986,8043],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"This thrown together piece of fecal matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity. Too bad as the premise is promising (as it so often is in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter it segues off into la la land. <br /><br />Lowe is in Prison serving time for a DUI that killed off his mistress. We get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real BAD about this. Then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself. Or does he? Lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly. His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why do they then set him up to be killed? Ah, that's where this story could get interesting. That's where it falls off the rails, and once off the rails it decides it can get away with insulting the viewers attention for the next numbing hour.<br /><br />****************SPOILERS****************************<br /><br />I won't bore with an endless recounting of the irrationality of what follows, but contemplate this ending. Lowe has been trapped by the bad guys on a train. They want a tape he has, because that tape will screw their boss, and them. So on to the train come 3 cops, guns drawn, ready to rescue Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops, in front of half the passengers and then....continue chasing Lowe to get the tape. HELLO!!!! killing 3 cops in public will get you into deep doodo, to hell with the tape. Yet off they go through a mall shooting up the place, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end Lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the

{"value":"The character acting is a little stiff, as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen. Unfortunately one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (played many bit roles on TV, like in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed.<br /><br />The lead role is Mr Ballard, as portrayed by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. He doesn't do a poor job, but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time NOT talking and also NOT acting. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (starring Tobey Maguire).<br /><br />The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for her money. thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window (fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is predicted to die no less.<br /><br />The second chauffeur Mr Ballard hires looks a lot like an English mark Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in quietness, no one speaks, and few act. It is a shame the MST3K guys never got hold of this movie. It could have been much better, if not just as predictable, with more dialogue, or shorter scenes of 'nothingness'.<br /><br />I kept expecting G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the \"nothing\" that inhabits this

{"value":"I didn't think the French could make a bad movie, but I was, clearly, very wrong. As has been said before, this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /><br />The script is awful -- pretentious, stilted, and vapid -- and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting, rather than retelling, history. Along with some fairly decent set design, Valentina Cervi's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no time in contriving various \"erotic\" sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot, and does not, sustain this movie. The acting is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two. The cinematography is OK, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted-lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama. In any event, the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on Artemisia's body, and all too seldom on her paintings.<br /><br />All told, a near-complete failure.

{"value":"Okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since Fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say. <br /><br />To start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic. Simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void. example; who the heck is trying to 'shut down' Santa clause? Is it some sort of corporation? A little explanation would of been lovely. <br /><br />Second: The movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care. <br /><br />Third: I suppose this was suppose to be a family film? Its rating was low at just PG. For a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. It didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem. <br /><br />Through the whole movie Paul Giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. Vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies. mouthy frat boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he's been good in other movies)<br /><br />so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick. <br /><br />In my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you HAVE to see it save it for a rainy day rental.","finished_norm":["okai","dure","thi","past","thanksgiv","break","whilst","have","the","whole","famili","togeth","everybodi","decid","to","go","see","a","movi","and","sinc","fred","claus","be","vote","major","that","what","we","go","and","sai","br","br","to","start","off","the","movi","have","so","mani","plot","hole","it","be","pathet","simpl","explan","of","why","a","certain","event","be","happen","be","void","exampl","who","the","heck","be","try","to","shut","down","santa","claus","be","it","some","sort","of","corpor","a","littl","explan","would","of","be","love","br","br","the","movi","toss","you","flimsi","charact","that","evok","no","sympathi","from","you","about","their","feel","or","action","exampl","the","littl","elf","name","willi","and","the","onli","tall","girl","in","the","elf","villag","thei","see","each","other","twice","and","then","thei","be","a","coupl","and","i","can","of","care","littl","becaus","thi","movi","do","not","make","me","care","br","br","i","suppos","thi","be","suppos","to","be","a","famili","film","it","rate","be","low","at","just","pg","for","a","famili","film","there","be","sever","articl","of","suggest","convers","it","do","not","bother","me","but","if","i","be","a","parent","i","can","see","a","problem","br","br","through","the","whole","movi","paul","giamatti","look","extrem","bore","with","hi","role","but","honestli","he","be","the","onli","on","worth","watch","in","the","movi","vaughn","have","a","few","funni","moment","but","plai","the","same","charact","he","have","for","the","last","two","movi","mouthi","frat","boi","noth","against","vaughn","he","be","good","in","other","moviesbr","br","so","thi","movi","get","a","out","of","star","from","me","just","becaus","somebodi","have","to","put","in","the","effort","to","produc","film","and","releas","thi","flick","br","br","in","my","opinion","i","would","definit","pass","on","thi","flick","or","if","you","have","to","see","it","save","it","for","a","raini","dai","rental"],"filtered":["okai","dure","thi","past","thanksgiv","break","whilst","whole","famili","togeth","everybodi","decid","go","see","movi","sinc","fred","claus","vote","major","go","sai","br","br","start","movi","mani","plot","hole","pathet","simpl","explan","certain","event","happen","void","exampl","heck","try","shut","santa","claus","sort","corpor","littl","explan","love","br","br","movi","toss","flimsi","charact","evok","sympathi","feel","action","exampl","littl","elf","name","willi","onli","tall","girl","elf","villag","thei","see","twice","thei","coupl","care","littl","becaus","thi","movi","make","care","br","br","suppos","thi","suppos","famili","film","rate","low","pg","famili","film","sever","articl","suggest","convers","bother","parent","see","problem","br","br","whole","movi","paul","giamatti","look","extrem","bore","hi","role","honestli","onli","worth","watch","movi","vaughn","funni","moment","plai","charact","last","two","movi","mouthi","frat","boi","noth","vaughn","good","moviesbr","br","thi","movi","get","star","becaus","somebodi","put","effort","produc","film","releas","thi","flick","br","br","opinion","definit","pass","thi","flick","see","save","raini","dai","rental"],"filtered2":["okai","dure","past","thanksgiv","break","whilst","whole","famili","togeth","everybodi","decid","go","see","sinc","fred","claus","vote","major","go","start","mani","plot","hole","pathet","simpl","explan","certain","event","happen","void","exampl","heck","try","shut","santa","claus","sort","corpor","littl","explan","love","toss","flimsi","charact","evok","sympathi","feel","action","exampl","littl","elf","name","willi","onli","tall","girl","elf","villag","see","twice","coupl","care","littl","becaus","make","care","suppos","suppos","famili","rate","low","pg","famili","sever","articl","suggest","convers","bother","parent","see","problem","whole","paul","giamatti","look","extrem","bore","role","honestli","onli","worth","watch","vaughn","funni","moment","plai","charact","last","two","mouthi","frat","boi","noth","vaughn","good","moviesbr","get","star","becaus","somebodi","put","effort","produc","releas","flick","opinion","definit","pass","flick","see","save","raini","dai","rental"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,7,10,11,14,16,22,32,36,40,43,47,49,50,54,62,71,84,94,100,108,111,128,129,132,143,144,149,159,162,167,182,188,189,191,202,205,217,219,239,249,253,257,261,269,270,282,307,316,327,329,360,392,401,404,440,470,487,496,538,601,646,670,737,757,774,810,840,1000,1082,1134,1190,1215,1256,1305,1496,1504,1533,1545,1675,1689,1711,2020,2199,2531,2552,2709,2795,2883,3224,4022,4332,4624,4849,5243,5425,5732,6657,8312],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Ever since the cinema-loving universe made acquaintance with a guy named George A. Romero, the word \"zombie\" automatically gets associated with blood-soaked horror images and non-stop acting sequences. It's safe to say that his \"Night of the Living Dead\" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. Yet, in the earliest years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was merely used in slow, nearly action-less psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneur's \"I walked with a Zombie\" is a perfect example and so is \"White Zombie\", starring Bela Lugosi. This \"Revolt of the Zombies\" could have been another example but unfortunately it's a failure over the entire line and easily one of the most tedious movies I ever saw. Dreadful acting, a very poorly written screenplay and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film only lasts 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is entirely wasted on stupid love-story intrigues and unexciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor surely could have resulted in a more compelling story but all we ever see are interior shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blonde with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me enormously and I kept hoping a ravenous undead would suddenly appear out of nowhere to devour her. Unlucky again. If you manage to struggle yourself through 60 soporific minutes, you'll be rewarded with a fairly decent finale. Still, this is far too little to give this film a positive rating, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see in case you already saw everything else.","finished_norm":["ever","sinc","the","cinemalov","univers","make","acquaint","with","a","gui","name","georg","a","romero","the","word","zombi","automat","get","associ","with","bloodsoak","horror","imag","and","nonstop","act","sequenc","it","safe","to","sai","that","hi","night","of","the","live","dead","form","the","zombi","movi","a","we","know","it","now","yet","in","the","earli","year","of","cinema","the","premis","of","reanim","corps","be","mere","us","in","slow","nearli","actionless","psycholog","thriller","jacqu","tourneur","i","walk","with","a","zombi","be","a","perfect","exampl","and","so","be","white","zombi","star","bela","lugosi","thi","revolt","of","the","zombi","can","have","be","anoth","exampl","but","unfortun","it","a","failur","over","the","entir","line","and","easili","on","of","the","much","tediou","movi","i","ever","see","dread","act","a","veri","poorli","write","screenplai","and","a","complet","lack","of","atmospher","and","tension","the","film","onli","last","minut","and","yet","the","half","hour","be","entir","wast","on","stupid","lovestori","intrigu","and","unexcit","monologu","the","set","in","the","legendari","cambodian","citi","of","angkor","sure","can","have","result","in","a","much","compel","stori","but","all","we","ever","see","be","interior","shot","the","lead","actress","dorothi","stone","textbook","blond","with","curli","hair","and","a","ugli","nose","irrit","me","enorm","and","i","keep","hope","a","raven","undead","would","suddenli","appear","out","of","nowher","to","devour","her","unlucki","again","if","you","manag","to","struggl","yourself","through","soporif","minut","you","will","be","reward","with","a","fairli","decent","final","still","thi","be","far","too","littl","to","give","thi","film","a","posit","rate","let","alon","a","recommend","avoid","thi","be","the","typ","of","movi","you","should","onli","see","in","case","you","alreadi","see","everyth","els"],"filtered":["ever","sinc","cinemalov","univers","make","acquaint","gui","name","georg","romero","word","zombi","automat","get","associ","bloodsoak","horror","imag","nonstop","act","sequenc","safe","sai","hi","night","live","dead","form","zombi","movi","know","yet","earli","year","cinema","premis","reanim","corps","mere","us","slow","nearli","actionless","psycholog","thriller","jacqu","tourneur","walk","zombi","perfect","exampl","white","zombi","star","bela","lugosi","thi","revolt","zombi","anoth","exampl","unfortun","failur","entir","line","easili","much","tediou","movi","ever","see","dread","act","veri","poorli","write","screenplai","complet","lack","atmospher","tension","film","onli","last","minut","yet","half","hour","entir","wast","stupid","lovestori","intrigu","unexcit","monologu","set","legendari","cambodian","citi","angkor","sure","result","much","compel","stori","ever","see","interior","shot","lead","actress","dorothi","stone","textbook","blond","curli","hair","ugli","nose","irrit","enorm","keep","hope","raven","undead","suddenli","appear","nowher","devour","unlucki","manag","struggl","soporif","minut","reward","fairli","decent","final","still","thi","far","littl","give","thi","film","posit","rate","let","alon","recommend","avoid","thi","typ","movi","onli","see","case","alreadi","see","everyth","els"],"filtered2":["ever","sinc","cinemalov","univers","make","acquaint","gui","name","georg","romero","word","zombi","automat","get","associ","bloodsoak","horror","imag","nonstop","act","sequenc","safe","night","live","dead","form","zombi","know","yet","earli","year","cinema","premis","reanim","corps","mere","us","slow","nearli","actionless","psycholog","thriller","jacqu","tourneur","walk","zombi","perfect","exampl","white","zombi","star","bela","lugosi","revolt","zombi","anoth","exampl","unfortun","failur","entir","line","easili","tediou","ever","see","dread","act","veri","poorli","write","screenplai","complet","lack","atmospher","tension","onli","last","minut","yet","half","hour","entir","wast","stupid","lovestori","intrigu","unexcit","monologu","set","legendari","cambodian","citi","angkor","sure","result","compel","stori","ever","see","interior","shot","lead","actress","dorothi","stone","textbook","blond","curli","hair","ugli","nose","irrit","enorm","keep","hope","raven","undead","suddenli","appear","nowher","devour","unlucki","manag","struggl","soporif","minut","reward","fairli","decent","final","still","far","littl","give","posit","rate","let","alon","recommend","avoid","typ","onli","see","case","alreadi","see","everyth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,11,14,15,17,21,26,30,44,55,56,57,59,64,65,73,83,89,100,101,103,107,109,116,119,124,134,136,143,144,156,157,162,169,174,181,183,193,194,196,198,202,206,210,227,228,258,266,268,288,294,298,307,309,330,335,345,349,354,359,384,390,398,409,441,447,457,484,509,583,595,611,677,680,690,703,714,740,785,799,813,819,835,836,842,886,895,913,959,985,995,1017,1100,1235,1254,1267,1575,1606,1742,1848,1957,2169,2262,2441,2483,2888,2970,2977,2992,3382

{"value":"In addition to his \"Tarzan\" series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs did write many other books, although, aside from the popular \"At the Earth's Core\", few of these have been filmed. One exception is the novel entitled \"The Lad and the Lion\", brought to the screen as \"The Lion Man\" (1936), an over-talkative, static, old-hat, slow-moving and rather dull movie, despite being filmed on real desert locations. Actually \"movie\" is the wrong word. The narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. For instance, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. Even more frustrating for the keen movie fan, are the characters who make an impression of sorts (like the lass who plies Hall with drugged wine) but are enacted by players who are not credited! The credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young Master Fairy. Admittedly, most of the cast are saddled with atrocious King James dialogue which has to be heard to be believed! But the way to play this rubbish is tongue-in-cheek, a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no-talent players. Maybe director J.P. McCarthy scotched that idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to trade lines with the likes of Richard Carlyle (her dad) and Jon Hall (her suitor). Admittedly, Mr Hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than Mr Carlyle, but that is no recommendation.","finished_norm":["in","addit","to","hi","tarzan","seri","the","prolif","edgar","rice","burrough","do","write","mani","other","book","although","asid","from","the","popular","at","the","earth","core","few","of","thi","have","be","film","on","except","be","the","novel","entitl","the","lad","and","the","lion","bring","to","the","screen","a","the","lion","man","a","overtalk","static","oldhat","slowmov","and","rather","dull","movi","despit","be","film","on","real","desert","locat","actual","movi","be","the","wrong","word","the","narr","doe","not","move","but","proce","at","a","snail","pace","in","a","abrupt","seri","of","jerk","for","instanc","at","littl","five","charact","be","give","elabor","open","scene","and","then","just","disappear","even","much","frustrat","for","the","keen","movi","fan","be","the","charact","who","make","a","impress","of","sort","like","the","lass","who","ply","hall","with","drug","wine","but","be","enact","by","player","who","be","not","credit","the","credit","thespian","gener","come","off","wrong","than","the","unknown","on","except","be","australian","actress","fini","barton","who","give","a","good","account","of","the","kidnap","harem","girl","who","rescu","young","master","fairi","admittedli","much","of","the","cast","be","saddl","with","atroci","king","jame","dialogu","which","have","to","be","hear","to","be","believ","but","the","wai","to","plai","thi","rubbish","be","tongueincheek","a","stratagem","which","doe","not","seem","to","have","occur","to","a","singl","on","of","the","film","roster","of","notal","player","mayb","director","jp","mccarthi","scotch","that","idea","anywai","it","sad","to","see","the","love","kathleen","burk","forc","to","trade","line","with","the","like","of","richard","carlyl","her","dad","and","jon","hall","her","suitor","admittedli","mr","hall","deliv","hi","line","with","margin","much","convict","than","mr","carlyl","but","that","be","no","recommend"],"filtered":["addit","hi","tarzan","seri","prolif","edgar","rice","burrough","write","mani","book","although","asid","popular","earth","core","thi","film","except","novel","entitl","lad","lion","bring","screen","lion","man","overtalk","static","oldhat","slowmov","rather","dull","movi","despit","film","real","desert","locat","actual","movi","wrong","word","narr","doe","move","proce","snail","pace","abrupt","seri","jerk","instanc","littl","five","charact","give","elabor","open","scene","disappear","even","much","frustrat","keen","movi","fan","charact","make","impress","sort","like","lass","ply","hall","drug","wine","enact","player","credit","credit","thespian","gener","come","wrong","unknown","except","australian","actress","fini","barton","give","good","account","kidnap","harem","girl","rescu","young","master","fairi","admittedli","much","cast","saddl","atroci","king","jame","dialogu","hear","believ","wai","plai","thi","rubbish","tongueincheek","stratagem","doe","seem","occur","singl","film","roster","notal","player","mayb","director","jp","mccarthi","scotch","idea","anywai","sad","see","love","kathleen","burk","forc","trade","line","like","richard","carlyl","dad","jon","hall","suitor","admittedli","mr","hall","deliv","hi","line","margin","much","convict","mr","carlyl","recommend"],"filtered2":["addit","tarzan","prolif","edgar","rice","burrough","write","mani","book","although","asid","popular","earth","core","except","novel","entitl","lad","lion","bring","screen","lion","man","overtalk","static","oldhat","slowmov","rather","dull","despit","real","desert","locat","actual","wrong","word","narr","doe","move","proce","snail","pace","abrupt","jerk","instanc","littl","five","charact","give","elabor","open","scene","disappear","even","frustrat","keen","fan","charact","make","impress","sort","like","lass","ply","hall","drug","wine","enact","player","credit","credit","thespian","gener","come","wrong","unknown","except","australian","actress","fini","barton","give","good","account","kidnap","harem","girl","rescu","young","master","fairi","admittedli","cast","saddl","atroci","king","jame","dialogu","hear","believ","wai","plai","rubbish","tongueincheek","stratagem","doe","seem","occur","singl","roster","notal","player","mayb","director","jp","mccarthi","scotch","idea","anywai","sad","see","love","kathleen","burk","forc","trade","line","like","richard","carlyl","dad","jon","hall","suitor","admittedli","mr","hall","deliv","line","margin","convict","mr","carlyl","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,10,14,18,19,25,30,33,34,35,40,45,50,52,54,58,65,80,84,91,92,107,123,135,140,151,160,163,192,216,225,233,237,242,248,250,258,269,275,298,338,354,356,357,367,386,391,418,443,455,474,505,517,522,541,546,620,641,697,775,936,951,999,1016,1059,1098,1185,1187,1189,1198,1203,1216,1219,1253,1365,1370,1501,1511,1881,1888,1918,2118,2197,2288,2358,2426,2473,2533,2547,2567,2802,3492,3621,3696,4088,4178,4229,4308,4565,4759,4825,4877,5083,5428,5609,5647,5914,6091,6127,6422,6621,7712],"values":[1.0

{"value":"So it has come to this. Fast, expensive cars that only the upper 1% will ever drive. The girls that pose next to them in gearhead magazines. Second-tier and no-name actors. Cheap promotional appearances by people from niche culture. <br /><br />This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer. Don't get me wrong; I love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy. But please, will the collective Braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty \"Woooooosaaaaaah\", then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time? Then actually MAKE some movies like that again? <br /><br />I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop-culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother thinks their Maverick now (not that half of them even will get that reference). Some executive said, \"Hey, what demographic do you want to leach $9.50 out of?\" \"I know, sir. The 18-35 market.\" \"Ok, let's give them poker, girls, and fast cars.\" \"Brilliant idea, sir.\" The result? A film that I've seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not, starring Dolph Lundgren. <br /><br />Now don't misunderstand me;I am not a film snob. Over-the-top artsy flicks like The English Patient don't float my boat, but generic films that should not have even been made straight to DVD bother the hell out of me too. Only adolescent gearheads will have their engines revved by this, and I imagine the ones in the higher end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard.","finished_norm":["so","it","have","come","to","thi","fast","expens","car","that","onli","the","upper","will","ever","drive","the","girl","that","pose","next","to","them","in","gearhead","magazin","secondti","and","nonam","actor","cheap","promot","appear","by","peopl","from","nich","cultur","br","br","thi","be","the","garbag","that","hollywood","have","to","offer","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","love","the","mindless","action","flick","with","hot","chick","a","much","a","the","next","gui","but","pleas","will","the","collect","braintrust","that","greenlight","thi","stuff","pleas","stop","count","to","ten","breath","have","a","hearti","woooooosaaaaaah","then","rewind","twentyf","year","and","recal","what","make","movi","enjoy","onc","upon","a","time","then","actual","make","some","movi","like","that","again","br","br","i","have","noth","against","poker","but","the","entir","popcultur","explos","it","have","enjoi","over","the","past","five","year","be","ridicul","everyon","and","their","mother","think","their","maverick","now","not","that","half","of","them","even","will","get","that","refer","some","execut","sai","hei","what","demograph","do","you","want","to","leach","out","of","i","know","sir","the","market","okai","let","give","them","poker","girl","and","fast","car","brilliant","idea","sir","the","result","a","film","that","i","have","see","a","hundr","time","late","at","night","on","spike","tv","and","much","often","than","not","star","dolph","lundgren","br","br","now","do","not","misunderstand","mei","be","not","a","film","snob","overthetop","artsi","flick","like","the","english","patient","do","not","float","my","boat","but","gener","film","that","should","not","have","even","be","make","straight","to","dvd","bother","the","hell","out","of","me","too","onli","adolesc","gearhead","will","have","their","engin","rev","by","thi","and","i","imagin","the","on","in","the","high","end","of","their","iq","rang","will","see","thi","for","what","it","be","a","junkyard"],"filtered":["come","thi","fast","expens","car","onli","upper","ever","drive","girl","pose","next","gearhead","magazin","secondti","nonam","actor","cheap","promot","appear","peopl","nich","cultur","br","br","thi","garbag","hollywood","offer","get","wrong","love","mindless","action","flick","hot","chick","much","next","gui","pleas","collect","braintrust","greenlight","thi","stuff","pleas","stop","count","ten","breath","hearti","woooooosaaaaaah","rewind","twentyf","year","recal","make","movi","enjoy","onc","upon","time","actual","make","movi","like","br","br","noth","poker","entir","popcultur","explos","enjoi","past","five","year","ridicul","everyon","mother","think","maverick","half","even","get","refer","execut","sai","hei","demograph","want","leach","know","sir","market","okai","let","give","poker","girl","fast","car","brilliant","idea","sir","result","film","see","hundr","time","late","night","spike","tv","much","often","star","dolph","lundgren","br","br","misunderstand","mei","film","snob","overthetop","artsi","flick","like","english","patient","float","boat","gener","film","even","make","straight","dvd","bother","hell","onli","adolesc","gearhead","engin","rev","thi","imagin","high","end","iq","rang","see","thi","junkyard"],"filtered2":["come","fast","expens","car","onli","upper","ever","drive","girl","pose","next","gearhead","magazin","secondti","nonam","actor","cheap","promot","appear","peopl","nich","cultur","garbag","hollywood","offer","get","wrong","love","mindless","action","flick","hot","chick","next","gui","pleas","collect","braintrust","greenlight","stuff","pleas","stop","count","ten","breath","hearti","woooooosaaaaaah","rewind","twentyf","year","recal","make","enjoy","onc","upon","time","actual","make","like","noth","poker","entir","popcultur","explos","enjoi","past","five","year","ridicul","everyon","mother","think","maverick","half","even","get","refer","execut","hei","demograph","want","leach","know","sir","market","okai","let","give","poker","girl","fast","car","brilliant","idea","sir","result","see","hundr","time","late","night","spike","tv","often","star","dolph","lundgren","misunderstand","mei","snob","overthetop","artsi","flick","like","english","patient","float","boat","gener","even","make","straight","dvd","bother","hell","onli","adolesc","gearhead","engin","rev","imagin","high","end","iq","rang","see","junkyard"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,8,11,12,23,24,25,26,30,34,37,41,44,49,52,54,55,57,84,100,123,124,129,150,169,172,191,198,200,206,210,211,225,236,246,247,257,274,284,297,300,315,340,346,351,361,394,397,400,440,447,461,496,505,507,542,545,548,588,630,662,666,702,715,736,880,884,912,974,1026,1042,1241,1328,1450,1477,1553,1616,1700,1743,1806,1817,1915,1921,1938,2318,2367,2591,2645,2716,2806,2913,3265,3336,3339,3453,3551,4722,5402,5618,5716,6045,7663,7805,8162,8524],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts. It all looks very promising from the get go. With some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. Normally a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and God. And they provide the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it always is helpful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good,it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell. The once brilliant actor is adequate,but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. He really must be desperate for money. Otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like

{"value":"Upon viewing Tobe Hooper's gem, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />While Tobe Hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.<br /><br />I was disappointed the crock didn't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. Perhaps, in the coming years, we'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset.

{"value":"OK, the portrayal of the stereotyped 'indians' in this story is just plain WRONG. I do agree that Elvis looks rather good here, but yeah, his skin color does seem to change during the movie. I was thinking, OK,...he was never THAT tan in real life. It's some of the most obvious brown 'indian' makeup that I have ever seen. It's as bad as the 'indians' on 'F-Troop' and the old Hollywood westerns who were played by Jewish and Italian American actors and not real Native Americans!<br /><br />This movie is o.k., but typically lame story and mediocre songs, like in all of Elvis' later films. He just did them because Colonel Parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible! I keep thinking 'thank God' that Elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out. It is cool to see character actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, though.<br /><br />Burgess Meredith's 'indian' makeup is absolutely AWFUL. It's The worst of the bunch for sure. What were the filmmakers thinking? Was Mr. Meredith doing this one just for the money or what? I do love certain Elvis movies, though. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. I can even stand to watch his movie with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner,'Change Of Habit' in which Elvis plays an inner-city doctor.<br /><br />Oh well, at least Elvis made a FEW good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.<br /><br />I'll always love ELVIS!
