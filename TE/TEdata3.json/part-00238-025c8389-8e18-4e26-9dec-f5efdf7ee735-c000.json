{"value":"I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take a cut in pay, Warner Bros. retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract.<br /><br />She decided to take the money. But her career suffered accordingly.<br /><br />That might explain what she was doing in \"Comet Over Broadway.\" (Though it doesn't explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it, too.) \"Ludicrous\" is the word that others have used for the plot of this film, and that's right on target. The murder trial. Her seedy vaudeville career. Her success in London. Her final scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part.<br /><br />Also, the sets and costumes looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! Turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month. Watch any OTHER one and you'll be doing yourself a favor.","finished_norm":["i","read","somewher","that","when","kai","franci","refus","to","take","a","cut","in","pai","warner","bro","retali","by","cast","her","in","inferior","project","for","the","remaind","of","her","contractbr","br","she","decid","to","take","the","monei","but","her","career","suffer","accordinglybr","br","that","mai","explain","what","she","be","do","in","comet","over","broadwai","though","it","doe","not","explain","why","donald","crisp","and","ian","hunter","be","in","it","too","ludicr","be","the","word","that","other","have","us","for","the","plot","of","thi","film","and","that","right","on","target","the","murder","trial","her","seedi","vaudevil","career","her","success","in","london","her","final","scene","with","her","daughter","no","part","logic","lead","to","the","next","partbr","br","conjur","the","set","and","costum","look","like","bmovi","stuff","and","her","hair","turner","be","show","lot","and","lot","of","her","movi","thi","month","watch","ani","other","on","and","you","will","be","do","yourself","a","favor"],"filtered":["read","somewher","kai","franci","refus","take","cut","pai","warner","bro","retali","cast","inferior","project","remaind","contractbr","br","decid","take","monei","career","suffer","accordinglybr","br","mai","explain","comet","broadwai","though","doe","explain","donald","crisp","ian","hunter","ludicr","word","us","plot","thi","film","right","target","murder","trial","seedi","vaudevil","career","success","london","final","scene","daughter","part","logic","lead","next","partbr","br","conjur","set","costum","look","like","bmovi","stuff","hair","turner","show","lot","lot","movi","thi","month","watch","ani","favor"],"filtered2":["read","somewher","kai","franci","refus","take","cut","pai","warner","bro","retali","cast","inferior","project","remaind","contractbr","decid","take","monei","career","suffer","accordinglybr","mai","explain","comet","broadwai","though","doe","explain","donald","crisp","ian","hunter","ludicr","word","us","plot","right","target","murder","trial","seedi","vaudevil","career","success","london","final","scene","daughter","part","logic","lead","next","partbr","conjur","set","costum","look","like","bmovi","stuff","hair","turner","show","lot","lot","month","watch","ani","favor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,16,18,19,27,28,31,32,39,46,56,61,72,86,92,109,121,126,145,156,157,249,258,273,297,303,322,361,395,426,511,532,633,659,776,804,813,973,1092,1110,1231,1260,1271,1286,1394,1545,2267,2500,2571,2780,2967,3127,3279,3306,3318,3855,4627,5152,6466,7463],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,16,18,19,27,28,31,32,39,46,56,61,72,86,92,109,121,126,145,156,157,249,258,273,297,303,322,361,395,426,511,532,633,659,776,804,813,973,1092,1110,1231,1260,1271,1286,1394,1545,2267,2500,2571,2780,2967,3127,3279,3306,3318,3855,4627,5152,6466,7463],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,2.814133962290301,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,3.841892750832105,2.031112399272319,2.0489535369135887,2.125691139326857,2.2190595059394194,2.2391270689902285,2.34599021453259,2.3451551414151686,2.3360150694757706,2.6754694156628323,2.7061321952397077,2.9674191958529437,2.813490713560207,2.868298950055202,2.885344817328191,3.0399731661399314,6.306336162260736,3.3909310864081816,6.781862172816363,3.4446025032006995,3.550241531602284,3.6405503117064195,3.770603439954617,3.7740817043309423,3.8204358137024927,4.072271754381138,4.550761997504193,4.1554492608600455,4.327618446189983,4.589376833631972,4.3773181147422555,4.499089986959872,4.403125998698128,4.581533656170946,5.373120909544144,5.408212229355414,5.243909178064138,5.444579873526289,5.604922523601468,5.463272006538442,6.101359409915359,5.822646007446338,5.878215858601149,5.878215858601149,5.999576715605417,6.214688095222362,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691635E-4,1.8602795149399935E-4,1.8607388323225535E-4,1.8603647642975702E-4,1.8605408257553734E-4,1.8602692579199618E-4,1.8608478274858737E-4,1.8599924801951205E-4,1.8602799080910518E-4,1.8622023057954316E-4,1.8769783390787715E-4,1.8602829807924046E-4,1.8620447863330696E-4,1.8622387792744196E-4,1.861392812821261E-4,1.860372092005117E-4,1.8610121319542622E-4,1.8618879305904966E-4,1.8604681349948787E-4,1.8604613329387874E-4,1.8621351007268023E-4,1.8606477321704627E-4,1.8606505480995566E-4,1.8618425007623418E-4,1.8604688061125816E-4,1.8622610376242837E-4,1.8609343812280913E-4,1.8602753456676007E-4,1.8611187150105956E-4,1.8616867552698435E-4,1.8606568589487284E-4,1.8616533862436834E

{"value":"Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated, hated, hated it! Easily the most booooring movie I have ever seen in my life. Don't know where Leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. If you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this!

Eli Roth does shine for moments of maybe ten, putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption. overall, i found most of it pointless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the demise of cast, in a way though, wishing that journey never happened (probably should've been getting laid instead of

{"value":"This movie should be number one on the bottom 100. The acting is so horrible that when my son and I watched it we nearly got physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on and on about how bad it is but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob's review as I see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet.

Had we, I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher act. But I am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film. Don't spoil your opinion of Carrie by viewing it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","should","be","numb","on","on","the","bottom","the","act","be","so","horribl","that","when","my","son","and","i","watch","it","we","nearli","get","physic","ill","and","the","stori","be","wrong","i","can","go","on","and","on","about","how","bad","it","be","but","all","i","realli","want","to","do","be","add","a","warn","to","frankbob","review","a","i","see","no","on","els","have","go","to","the","troubl","of","do","so","yet","do","not","wast","your","time","monei","energi","or","anyth","els","on","thi","movi","thank","good","we","see","it","on","tv","so","we","do","not","spend","anyth","on","it","have","we","i","would","have","be","forc","to","write","the","peopl","respons","for","thi","abomin","and","be","forc","to","hurl","a","execr","in","their","gener","direct","in","conclus","i","would","like","to","sai","that","i","have","alwai","enjoi","watch","carri","fisher","act","but","i","be","sad","to","sai","that","she","be","not","worth","watch","in","thi","particular","film","do","not","spoil","your","opinion","of","carri","by","view","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","numb","bottom","act","horribl","son","watch","nearli","get","physic","ill","stori","wrong","go","bad","realli","want","add","warn","frankbob","review","see","els","go","troubl","yet","wast","time","monei","energi","anyth","els","thi","movi","thank","good","see","tv","spend","anyth","forc","write","peopl","respons","thi","abomin","forc","hurl","execr","gener","direct","conclus","like","sai","alwai","enjoi","watch","carri","fisher","act","sad","sai","worth","watch","thi","particular","film","spoil","opinion","carri","view"],"filtered2":["numb","bottom","act","horribl","son","watch","nearli","get","physic","ill","stori","wrong","go","bad","realli","want","add","warn","frankbob","review","see","els","go","troubl","yet","wast","time","monei","energi","anyth","els","thank","good","see","tv","spend","anyth","forc","write","peopl","respons","abomin","forc","hurl","execr","gener","direct","conclus","like","alwai","enjoi","watch","carri","fisher","act","sad","worth","watch","particular","spoil","opinion","carri","view"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,13,17,21,23,25,37,65,89,102,104,126,172,176,194,196,197,200,219,225,230,283,299,312,338,434,455,516,527,538,611,621,651,752,832,860,915,956,970,1193,1374,1488,2616,5267,5480,5943],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,13,17,21,23,25,37,65,89,102,104,126,172,176,194,196,197,200,219,225,230,283,299,312,338,434,455,516,527,538,611,621,651,752,832,860,915,956,970,1193,1374,1488,2616,5267,5480,5943],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,2.324031090670098,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.4876543214774305,1.9073850067444174,1.9940046109572438,2.087553710177271,4.145648034064571,2.2391270689902285,2.5001408943598484,2.5040471493269134,2.5378812223426954,4.957850110419152,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.5792094178355414,2.641219492619754,2.7121382192999195,2.7678802023081546,2.7949961309240425,2.8824835850471584,5.944191487473691,3.4101163271295305,3.2787058260741455,3.442099372982581,3.439602492783994,3.43462735814388,3.520060914452293,7.0893719235153645,3.5474598886404074,3.719831114581194,3.7987743169213135,3.8538340941043407,3.9363956947973615,3.969732115064953,4.086456389373095,4.240607069200353,4.443131333311827,4.5432147918688095,5.2288713006995975,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.950611946162387E-4,1.9488834103030834E-4,1.9493646046718572E-4,1.948972720031748E-4,1.9491571671815183E-4,1.9488726647479027E-4,1.9494787912034467E-4,1.9485827042812348E-4,1.948883822179669E-4,1.950897782428106E-4,1.9663775885027946E-4,1.9488870412317756E-4,1.9507327604168802E-4,1.9509359931150187E-4,1.9500497338335542E-4,1.948980396753208E-4,1.949650921386094E-4,1.9505684337379827E-4,1.949081014207692E-4,1.9490738881741226E-4,1.9508273764260573E-4,1.9492691654791663E-4,1.9492721155291192E-4,1.950520840116856E-4,1.949081717290292E-4,1.9509593116155143E-4,1.9495694674437393E-4,1.948879042450976E-4,1.94976258092362E-4,1.9503576765685172E-4,1.9492787269599054E-4,1.950322718197488E-4,1.951280277962667E-4,1.953091368623546E-4,1.9495660985328894E-4,1.9489792146657012E-4,1.949681931739204E-4,1.949177151705369E-4,1.9485847840320693E-4,1.9490804106090198E-4,1.951033722258574E-4,1.949963457450004E-4,1.9503271626469297E-4,1.9486817648792665E-4,1.9490809062107926E-4,1.9489784817751027E-4,1.9496381933204325E-4,1.9499762630199998E-4,1.949579746365812E-4,1.9492707345315945E-4,1.948983301449127E-4,1.95297645172

{"value":"Sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give this is that it maintains that old tradition. These three tales aren't anything as good as any from the original Creepshow.<br /><br />By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners. The second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop, makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it. The third story includes a cameo from Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for

{"value":"I am not sure who is writing these<br /><br />glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it STKINKS. I have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is LAME it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all I could take. Plot is terrible, acting is even worse. And there is no development at all.<br /><br />Even the David Cocteau films are better than this. RUN AWAY from JIGSAW . I expected to hate the acting, which can be forgiven in direct to video movies, if the plot is good.<br /><br />This had no scares, very little Gore,<br /><br />and a truly unattractive cast.<br /><br />I watched this with three other friends<br /><br />who I hope are still talking to me!<br /><br />They wanted me to fling the disc out the window.

{"value":"I do agree that though this story by Melville just might be unfilmable, this isn't even a credible try. To move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story's intent and nature; possibly you might have been able to move it over to England, but it must be a period piece. Even our story narrator--the proprietor--tells it in a flashback, going back even further, somewhere around 1800. Towards the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me an expletive deleted break!!! Even around 1800, such behavior didn't work very well, in view of the ending. And the movie's ending? I don't know what it was, because I didn't watch the entire travesty--I had to stop.

{"value":"Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is totally ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. Its a typical straight to DVD/TV-movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: Over-acting by has been actors, side steps from the plot that are left unexplained, THE GIRL SHOWS HER T*ts(why, god, why??), people do not react to things as they would in real life. I'm not even gonna bother you with details, it would take all night. Well, OK, just one: If two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street, one of the victims practically dies in your arms, his blood spurts from his head-wound all over you, would your first concern be; \"Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!\"?

{"value":"Please, spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or a Coen brother, plus the lives of yet ANOTHER group of supposedly high school age people acting out their Dawson Creek-brand teen angst complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie \"feel\" cool and, we have intensely and painfully inept satire.<br /><br />This isn't even watered-down 'Ferris Bueller'...I'd rather watch a traffic light change.<br /><br />Only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission: when the Betty Masked girls meet a Richard Nixon Masked friend. It's a surreal moment. Priceless even.<br /><br />But for the rest of it, I'd rather have a toothache.

{"value":"Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet.<br /><br />The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it was a major city at this time, it's best days already passed by. Secondly, Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the major town at that time was Lübeck.<br /><br />But worse than all that: The directing! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene it, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.<br /><br />I can't understand at all how a major television station could

{"value":"never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire.i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film.i found it unbelievable,lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted.a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain't.the acting by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue. perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn't fit into any genre,it didn't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense,in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling

{"value":"This film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening.

{"value":"Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: \"Merry Christmas to everyone!\" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think Christmas is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged.

{"value":"For a science scare movie to work well it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling. This movie is neither. Sure there is a pseudo-original twist in that the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but that is a very minor twist. There is the government conspiracy angle, the crusader protagonist who has personal experience...<br /><br />And one real drawback of this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Although the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied, he is not. Without the pity the movie is pointless. The other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous. The subplots are convoluted and annoying. And the saddest thing is the movie is too flat to even be enjoyed as mock material.

{"value":"This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, as I did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that

{"value":"Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />Other factual errors: A train is shown to be operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (the red hat), whereas the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes.

{"value":"Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes.

{"value":"(When will I ever learn-?) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Please allow me to vent my spleen...<br /><br />I will admit: the setting, presumably New York City, has never been so downright ugly and unappealing. I am reminded that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles. And all the smoking-! If the plan was to cheapen the characters, it succeeded.<br /><br />For a film to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there has to be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close, and I could not wait for him to finish off Nicky. If a stray shot had struck Mikey, well, it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most.<br /><br />I can't remember when I detested a film as strongly. I suppose I'm a rube who doesn't dig \"art\" flicks.

{"value":"Just think, it cost a total of $250,000 to make \"Clerks\". How the hell did they spend $45 Million to make this glorified music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see... I know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything.<br /><br />Anyway, it wasn't an awful film I guess. The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 Million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made

{"value":"Five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up. But is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye?<br /><br />Lucky me, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment features the very worst in acting, special effects, make up and music. And these were supposed to be scary? Hmm.. I think I've been more freaked out during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear, you'll sit there like I was, bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Don't bother. It never does. In fact, I even stopped fast forwarding the commercials, as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature. AND the ending is the ultimate cop-out. Yep, none of this actually ever happened.

{"value":"I saw this movie at an actual movie theater (probably the $2.00 one) with my cousin and uncle. We were around 11 and 12, I guess, and really into scary movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us pick the movie (and we probably never got to do that again!) and sooo disappointed afterwards!! Just boring and not scary. The only redeeming thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and that wasn't all that great, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst. This was from what I can recall, one of the most boring, non-scary, waste of our collective $6, and a waste of film. I have read some of the reviews that say it is worth a watch and I say, \"Too each his own\", but I wouldn't even bother.

{"value":"This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I guess. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't. Confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to shut off. It was too boring. I can do slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually, story-wise, acting, etc. This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience.

{"value":"I wanted to like this movie. But it falls apart in the middle. the whole premise is a good one and ties up nicely, but the middle runs off tangent. The people I watched with were getting annoyed while it ran off course, and hoping it would end sooner than it did. Another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment! I found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the Schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well, but it lacks Pixar's writing and soul. I think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule, while missing the plot. People old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily. Edit out most of the middle section, make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid flick. I wish I had better things to say.

{"value":"Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made...ever?' It is Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of famously bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously.<br /><br />It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.<br /><br />It was released only on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD's had to wear protective gear and receive regular

{"value":"First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the \"sporty type\" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this

{"value":"I watched this....let me rephrase...suffered through this because I'm a fan of Eva's. I don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos. I like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close. The budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on the caterer.<br /><br />The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not.<br /><br />I won't bother saying who did what and how, because it isn't worth the effort. I'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that I didn't have to actually pay for this garbage.<br /><br />OH!!

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to people who like \"comedies\" in the vein of \"Big Momma's House\" or \"Norbit\"; people who think that words like \"butt\" are inherently hysterically funny.

{"value":"The Return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie. I was willing to put up with this, however I was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks. At the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and that was just a flashback. With this movie it's impossible to tell. Can you believe the same dude who made Army of Darkness produced this crap? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on Sci Fi channel. That movie had it all: sluts, zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm.

{"value":"I went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful. And it was. I really felt sorry for the star-studded cast- Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress... before she made this movie- Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances I know and love her for. Fred's dad, played by Trevor Peacock (of Vicar of Dibley fame, amongst others), had about one line.<br /><br />The plot was predictable and all over the place, and the humour was... lacking. (However, there was one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic) Don't see this movie unless your only other

{"value":"There is a lot of talk of torture these days. That's all this movie is. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From then on its a just-for-kicks assault on him. I don't know at what point you do something about it. There is a wife and child out there somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been some times when he could have acted. The movie seems to be somebody's joke. I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders, we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two. Nevertheless, why would someone make a film like this? What appeals does it have except for sadism. The conclusion is totally unsatisfying, but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist. Oh, well.
