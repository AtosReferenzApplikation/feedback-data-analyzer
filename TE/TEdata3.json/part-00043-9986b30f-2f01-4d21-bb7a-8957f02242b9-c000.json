{"value":"Really. Does any week go by that Oprah doesn't remind us that she was abused as child?<br /><br />She makes herself the focus of every interview.<br /><br />Oprah cannot resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks. She often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote. Directors are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest's faces because that's what counts - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says.<br /><br />Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always all about Oprah.<br /><br />Oprah says - Feel sorry for me, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my battle with my weight. Feel my hurt when I'm turned away from a fancy store after they've already closed. Feel good for buying my magazines and books. Feel good for my success. Feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good. Feel good for making me rich beyond belief.<br /><br />My interpretation of her point of view: YOU VIEWERS ARE ALL DEEPLY FLAWED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE. I have all the answers for your life though I have nothing in common with you plebes. I have never been married nor do I want to be. I have never had to raise a family - but I know all about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me over others - witness \"Legends Ball 2006\". Gayle is my best friend but we are not gay.<br /><br />As of 7/31/2006, the heading on her website actually reads : \"Oprah.com is your leading source for information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health.\" How presumptive and obnoxious is that ? <br /><br />In June 2006, she crashed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to gather footage for her September 2006 shows. She keeps promising to quit TV but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight.<br /><br />Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from God. She's just one very lucky, overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it her own. She happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic. <br /><br />Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of this age and it amazes me that people cannot see through her facade. <br /><br />So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too Oprah if you can fit that inflated ego through the door - This way now to the great egress

{"value":"I saw \"Paris Je T'Aime\" because a friend really wanted to see it so I went along with him. Going in, I was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater I really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production. The \"stories\" are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful. What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors most definitely gave this French film a remarkably non-French feel. The clichés about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them were playing with clichés about Paris but by spending so much time making fun of French clichés, they directly and regrettably promoted them once more. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We get it.<br /><br />The worst segments were: the one directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the mime one (the worst?); the hair products one; the one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); the vampire one (When I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood). The one with Natalie Portman, which really looked like a Mentos commercial and it was stupid (the blind young man should know Portman was just playing a part when she called him). On and on it went. It felt endless.<br /><br />I didn't like the Coen Bros one as well. It really plays with those Parisien clichés but I didn't find it funny. Just annoying. The Gus Van Sant one was interesting but it was so slight (and the punchline was obvious) that it barely registered.<br /><br />There were only two \"successful\" segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman. Nice irony there. And the segment about the African who is stabbed. It's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place in any city around the world.<br /><br />The last segment, the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of French but the segment came off as being condescending.<br /><br />The whole project felt forced and uninspired. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. All in all, with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff, \"Paris Je T'Aime\" was an awful cinematic

{"value":"It was 1974 and it starred Martin Sheen.<br /><br />That alone says what to expect of this movie.<br /><br />And it was a movie. According to the movie, Slovik had reformed, got a good woman, and didn't want to fight.<br /><br />In real life, Slovik may have been a naive innocent, or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system.<br /><br />Whoever Slovik was or wasn't is for history to decide, but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting, and the movie took sides.<br /><br />With no regard to servicemen who were in Viet Nam either in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's tell the truth, it was about the Viet Nam war, not WWII), EoES was as propagandistic as Gung Ho was in the forties.<br /><br />According to this movie, Slovik stated his position, plain and simple. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervous condition, and trust me, if I had done military duty, it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on KP duty or latrine duty with no problem.<br /><br />If we believe the teleflick, Slovik didn't have that option, no doubt because of his criminal history.<br /><br />Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I've learned that movies from this decade or that decade, in dealing with service or military duty, will pretty much take the same stance over and over.<br /><br />1940s and 1950s, serve your country.<br /><br />1960s and 1970s, mock your country.<br /><br />This is the history.<br /><br />The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me. He refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion.<br /><br />Such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition, but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful.<br /><br />I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the recital of the hail Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end, with the Lord's prayer, was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster.<br /><br />I don't see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Viet Nam war.<br /><br />I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.","finished_norm":["it","be","and","it","star","martin","sheenbr","br","that","alon","sai","what","to","expect","of","thi","moviebr","br","and","it","be","a","movi","accord","to","the","movi","slovik","have","reform","get","a","good","woman","and","do","not","want","to","fightbr","br","in","real","life","slovik","mai","have","be","a","naiv","innoc","or","he","mai","have","just","want","to","manipul","the","systembr","br","whoever","slovik","be","or","be","not","be","for","histori","to","decid","but","thi","be","a","movi","that","deal","with","dessert","at","a","time","when","a","countri","be","question","why","it","be","fight","and","the","movi","take","sidesbr","br","with","no","regard","to","serviceman","who","be","in","viet","nam","either","in","a","willi","nelson","would","sai","let","tell","the","truth","it","be","about","the","viet","nam","war","not","wwii","eoe","be","a","propagandist","a","gung","ho","be","in","the","fortiesbr","br","accord","to","thi","movi","slovik","state","hi","posit","plain","and","simpl","he","have","a","nervou","problem","heck","i","have","a","clinic","nervou","condit","and","trust","me","if","i","have","do","militari","duti","it","would","have","be","no","problem","for","me","to","either","just","let","my","nerv","go","and","fail","at","my","task","and","get","a","demot","or","put","on","kp","duti","or","latrin","duti","with","no","problembr","br","if","we","believ","the","teleflick","slovik","do","not","have","that","option","no","doubt","becaus","of","hi","crimin","historybr","br","whatev","the","viewer","want","to","believ","be","up","to","the","viewer","i","have","learn","that","movi","from","thi","decad","or","that","decad","in","deal","with","servic","or","militari","duti","will","pretti","much","take","the","same","stanc","over","and","overbr","br","and","serv","your","countrybr","br","and","mock","your","countrybr","br","thi","be","the","historybr","br","the","whole","movi","seem","predict","hollywood","to","me","he","refus","to","serv","and","onli","when","he","be","be","strap","up","to","be","execut","doe","he","show","emotionbr","br","such","a","emot","outburst","can","have","easili","work","to","hi","advantag","in","hi","declar","of","hi","nervou","condit","but","obvious","the","movi","want","to","show","him","a","a","human","be","and","onli","when","he","be","about","to","die","doe","he","becom","sorrowfulbr","br","i","be","not","a","cathol","but","i","think","the","recit","of","the","hail","mari","by","ned","beatti","and","sheen","at","the","end","with","the","lord","prayer","be","funni","a","it","sound","like","thei","be","try","to","see","who","can","sai","it","fasterbr","br","i","do","not","see","how","thi","movi","can","be","watch","without","realiz","it","be","aim","at","tricki","dick","nixon","and","the","viet","nam","warbr","br","i","hope","it","be","all","worth","it","for","slovik","and","anyon","who","choos","to","follow","hi","exampl"],"filtered":["star","martin","sheenbr","br","alon","sai","expect","thi","moviebr","br","movi","accord","movi","slovik","reform","get","good","woman","want","fightbr","br","real","life","slovik","mai","naiv","innoc","mai","want","manipul","systembr","br","whoever","slovik","histori","decid","thi","movi","deal","dessert","time","countri","question","fight","movi","take","sidesbr","br","regard","serviceman","viet","nam","either","willi","nelson","sai","let","tell","truth","viet","nam","war","wwii","eoe","propagandist","gung","ho","fortiesbr","br","accord","thi","movi","slovik","state","hi","posit","plain","simpl","nervou","problem","heck","clinic","nervou","condit","trust","militari","duti","problem","either","let","nerv","go","fail","task","get","demot","put","kp","duti","latrin","duti","problembr","br","believ","teleflick","slovik","option","doubt","becaus","hi","crimin","historybr","br","whatev","viewer","want","believ","viewer","learn","movi","thi","decad","decad","deal","servic","militari","duti","pretti","much","take","stanc","overbr","br","serv","countrybr","br","mock","countrybr","br","thi","historybr","br","whole","movi","seem","predict","hollywood","refus","serv","onli","strap","execut","doe","show","emotionbr","br","emot","outburst","easili","work","hi","advantag","hi","declar","hi","nervou","condit","obvious","movi","want","show","human","onli","die","doe","becom","sorrowfulbr","br","cathol","think","recit","hail","mari","ned","beatti","sheen","end","lord","prayer","funni","sound","like","thei","try","see","sai","fasterbr","br","see","thi","movi","watch","without","realiz","aim","tricki","dick","nixon","viet","nam","warbr","br","hope","worth","slovik","anyon","choos","follow","hi","exampl"],"filtered2":["star","martin","sheenbr","alon","expect","moviebr","accord","slovik","reform","get","good","woman","want","fightbr","real","life","slovik","mai","naiv","innoc","mai","want","manipul","systembr","whoever","slovik","histori","decid","deal","dessert","time","countri","question","fight","take","sidesbr","reg

{"value":"This film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in Math. He didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues. After a rough start at his new school, he starts making friends, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff.<br /><br />Beside some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way, focussing on Benjamin and his problems.<br /><br />If you already don't like this story outline, save your time and watch something else. If you do, please be aware of the following:<br /><br />1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self-pity all the time. For me he wasn't that kind of \"charming loser\" who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching.<br /><br />2) The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't (except for Janosch maybe). And yes, I know this film is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself, I don't believe him.<br /><br />3) Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do an \"Ejaculate on the cookie\"-contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm-wet cookie afterwards. Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way, it's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.<br /><br />4) There's a sub-plot about Benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife - still, I don't know why it's there and where to put it. It just bored me.<br /><br />Well, I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin, being without a message, concept, scheme, whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious. However, I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked \"The Other Sister\" you'll probably like this one, too. I hated both.<br /><br />17-year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do, it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it.<br /><br />2 out of

{"value":"This is crap....utter crap. I cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this. Full Moon has a number of awful films, but this has got to be the worst. First off, the plot doesn't exist. It's odd. It's like, they took an idea for the story, and kind of never really got around to developing it. They seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two \"heroes\" drove around in the desert, and Bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes. There were two scenes in the movie (when Dez and Dazzy are driving, and when Dez and Bradbury are driving) where it just went on and on and on...it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action. They just drove for about 5 minutes, with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape.<br /><br />Next, we come to the acting, which is simply horrible. First off, the girl who plays Dazzy is just a beast. She is so scary looking, I wanted to look away when she was on screen! Horrible casting. Then, you have the guy who played Dez, who couldn't act if his life depended on it. His \"crying\" is actually funny, and his madman antics are even funnier. The guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad, as is the guy who plays Bradbury. There was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever.<br /><br />The makeup effects...hmmm, can anyone say pathetic? The \"effects\" were so fake, they were laughable. The crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone, they cut away, and when they come back, the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound. Nice. Did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what?! I must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl's apartment...nice makeup there too. I think they were going for a drugged look, and I think she was supposed to have a black guy, but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween.<br /><br />This movie is just horrible from the start. The story is stupid and very, very unoriginal, the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old, the acting is the lowest of the low, and so on. STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs. It's only 70 minutes long in the first place, and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel. Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage.","finished_norm":["thi","be","craputt","crap","i","cannot","believ","ani","compani","can","even","get","peopl","to","work","on","a","film","like","thi","full","moon","have","a","numb","of","aw","film","but","thi","have","get","to","be","the","wrong","off","the","plot","doe","not","exist","it","odd","it","like","thei","take","a","idea","for","the","stori","and","kind","of","never","realli","get","around","to","develop","it","thei","seem","to","have","just","wast","a","lot","of","time","film","outsid","shot","while","the","two","hero","drive","around","in","the","desert","and","bradburi","talk","nonsens","for","about","minut","there","be","two","scene","in","the","movi","when","dez","and","dazzi","be","drive","and","when","dez","and","bradburi","be","drive","where","it","just","go","on","and","on","and","onit","be","almost","like","music","video","in","the","place","where","there","should","have","be","some","dialog","or","action","thei","just","drive","for","about","minut","with","noth","but","music","and","shot","of","the","surround","landscapebr","br","next","we","come","to","the","act","which","be","simpli","horribl","off","the","girl","who","plai","dazzi","be","just","a","beast","she","be","so","scari","look","i","want","to","look","awai","when","she","be","on","screen","horribl","cast","then","you","have","the","gui","who","plai","dez","who","can","not","act","if","hi","life","depend","on","it","hi","cry","be","actual","funni","and","hi","madman","antic","be","even","funni","the","gui","who","plai","the","desk","clerk","at","the","hotel","be","just","a","bad","a","be","the","gui","who","plai","bradburi","there","be","no","act","that","deserv","ani","recognit","in","thi","movi","whatsoeverbr","br","the","makeup","effectshmmm","can","anyon","sai","pathet","the","effect","be","so","fake","thei","be","laughabl","the","crazi","littl","robot","look","catepillar","thing","grab","onto","someon","thei","cut","awai","and","when","thei","come","back","the","gui","have","a","complet","fake","look","flesh","wind","nice","do","thei","run","out","of","monei","on","the","makeup","budget","or","what","i","must","sai","the","druggi","chick","who","be","in","the","on","girl","apartmentnic","makeup","there","too","i","think","thei","be","go","for","a","drug","look","and","i","think","she","be","suppos","to","have","a","black","gui","but","it","look","much","like","cheap","zombi","makeup","for","halloweenbr","br","thi","movi","be","just","horribl","from","the","start","the","stori","be","stupid","and","veri","veri","unorigin","the","direct","look","a","tho","it","be","perform","by","a","year","old","the","act","be","the","low","of","the","low","and","so","on","stai","awai","from","thi","movi","at","all","cost","it","onli","minut","long","in","the","place","and","atleast","minut","of","that","be","take","up","by","either","music","and","no","dialog","or","the","charact","sit","around","in","the","hotel","do","not","wast","your","time","on","thi","piec","of","garbag"],"filtered":["thi","craputt","crap","believ","ani","compani","even","get","peopl","work","film","like","thi","full","moon","numb","aw","film","thi","get","wrong","plot","doe","exist","odd","like","thei","take","idea","stori","kind","never","realli","get","around","develop","thei","seem","wast","lot","time","film","outsid","shot","two","hero","drive","around","desert","bradburi","talk","nonsens","minut","two","scene","movi","dez","dazzi","drive","dez","bradburi","drive","go","onit","almost","like","music","video","place","dialog","action","thei","drive","minut","noth","music","shot","surround","landscapebr","br","next","come","act","simpli","horribl","girl","plai","dazzi","beast","scari","look","want","look","awai","screen","horribl","cast","gui","plai","dez","act","hi","life","depend","hi","cry","actual","funni","hi","madman","antic","even","funni","gui","plai","desk","clerk","hotel","bad","gui","plai","bradburi","act","deserv","ani","recognit","thi","movi","whatsoeverbr","br","makeup","effectshmmm","anyon","sai","pathet","effect","fake","thei","laughabl","crazi","littl","robot","look","catepillar","thing","grab","onto","someon","thei","cut","awai","thei","come","back","gui","complet","fake","look","flesh","wind","nice","thei","run","monei","makeup","budget","must","sai","druggi","chick","girl","apartmentnic","makeup","think","thei","go","drug","look","think","suppos","black","gui","look","much","like","cheap","zombi","makeup","halloweenbr","br","thi","movi","horribl","start","stori","stupid","veri","veri","unorigin","direct","look","tho","perform","year","old","act","low","low","stai","awai","thi","movi","cost","onli","minut","long","place","atleast","minut","take","either","music","dialog","charact","sit","around","hotel","wast","time","thi","piec","garbag"],"filtered2":["craputt","crap","believ","ani","compani","even","get","peopl","work","like","full","moon","numb","aw","get","wrong","plot","doe","exist","odd","like","take","idea","stori","kind","nev

{"value":"So, back when Herbie made his first appearance, I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away. I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations of a riveting/delightful story whenever I watch a movie, if I'm not on some sort of medication. And this is another good movie for the medicated. There are no major laughs, no complex plot lines, no difficult twists. Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded.<br /><br />This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was excellent in that), and I can't say I was terribly impressed this time around. Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color, she just didn't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers. Her 'need for speed' wasn't portrayed consistently in the film - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part, and seemed to always be looking for something (a party? designer togs? new place to spend money?) off set. I couldn't see any chemistry with Justin Long; that romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon, who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy.<br /><br />It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry, I might have worn some just to be loyal. His new feature (?) was a little inconsistent (does he channel the thoughts of his driver? Does he now skateboard?) but whatever. We all knew how it was going to end, but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie. And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home. <br /><br />What would have made the movie worthwhile? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at the very least, Herbie's as good as Lassie - but clearly that's asking too much. Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as \"Herbie Goes Bananas\" and \"the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes\" when it comes to innovation? <br /><br />I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations. For the rest of us....it's for when you have the 'flu and just can't take the suspense of Rear

{"value":"I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.<br /><br />First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a shapely woman's behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.<br /><br />The rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. Really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.<br /><br />Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing.<br /><br />I'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. However, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll.<br /><br />This is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious

{"value":"A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up.<br /><br />In the case of \"the Big Sky,\" writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize-winning author, A.B. Guthrie. In so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation.<br /><br />The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from a naive, Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man, has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent. In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming.<br /><br />Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever. Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character, who was an incidental, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, is missing altogether!!! It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, wasn't irritating enough. So Zeb/Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious, voice-over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing, editing, and direction.<br /><br />Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (William Wyler's \"Ben-Hur\" is an excellent example). But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself.<br /><br />The story is dull and clichéd, and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas' star appeal, which could have helped lift this film, was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given.<br /><br />If you can believe it, the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer prize-winning sequel, \"The Way West,\" also starring Kirk, is even worse.<br /><br />In my opinion, \"The Big Sky\" further solidifies Howard Hawks' place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of

Then it was Gene Okerland who when he got \"mad as the wrestler\" would say either \"Were out of time\" or \"Well be right back\" acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced. After he went to the WWF Ken Resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who \"Georgeous\" Jimmy Garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing. After he jumped ship then Larry Nelson came on board which he was so bad that Phyllis George would of been an improvement! Then there's Doug McLeod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows! Then he was offered more pay by the Minnesota North Stars hockey team. At ringside who can forget Roger Kent who's mispronouncing of words and sentences were historic Like when a wrestler was big \"Hes a big-on!\" punched or kicked in the guts \"right in the gussets\"or when kicked \"He punted him\" or \"the \"piledriver should be banned\" after Nick Bockwinkle used it on a helpless opponent.(Right Roger like you care!) After he left to greener money(WWF) they had Rod Trongard who's announcing style was great but different. Like when a wrestler scraped the sole of his boot across another guys forehead he'd say\"Right across the front-e-lobe\" or when a wrestler is in trouble \"Hes in a bad bad way\". He also would say AWA the baddest,toughest,meanest, most scientific wrestlers are here right in the AWA!(No extra money Verne Gagne!) After he left(WWF) Larry(Wheres Phyllis?!) Nelson took over and I would talk to someone else or totally ignore him.(WWE wisely didn't take him!) Also Greg Gagne had the ugliest wrestling boots I ever saw a yellow color of something I don't want to say.Also when hes looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest restroom! Jumpin Jim Brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why Greg was ever his partner. Jerry Blackwell(RIP)was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why Verne had himself win against him.(Puhleeeeze!) Then when Vince McMahon would hire Gagnes jobbers, he would make most of them wrestle squash matches.

{"value":"Save the $8.97 you'll spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real film by Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />I'm a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of H.G. Wells, I had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time. It's horrible.<br /><br />There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $20 Million budget for this production. Where the heck did it go? Did he use most of it to buy a new house? Finance his retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is actually good about this film. It does stay true to the book AND there are a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible... and I do mean horrible special effects. Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the CGI. To me, most of it looked like \"stop action\" card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $20 Million project should be using.<br /><br />There's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created. I've seen films with budgets of less than $2 Million look better. Much better.<br /><br />In my opinion the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines' special effects in this film. IN fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this film. There's no excuse with today's technology for a film to look like a 50's B-Movie unless that was the intention, which shouldn't have been with this particular project.<br /><br />A problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur film-making.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that I produced a $45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.<br /><br />I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.","finished_norm":["save","the","you","will","spend","at","walmart","to","bui","thi","dvd","and","go","see","the","real","film","by","steven","spielbergbr","br","i","be","a","filmmak","and","be","a","avid","fan","of","hg","well","i","have","to","bui","thi","hope","to","sit","down","and","watch","three","hour","of","good","entertain","instead","it","take","four","dai","to","finish","watch","thi","becaus","i","can","not","stand","watch","much","than","minut","at","a","time","it","horriblebr","br","there","be","report","that","timothi","hine","have","a","million","budget","for","thi","product","where","the","heck","do","it","go","do","he","us","much","of","it","to","bui","a","new","hous","financ","hi","retir","or","what","let","me","start","with","what","be","actual","good","about","thi","film","it","doe","stai","true","to","the","book","and","there","be","a","few","good","perform","in","it","i","can","respect","the","actor","who","obvious","try","to","make","thi","a","good","film","but","good","perform","be","quickli","overshadow","by","horribl","and","i","do","mean","horribl","special","effect","ani","freshman","film","school","student","can","have","do","a","much","well","job","with","the","cgi","to","me","much","of","it","look","like","stop","action","card","board","cutout","that","be","us","rather","than","sophist","cgi","softwar","that","a","million","project","should","be","usingbr","br","there","no","excus","for","the","amateur","post","product","that","be","appli","to","thi","film","my","own","partner","and","i","sit","down","and","recreat","our","version","of","the","ferri","scene","us","softwar","that","cost","littl","than","and","within","a","dai","have","five","minut","of","scene","that","look","well","and","much","realist","than","what","hine","creat","i","have","see","film","with","budget","of","littl","than","million","look","well","much","betterbr","br","in","my","opinion","the","special","effect","us","in","the","origin","king","kong","be","much","sophist","and","well","than","hine","special","effect","in","thi","film","in","fact","i","have","a","much","well","appreci","for","attack","of","the","killer","tomato","becaus","of","thi","film","there","no","excus","with","todai","technologi","for","a","film","to","look","like","a","bmovi","unless","that","be","the","intent","which","should","not","have","be","with","thi","particular","projectbr","br","a","problem","i","have","with","the","dvd","transfer","be","that","the","film","be","jerki","anoth","demonstr","of","amateur","filmmakingbr","br","overal","i","have","to","sai","that","i","produc","a","project","in","that","have","well","cinematographi","and","special","effect","than","thi","filmbr","br","i","strongli","encourag","anyon","who","appreci","good","filmmak","or","who","be","a","fan","of","wotw","to","leav","thi","film","on","the","shelf","and","watch","attack","of","the","foot","woman","instead","it","would","be","easi","on","the","ey"],"filtered":["save","spend","walmart","bui","thi","dvd","go","see","real","film","steven","spielbergbr","br","filmmak","avid","fan","hg","well","bui","thi","hope","sit","watch","three","hour","good","entertain","instead","take","four","dai","finish","watch","thi","becaus","stand","watch","much","minut","time","horriblebr","br","report","timothi","hine","million","budget","thi","product","heck","go","us","much","bui","new","hous","financ","hi","retir","let","start","actual","good","thi","film","doe","stai","true","book","good","perform","respect","actor","obvious","try","make","thi","good","film","good","perform","quickli","overshadow","horribl","mean","horribl","special","effect","ani","freshman","film","school","student","much","well","job","cgi","much","look","like","stop","action","card","board","cutout","us","rather","sophist","cgi","softwar","million","project","usingbr","br","excus","amateur","post","product","appli","thi","film","partner","sit","recreat","version","ferri","scene","us","softwar","cost","littl","within","dai","five","minut","scene","look","well","much","realist","hine","creat","see","film","budget","littl","million","look","well","much","betterbr","br","opinion","special","effect","us","origin","king","kong","much","sophist","well","hine","special","effect","thi","film","fact","much","well","appreci","attack","killer","tomato","becaus","thi","film","excus","todai","technologi","film","look","like","bmovi","unless","intent","thi","particular","projectbr","br","problem","dvd","transfer","film","jerki","anoth","demonstr","amateur","filmmakingbr","br","overal","sai","produc","project","well","cinematographi","special","effect","thi","filmbr","br","strongli","encourag","anyon","appreci","good","filmmak","fan","wotw","leav","thi","film","shelf","watch","attack","foot","woman","instead","easi","ey"],"filtered2":["save","spend","walmart","bui","dvd","go","see","real","steven","spielbergbr","filmmak","avid","fan","hg","well","bui","hope","sit","watch","three","hour","good","entertain","in

{"value":"I hope the viewer who regards 'Dream Machine' as one of Corey Haim's finest and the \"best movies of the century\" was kidding. Undetected sarcasm on my part? I sincerely hope so.<br /><br />'The Dream Machine' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of Corey Haim's career (except 'Prayer of the Rollerboys' which was surprisingly decent). Here, Haim plays nonchalant college boy, Bernie, who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl's attention. Lucky for Bernie, a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband, hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner--Bernie--with a gift: a slick Porsche Turbo. However, unbeknownst to the woman, and unfortunate for Bernie, is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk. Now, being that in this movie, bodies don't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk, Bernie is unaware of this. In fact, the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise. In particular, a grizzly man follows him around, desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected.<br /><br />This is a low-grade action fizzle as many of Haim's films like this are (see The Double O Kid). Despite being part action, part romantic comedy, this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem (i.e. Bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body, and a hit-man finding out that the Porsche is going to be hard to find). After which, and thanks to poor acting by Haim (I loved this kid, too, but it's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously couldn't act well) and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result, inappreciable. To add injury to insult, the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self-evident songs you would hear in Team America (see the 'date' montage).<br /><br />Loyal Corey Haim fans, however, should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance. However, others understanding that Haim's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered, might expect mediocrity, as will viewers just looking for early 90s b-comedy fluff to pass the

{"value":"Bad Actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. <br /><br />Preston Blake is an annoying, obnoxious, boy, who decides that, when written a blank check by a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank, <br /><br />hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash. Preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars.<br /><br />Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine. In this case our hot heroine is a child molesting FBI agent who dates the eleven year old Preston, and promises another date when he turns 17. <br /><br />However, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as \"The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur\". It was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the FBI does not give a damn about random people . What I have failed to explain is that Preston uses the alias \"Macintosh\" to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.<br /><br />Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film. I don't see how it only has a

{"value":"Sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This one will always be in the bad movie category, simply because all but Shu Qi's performance was terrible.<br /><br />Martial Angel tells of Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years before. But her past returns to haunt her as Chi Lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company Cat works for. In order to rescue him, she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days, six other feisty women, to save the day...<br /><br />I may have told the synopsis cheesily, but this is a cheesy story. In fact, the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice-paper in water. If I could sum it up, take a bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw away the budget, and you have Martial Angels: a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all.<br /><br />Mind you, I do have to give credit where credit's due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action, as it was her performance that shone through. Okay, you can't say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she did manage to dig some character out from her role. Other than that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimmers and very brief.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the film just fell to pieces. Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable, special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen, poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes, camera angles that were elementary and unflattering, and direction I've seen better from a lost dog.<br /><br />I guess this film was a too many cooks affair. Most probably, the budget was blown away on the over-enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen. That didn't leave much else.<br /><br />Frankly, the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn. Charlie's Angels, it ain't. In fact, while sisters can do it for themselves, none of that was really that apparent here.<br /><br />Definitely one to

{"value":"Hip. Erotic. Wickedly sexy ... whatever. It's \"The Terminator\" with werewolves.<br /><br />No, seriously. The cop saves the girl (waitress!) from the big monster and refers to himself as her 'protector'. The lead actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of emulating Kyle Reese ... there's a massacre in a police precinct ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and it even contains dialogue along the lines of \"You said it yourself, he won't ever stop. Never.\" The dire script comes from a first-time screenwriter who, thank God, hasn't sold anything since this, and it's all thrown together by famously bad director Richard Friedman.<br /><br />The movie opens in a strip bar (always a good sign), and a mean-looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason, pursued by three cops. One of them is black, and (shock horror!) he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes. The film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up a little with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending.<br /><br />For the most part, the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less. If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio, along with some of the supporting cast, shows signs of talent. DarkWolf in his human form is played by gargantuan Kane Hodder -- famous for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the 'Friday the 13th' movies. He's decent enough, especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles.<br /><br />It's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former 'Power Rangers' actresses. And it's unnervingly clear that the editor spent WAY too much time on that scene ... anyway, the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good, and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all.But the CGI is bad. Just plain bad. I mean seriously, if you can't reach some level of realism - why bother? Just throw a little extra money into the make-up! Aside from the terrible script, this movie does have it's moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. It's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do, but just don't spend any money on it.

{"value":"This was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970's, usually on the \"4am Movie\" or one time, on the 7:30 PM \"Channel 6 Big Movie\" and still another on Creature Double Feature.WHen local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time) It was of the time. A couple of low-rent Abbott and Costello wannabees(Frankie Ray and Robert Ball) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in Army Surplus remainders) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation, and wind up encountering extraterrestrials. They first go into Bronson Canyon to what would be later the famous Batcave on BATMAN, and encounter the remains of a dead \"carrot monster\". Later, in the cave they're chased by a living carrot creature-basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head, with sparkly things on it and ping-pong ball eyes. Two of them-complete geeks,Ray and Ball-are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being \"examined\" by space amazons-Dr Poona(nooo kidding!) and Professor Tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini \"uniforms\". We were too young at the time,to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this \"examination\" scene would more than suggest. Turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster, are stranded on earth with a ship that's well hidden and are trying to return to their world.<br /><br />The film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when Eric Von Zipper and his crew from Frankie and Annette's films, were the height of B-film, drive-in comedy.So it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks.<br /><br />For some reason I only thought I'd imagined seeing this film to start with. No, I really saw it. And when it was released on \"restored\" DVD I was assured in my memory. The comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid, but whatever.The budget is non-existent, which, is a minor miracle when you think about it, that it even got made and we can talk about a \"restored\" version here and now-over 40 years later. The payoff is the girls who want to learn about \"love\" and \"kissing\" and, the upshot is the geeks-which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out. It's just goofy and silly and for the locations, has nostalgic

{"value":"It's the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others' success. Here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier 'Dracula' (1931) and 'Frankenstein' (1931) -- in a Germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires (in the shape of bats) have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims. Even though shot at Universal (and at the Bronson caves!) it's a Poverty Row feature; it's not fair to compare it with those earlier, more expensively made and superior films.<br /><br />From the familiar and exciting, chilling music of the main titles (which must have been by Mischa Bakalienikoff), through the talky but well done opening sequence, we anticipate the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good 30s mystery film. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen. That's the disappointment.<br /><br />We get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing, low budget, not enough of Dwight Frye, the overdone presence of Maude Eburne (Aunt Gussie), and the premise for Lionel Atwill (Dr. von Niemann) to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) never made very clear.<br /><br />Do not watch the technicolor 'Dr. X' (1932) -- which also stars Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray but as father and daughter -- before watching this the way I did; it's an Oscar winner by comparison. So watch this one first. Structurally, 'The Vampire Bat' still isn't that good. It plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy.<br /><br />Besides 'Dr. X' and 'Mystery of the Wax Museum' (both 1932 and co starring Fay Wray), Lionel Atwill's most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in 'Son of Frankenstein' (1939) and as Moriarity in 'Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon' (1943). Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in 'Dracula' (1931). As the 'young lovers,' Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene, but that's about it. He can be seen in 'The Old Dark House' (1932), and Fay gets dragged around by Joel McCrea in 'The Most Dangerous Game' (1930). Then there's her 1933 classic 'screamer.' Too bad more time, money and rewrites weren't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Sadly, then, this drearily disappointing film only gets a

{"value":"Eight academy nominations? It's beyond belief. I can only think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leads I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and I feel distinctly cheated as a result.<br /><br />So it's a black comedy is it? Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzi's Honor? It's certainly tasteless (the shooting in the head of a policeman's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life) but with the exception of a joke about 'your favourite Mexican cigars' (which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years) I failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and I did try. There is a lot of Mafia cliché but cliché doesn't constitute humour in my book.<br /><br />Is it a romantic comedy of sorts? Never. The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.<br /><br />Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd, and it usually just has the feel of a really bad (and cheap) Mafia movie. It feels more like a homage than a parody.<br /><br />With one-dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them, the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces. Well it isn't enough; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson (repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brando's padded jowls in The Godfather?... Oh! Who cares?... all I know is, it isn't funny).<br /><br />Throw in some slow, plodding direction (this film drags on for 2 hours), some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as; \"You remember the Camora? Well we're far bigger, we'll track you down wherever you go\", and clichéd mannerisms and you'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say \"capiche?\". Prizzi's Honor is far from being Huston's \"masterpiece\" and is rather a very poor last work. It's definitely one work in the great director's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the Hudson

{"value":"Journey to the Center of the Earth is the story of some tourists of Hawaii, three of them siblings, and one of them a young British nanny babysitting a dog. When the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits, the nanny follows them (it might've just been safer to purchase more) all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore (I guess). For some reason, they actually go in the cave and then, when the place starts caving in, they try to get out to no avail, except for the six-year-old sister who they tell to go get help. Meanwhile, the more they move around in the cave, the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core. And behold, it is here where they find the City of Atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn't want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own.<br /><br />I see that Rusty Lemorande, the named director of the film has provided comments on this film, in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to Alien in L.A. Well, whatever it was, it was an amazingly cheap movie that I would rank only slightly higher than City Limits (a 1988 sci-fi film also made on a non-existent budget) because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film-making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the Earth. I also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times, funny, even if only in its subtleties. For example, the aliens asks the British girl if she's an alien and she explains that the Ministry should be sending her work visa shortly. Or when the alien girl finds Bryan and explains that he is in the city of Altantis and he mistakes this for Atlantic City, New Jersey. Little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable. Imagine how great the film could've been though if they had 1) actually intended to make it, and 2) actually had money to make it.<br /><br />I do like how in the end, no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help. She'd just be wandering around the Hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano, mind

After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality. While she has recovered from that dark past, this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days.<br /><br />The movie starts with an interesting premise, very reminiscent to Brian De Palma's \"Raising Cain\"; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror/thriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother.<br /><br />Suddenly, her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past.<br /><br />Unlike De Palma's underrated thriller, \"Doppelganger\" is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it's purpose, it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them.<br /><br />The script is full of clichés and De Palma's influence is quite obvious. While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line, the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons, and excessive use of special effects.<br /><br />The make-up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre over-use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing.<br /><br />The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for it's low quality, as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie. Sadly, all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second.

{"value":"I kind of feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one who saw through this fake film. I watched it three times, once with commentary, and I found myself getting annoyed at all the close-ups, all the times the screen just blacks out, and worst of all, I feel the film never really resolves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he didn't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief, or with himself. That and he was an idiot. If it weren't for the commentary by Peter Cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from, I wouldn't have been able to stomach it at all. I enjoy French movies, but this is one that was completely absurd.<br /><br />Diary of a Country Priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but, that alone cannot save this deadly dull tripe. Scene after scene of extreme close-ups where characters don't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do NOT make an interesting or relevant story. How this film ever became a classic is mind boggling: it reminds me more of The Emperor's New Clothes.<br /><br />Yes, Claude Laydu's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking, if you are a sadist, but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption. The young priest's triumph over the countess's pride is a weak scene but 90% of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest's melancholy thoughts. This priest doesn't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful.<br /><br />Being that I don't speak or understand French I was looking forward to doing the English SUBTITLE thing to help understand the film. Well, the English SUBTITLE is at times impossible to view/read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much I could not read (and I am not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days). <br /><br />I really wanted to like this film . I try out everything \"chosen\" by the Criterion Collection, and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod. However, I sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character, and it never materialized. He just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter. And for that, I say it

Maybe all they needed was a real budget.<br /><br />Munchies, as many viewers have pointed out already, is something of a Gremlins parody. Hence, all the references to the movie. The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig. An annoying dufus named Paul, aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans, is holed up with his dad in the caves. His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist, searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything, but proof of U.F.O.'s. And that's where the Munchies come into the picture. Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice. They name him Arnold, stash him in a bag, and bring him home so Paul's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life.<br /><br />Paul, the idiot that he is, breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold (a wager he made with his dad, if he loses, it's off to community college to get a 'real' career). The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug, Cecil (television veteran Harvey Korman), wonders what his neighbors are up to. So, he and his lazy son, some airhead hippie type (who looks more like they should've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast) to go and snatch Arnold. Why? A get rich quick scheme of course. And of course, even Cecil's son is too dumb to look after Arnold. And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold, he multiplies into more Munchies.<br /><br />This wasn't even a movie that was so bad it was good. It was just plain awful. I was hoping that the Munchies would've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them, even Paul and his girlfriend. At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie. Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets. And really bad writing all around--it wasn't even funny--not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye. Like I said, Munchies, if they had been given an actual budget and better actors, they might've been able to pull off a good parody.

{"value":"What the hell is this? \"Kooky drama\"? \"Lawyers in Loony Tunes Land\"? The world's thinnest, most duck-faced actress (even more duck-faced and anorexic than Michelle Pfeiffer) overacts her bony butt off, making cretinous grimaces that would shame Bugs Bunny, in one of the most animated non-animated TV series ever. This is also the most annoying one-hour-format TV show ever, hence the worst.<br /><br />All the men act like pansies, and I for one refuse to believe that even hip big-city shysters are all as delta-male-like as this sorry (short) bunch. Wuss Peter MacNicol manages to be even more irritating than Calista Flockofducks with his fake Hollywood \"shshshs\" speech impediment: it's the sort of pseudo-inability to pronounce the letter \"S\" by turning it into a moronic \"SH\" that the likes of Jon Shtewart and Christian Shlater also practice with zeal. Watching MacNicol talk, I always wonder how come his jaw doesn't dislocate... Human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the \"SH\" sound more than three times per second. He is a medical wonder.<br /><br />This badly conceived and written legal-drama/comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s PC. It has POLITICAL CORRECTNESS written with huge, neon letters. Is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of LAWYERS being full of ideals, high principles, and moral fiber? Laughable, but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in Hollywood since its inception. After all, what is more noble than defending a murderer, a rapist, or a thief? When a TV series as retarded as \"Ally McBeak\" starts preaching to America about how it should run the country, then it must be time for Paris Hilton to become President. \"Ally McQuack\" is both a product of recent and large-scale Western dumbing-down and a perpetrator of it.<br /><br />Those supposed touches of \"eccentricity\", like the UNBELIEVABLY annoying musical numbers, are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny. This is no Monty Python. Whatever \"new\" the talent-free makers of this garbage were aiming for, they failed with honours. \"Ally McBeak\" is a highly commercialized TV venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies, bored housewives, and bipolar lawyers. It's yet another dull \"objection overruled sustained your Honour may I call the witness\" legalistic baloney that the American audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange

{"value":"I have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty, and I can honestly say I feel violated. I had read the reviews and heard the warnings, and I thought I was prepared for anything - at best I thought, a faithful (if misguided) attempt at an original adaptation; at worst, a so-good-it's-bad \"Plan 9\" for the new millennium. So when I managed to pick up a copy in Walmart while in Florida and brought it back to the UK, I joked to my friends \"Prepare for the worst movie ever made!\" Oh, cruel Karma. There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend this film. The \"special\" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a Spectrum ZX81. The acting is terrible, the accents are WORSE than terrible (one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the British Isles, from Scotland to Wales via Northern Ireland), the dialogue is stilted, the editing is non-existent, the production values prove that no expense has been gone to. Words really cannot describe how bad this movie is; from the Union Flag flying from the horribly CGI'd Thunderchild (the Royal Navy flies the White Ensign, NOT the Union flag) to the woodworm ridden acting, this is quite simply a crime against film making. When you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the 'net (the Star Wars short \"Troops\" for example), the whole \"we're enthusiastic amateurs\" argument goes right out of the window. And if you believe an interview with Hines on the Pendragon website, this film had an 8 figure budget! I can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the US. Maybe the problem is that Hines & co tried to make a film of the book, rather than turn the book into a film (if that makes any sense). Characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words. Ironically enough, the ONLY person who even came close to giving a decent performance was Darlene Sellers, the ex-soft porn actress. My advice? Pray like crazy that Jeff Wayne doesn't screw up, and go watch the Spielberg version. It may not be true to the text of the book, but I can say this; As a lifelong HG Wells fan (and Englishman as well) Speilbergs film IS true to the Spirit of the book. Maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country, but I will say this: Timothy Hines stole three hours of my life, and I want them

{"value":"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, \"Phantom Menace\", is that it will likely blow \"Titanic\" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare \"Titanic\" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, \"You don't see a lot of movies, do you?\" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than \"Titanic\", and for the same price tag.<br /><br />\"Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,\" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, \"Phantom Menace\" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.<br /><br />James Cameron's \"Titanic\" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, \"I wish I could trade places with you.\" g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.<br /><br />The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or

{"value":"Welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack. Where we'll see, That's right. Another movie that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously, this movie had me so confused at the end, i thought i was rewatching \"At Dawn they Sleep.\" The plot seems simple enough....well that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then...um.. explodes? i have no idea what happened. and that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN. That's really sad when i can't even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes.<br /><br />Anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere. so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town. suspicious? nah. so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady. and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking. The guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to. He gets lost and then finds his way back.<br /><br />Oh, i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca. Then they leave. There's really no point to this scene. It's really just padding. if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared.<br /><br />But sadly, that was actually the best part of the movie. wait. let me rephrase that. REALLY sadly that was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on IMDb to find out what happened. But of course no one else knows so i'm SOL. <br /><br />Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments i've ever seen on film. They dressed her up in a dress, he gets kidnapped, then released, he runs back to the house, then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends? seriously. i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie. i mean, as bad as movies such as \"War of the Robots\" are, at least they MAKE SENSE. this movie doesn't even make the ATTEMPT to be coherent. the ending was as confusing as the end of \"At dawn they sleep\" and the plot was much more boring. This movie gets a 1 just for its sheer \"i have no idea what happened in this movie\"ness. \"Witches mountain\" gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10.","finished_norm":["welcom","to","movi","on","the","chill","classic","pack","where","we","will","see","that","right","anoth","movi","that","make","absolut","no","sens","serious","thi","movi","have","me","so","confus","at","the","end","i","think","i","be","rewatch","at","dawn","thei","sleep","the","plot","seem","simpl","enoughwel","that","be","until","second","into","the","movi","where","a","girl","supposedli","kill","a","cat","and","thenum","explod","i","have","no","idea","what","happen","and","that","be","befor","the","titl","screen","that","realli","sad","when","i","ca","not","even","tell","what","happen","in","the","minutesbr","br","anywai","it","star","a","photograph","with","a","big","mustach","who","find","thi","girl","after","dump","hi","other","girlfriend","on","the","wai","to","take","pictur","of","someth","somewher","so","we","get","there","but","not","befor","somebodi","steal","their","jeep","to","drive","it","foot","out","of","the","wai","toward","a","town","suspici","nah","so","thei","decid","to","stai","at","thi","desert","villag","with","on","old","ladi","and","then","blah","blah","stuff","happen","and","blah","blah","talk","the","gui","with","the","mustach","go","out","in","the","fog","for","some","reason","even","though","the","old","ladi","tell","him","not","to","he","get","lose","and","then","find","hi","wai","backbr","br","oh","i","forget","to","mention","thi","be","all","after","a","incredibli","pointless","minut","of","them","stai","in","the","hous","of","a","gui","who","look","like","that","buggi","ey","gui","from","casablanca","then","thei","leav","there","realli","no","point","to","thi","scene","it","realli","just","pad","if","you","cut","it","out","no","on","would","have","notic","or","caredbr","br","but","sadli","that","be","actual","the","well","part","of","the","movi","wait","let","me","rephras","that","realli","sadli","that","be","the","well","part","of","the","movi","becaus","the","rest","be","so","confus","that","i","have","to","look","on","imdb","to","find","out","what","happen","but","of","cours","no","on","els","know","so","i","be","sol","br","br","serious","the","last","minut","of","the","movi","be","some","of","the","much","mindscrew","moment","i","have","ever","see","on","film","thei","dress","her","up","in","a","dress","he","get","kidnap","then","releas","he","run","back","to","the","hous","then","at","the","end","the","witch","be","in","the","hous","and","it","end","serious","i","have","hardli","ever","be","so","confus","in","a","movi","i","mean","a","bad","a","movi","such","a","war","of","the","robot","be","at","littl","thei","make","sens","thi","movi","doe","not","even","make","the","attempt","to","be","coher","the","end","be","a","confus","a","the","end","of","at","dawn","thei","sleep","and","the","plot","be","much","much","bore","thi","movi","get","a","just","for","it","sheer","i","have","no","idea","what","happen","in","thi","movi","witch","mountain","get","confus","movi","watcher","out","of"],"filtered":["welcom","movi","chill","classic","pack","see","right","anoth","movi","make","absolut","sens","serious","thi","movi","confus","end","think","rewatch","dawn","thei","sleep","plot","seem","simpl","enoughwel","second","movi","girl","supposedli","kill","cat","thenum","explod","idea","happen","befor","titl","screen","realli","sad","ca","even","tell","happen","minutesbr","br","anywai","star","photograph","big","mustach","find","thi","girl","dump","hi","girlfriend","wai","take","pictur","someth","somewher","get","befor","somebodi","steal","jeep","drive","foot","wai","toward","town","suspici","nah","thei","decid","stai","thi","desert","villag","old","ladi","blah","blah","stuff","happen","blah","blah","talk","gui","mustach","go","fog","reason","even","though","old","ladi","tell","get","lose","find","hi","wai","backbr","br","oh","forget","mention","thi","incredibli","pointless","minut","stai","hous","gui","look","like","buggi","ey","gui","casablanca","thei","leav","realli","point","thi","scene","realli","pad","cut","notic","caredbr","br","sadli","actual","well","part","movi","wait","let","rephras","realli","sadli","well","part","movi","becaus","rest","confus","look","imdb","find","happen","cours","els","know","sol","br","br","serious","last","minut","movi","much","mindscrew","moment","ever","see","film","thei","dress","dress","get","kidnap","releas","run","back","hous","end","witch","hous","end","serious","hardli","ever","confus","movi","mean","bad","movi","war","robot","littl","thei","make","sens","thi","movi","doe","even","make","attempt","coher","end","confus","end","dawn","thei","sleep","plot","much","much","bore","thi","movi","get","sheer","idea","happen","thi","movi","witch","mountain","get","confus","movi","watcher"],"filtered2":["welcom","chill","classic","pack","see","right","anoth","make","absolut","sens","serious","confus","end","think","rewatch","dawn","sleep","plot","seem","simpl","enoughwel","second","girl","supposedli","kill","cat","thenum","explod","ide

{"value":"I had high expectations of this movie (the title, translated, is \"How We Get Rid of the Others\"). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right-wing government's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing in general, and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they're contributing something to the establishment (the establishment being called \"the common good\", but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology).<br /><br />Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie completely blows its chance. The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. And for an alleged comedy, the movie has nearly no funny scenes. The comedy, I assume, is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over-serious, rather than evoking either laughter or thought.<br /><br />The script is rife with grave errors in disposition. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun, and who's trying to save everybody, by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa. All this is beside the point! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement. But it doesn't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about. Maybe it was afraid of going too far? How cowardly. That's not art. It's not even real satire.<br /><br />Søren Pilmark, a very serious and by now one of Denmark's absolutely senior actors, was very good. He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had. Everybody else: nothing special (well, perhaps except for Lene Poulsen, who did supply a convincing performance).<br /><br />In fact, a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the formulation nor the delivery. Why is it so difficult to make it sound right? Why must it be so stilted and artificial? I hope, when people look at these movies fifty years from now, they don't think that this was how people talked in general Danish society.<br /><br />3 out of

{"value":"***THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILER(S)*** <br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Chuck Norris as an actor, but I worship him in all other ways. He also have his own fan web site with \"Chuck Norris facts\" that is really entertaining. But this movie looks like someone was joking with the audience putting all those \"facts\" into one movie. I really don't remember when I wasted my time more than with this \"action\". I don't know what's the worst this movie can offer you: unoriginal and thousand-times-made plot of terrorists who are trying to nuke US by smuggling nuke on US soil or perhaps that \"great\" dialogs and Chucks words of wisdom about life and everything else. Someone may find the worst that terrorists actually speak English in everyday life. It's a never ending list of crap. Not to mention huge amount of archive footage used in film, that is kinda annoying. The chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is: Chuck Norris, of course. NO ONE else in America is not smart enough to see that! And the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous. One man is sent to walk through a whole terrorist camp UNARMED (I'm lying, he had a KNIFE), escapes his stalkers with JET PACK and then para glides for few hundred, maybe even thousand kilometers to nearest shore (Afganistan border is 450 km far away from nearest shore), where he is rescued by submarine. I hoped that at least fighting scenes will be good, but that's even more funny than the plot. If you didn't know, 85% of terrorist are masters of some martial art, but Chuck and CO beat the sh*t out of them. Not only they kill them easily, they can kick and throw them away by a single move and the bad guys fly few meters like dolls. You may ask me did I watch this movie to the end? I did. Why? Because I just wanted to see who, of these two super heroes, will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a MICROWAVE. And then I realized what fool I am. Of course, it's Chuck's movie after all. And not only he singlehandedly defuse nuke with tweezers, but he do it - TWICE!!

{"value":"The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit <br /><br />Erotic,Scary, Suspenseful, Well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.<br /><br />It is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years. And yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.<br /><br />Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. Such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. And yet there's only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. Surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.<br /><br />In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels \"editing isn't a hard job anyway right?\" The only reason this \"movie\" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason, strange how these things happen isn't it. And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.<br /><br />Oh yes we did laugh at the end, but I'm

{"value":"Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, centers around three \"couples\" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being \"harmlessly\" stalked by a gay man.<br /><br />The \"het\" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple aren't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don't add much to the theme or plot.<br /><br />The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just doesn't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up doesn't help either. Sometimes, it's okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face. Confusing.<br /><br />The more interesting pair of the characters is the \"stalker couple.\" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two.<br /><br />I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want he was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This doesn't mean, however, that the director can't achieve something with his next film.<br /><br />He seems to have something to say.","finished_norm":["shiner","direct","by","christian","calson","center","around","three","coupl","and","their","relationship","with","obsess","and","violenc","pretti","good","start","a","far","a","i","be","concern","interest","the","coupl","break","down","into","a","heterosexu","coupl","two","heterosexu","male","friend","and","a","straight","gui","be","harmlessli","stalk","by","a","gai","manbr","br","the","het","coupl","realli","do","not","have","much","of","a","role","in","the","film","there","be","some","scene","that","show","how","thei","like","to","be","aggress","when","have","sex","or","plai","around","with","each","other","but","seem","to","have","no","real","purpos","sinc","the","be","so","margin","my","assumpt","be","that","thei","repres","a","much","dai","to","dai","illustr","of","how","sexviol","be","integr","in","a","coupl","life","the","coupl","be","not","veri","aggress","and","it","not","even","shoot","in","ani","kind","of","erot","wai","a","charact","thei","do","not","add","much","to","the","theme","or","plotbr","br","the","two","male","friend","make","up","the","bulk","of","the","plot","thei","engag","in","some","gai","bash","of","sort","by","convinc","a","homosexu","man","to","have","sex","with","them","in","a","allei","thi","escal","into","violenc","and","the","violenc","chang","them","it","becom","a","mean","of","sexual","gratif","and","their","ne","for","violenc","t","releas","grow","a","the","film","progress","the","main","problem","i","have","be","the","violenc","be","not","convinc","never","onc","doe","it","seem","that","ani","of","the","charact","be","in","ani","real","danger","it","just","doe","not","work","give","that","the","whole","theme","of","the","film","be","about","the","charact","relationship","with","violenc","thi","be","a","major","problem","unfortun","the","makeup","doe","not","help","either","sometim","it","okai","other","time","it","be","veri","bad","in","on","scene","i","realli","wonder","why","on","of","the","charact","have","roug","smear","on","hi","face","confusingbr","br","the","much","interest","pair","of","the","charact","be","the","stalker","coupl","here","calson","seem","to","have","much","to","sai","and","be","abl","to","develop","a","much","coher","storylin","perhap","it","be","becaus","the","charact","seem","to","develop","much","and","have","resolut","at","the","end","shiner","mai","good","have","be","much","well","if","it","have","stick","with","thi","twobr","br","i","appreci","that","calson","want","to","achiev","a","lot","with","thi","film","it","be","admir","much","low","budget","flick","do","not","aspir","to","much","i","do","not","think","calson","achiev","want","he","be","aim","for","myself","i","find","noth","particularli","controversi","or","unsettl","shiner","be","unconvinc","thi","doe","not","mean","howev","that","the","director","ca","not","achiev","someth","with","hi","next","filmbr","br","he","seem","to","have","someth","to","sai"],"filtered":["shiner","direct","christian","calson","center","around","three","coupl","relationship","obsess","violenc","pretti","good","start","far","concern","interest","coupl","break","heterosexu","coupl","two","heterosexu","male","friend","straight","gui","harmlessli","stalk","gai","manbr","br","het","coupl","realli","much","role","film","scene","show","thei","like","aggress","sex","plai","around","seem","real","purpos","sinc","margin","assumpt","thei","repres","much","dai","dai","illustr","sexviol","integr","coupl","life","coupl","veri","aggress","even","shoot","ani","kind","erot","wai","charact","thei","add","much","theme","plotbr","br","two","male","friend","make","bulk","plot","thei","engag","gai","bash","sort","convinc","homosexu","man","sex","allei","thi","escal","violenc","violenc","chang","becom","mean","sexual","gratif","ne","violenc","releas","grow","film","progress","main","problem","violenc","convinc","never","onc","doe","seem","ani","charact","ani","real","danger","doe","work","give","whole","theme","film","charact","relationship","violenc","thi","major","problem","unfortun","makeup","doe","help","either","sometim","okai","time","veri","bad","scene","realli","wonder","charact","roug","smear","hi","face","confusingbr","br","much","interest","pair","charact","stalker","coupl","calson","seem","much","sai","abl","develop","much","coher","storylin","perhap","becaus","charact","seem","develop","much","resolut","end","shiner","mai","good","much","well","stick","thi","twobr","br","appreci","calson","want","achiev","lot","thi","film","admir","much","low","budget","flick","aspir","much","think","calson","achiev","want","aim","find","noth","particularli","controversi","unsettl","shiner","unconvinc","thi","doe","mean","howev","director","ca","achiev","someth","hi","next","filmbr","br","seem","someth","sai"],"filtered2":["shiner","direct","christian","calson","center","around","three","coupl","relationship","obsess","violenc","pretti","good","start","far","concern","interest","coupl","break","heterosexu","cou

{"value":"Uta Hagen's \"Respect for Acting\" is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the Presentational approach, and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In the Representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.<br /><br />The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.<br /><br />Time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach. To the modern eye, Olivier's highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet, Olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.<br /><br />And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: \"In-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... Smooth-ness!\" Instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in Olivier's pupils give us that impression.<br /><br />Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet, putting in a good essay at the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given Olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! <br /><br />Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed Hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn. Final analysis: \"I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.\"","finished_norm":["uta","hagen","respect","for","act","be","the","standard","textbook","in","mani","colleg","theater","cours","in","the","book","hagen","present","two","fundament","differ","approach","to","develop","a","charact","a","a","actor","the","present","approach","and","the","represent","approach","in","the","present","approach","the","actor","focu","on","realiz","the","charact","a","honestli","a","possibl","by","introduc","emot","elem","from","the","actor","own","life","in","the","represent","approach","the","actor","try","to","present","the","effect","of","a","emot","through","a","high","degre","of","control","of","movem","and","soundbr","br","the","represent","approach","to","act","be","still","partial","in","vogu","when","thi","hamlet","be","make","british","theater","have","a","long","histori","of","thi","styl","of","act","and","olivi","can","be","sai","to","be","the","ultim","king","of","the","represent","schoolbr","br","time","have","not","be","kind","to","thi","school","of","act","or","to","thi","movi","nearli","everi","work","actor","todai","us","a","present","approach","to","the","modern","ey","olivi","highli","enunci","styliz","deliveri","be","stodgi","stiff","and","stilt","instead","of","creat","a","intern","conflict","hamlet","olivi","make","a","declaim","selfimport","bullhorn","out","of","the","melancholi","dane","a","act","styl","that","would","have","carri","good","to","the","back","of","the","larg","london","theater","but","be","far","too","starchi","to","carri","off","a","modern","hamletbr","br","and","so","the","movi","creak","along","ungainfulli","todai","olivi","tendenc","to","enunci","make","some","of","hamlet","line","unintention","funni","instead","you","must","acquir","and","beget","a","tempurr","that","mai","give","it","smooth","instead","of","cry","at","meet","hi","father","ghost","a","ani","proper","actor","can","bright","fill","light","in","olivi","pupil","give","u","that","impressionbr","br","eileen","herli","be","the","onli","other","actor","of","note","in","thi","hamlet","putt","in","a","good","essai","at","the","queen","despit","the","painfulli","obviou","ag","differ","he","be","she","be","the","other","actor","in","thi","movi","have","no","chanc","to","get","anyth","els","of","signific","do","give","olivi","tendenc","to","want","to","keep","the","camera","on","him","at","all","time","br","br","sixti","year","late","you","feel","the","insecur","of","the","shakespearean","stage","actor","who","lack","the","confid","to","portrai","a","breakabl","flaw","hamlet","and","instead","elect","to","portrai","a","sort","of","elizabethan","bullhorn","final","analysi","i","would","have","such","a","fellow","whip","for","oerdo","termag","it","outherod","herod","prai","you","avoid","it"],"filtered":["uta","hagen","respect","act","standard","textbook","mani","colleg","theater","cours","book","hagen","present","two","fundament","differ","approach","develop","charact","actor","present","approach","represent","approach","present","approach","actor","focu","realiz","charact","honestli","possibl","introduc","emot","elem","actor","life","represent","approach","actor","try","present","effect","emot","high","degre","control","movem","soundbr","br","represent","approach","act","still","partial","vogu","thi","hamlet","make","british","theater","long","histori","thi","styl","act","olivi","sai","ultim","king","represent","schoolbr","br","time","kind","thi","school","act","thi","movi","nearli","everi","work","actor","todai","us","present","approach","modern","ey","olivi","highli","enunci","styliz","deliveri","stodgi","stiff","stilt","instead","creat","intern","conflict","hamlet","olivi","make","declaim","selfimport","bullhorn","melancholi","dane","act","styl","carri","good","back","larg","london","theater","far","starchi","carri","modern","hamletbr","br","movi","creak","along","ungainfulli","todai","olivi","tendenc","enunci","make","hamlet","line","unintention","funni","instead","must","acquir","beget","tempurr","mai","give","smooth","instead","cry","meet","hi","father","ghost","ani","proper","actor","bright","fill","light","olivi","pupil","give","u","impressionbr","br","eileen","herli","onli","actor","note","thi","hamlet","putt","good","essai","queen","despit","painfulli","obviou","ag","differ","actor","thi","movi","chanc","get","anyth","els","signific","give","olivi","tendenc","want","keep","camera","time","br","br","sixti","year","late","feel","insecur","shakespearean","stage","actor","lack","confid","portrai","breakabl","flaw","hamlet","instead","elect","portrai","sort","elizabethan","bullhorn","final","analysi","fellow","whip","oerdo","termag","outherod","herod","prai","avoid"],"filtered2":["uta","hagen","respect","act","standard","textbook","mani","colleg","theater","cours","book","hagen","present","two","fundament","differ","approach","develop","charact","actor","present","approach","represent","approach","present","approach","actor","focu","realiz","charact","honestli","possibl","in

Alex's brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree, thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter.<br /><br />Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg, with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere (the film was shot on location in the dismal, rusty, rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island), \"Slaughterhouse rock\" nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid, effective fright feature. This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters, a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing. The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more, with onetime \"Playboy\" playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo. Dimitri Logothetis' direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style, but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy, horrendously sophomoric silliness, and, most damagingly, Ted Landon's sloppy, inconsistent, overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far-fetched story even remotely plausible. In other words, this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn-out cinematic jail

{"value":"Rajinikanth becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times.<br /><br />There are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience: the 50ish Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling \"boy\" ('vaseekaramaana paiyan'); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons, the worst being how women of yesteryears got their exercise through household work--yet we are to believe that he is not a theist; even though he was well read, he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can go on, but you get the picture.<br /><br />There are god-men, there are gods, and there is Rajinikanth. The directory has difficulty fitting Rajinikanth into one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth doing what Tamil heroes do--stand up to villains and, in spite of being the oldest, getting courted by the prettiest girl in the movie. Rajinikanth does this well and some of Rajinikanth's trademark styles are actually enjoyable--\"baba count\" is a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a preface to an worst book to be ever written. Even that preface is punctuated with some comedy which are forced and obvious.<br /><br />The director doesn't explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero is facing several hurdles (from politicians, as usual) but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is. At the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives another one of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit. The director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene.<br /><br />A. R. Rehman's score is really interesting. Either he shows patches of brilliance or he didn't bother to invest himself fully into this movie--who can blame him. There is one scene where Rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baba count. The music is very apt for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding further tension. The songs are all mediocre, no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb.
