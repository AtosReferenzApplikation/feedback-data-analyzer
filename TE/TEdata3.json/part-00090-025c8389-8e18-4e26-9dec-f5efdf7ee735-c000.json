{"value":"I personally liked \"The Prophecy\" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, \"The Prophecy II\" sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up. Still, Walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film. The entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the \"Prophecy\" films. \"The Prophecy II\" is nevertheless the weakest of the three \"Prophecy\" films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.","finished_norm":["i","person","like","the","propheci","of","a","lot","christoph","walken","be","a","alwai","great","and","even","though","the","film","be","not","flawless","it","be","a","creepi","and","highli","origin","horrorfantasi","film","that","entertain","immens","thi","inferior","sequel","be","still","worth","watch","but","mainli","due","to","walken","walken","be","on","of","the","great","actor","around","in","my","opinion","and","he","be","onc","again","outstand","in","the","role","of","the","fall","archangel","gabriel","whom","he","plai","for","the","time","here","onc","again","the","war","between","fall","and","loyal","angel","be","bring","to","earth","gabriel","return","in","order","to","prevent","the","birth","of","a","child","name","the","child","of","the","angel","danyael","russel","wong","and","the","human","woman","valeri","jennif","beal","thi","child","can","onc","be","the","determin","factor","of","the","celesti","war","a","i","sai","abov","christoph","walken","be","onc","again","excel","a","gabriel","besid","gabriel","howev","the","propheci","ii","sadli","conjur","includ","a","bunch","of","terribli","annoi","charact","the","charact","of","valeri","be","annoi","enough","and","danayel","annoi","me","even","much","the","big","pain","in","the","ass","howev","be","the","charact","of","izzi","plai","by","brittani","murphi","a","suicid","girl","who","would","not","shut","up","still","walken","perform","be","not","the","onli","redeem","qualiti","of","the","film","the","entir","film","be","quit","dreari","and","wellshot","in","dark","color","which","contribut","a","lot","to","the","atmospher","gabriel","resurrect","scene","in","the","begin","be","furthermor","quit","impress","and","on","of","the","cool","moment","in","ani","of","the","propheci","film","the","propheci","ii","be","nevertheless","the","weak","of","the","three","propheci","film","with","walken","definit","a","christoph","walken","onemanshow","entertain","but","noth","beyond","that"],"filtered":["person","like","propheci","lot","christoph","walken","alwai","great","even","though","film","flawless","creepi","highli","origin","horrorfantasi","film","entertain","immens","thi","inferior","sequel","still","worth","watch","mainli","due","walken","walken","great","actor","around","opinion","onc","outstand","role","fall","archangel","gabriel","plai","time","onc","war","fall","loyal","angel","bring","earth","gabriel","return","order","prevent","birth","child","name","child","angel","danyael","russel","wong","human","woman","valeri","jennif","beal","thi","child","onc","determin","factor","celesti","war","sai","abov","christoph","walken","onc","excel","gabriel","besid","gabriel","howev","propheci","ii","sadli","conjur","includ","bunch","terribli","annoi","charact","charact","valeri","annoi","enough","danayel","annoi","even","much","big","pain","ass","howev","charact","izzi","plai","brittani","murphi","suicid","girl","shut","still","walken","perform","onli","redeem","qualiti","film","entir","film","quit","dreari","wellshot","dark","color","contribut","lot","atmospher","gabriel","resurrect","scene","begin","furthermor","quit","impress","cool","moment","ani","propheci","film","propheci","ii","nevertheless","weak","three","propheci","film","walken","definit","christoph","walken","onemanshow","entertain","noth","beyond"],"filtered2":["person","like","propheci","lot","christoph","walken","alwai","great","even","though","flawless","creepi","highli","origin","horrorfantasi","entertain","immens","inferior","sequel","still","worth","watch","mainli","due","walken","walken","great","actor","around","opinion","onc","outstand","role","fall","archangel","gabriel","plai","time","onc","war","fall","loyal","angel","bring","earth","gabriel","return","order","prevent","birth","child","name","child","angel","danyael","russel","wong","human","woman","valeri","jennif","beal","child","onc","determin","factor","celesti","war","abov","christoph","walken","onc","excel","gabriel","besid","gabriel","howev","propheci","ii","sadli","conjur","includ","bunch","terribli","annoi","charact","charact","valeri","annoi","enough","danayel","annoi","even","big","pain","ass","howev","charact","izzi","plai","brittani","murphi","suicid","girl","shut","still","walken","perform","onli","redeem","qualiti","entir","quit","dreari","wellshot","dark","color","contribut","lot","atmospher","gabriel","resurrect","scene","begin","furthermor","quit","impress","cool","moment","ani","propheci","propheci","ii","nevertheless","weak","three","propheci","walken","definit","christoph","walken","onemanshow","entertain","noth","beyond"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,10,11,19,27,39,40,41,49,51,64,69,70,72,82,84,86,93,98,105,113,120,128,143,147,153,169,180,188,195,197,198,219,224,236,250,271,292,301,314,319,368,379,387,392,418,419,439,458,481,488,502,522,538,568,580,634,704,706,755,835,875,896,972,1036,1152,1162,1169,1210,1373,1572,1576,1650,1660,1699,1894,2100,2189,2251,2320,2422,24

{"value":"The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night, a sprinkle of I Know what you did Last Summer, and add a tiny dash of Single White Female - now blend until completely nonsensical. There is nothing new to this plot, and revisiting the clichés I've grown so fond of wasn't even entertaining this time. This movie jumps to and from the past too much, and once I made sense of it all I realized it still didn't make much sense. Characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer, the egocentric actress, the has-been baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the spooky quiet chick, the 'nicer-than-nice' nice girl, a freakin' black cat... and I didn't care about any of them. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a certain 'video tape' that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to shoot. <br /><br />This movie isn't the worst Asian horror has to offer by far, but it is still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting, or just want to yell \"you're stupid!\" at a movie screen, or just want to have another Asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /><br />Those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere.","finished_norm":["the","review","i","read","for","thi","movi","be","pretti","decent","so","i","decid","to","check","it","out","bad","idea","thi","be","anoth","movi","about","a","ghost","out","for","reveng","against","a","group","friend","the","stori","be","stupid","mix","two","part","ringu","with","on","part","prom","night","a","sprinkl","of","i","know","what","you","do","last","summer","and","add","a","tini","dash","of","singl","white","femal","now","blend","until","complet","nonsens","there","be","noth","new","to","thi","plot","and","revisit","the","cliché","i","have","grow","so","fond","of","be","not","even","entertain","thi","time","thi","movi","jump","to","and","from","the","past","too","much","and","onc","i","make","sens","of","it","all","i","realiz","it","still","do","not","make","much","sens","charact","go","from","sane","to","psycho","killer","in","the","blink","of","a","ey","speak","of","charact","thei","be","all","your","stereotyp","favorit","the","greedi","selfish","lawyer","the","egocentr","actress","the","hasbeen","basebal","star","the","video","voyeur","the","bitter","girl","the","spooki","quiet","chick","the","nicerthannic","nice","girl","a","freakin","black","cat","and","i","do","not","care","about","ani","of","them","perhap","a","well","writer","can","have","make","the","movi","work","there","be","some","decent","scene","in","it","but","overal","thi","movi","be","a","mess","i","should","conjur","mention","a","certain","video","tape","that","would","have","be","imposs","to","shoot","br","br","thi","movi","be","not","the","wrong","asian","horror","have","to","offer","by","far","but","it","be","still","pretti","bad","if","you","just","want","to","see","some","creepi","imag","in","the","dark","or","just","want","to","laugh","out","loud","at","some","over","the","top","act","or","just","want","to","yell","you","re","stupid","at","a","movi","screen","or","just","want","to","have","anoth","asian","horror","flick","up","your","sleev","when","someon","ask","you","how","mani","you","have","see","thi","movi","be","for","you","br","br","that","seek","a","decent","plot","look","elsewher"],"filtered":["review","read","thi","movi","pretti","decent","decid","check","bad","idea","thi","anoth","movi","ghost","reveng","group","friend","stori","stupid","mix","two","part","ringu","part","prom","night","sprinkl","know","last","summer","add","tini","dash","singl","white","femal","blend","complet","nonsens","noth","new","thi","plot","revisit","cliché","grow","fond","even","entertain","thi","time","thi","movi","jump","past","much","onc","make","sens","realiz","still","make","much","sens","charact","go","sane","psycho","killer","blink","ey","speak","charact","thei","stereotyp","favorit","greedi","selfish","lawyer","egocentr","actress","hasbeen","basebal","star","video","voyeur","bitter","girl","spooki","quiet","chick","nicerthannic","nice","girl","freakin","black","cat","care","ani","perhap","well","writer","make","movi","work","decent","scene","overal","thi","movi","mess","conjur","mention","certain","video","tape","imposs","shoot","br","br","thi","movi","wrong","asian","horror","offer","far","still","pretti","bad","want","see","creepi","imag","dark","want","laugh","loud","top","act","want","yell","re","stupid","movi","screen","want","anoth","asian","horror","flick","sleev","someon","ask","mani","see","thi","movi","br","br","seek","decent","plot","look","elsewher"],"filtered2":["review","read","pretti","decent","decid","check","bad","idea","anoth","ghost","reveng","group","friend","stori","stupid","mix","two","part","ringu","part","prom","night","sprinkl","know","last","summer","add","tini","dash","singl","white","femal","blend","complet","nonsens","noth","new","plot","revisit","cliché","grow","fond","even","entertain","time","jump","past","onc","make","sens","realiz","still","make","sens","charact","go","sane","psycho","killer","blink","ey","speak","charact","stereotyp","favorit","greedi","selfish","lawyer","egocentr","actress","hasbeen","basebal","star","video","voyeur","bitter","girl","spooki","quiet","chick","nicerthannic","nice","girl","freakin","black","cat","care","ani","perhap","well","writer","make","work","decent","scene","overal","mess","conjur","mention","certain","video","tape","imposs","shoot","wrong","asian","horror","offer","far","still","pretti","bad","want","see","creepi","imag","dark","want","laugh","loud","top","act","want","yell","re","stupid","screen","want","anoth","asian","horror","flick","sleev","someon","ask","mani","see","seek","decent","plot","look","elsewher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,6,8,9,10,16,17,19,20,21,25,26,27,32,37,39,47,48,49,50,61,64,68,73,78,83,84,87,100,101,103,117,123,133,136,139,144,145,161,173,176,192,195,205,210,229,236,240,249,252,257,262,281,285,287,299,306,309,318,344,355,359,364,368,405,407,410,412,422,440,443,505,507,523,561,604,674,727,742,755,774,782,792,822,871,901,905,957,1041,1238,1383,1403,1421,1663,1725,1889,1893,1970,223

{"value":"Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And, I like low-budget, B movies. <br /><br />Sometimes, I even like bad acting, plodding scripts, wooden lines, improbably situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /><br />It just doesn't work on so many levels. For all the reasons listed previously, and many more. That includes the nonsensical, blatant use of images of female genitalia. And the many allusions to male genitalia, in a very Freudian way.<br /><br />I am convinced this is purely from ineptitude. As opposed to some attempt at doing something really different. I mean any movie that takes years to film, just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences.<br /><br />I had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character. However, sadly, it was meant to have happened, as we saw things unfold on screen. <br /><br />About the only kindness that I can express, is that the image at the end was stupendous. If this had been used at the beginning, instead of the end, it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended... <br /><br />To bad they didn't try that instead. I just don't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made. Was it the plot? Surely, it couldn't be. Was it the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was it the dialog? Emphatically, no. The music? Perhaps, but more-likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked. <br /><br />Much better efforts have died on the cutting room

{"value":"Almost a two-person play, and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important. Neither are particularly good. This might have been stronger, in fact, if it had first been crafted as a two-person play, and then worked into a film.<br /><br />Anyway, a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper (as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home). He wants to have her tell him about the daylight. He would have been better off finding someone with a day job, or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet, but then they might not have a hot bod.<br /><br />After he gets her to do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good at it), he intends to feed on her at 6 AM, at which point the sun rises. Much is made of that deadline, despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding, it will just make him hungrier. Additionally, he claims he can't let the stripper go, since she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is. There are a lot of inconsistencies.<br /><br />Why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, you'd think he'd have done a better job, or fixed the place up a bit. He's clearly not a wealthy vampire.<br /><br />This is supposedly a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although, that was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.","finished_norm":["almost","a","twoperson","plai","and","a","such","the","dialog","and","the","perform","of","the","lead","will","be","import","neither","be","particularli","good","thi","mai","have","be","strong","in","fact","if","it","have","be","craft","a","a","twoperson","plai","and","then","work","into","a","filmbr","br","anywai","a","twitchi","vampir","who","seem","slightli","autist","becom","infatu","with","a","stripper","a","a","result","of","watch","too","much","porn","in","hi","crappi","home","he","want","to","have","her","tell","him","about","the","daylight","he","would","have","be","well","off","find","someon","with","a","dai","job","or","someon","who","excel","at","paint","a","pictur","with","word","like","a","poet","but","then","thei","mai","not","have","a","hot","bodbr","br","after","he","get","her","to","do","whatev","he","want","and","he","not","terribli","good","at","it","he","intend","to","fee","on","her","at","be","at","which","point","the","sun","rise","much","be","make","of","that","deadlin","despit","the","fact","that","he","conjur","sai","that","he","can","go","without","fe","it","will","just","make","him","hungri","addition","he","claim","he","ca","not","let","the","stripper","go","sinc","she","know","about","him","but","he","let","a","numb","of","other","peopl","go","who","learn","what","he","be","there","be","a","lot","of","inconsistenciesbr","br","why","thi","vampir","choos","to","live","in","a","hous","so","poorli","board","up","that","light","from","streetlamp","and","neighbor","build","pour","in","a","if","it","be","daytim","i","be","not","sure","with","all","the","time","in","the","world","you","have","think","he","have","have","do","a","well","job","or","fix","the","place","up","a","bite","he","clearli","not","a","wealthi","vampirebr","br","thi","be","supposedli","a","remak","and","i","be","curiou","to","see","the","origin","version","of","thi","danc","of","the","damn","although","that","be","direct","by","katt","shea","and","the","other","film","she","direct","for","corman","strip","to","kill","stk","ii","be","pretti","bad"],"filtered":["almost","twoperson","plai","dialog","perform","lead","import","neither","particularli","good","thi","mai","strong","fact","craft","twoperson","plai","work","filmbr","br","anywai","twitchi","vampir","seem","slightli","autist","becom","infatu","stripper","result","watch","much","porn","hi","crappi","home","want","tell","daylight","well","find","someon","dai","job","someon","excel","paint","pictur","word","like","poet","thei","mai","hot","bodbr","br","get","whatev","want","terribli","good","intend","fee","point","sun","rise","much","make","deadlin","despit","fact","conjur","sai","go","without","fe","make","hungri","addition","claim","ca","let","stripper","go","sinc","know","let","numb","peopl","go","learn","lot","inconsistenciesbr","br","thi","vampir","choos","live","hous","poorli","board","light","streetlamp","neighbor","build","pour","daytim","sure","time","world","think","well","job","fix","place","bite","clearli","wealthi","vampirebr","br","thi","supposedli","remak","curiou","see","origin","version","thi","danc","damn","although","direct","katt","shea","film","direct","corman","strip","kill","stk","ii","pretti","bad"],"filtered2":["almost","twoperson","plai","dialog","perform","lead","import","neither","particularli","good","mai","strong","fact","craft","twoperson","plai","work","filmbr","anywai","twitchi","vampir","seem","slightli","autist","becom","infatu","stripper","result","watch","porn","crappi","home","want","tell","daylight","well","find","someon","dai","job","someon","excel","paint","pictur","word","like","poet","mai","hot","bodbr","get","whatev","want","terribli","good","intend","fee","point","sun","rise","make","deadlin","despit","fact","conjur","go","without","fe","make","hungri","addition","claim","ca","let","stripper","go","sinc","know","let","numb","peopl","go","learn","lot","inconsistenciesbr","vampir","choos","live","hous","poorli","board","light","streetlamp","neighbor","build","pour","daytim","sure","time","world","think","well","job","fix","place","bite","clearli","wealthi","vampirebr","supposedli","remak","curiou","see","origin","version","danc","damn","although","direct","katt","shea","direct","corman","strip","kill","stk","ii","pretti","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,12,20,23,26,35,37,38,39,40,46,48,66,69,72,76,78,81,90,97,102,105,115,116,119,124,125,131,132,139,154,157,162,164,165,213,220,237,258,289,302,311,353,386,391,398,431,432,447,477,483,485,492,494,497,516,557,566,580,584,600,631,666,718,751,868,889,922,926,946,965,971,1077,1152,1169,1332,1596,1881,2111,2122,2182,2223,2254,2529,2726,3258,3837,3925,3940,4437,4583,5676,6405,6449,8060],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Woody Allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and I would seriously consider saying that Annie Hall is the greatest movie ever but if I really think about it I will probably think of one or two that are better, but it would be hard. He has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown but he has never before had a film quite as bad as Melinda and Melinda. Not quite so tired and so unfunny, his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen, is it still our good old Woody? The plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together. Two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers. It is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected. We never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy. Than we begin to see the two points of view. Both center on this woman named Melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex-husband. In the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills. Both go on a wild whirl wind of events that never really make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own. They cam't stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this

{"value":"In São Paulo, the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class, they go to a party with drugs and booze. On the next day, after their classes, the date of Cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid off the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, startles with Gabriel and rolls the staircase, breaking her neck. The trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill, but along the night other tragedies happen.<br /><br />The polemic and shameful \"Cama de Gato\" is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth, and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie that I have seen along many years. The shallow, tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste. The screenplay is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogs, and boring, manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end. The acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but no talent, and I was disappointed with presence of the promising Caio Blat in this trash. The camera, framing, cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality. The sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking (probably it is a plus, since this flick sucks). The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex-exploitation.

{"value":"I am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who are, otherwise, quite sensible.<br /><br />There is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.<br /><br />The most easily explained example of this is the director's use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music. In the first half, a really dull reggae tune is played about three times (when once is too often). But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas \"California Dreamin'\" is played at least seven times, usually at top volume. Godsakes, whether you liked the song or not beforehand, you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this film four or five times. This means they've listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times.....<br /><br />All of this needless hyper-repetition (it contributes nothing to the story) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit, or if the story was in any way involving.<br /><br />But it ain't.<br /><br />The only aspect I found likeable was Bridgette Lin's charging around and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even this wore off fairly quickly.<br /><br />I'm sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it.<br /><br />I can only warn you - if you've never seen a HK movie before, don't start with this one.<br /><br />If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema. The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here.<br /><br />You have been warned

{"value":"A missed train. A wrong phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? Most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions.<br /><br />\"Happenstance\" tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal Parisian folk. It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.<br /><br />There's a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist (in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film) and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life.<br /><br />She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her. What happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters. Does the prediction come true? The concept is good, but the storytelling is flimsy. The connections from one event to the next are weak. There's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of Happenstance.<br /><br />If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film, but you'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and

{"value":"I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. However, in comparison with Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, zany, and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic, this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre... even if it did run for 11 years, that doesn't necessarily make it any good. This show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood (it was on re-runs every night, and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up), but it's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I actually have seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate critique. On its own, it's not nearly \"2 out of 10\" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them technically are the same, but they're only similar in name. For instance, since when is Alan Alda anything like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as are his characterization and outlook. The new characters are not that great; they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar, who's still (even though played by the same actor) merely a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh, yeah. With a laugh track (it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not), it comes across as creepy, due to what's going on in the other settings. And because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual Korean War, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal rift that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons.

{"value":"If anybody really wants to understand Hitler, read WWI history not WWII history. Find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time. How so many soldiers went insane, from what they saw during WWI, at the time they called it \"shellshocked\" now the call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of WWI, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death, not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them.<br /><br />This movie unfortunately misses that, as so many others do. Read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie \"paths of glory\", the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie, the sense of helplessness, and a utter devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullet catchers.<br /><br />Thats what this movie misses, its really the key point to understanding Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, for no real reason. Then comes an utter economic collapse, following the war. Those are the factors that create extremism.<br /><br />The loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism. Unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile. With really no real value, there are fictional movie's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of Hitler than this does. They just threw Hitlers name on this so it would sell

{"value":"The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful, amateurish film I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos, the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting, useless direction, and kindergarten-level production values. In this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins dining on the local hayseeds. In the thrilling climax, the creature, described by one local as \"a giant alligator with flippers\", drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch, before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $4.75 pint of Ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander, shoots at a cop, gets chased towards the lake, all so that he can eaten by the monster. Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent (to make him seem more legit), two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters, some cheesy \"pre-historic cave art\" done in crayon, and annoying banjo-pickin' background moosic. In one painful scene, the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky, even though it is clearly day time still. Even on constant fast-forward, this moovie hurts, and hurts bad.

{"value":"A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio. To say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I'd ever read would be a bold understatement. Yet I never told him this. Why? Because in a world where films like \"While She Was Out\" can be green-lighted and attract an Oscar- winning star like Kim Basinger, a screenplay lacking in character, content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell.<br /><br />As so many other reviewers have pointed out, \"While She Was Out\" is a dreadfully under-written Woman-in-Peril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Every gripe is legitimate, from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapses of logic, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise. Here are a couple of things that struck me:<br /><br />1) I don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk, the house IS a mess with toys. Since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves?<br /><br />2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen.<br /><br />3) Sure the film is stupid. But so are the countless \"thrillers\" I've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors.<br /><br />4) I LOVED the ending! <br /><br />5) Though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase, I really DO

{"value":"If another Hitler ever arises, it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start. Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown.<br /><br />Anyone who reads the accounts of Hitler's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for instance - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made, when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches. Ditto the overstated anti-Semitism, which was neither a central plank of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the times. The film makes it look as though Hitler's sole ambition from the start was the Holocaust.<br /><br />If you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore fleck-lipped ravers life the one portrayed here. Look instead for a charming, charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation, and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama's than Fred Phelps'.<br /><br />I hoped for much here, and got nothing but caricature.

{"value":"I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and I`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy so I guess this movie has something going for it<br /><br />It gets off to a bad start where Buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face . Bad guys enter the temple<br /><br />Child sits with blank expression<br /><br />Bad guys chop up the monks<br /><br />Child sits with blank expression<br /><br />Bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with ... Go on guess ? You do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at Michael Jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD<br /><br />The title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . Not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . In fact that`s the main problem ( And boy it`s a serious one ) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . I blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too .

{"value":"If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be boy. But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio.<br /><br />After having watched such a good movie as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they come up with again in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems seriously to work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment. That it is a 'global' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'Made in Indonesia' with a flavor of the west, they get away with it.<br /><br />OK, the story is nice to begin with. And it could have developed into a nice flick. But did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music OR at least good playback, and secondly good choreography? In this movie, the playback is SO BAD that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema. Every single word you hear is followed seconds LATER by the actor or whoever sing playback, and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie.<br /><br />The choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical... They only forgot to change the choreography.

{"value":"Having endured this inaccurate movie I will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. Yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have probably been better cast as Sam Houston given both men's love of oratory. I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid(an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset I feel Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan even though not born here. Our unofficial motto is \"It ain't braggin' if it is a fact\" was made for Crockett. And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. Finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texicans vs 700 Mexican Soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas school kid who pays attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused they could not

{"value":"Unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend. Pretty Young Girls In Peril. I have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road-trip shots, you actually think for a second there's going to be quality in the production. Watching \"Unhinged\" was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it's warm-up. Some of the most awkward, badly lit, overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a Valium overdose. I wondered why they didn't just put the cue-cards on camera so the actresses wouldn't have to constantly shift their gaze. The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T&A factor rather than talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as watching paint dry. Two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy/creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for Worst Acting Ever. Long pauses, weird expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films. The scenes shift suddenly with long black-outs you could drive a Mack truck through. Cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky. Eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer. But ya know, it grew on me. I felt sorry for it. I wanted to hug it, kiss it's boo-boos and make it better. The ending doesn't make up for the damage it's caused but I grinned anyway. I have my own theories regarding the whole \"banned\" hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor.

{"value":"===minor spoilers=== <br /><br />I am, like many others, a huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before MI:2, expectations were rising. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar- Angelina Jolie. What can possibly go wrong? A lot. <br /><br />The script is neither funny (which it tries really hard to be) nor exciting. You put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa!! you've got comedy? I don't think so. Excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? IF you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) is walking with Nic in the streets again. Is this excitement? Think not. Then comes the best bit- the romance between Nic and Angelina. She actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to Nic. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Are you seeing anybody?' 'What went wrong?' etc.<br /><br />Then there's only one sparkle of hope left: the car chases. They're disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there's only one. A very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement. I really had trouble following the action.<br /><br />So is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - there's no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.","finished_norm":["minor","spoiler","br","br","i","be","like","mani","other","a","huge","jerri","bruckheim","fan","so","when","i","see","all","the","beauti","poster","hang","out","front","and","the","trailer","come","by","befor","mi","expect","be","rise","a","jerri","bruckheim","product","big","car","nic","cage","and","fresh","from","a","oscar","angelina","joli","what","can","possibli","go","wrong","a","lot","br","br","the","script","be","neither","funni","which","it","try","realli","hard","to","be","nor","excit","you","put","in","a","black","person","who","be","constantli","make","racist","joke","about","himself","and","woohhaa","you","have","get","comedi","i","do","not","think","so","excit","be","total","out","of","the","pictur","of","all","and","thi","be","probabl","sai","mani","time","there","be","no","sympathet","charact","so","who","care","who","get","kill","if","you","can","stomach","the","premis","that","a","psycho","be","gonna","kill","nic","brother","unless","he","steal","car","in","dai","next","thing","you","know","be","that","kip","the","brother","be","walk","with","nic","in","the","street","again","be","thi","excit","think","not","then","come","the","well","bite","the","romanc","between","nic","and","angelina","she","actual","look","bore","have","to","utter","all","thi","stupid","line","to","nic","do","you","have","a","girlfriend","be","you","see","anybodi","what","go","wrong","etcbr","br","then","there","onli","on","sparkl","of","hope","leav","the","car","chase","thei","re","disappoint","to","sai","the","littl","becaus","the","trailer","make","it","look","like","it","be","full","of","them","and","there","onli","on","a","veri","long","on","catch","in","irritatingli","hectic","camera","movem","i","realli","have","troubl","follow","the","actionbr","br","so","be","it","a","action","movi","a","thriller","a","romant","comedi","there","no","ne","to","decid","just","avoid","thi","horribl","mess","i","will","give","out","of","star","and","i","feel","like","i","be","be","gener"],"filtered":["minor","spoiler","br","br","like","mani","huge","jerri","bruckheim","fan","see","beauti","poster","hang","front","trailer","come","befor","mi","expect","rise","jerri","bruckheim","product","big","car","nic","cage","fresh","oscar","angelina","joli","possibli","go","wrong","lot","br","br","script","neither","funni","try","realli","hard","excit","put","black","person","constantli","make","racist","joke","woohhaa","get","comedi","think","excit","total","pictur","thi","probabl","sai","mani","time","sympathet","charact","care","get","kill","stomach","premis","psycho","gonna","kill","nic","brother","unless","steal","car","dai","next","thing","know","kip","brother","walk","nic","street","thi","excit","think","come","well","bite","romanc","nic","angelina","actual","look","bore","utter","thi","stupid","line","nic","girlfriend","see","anybodi","go","wrong","etcbr","br","onli","sparkl","hope","leav","car","chase","thei","re","disappoint","sai","littl","becaus","trailer","make","look","like","full","onli","veri","long","catch","irritatingli","hectic","camera","movem","realli","troubl","follow","actionbr","br","action","movi","thriller","romant","comedi","ne","decid","avoid","thi","horribl","mess","give","star","feel","like","gener"],"filtered2":["minor","spoiler","like","mani","huge","jerri","bruckheim","fan","see","beauti","poster","hang","front","trailer","come","befor","mi","expect","rise","jerri","bruckheim","product","big","car","nic","cage","fresh","oscar","angelina","joli","possibli","go","wrong","lot","script","neither","funni","try","realli","hard","excit","put","black","person","constantli","make","racist","joke","woohhaa","get","comedi","think","excit","total","pictur","probabl","mani","time","sympathet","charact","care","get","kill","stomach","premis","psycho","gonna","kill","nic","brother","unless","steal","car","dai","next","thing","know","kip","brother","walk","nic","street","excit","think","come","well","bite","romanc","nic","angelina","actual","look","bore","utter","stupid","line","nic","girlfriend","see","anybodi","go","wrong","etcbr","onli","sparkl","hope","leav","car","chase","re","disappoint","littl","becaus","trailer","make","look","like","full","onli","veri","long","catch","irritatingli","hectic","camera","movem","realli","troubl","follow","actionbr","action","thriller","romant","comedi","ne","decid","avoid","horribl","mess","give","star","feel","like","gener"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,20,22,25,26,29,30,34,36,43,50,52,62,68,72,74,76,77,79,82,99,100,107,108,110,127,129,130,132,136,140,148,153,154,159,171,181,184,187,190,205,214,225,229,230,231,249,260,284,294,297,311,325,335,336,381,407,444,460,484,490,512,524,530,558,578,664,714,718,730,752,773,848,864,892,922,950,979,1024,1097,1156,1209,1351,1380,1431,1659,1661,1725,1825,1877,2076,2278,3167,5187,5424,6513,6766,7575,8386,8405],"values":[2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"I disliked Frosty returns and this one. Both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been done but Frosty returns was worst than this because of the unalike snowman they drew. Frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming Drama. The only good thing about this film was Frosty the snowman was alike of the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then Frosty walks by the window humming, whistling whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and I barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so I didn't pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but I played this film. It was a hassle poorly art characters just like the DVD and it was just terrible about what's going on. I watched this at night and found it dull that I fell asleep on the whole thing (Wait I always do that when I watch something while I go to sleep) But this movie was overall boring<br /><br />Overall rating: Grade -C<br /><br />This is like another holiday special bad rip-off in the frosty returns and this one. This one is the badly 4th sequel like Home alone 4 well i thought that movie was OK but home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate like this.

{"value":"Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I am starving for some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these \"opportunites\". But, sadly, I am in the minority I guess when it comes to the Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn't translate well to the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), the King experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. Many people would disagree with this, but I'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read. The reason is simple. The average King story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. In short, King takes the reader places where you can't put a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the filmed King, we're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. It's not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read, whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. For as long as King writes, Hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. I don't blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works.

{"value":"I saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and I excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's. It recalled me also Fugitive movies, a cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say that this is like a TV movie. Not exactly. Firstly, there are much more better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies might be very fun sometimes, but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time. It is not stylish at all visually and the most important, the tone of the movie is unappealing. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash. Also they are not big action scenes, but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. Besides, the assassination plot to the president is the most cliché story in this genre either, but they insist on that. And this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be. Although, Douglas is very old now, he has still potential for acting in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas cannot be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice either, because you feel as if you watch Jack Bauer and somehow, its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course she is too passive or straight in this movie, because she is a soap opera actress. The movie was not fun even one second to me, so I could not get over for a while.","finished_norm":["i","see","the","trailer","of","the","film","sever","time","at","theater","and","i","excit","it","look","like","a","classic","action","thriller","like","the","on","make","in","it","recal","me","conjur","fugit","movi","a","cat","and","mous","chase","between","dougla","and","sutherland","howev","the","sentinel","be","the","much","tasteless","action","thriller","of","all","time","a","i","see","mani","peopl","sai","that","thi","be","like","a","tv","movi","not","exactli","firstli","there","be","much","much","well","tv","movi","in","thi","genr","secondli","tv","movi","mai","be","veri","fun","sometim","but","thi","film","be","the","exact","opposit","of","have","a","good","time","it","be","not","stylish","at","all","visual","and","the","much","import","the","tone","of","the","movi","be","unapp","thi","be","not","a","action","movi","there","be","two","action","scene","consist","of","a","chase","and","a","clash","conjur","thei","be","not","big","action","scene","but","the","wrong","be","that","that","action","scene","be","veri","tasteless","like","the","whole","movi","the","love","affair","between","dougla","and","bassing","be","veri","unnecessari","besid","the","assassin","plot","to","the","presid","be","the","much","cliché","stori","in","thi","genr","either","but","thei","insist","on","that","and","thi","be","not","a","cat","and","mous","film","a","it","be","suppos","to","be","although","dougla","be","veri","old","now","he","have","still","potenti","for","act","in","a","action","thriller","in","the","film","michael","dougla","cannot","be","like","tommi","lee","jone","for","exampl","sutherland","be","a","wrong","choic","either","becaus","you","feel","a","if","you","watch","jack","bauer","and","somehow","it","charact","be","on","of","the","reason","which","make","the","film","like","a","tv","movi","eva","longoria","parker","be","a","strang","choic","of","cours","she","be","too","passiv","or","straight","in","thi","movi","becaus","she","be","a","soap","opu","actress","the","movi","be","not","fun","even","on","to","me","so","i","can","not","get","over","for","a","while"],"filtered":["see","trailer","film","sever","time","theater","excit","look","like","classic","action","thriller","like","make","recal","conjur","fugit","movi","cat","mous","chase","dougla","sutherland","howev","sentinel","much","tasteless","action","thriller","time","see","mani","peopl","sai","thi","like","tv","movi","exactli","firstli","much","much","well","tv","movi","thi","genr","secondli","tv","movi","mai","veri","fun","sometim","thi","film","exact","opposit","good","time","stylish","visual","much","import","tone","movi","unapp","thi","action","movi","two","action","scene","consist","chase","clash","conjur","thei","big","action","scene","wrong","action","scene","veri","tasteless","like","whole","movi","love","affair","dougla","bassing","veri","unnecessari","besid","assassin","plot","presid","much","cliché","stori","thi","genr","either","thei","insist","thi","cat","mous","film","suppos","although","dougla","veri","old","still","potenti","act","action","thriller","film","michael","dougla","like","tommi","lee","jone","exampl","sutherland","wrong","choic","either","becaus","feel","watch","jack","bauer","somehow","charact","reason","make","film","like","tv","movi","eva","longoria","parker","strang","choic","cours","passiv","straight","thi","movi","becaus","soap","opu","actress","movi","fun","even","get"],"filtered2":["see","trailer","sever","time","theater","excit","look","like","classic","action","thriller","like","make","recal","conjur","fugit","cat","mous","chase","dougla","sutherland","howev","sentinel","tasteless","action","thriller","time","see","mani","peopl","like","tv","exactli","firstli","well","tv","genr","secondli","tv","mai","veri","fun","sometim","exact","opposit","good","time","stylish","visual","import","tone","unapp","action","two","action","scene","consist","chase","clash","conjur","big","action","scene","wrong","action","scene","veri","tasteless","like","whole","love","affair","dougla","bassing","veri","unnecessari","besid","assassin","plot","presid","cliché","stori","genr","either","insist","cat","mous","suppos","although","dougla","veri","old","still","potenti","act","action","thriller","michael","dougla","like","tommi","lee","jone","exampl","sutherland","wrong","choic","either","becaus","feel","watch","jack","bauer","somehow","charact","reason","make","like","tv","eva","longoria","parker","strang","choic","cours","passiv","straight","becaus","soap","opu","actress","fun","even","get"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,15,16,17,19,20,21,22,23,25,32,39,43,46,47,50,54,64,67,82,95,111,113,129,149,172,199,207,237,259,307,316,332,355,417,424,462,466,467,500,523,524,530,547,548,549,570,600,635,714,777,792,809,828,950,967,972,1081,1195,1200,1201,1343,1652,1698,1703,1721,1809,1904,1912,2025,2478,2788,2851,2928,2936,2981,3159,3260,4073,4423,5304,6048,6756,6805,7814],"values":[2.0,6.0,2.0,1.

{"value":"When In Rome is a definite improvement on Getting There. Getting There I found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day I still consider it as the Olsen twins' worst. However, while When In Rome isn't a terrible movie, it's not a great one either. If I had to sum it up in one word, I would say passable. It is good fun for teenagers, but I think adults won't find much to go on.<br /><br />When In Rome does have its good points. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty as well. I will admit when I was 10 or so, I really liked them, and in general I kind of like them still. And I have enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back on target, both girls don't do that bad a job, in fact they are very appealing. Plus their outfits are to die for, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack ain't half bad either.<br /><br />However, where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script. The script is on the most part clichéd and has hints of deja vu. The plot, like most of the Mary Kate and Ashley movies, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other of the Olsen twins' work, will find some rather unoriginal elements to it. Most of the characters are cardboard thin, and you don't learn very much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven. Sadly, the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work, that looked rushed constantly.<br /><br />All in all, does have its good points, and certainly watchable. However, for my taste, it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff. 4/10 Bethany

{"value":"The fifth \"Black Emanuelle\" I've watched has, potentially, the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery/prostitution racket which takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her own hometown, New York! The film is peopled with past veterans of the series which, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (appearing here as a head of a United Nations committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (as Rassimov's chauffeur).<br /><br />Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite their being shown in the dead of night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in \"Stracultr) in which an Asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here!! Still, a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls (including, naturally, Gemser and Shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a group of bums (this is the way he gets their votes, get it!) - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact.<br /><br />The most ridiculous element of this entry - apart

{"value":"I so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes.<br /><br />Of course, it went completely the other way - let's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it. I bet One Small Seed went nuts for this. I know SL did.<br /><br />None of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off. Even Danny K had better timing. I'm actually being serious. Every time they introduced a bit character I kept thinking, \"Darn, this person should have been the lead!\".<br /><br />Independent doesn't mean that the camera work needs to be horrible. Black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief. The black and white also wasn't crisp. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Strangely enough I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe that's why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind.<br /><br />I think Corne (who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything) was speaking to this movie and not David - see it and you'll understand. I bet the guys who organise Oppikoppi were dismayed. One would think nothing happens there at all. I got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone's back garden. I know regular guys who have much funnier, raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these \"comics\". The dude who they hooked up with end was OK though.<br /><br />Guess SA comedy's gonna stay in the stone age a little longer.

{"value":"Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book \"Requiem For A Dream\" and co-wrote the screenplay to Aronofsky's movie of it. That movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate, and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them. \"Last Exit To Brooklyn\" still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives, but it hardly does them the same justice Aronofsky did.<br /><br />The film seems laughably anti-gay at times. Especially when in the film homosexuality equals death. One gay character gets stoned, is launched skyward by a speeding car, and lands dead on the pavement. Another is crucified and still more are simply beat up. Another exaggerated piece of shock value, that might actually have been compelling if it were done well, are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers. Who'd have thought a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions?<br /><br />The director, Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director, but he is far below the cut for real movies. The film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre. Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our lead, a loathsome hooker named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not joking). Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. Poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the \"real\" edge off the more provocative bits.

{"value":"The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes, this does take away from the film), the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis, and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co-writing, but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.","finished_norm":["the","premis","of","the","movi","have","be","explain","and","if","you","have","get","thi","far","you","do","not","me","to","pretend","that","i","be","a","movi","critic","with","that","be","sai","my","own","opinion","of","the","movi","be","quit","low","i","be","a","fan","of","takashi","miik","but","thi","go","down","in","the","categori","of","hi","not","so","great","work","along","with","doa","and","and","some","other","manybr","br","the","movi","seem","to","get","a","free","pass","becaus","it","be","a","takashi","film","and","noth","takashi","doe","can","be","wrong","thi","be","a","highschool","approach","to","cinema","for","the","rest","of","u","we","will","find","and","hour","and","a","half","of","a","kid","scream","for","no","real","reason","complet","annoi","and","ye","thi","doe","take","awai","from","the","film","the","pace","of","the","film","almost","reach","level","of","rigomorti","and","the","actingwellhmmm","br","br","if","on","be","a","takashi","fan","you","will","see","it","regardless","to","peak","your","interest","it","lack","ani","origin","see","the","neverend","stori","or","ani","charact","develop","from","the","lead","charact","in","the","face","of","conflict","other","then","a","quit","superfici","on","br","br","a","it","have","be","point","out","thi","be","the","film","miik","have","be","credit","with","cowrit","but","that","doe","not","mean","much","a","non","of","what","we","have","hope","would","be","miik","person","would","spill","over","into","the","screen","all","we","get","be","some","of","the","token","miik","shot","vi","the","director","of","photographybr","br","the","movi","have","the","potenti","to","be","someth","great","the","premis","be","not","a","difficult","on","to","run","wild","with","but","thi","on","seem","to","have","be","run","into","the","groundbr","br","my","suggest","be","if","you","re","just","get","into","miik","be","go","with","some","of","the","standard","like","gozu","ichi","and","audit","then","movi","into","hi","work","like","blue","harp","fudoh","raini","dog","bird","peopl","of","china"],"filtered":["premis","movi","explain","get","thi","far","pretend","movi","critic","sai","opinion","movi","quit","low","fan","takashi","miik","thi","go","categori","hi","great","work","along","doa","manybr","br","movi","seem","get","free","pass","becaus","takashi","film","noth","takashi","doe","wrong","thi","highschool","approach","cinema","rest","u","find","hour","half","kid","scream","real","reason","complet","annoi","ye","thi","doe","take","awai","film","pace","film","almost","reach","level","rigomorti","actingwellhmmm","br","br","takashi","fan","see","regardless","peak","interest","lack","ani","origin","see","neverend","stori","ani","charact","develop","lead","charact","face","conflict","quit","superfici","br","br","point","thi","film","miik","credit","cowrit","doe","mean","much","non","hope","miik","person","spill","screen","get","token","miik","shot","vi","director","photographybr","br","movi","potenti","someth","great","premis","difficult","run","wild","thi","seem","run","groundbr","br","suggest","re","get","miik","go","standard","like","gozu","ichi","audit","movi","hi","work","like","blue","harp","fudoh","raini","dog","bird","peopl","china"],"filtered2":["premis","explain","get","far","pretend","critic","opinion","quit","low","fan","takashi","miik","go","categori","great","work","along","doa","manybr","seem","get","free","pass","becaus","takashi","noth","takashi","doe","wrong","highschool","approach","cinema","rest","u","find","hour","half","kid","scream","real","reason","complet","annoi","ye","doe","take","awai","pace","almost","reach","level","rigomorti","actingwellhmmm","takashi","fan","see","regardless","peak","interest","lack","ani","origin","see","neverend","stori","ani","charact","develop","lead","charact","face","conflict","quit","superfici","point","miik","credit","cowrit","doe","mean","non","hope","miik","person","spill","screen","get","token","miik","shot","vi","director","photographybr","potenti","someth","great","premis","difficult","run","wild","seem","run","groundbr","suggest","re","get","miik","go","standard","like","gozu","ichi","audit","work","like","blue","harp","fudoh","raini","dog","bird","peopl","china"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,10,17,18,22,23,25,27,31,35,38,48,49,51,53,58,60,66,68,69,80,88,95,101,103,112,114,120,131,137,140,153,155,157,174,181,183,192,206,209,217,226,251,271,320,324,356,395,409,441,445,484,487,526,538,546,547,579,609,616,646,686,803,934,1040,1078,1107,1331,1371,1473,2299,2454,2606,2735,2882,2899,3249,3339,3777,4335,4458,4755,5175,5741,7722,7746],"values":[2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression.. Story writing IS what movie making is about. <br /><br />Incredible visual effects.. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect.. Except.. The story is just poor and so, everything fails.<br /><br />Picture this, if you had the power to be invisible.. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women.. This is all his supposedly \"genius\" mind could think of. Does he try to gain extra power? No. He doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible. The guy is basically a sex crazed maniac.<br /><br />Add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys.. Throwing around jokes like they were in a bar.. If it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of \"Cheers.\" Very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the Hollow Man's wolf.<br /><br />Even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the \"thrilling\" scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming \"this is just a stupid thing I have to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me.\"<br /><br />If you read the actual book, while the Scientist (Cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character.

{"value":"Okay, when I came on the board for this movie, I was really expecting people to be making fun of it. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. I enjoyed the movie... but only b/c me and my little sister (who is, in fact only 10) made fun of the whole thing.<br /><br />I am sorry Jordan, but that acting was awful. You know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act. And it didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it. I also thought that the character of Pamela was very very lame... border-lining pathetic.<br /><br />Even with that being said, I thought there were a few good actors, such as gorgeous Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, not enough to redeem the movie.<br /><br />Two things about this movie that I just can't get over:<br /><br />1.) That that Spencer guy would fall for her. Okay, eww. I looked up the dates and while in reality, he is only about four years older than her, the difference in \"Go Figure\" seemed much larger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF, she seemed like 10 or 12... she seemed like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed like a college student.<br /><br />2.) That there is any way that Kristi Yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it still just seemed kinda unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school that didn't even have scholarships for skating, or that a school

{"value":"The words \"Swedish\" and \"Action movie\" do not mix. That becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre. This is yet another failed attempt.<br /><br />Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems. One day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it.<br /><br />This movie has it's ups and downs. And usually in Swedish action movies there are no \"ups\", just \"downs\". So i guess something in this movie showed some quality. To begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made. The footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice. The acting is of very varying quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (i wonder how long Swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank?). Stefan Sauk is laughable as the \"cool\" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate.<br /><br />And what about the action scenes? Well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice. But aside from that there is not much action to talk about. And that is a common problem with Swedish action films. There is just not enough action going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's film-making culture. I don't know, but it negatively affects the experience.

{"value":"Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone over at 20th Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better.<br /><br />Betty plays a 19th century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed.<br /><br />Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee.<br /><br />Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch in anything.<br /><br />Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows.<br /><br />Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine.

{"value":"Nikolai Gogol's story \"Viy\" has been filmed again and released to home video in the US via Faith Films.<br /><br />The original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him. Greatly expanded and set in America, though clearly filmed in Russia (the houses,clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the English signs), this is an odd film that doesn't really work.Part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods America but clearly isn't.There are also some weird, intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later. I'm not sure why they did that, even after watching the making of piece on the DVD) The other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful. Its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera- or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps. I don't know if its Faith Films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the West (revealed in the making of piece).<br /><br />The film isn't very good. As I've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio. Despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film. As film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god.<br /><br />Given the choice I'd give it a pass, even at a bargain bin price. My advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called Viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god.","finished_norm":["nikolai","gogol","stori","vii","have","be","film","again","and","releas","to","home","video","in","the","u","via","faith","filmsbr","br","the","origin","stori","concern","a","priest","who","have","to","watch","over","the","bodi","of","a","witch","with","onli","hi","faith","to","protect","him","greatli","expand","and","set","in","america","though","clearli","film","in","russia","the","housescloth","and","furnish","be","all","wrong","despit","the","english","sign","thi","be","a","odd","film","that","doe","not","realli","workpart","of","it","be","the","weird","set","that","try","veri","hard","to","be","backwood","america","but","clearli","isntther","be","conjur","some","weird","intention","obliqu","moment","a","the","main","charact","be","a","report","at","the","start","and","a","priest","a","short","time","late","i","be","not","sure","why","thei","do","that","even","after","watch","the","make","of","piec","on","the","dvd","the","other","problem","be","the","dub","which","be","beyond","aw","it","do","in","such","awai","that","everyon","speak","when","their","lip","be","not","on","camera","or","if","thei","be","the","voic","do","not","even","remot","match","the","lip","flap","i","do","not","know","if","it","faith","film","fault","or","that","of","the","produc","who","make","the","film","hope","to","dump","into","the","west","reveal","in","the","make","of","piecebr","br","the","film","be","not","veri","good","a","i","have","sai","it","have","all","sort","of","technic","issu","that","just","make","thi","a","odd","ball","curio","despit","some","realli","good","look","horror","imag","the","film","never","work","a","a","horror","film","a","film","to","engend","faith","it","much","too","confus","in","thi","retel","to","amount","to","make","anyon","feel","anyon","close","to","godbr","br","give","the","choic","i","have","give","it","a","pass","even","at","a","bargain","bin","price","my","advic","would","be","to","find","the","version","of","the","tale","call","vii","which","will","bring","both","some","shiver","and","some","understand","about","a","belief","in","god"],"filtered":["nikolai","gogol","stori","vii","film","releas","home","video","u","via","faith","filmsbr","br","origin","stori","concern","priest","watch","bodi","witch","onli","hi","faith","protect","greatli","expand","set","america","though","clearli","film","russia","housescloth","furnish","wrong","despit","english","sign","thi","odd","film","doe","realli","workpart","weird","set","try","veri","hard","backwood","america","clearli","isntther","conjur","weird","intention","obliqu","moment","main","charact","report","start","priest","short","time","late","sure","thei","even","watch","make","piec","dvd","problem","dub","beyond","aw","awai","everyon","speak","lip","camera","thei","voic","even","remot","match","lip","flap","know","faith","film","fault","produc","make","film","hope","dump","west","reveal","make","piecebr","br","film","veri","good","sai","sort","technic","issu","make","thi","odd","ball","curio","despit","realli","good","look","horror","imag","film","never","work","horror","film","film","engend","faith","much","confus","thi","retel","amount","make","anyon","feel","anyon","close","godbr","br","give","choic","give","pass","even","bargain","bin","price","advic","find","version","tale","call","vii","bring","shiver","understand","belief","god"],"filtered2":["nikolai","gogol","stori","vii","releas","home","video","u","via","faith","filmsbr","origin","stori","concern","priest","watch","bodi","witch","onli","faith","protect","greatli","expand","set","america","though","clearli","russia","housescloth","furnish","wrong","despit","english","sign","odd","doe","realli","workpart","weird","set","try","veri","hard","backwood","america","clearli","isntther","conjur","weird","intention","obliqu","moment","main","charact","report","start","priest","short","time","late","sure","even","watch","make","piec","dvd","problem","dub","beyond","aw","awai","everyon","speak","lip","camera","voic","even","remot","match","lip","flap","know","faith","fault","produc","make","hope","dump","west","reveal","make","piecebr","veri","good","sort","technic","issu","make","odd","ball","curio","despit","realli","good","look","horror","imag","never","work","horror","engend","faith","confus","retel","amount","make","anyon","feel","anyon","close","godbr","give","choic","give","pass","even","bargain","bin","price","advic","find","version","tale","call","vii","bring","shiver","understand","belief","god"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,8,10,11,13,15,16,17,18,25,26,30,36,38,39,42,43,48,69,71,83,86,109,112,119,138,142,150,155,158,167,171,179,181,188,212,218,220,231,240,246,247,250,261,269,272,295,302,327,344,352,376,391,427,428,487,494,502,588,625,742,771,772,806,808,809,820,833,874,876,883,919,944,949,990,1072,1090,1135,1252,1283,1298,1309,1513,1570,1648,2165,2260,2396,2423,2802,3052,3210,3266,3785,3908,4786,6300,6728,7602,8398,8446],"values":[5.0,2.0

{"value":"Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; having partial amnesia (or \"global amnesia\", which one character claims to define as elective loss of memory), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book in the hopes of piecing his life back together. Abhorrent concoction very loosely based on Walter Ericson's book \"Fallen Angel\" (filmed in 1965 as \"Mirage\" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too racy for television--what with drugs and hippies added to the mix--that NBC initially refused to air it, which is how this low-budgeter wound up in theaters. Director James Goldstone gets freaky with the hyperkinetic visuals and camera-tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery goes wild with the zig-zag cuts. Unfortunately, their admittedly-colorful gimmicks cannot cover up the weaknesses of this updated plot, and the acting is woefully overripe. Dillman, under pressure to recall the events of the night in question, goes through an Actor's Seminar of tics, stammers, nose-wipes, and crazy half-laughs while spitting out dialogue like, \"Dream...a dream...drugs...yeah, drugs...that SOUND...bells...help!\" As a villainous fellow scientist with a Cheshire Cat smile, Pat Hingle nearly upstages Dillman in the Grand Thespian department by continually addressing everyone in baby-talk, strutting about like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth around in agony. Hope Lange's scientist/love-interest is given the short shrift, but not before she screams at indifferent-lover Dillman: \"What do I have to do, talk Ape Man?
