{"value":"Who did the research for this film? It's set in Baghdad in 2004, however all the Soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern gear. No one was wearing that stuff in 04. <br /><br />I just saw this film while deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was WTF? This movie made no sense, had characters come and go with no explanation, and people doing ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life. I realize that it's a movie, but it's obviously trying to portray something realistic. It fails miserably, but it's trying. <br /><br />It's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them up and swallowed, then vomited out a film. I would not recommend this film to anyone. I'm still not sure why I sat through the whole thing. GI Joe was one that really made you think compared to this.

{"value":"While I totally disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny, in this film he certainly is. It's a shame, as I suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few Charley Chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good Chase films, so he COULD be really funny given good material. Unfortunately, in this film he's given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, as I really wanted to love this film but couldn't.<br /><br />By the way, for those used to the look for Charley from the mid-1920s on, you'll be pretty surprised as Chase sports no

{"value":"And I thought The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the awful script, if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie, give your self a pat on the back. Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script. Its starts off kinda catching your eye, and then as it goes further into the plot, it just makes no sense, and don't get me started about the ending!!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why, just say the stupidest

{"value":"Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was okay. It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others. The problem isn't with direction, acting or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes, THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever.

{"value":"Some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies, despite the 'government controlling the media'. The makings of the film don't understand that the George Romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films (\"Land of the Dead\" withstanding). This satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario. What's subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction? Anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter-cut with the film? Nope. Furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible, the characters thoroughly unlikable, and the plot inane.

{"value":"I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers. <br /><br />... but the movie was confused and pointless ...<br /><br />it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in. Also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love.<br /><br />It seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of Fatal Attraction Super hero .. but I guess not. <br /><br />This is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be. You could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date. <br /><br />If the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might

{"value":"The Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is pretty far down on the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after World War I, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at first. A love triangle complicates the story some.<br /><br />This really was a tedious movie, with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who weren't. The dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable (not the zombie part of it but parts related to the \"romance\"). And while I am not any student or expert on cinematography, the camera work didn't seem to help the film much either.<br /><br />While I have seen a few movies that are worse, this is unlikely to please anyone.

{"value":"In spite of sterling work by the supporting actors, and an intelligent script by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character/actor. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as \"a whining little turd\" and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper-class publisher/friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoying. The part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate - a Ewan McGregor, for example.<br /><br />All of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted, thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance.

{"value":"First, I am not really a fan of the whole \"things eating flesh in disgusting new ways\" genre of film but I am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This one. So we start watching it. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod! Second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man! Third, none of the dialogue makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe the director (and my next door neighbor) are in need of psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast. It's so amateurish it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook.... with zombies.

{"value":"First off, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. It skips around a lot, and doesn't explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of \"melting\" together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. To sum up, I don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.","finished_norm":["off","i","have","to","sai","that","i","love","the","book","anim","farm","i","read","it","with","my","th","grade","class","and","it","be","great","we","conjur","decid","that","watch","the","movi","would","be","benefici","the","movi","be","so","disappoint","to","me","the","movi","cut","out","some","charact","and","miss","a","lot","of","the","main","point","of","the","book","it","skip","around","a","lot","and","doe","not","explain","anyth","in","detail","if","someon","be","watch","thi","movi","without","have","read","the","book","thei","would","be","confus","the","much","disappoint","thing","in","thi","movi","to","me","be","the","end","the","end","in","the","book","be","the","much","power","and","in","the","movi","thei","chang","it","it","be","suppos","to","be","the","pig","and","man","in","a","allianc","and","sort","of","melt","togeth","but","instead","the","movi","make","it","seem","like","the","anim","be","go","to","rebel","against","the","pig","to","sum","up","i","do","not","think","that","thi","movi","captur","the","real","mean","that","orwel","portrai","in","hi","book"],"filtered":["sai","love","book","anim","farm","read","th","grade","class","great","conjur","decid","watch","movi","benefici","movi","disappoint","movi","cut","charact","miss","lot","main","point","book","skip","around","lot","doe","explain","anyth","detail","someon","watch","thi","movi","without","read","book","thei","confus","much","disappoint","thing","thi","movi","end","end","book","much","power","movi","thei","chang","suppos","pig","man","allianc","sort","melt","togeth","instead","movi","make","seem","like","anim","go","rebel","pig","sum","think","thi","movi","captur","real","mean","orwel","portrai","hi","book"],"filtered2":["love","book","anim","farm","read","th","grade","class","great","conjur","decid","watch","benefici","disappoint","cut","charact","miss","lot","main","point","book","skip","around","lot","doe","explain","anyth","detail","someon","watch","without","read","book","confus","disappoint","thing","end","end","book","power","chang","suppos","pig","man","allianc","sort","melt","togeth","instead","make","seem","like","anim","go","rebel","pig","sum","think","captur","real","mean","orwel","portrai","book"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,10,12,18,24,29,35,39,45,51,54,66,72,80,88,98,104,125,139,145,149,151,152,179,187,249,255,269,270,277,278,303,366,395,427,469,628,741,853,924,931,938,1148,1982,2586,2852,3169,5759,5985],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,10,12,18,24,29,35,39,45,51,54,66,72,80,88,98,104,125,139,145,149,151,152,179,187,249,255,269,270,277,278,303,366,395,427,469,628,741,853,924,931,938,1148,1982,2586,2852,3169,5759,5985],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.929723173391612,3.841892750832105,1.9951803900462557,2.0317223413467334,2.0881990796736947,2.0728240170322856,2.2242236634876535,2.2939035841256437,4.69198042906518,2.3253197803590226,14.001227434050932,2.3131195476980753,2.507968722980095,4.946432381978511,2.6754694156628323,2.6754694156628323,2.76533567167316,2.731603554088023,6.232798466686559,2.8336934208777267,2.868298950055202,3.185521045582134,3.153168081130368,3.233054746047873,3.328770687675578,3.607563812710113,3.7165362186843414,3.8962296530720266,3.969732115064953,3.9241755834625858,3.952924996748572,4.176068548062782,5.482320201509136,10.926544013076883,5.444579873526289,5.604922523601468,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.098532391859541E-5,7.05066532843983E-5,7.105477528212553E-5,7.064422003357352E-5,7.064537745958227E-5,7.054662933953766E-5,7.075644489969097E-5,7.051680578176698E-5,7.067535326758903E-5,7.841044643486847E-5,0.5022577638550884,7.040297610999686E-5,7.17170127464601E-5,0.05970829304581886,7.045431322573948E-5,7.025960790215742E-5,7.201214593371852E-5,7.076307424448602E-5,7.054353208230392E-5,7.060200012797372E-5,7.128511588811751E-5,7.083318254464221E-5,7.091383686881839E-5,7.099023857441147E-5,7.153505218445539E-5,7.116094400018911E-5,0.24350217498716784,7.042390626927203E-5,7.042579027368889E-5,7.060421361508832E-5,7.210488964685174E-5,7.075897412859806E-5,7.595376461257328E-5,7.095800868116121E-5,7.05005595241999E-5,7.082596608085141E-5,7.042991620176055E-5,7.047153510037672E-5,7.02592549122066E-5,7.027748340439784E-5,7.043566947850758E-5,7.117861654263235E-5,7.081692808047295E-5,7.053693774293798E-5,7.139403549901078E-5,7.056401020509101E-5,0.18913373817522103,7.183636108558489E-5,7.029495120094943E-5,7.045030734193483E

{"value":"As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, as this film is very 'of its age', in the 1960's. To me (someone born in the 1980's) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but I am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th '60's. I expected drugs galore with th Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. I have not seen any of the directors other films, but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value.

{"value":"I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score.<br /><br />Either way it was a real disappointment. The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: \"Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?\" And that's about it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!).

{"value":"Knights was just a beginning of a series, a pilot, one might say. The plot (I really shouldn't call it that, there wasn't any plot) wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes, like [warning, I'm summarizing the plot]:<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs (the bad guys) but after the climax, Nea found out that there were many many more left of them. And it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month's training, Nea could kill them with a single blow.<br /><br />The movie was just pure kicking. I wasn't surprised at all, when I found out that the leading star was a kick boxer.<br /><br />There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends.

It was great, but it was cute.<br /><br />I think that it definitely had some room to improve, but it tried.<br /><br />I am not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer. They obviously do not care for Eva Longoria. I think that she was better in this than in The Sentinel. I think that movies are a matter of opinion. The actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop.<br /><br />Maybe the cast did not work out. Maybe there were too many things going on.<br /><br />I just wanted to speak up for an average movie, not a terrible one. It could just be a chick flick. Kind of like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still talks about those.

{"value":"I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /><br />Pros: the movie is beautiful, the period is depicted well and consistently (to the best of my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do good jobs.<br /><br />Cons: This is the worst acting job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons--I kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way he says \"Transito.\") Winona Ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK, but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that I was frustrated and angry well before the end. <br /><br />I'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow.","finished_norm":["i","be","glad","i","rent","thi","movi","for","on","reason","it","shortcom","make","me","want","to","read","allend","book","and","get","the","full","stori","br","br","pro","the","movi","be","beauti","the","period","be","depict","good","and","consist","to","the","well","of","my","knowledg","and","meryl","and","glenn","do","good","jobsbr","br","con","thi","be","the","wrong","act","job","i","have","ever","see","from","jeremi","ironsi","keep","wonder","if","someth","be","wrong","with","hi","mouth","and","i","hate","the","terribli","english","wai","he","sai","transito","winona","ryder","doe","noth","believ","except","look","young","and","idealist","much","of","the","other","perform","be","okai","but","so","few","thing","hang","togeth","in","the","charact","arc","and","the","relationship","develop","that","i","be","frustrat","and","angri","good","befor","the","end","br","br","i","be","veri","curiou","now","whether","thi","movi","be","typic","of","bill","august","work","i","mai","have","to","drop","anoth","coupl","of","buck","to","rend","smilla","sens","of","snow"],"filtered":["glad","rent","thi","movi","reason","shortcom","make","want","read","allend","book","get","full","stori","br","br","pro","movi","beauti","period","depict","good","consist","well","knowledg","meryl","glenn","good","jobsbr","br","con","thi","wrong","act","job","ever","see","jeremi","ironsi","keep","wonder","someth","wrong","hi","mouth","hate","terribli","english","wai","sai","transito","winona","ryder","doe","noth","believ","except","look","young","idealist","much","perform","okai","thing","hang","togeth","charact","arc","relationship","develop","frustrat","angri","good","befor","end","br","br","veri","curiou","whether","thi","movi","typic","bill","august","work","mai","drop","anoth","coupl","buck","rend","smilla","sens","snow"],"filtered2":["glad","rent","reason","shortcom","make","want","read","allend","book","get","full","stori","pro","beauti","period","depict","good","consist","well","knowledg","meryl","glenn","good","jobsbr","con","wrong","act","job","ever","see","jeremi","ironsi","keep","wonder","someth","wrong","mouth","hate","terribli","english","wai","transito","winona","ryder","doe","noth","believ","except","look","young","idealist","perform","okai","thing","hang","togeth","charact","arc","relationship","develop","frustrat","angri","good","befor","end","veri","curiou","whether","typic","bill","august","work","mai","drop","anoth","coupl","buck","rend","smilla","sens","snow"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,10,15,16,17,18,20,21,24,25,29,33,37,44,46,48,49,53,73,79,91,95,105,134,135,145,151,173,175,191,233,253,270,289,320,325,336,339,531,577,588,597,613,661,722,743,828,848,904,941,1011,1153,1161,1227,1365,1407,1595,1631,2278,2343,2903,3159,3403,3749,4167,4258,5458,6315],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,10,15,16,17,18,20,21,24,25,29,33,37,44,46,48,49,53,73,79,91,95,105,134,135,145,151,173,175,191,233,253,270,289,320,325,336,339,531,577,588,597,613,661,722,743,828,848,904,941,1011,1153,1161,1227,1365,1407,1595,1631,2278,2343,2903,3159,3403,3749,4167,4258,5458,6315],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.8950689206770979,1.9469506069506084,2.0105926690411424,2.0323326556775485,2.1765612129984904,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.5460113484259455,2.6102777977348763,2.7073305177318163,2.731603554088023,2.8282659991423613,2.938298364153555,2.973659465713028,2.9233055795674137,3.003844442051426,3.424750734647968,3.604618302480356,3.6375061693251913,3.4986697244709752,3.5364100524538222,3.5727776966246974,3.850067611308864,3.7568101178222815,3.827761853794566,3.827761853794566,3.9121030022283168,3.9612932464190886,4.086456389373095,4.213208095012239,4.327618446189983,4.246178114249808,4.422928625994308,4.443131333311827,4.613282354485526,4.646072177308517,5.373120909544144,5.3560264761848435,5.373120909544144,5.695894301807195,5.850044981634453,5.770002273960917,6.0662680901040895,5.878215858601149,6.2980697041614135,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.6839973316768954E-5,5.645668808859298E-5,5.689558500425511E-5,5.656684170797156E-5,5.6567768491985796E-5,5.648869805603409E-5,5.6656703358851794E-5,5.646481748277869E-5,5.6591770

{"value":"I watched this movie for a project on love. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying. My life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick flick. It is not a strict romantic. And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow.

{"value":"Dr Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be, and the asylum is being run by the patients, and the doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons(A guy who thinks he's a chicken, for instance). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the film itself bombs. The music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy, and yes, there is a scene involving dancing chicken men, which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen.

{"value":"My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitor's name on the box. This movie is a travesty I hope she negates from her CV.<br /><br />The \"plot\" was lose and flaccid, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The movie made no sense whatsoever. The rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this, for example, invasion of the body-snatchers and The faculty.<br /><br />If you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie, I suggest you burn it.<br /><br />How it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear, suspense, gore, terror or any of the usual horror film techniques I don't know, however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand, so you can find parts of it

{"value":"This film is awful. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","aw","not","offens","but","extrem","predict","the","movi","follow","the","life","of","a","small","town","famili","in","the","mid","the","father","the","princip","at","the","school","be","go","through","a","midlif","crisi","enter","a","pretti","teacher","from","the","big","citi","who","start","challeng","her","student","mind","with","some","thoughtprovok","stuff","like","think","for","yourself","the","princip","doe","not","agre","with","her","teach","but","she","be","pretti","you","can","connect","the","dot","hi","teenag","daughter","winona","ryder","wannab","tara","frederick","be","fe","up","with","the","small","town","lifestyl","and","want","to","live","she","get","some","bad","advic","hang","out","with","some","bad","boi","and","appar","famili","plan","be","not","be","teach","at","her","school","shock","see","that","director","paul","shapiro","have","mainli","work","in","tv","thi","movi","plai","like","a","much","adult","version","of","a","afterschool","special","or","a","veri","special","episod","of","on","of","the","much","mundan","sitcom"],"filtered":["thi","film","aw","offens","extrem","predict","movi","follow","life","small","town","famili","mid","father","princip","school","go","midlif","crisi","enter","pretti","teacher","big","citi","start","challeng","student","mind","thoughtprovok","stuff","like","think","princip","doe","agre","teach","pretti","connect","dot","hi","teenag","daughter","winona","ryder","wannab","tara","frederick","fe","small","town","lifestyl","want","live","get","bad","advic","hang","bad","boi","appar","famili","plan","teach","school","shock","see","director","paul","shapiro","mainli","work","tv","thi","movi","plai","like","much","adult","version","afterschool","special","veri","special","episod","much","mundan","sitcom"],"filtered2":["aw","offens","extrem","predict","follow","life","small","town","famili","mid","father","princip","school","go","midlif","crisi","enter","pretti","teacher","big","citi","start","challeng","student","mind","thoughtprovok","stuff","like","think","princip","doe","agre","teach","pretti","connect","dot","teenag","daughter","winona","ryder","wannab","tara","frederick","fe","small","town","lifestyl","want","live","get","bad","advic","hang","bad","boi","appar","famili","plan","teach","school","shock","see","director","paul","shapiro","mainli","work","tv","plai","like","adult","version","afterschool","special","veri","special","mundan","sitcom"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,9,12,15,18,37,40,48,58,71,75,78,82,116,138,172,182,203,220,238,260,282,296,308,329,337,342,361,363,426,450,508,581,595,622,626,692,734,767,840,848,1111,1114,1145,1170,1211,1283,1463,1869,1920,2089,2124,2575,2951,3199,3277,3998,5648,6840],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,9,12,15,18,37,40,48,58,71,75,78,82,116,138,172,182,203,220,238,260,282,296,308,329,337,342,361,363,426,450,508,581,595,622,626,692,734,767,840,848,1111,1114,1145,1170,1211,1283,1463,1869,1920,2089,2124,2575,2951,3199,3277,3998,5648,6840],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,4.012839573363895,2.020196584395323,2.2466628996789315,2.2907365189289424,2.5001408943598484,5.473059344848157,5.139521057275218,2.8336934208777267,2.597304642813496,2.6754694156628323,2.918851229218033,5.900913137266729,2.8753661172782943,2.951986790814132,2.973659465713028,3.112795625839981,3.0399731661399314,6.069937971110711,3.3909310864081816,6.939969152944234,3.4149707055943286,3.530930586689197,3.6284289511740746,3.4933926673701317,3.6528204042982337,3.753391311073496,3.79165684915245,3.79165684915245,4.049068857301474,3.827761853794566,8.537555892334098,4.364659717870332,4.2574141875167335,4.2860694432771105,4.274508620876034,4.3773181147422555,4.550761997504193,5.00274712124725,4.8184434032493035,4.9676558014359795,4.9909126636002465,10.487818356128276,5.521540914662417,5.501738287366237,5.967828017290836,5.7959777603641776,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.361535107152524E-5,5.325381022500408E-5,5.3667807819378264E-5,5.335771465405559E-5,5.335858886013612E-5,5.3284004215993115E-5,5.3442478310311376E-5,5.3261478425705666E-5,5.33812296453184E-5,0.06462422516303767,0.731856250245674,5.317550265666768E-5,5.41679970441782E-5,0.028129789169084263,5.3214277678483406E-5,5.306721637477902E-5,5.4390911705606876E-5,5.344748546712831E-5,5.328166485167414E-5,5.332582587851748E-5,5.384178452011785E-5,5.3500438400472845E-5,5.356135676595

{"value":"Well, were to start? This is by far one of the worst films I've ever paid good money to see. I won't comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera. To start with, the acting, except for Eric Bana, is soap opera quality. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame. The camera action doesn't help, either. How it lingers on him when he's thinking, it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery, or he is desperately in need of one. Either way, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to end my comments, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she sure is no Helen of Troy.

{"value":"On the face of it, this should be a great film, a great cast, a plot with many possibilities and one of Hollywood's finest behind the camera for the first time.<br /><br />However, its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again. This movie fails on so many levels. In a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations, it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director. Not so here, the great cast is horribly under-used, none more so than the great, late John Spencer, the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven't seen in a hundred other TV movies. There is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists.

{"value":"... And being let down bigger than ever before. I won't make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this film is pathetic. If you're military trained, don't bother watching. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick. Why couldn't I just have read the reviews first.<br /><br />Already at the first \"bomb\" scene the film has huge glitches, and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger. My 2 friends, not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as I myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic. Well, as you might have guessed, they're not - at all.<br /><br />Avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re-occurring mistakes being made. 2/10 for catching my

{"value":"Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual successful white middle-class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films.<br /><br />I usually find something to amuse in Woody Allen comedies, but here he really falls totally flat on his face. Even the one-liners seem to have deserted him. The really is no plot (bar bits and pieces of cod Shakespeare) - but Allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air, which just makes the thing even more witless and half-baked.<br /><br />It just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore. The best thing about this film (apart from the end credits coming up) is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your

{"value":"The plot is about a female nurse, named Anna, is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living. She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror. It's not even thrilling, just ridiculous.Even \"the Flintstones\" or \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor. The heroes who has locked themselves in, inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside, are not better either. Even though they doesn't seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled.

{"value":"There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent. Nobody in it has ever tried acting before, even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place. Nothing looks rehearsed.The film quality is terrible. Most of the 'action' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought, swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors' as they deliver their lines. No tripod and no proper microphone either, there sound quality is terrible. Even 'Manos' fares better than this, at least they had proper equipment. What plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess.<br /><br />Stick to home videos, preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy's new camera phone.

{"value":"Best of the Best 4, is better than 3, but just barely. Basically, I say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1/2 (like 3 does), (ie. their is no reference to Tommy Lee having siblings).<br /><br />Anyway, I liked the Russian plot line of the story, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen's bit part as Boris. Aside from that though and a few fighting scenes, the movie is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the airplane blow-up scene).<br /><br />Also, part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did, there are a couple of more better known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but alas nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles).<br /><br />Alas, it seems Best of the Best is the

{"value":"Quirky, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater--these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so \"discovering\" a jewel of a film. Boy, was I disappointed. Julian Po never gets over itself. The film is relentlessly self-conscious. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment. The overdone, obviously theatrical sets, the overdone, obviously theatrical acting, the overdone, obviously theatrical directing -- well, you get the idea. <br /><br />Allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style. And it's hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townsfolk, the idiotic clergyman, the bratty kids -- why would anyone, particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside (Slater's character),

{"value":"When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was showing at a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that the seats move). I take it that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min.) and also re-created to add the motion effects. It was a cute movie... but that was it. It was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit...well...trite. I was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I will say, the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. So all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring the younger kids... go for it.

{"value":"The dudes at MST3K should see this dog of a film. It's basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can't land any acting gigs. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this dumb actor do? He dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a L.A. surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles. You'll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie's inadvertently funny scenes. Like when the actor dude's girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like, \"How could you do this to me?\" And why is she crying? Cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs. This movie makes no sense at ALL! The actor who played the governor on Benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog. This movie will crack you up, trust me.
