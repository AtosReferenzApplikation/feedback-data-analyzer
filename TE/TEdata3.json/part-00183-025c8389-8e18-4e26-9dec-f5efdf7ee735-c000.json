{"value":"I am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film. Do not read further...here it comes, avert your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is murdered here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life.<br /><br />This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's. Despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk.<br /><br />Both priests and college students get a bad rap here. They are pictured as oversexed, sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life...and the college students come off even worse.<br /><br />\"Splatter University\" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape, that would be more entertaining.<br /><br />This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very brief female nudity, and sexual references.<br /><br

{"value":"I have seen many, many productions of The Nutcracker. Now perhaps I viewed this movie from the tainted point of view of a theatrical director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective I found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting of a \"motion picture\". None of the traditionally \"weird\" and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be (i.e. the candies didn't look like candies, the rats didn't look like rats but rather like chocolate kisses,) the acting was weak, perhaps toned down too much for the screen, and the choreography just didn't do anything for me. This makes the entire show very satisfactory (at best), as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production.

to add a few things: <br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button).<br /><br />had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes.<br /><br />the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point).<br /><br />forget it. don't buy it. don't waste your time. and your sanity. my brain is so fried after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?)

{"value":"The potential movie extravaganza, set during the 19th century, failed to produce. With big-name actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. However, the movie lacked an ending, had a sorry excuse for a plot line, and fell to pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, brought together by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, tormenting his daughter in life as well as death. He believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status. The actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' attempts.

{"value":"Run away from this movie. Even by B-movie standards this movie is dreadful. It is also insidious in it's theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie, see it instead.<br /><br />No normal kid would do what Trent does. State Troopers do not work as they do in this film etc. Seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche. Mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker,who yes, has had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her.<br /><br />Usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for, in this case there is none. It is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters. The acting is adequate by B-movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or

{"value":"\"The seventh sign\" borrows a lot from \"Rosemary's baby\" and \"the omen\" (it actually blends the two stories).Even its title recalls Bergman' s \"the seventh seal\" .<br /><br />Nevertheless,it begins well enough,with all the omens scattered on the whole earth,and in parallel ,a -seemingly- distinct plot with Moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister)from death penalty.This time,both Christian and Jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the Wandering Jew is involved),which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny (Have you ever been to Sunday school? But they taught me that God was love!).The best scene IMHO ,is the short dialog between priest John Heard -who does not seem to take things seriously ,too bad he was not given a more important part

{"value":"Too many secondary plot lines without a primary one. Too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason, they managed to stuff this boring film, that does not say anything, with every drama element that is out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, \"deep real love\" You would think that it would make for an interesting movie, but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the \"super-deep\" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. Pity.<br /><br />Oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are quite good. That's what kept me from turning it off. To bad their talents went to waste, The film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place.

{"value":"I read James Hawes book. It was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough. Without having read the book I wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.<br /><br />Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways I do not have the capacity to describe. Half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.<br /><br />Never before or since as a film made me feel so angry. The Mattress sequels came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.<br /><br />Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry. That is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh*t. No, that's unfair.

{"value":"This film should have never been made. Honestly, I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, though she did a lot of movies in Holland, and the young woman who took the main part is a TV-personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main part I recently saw in Bride Flight and although that film is better, he did not convince me than. To start with the the story, I have not read the novel it is based upon, but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon, not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues, it was most of the time spoken out loud. My regards go to the cameraman, at least he tried to make something out of it.

{"value":"I saw that movie, and i was shocked! Robert Carlyle isn't Hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The Movie lies, it doesn't reflect the truth. In the scene were Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never had hit anybody, he wouldn't hit people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: It is too obvious, that Hitler is that evil, he was more clever, than shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as the leader, because the can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler haven't shown his evil side to the people.<br /><br />Have any of you Yankees watched the movie \"Der Untergang\" or \"The Dawnfall\"? this is a great movie, with amazing actors. And its a German movie. I think, this Theme of Nazi-Germany, should not be realized as a movie by people who don't know anything of Germany. People!

{"value":"Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends.<br /><br />Seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man, the \"girl-friends\", dead-set on terminating this \"silly relationship\", go over and beyond the call of duty in \"helping out\" their friend (who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game\".<br /><br />A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous. Far fetched no longer covers it. Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story. Instead, all the viewer is left with is an involuntary shaking of head -- these things just don't happen! Without giving away cliff-hanger details, I warn the viewer of having high expectations for this film; most (like me) will be very disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, this one ranks a weak 4 with me. There is much better material out there.

{"value":"What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he's been shot about fifty times by now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico. Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. And you'll never hear another screenplay feature the word \"butthorn\" either. Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from \"Lethal Weapon\" and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in \"Red Dawn\" a few years earlier. After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies.

{"value":"I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.<br /><br />I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 (usa). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The story line was complicated, and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines. At one point, I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film.<br /><br />This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling, limbs severed, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action, and won a great following without having to resort to effects.<br /><br />I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend.

{"value":"Tough guys, sexy women, lots of swearing, and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. You'd think \"Monster\" would be fun...but it isn't, really. It does star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once. In an interview with \"Fangoria\" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed the bulk of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford--who only directed the footage featuring his children Andrea and Glenn (portraying characters named Andrea and Glenn, in a particularly inventive turn)--received full credit. Considering how awful the end result was, Strock was probably glad that he hadn't been credited! \"Monster\" has the look and feel of a mid-to-late-seventies TV movie, which is why I like to leave it on in the background every so often. As entertainment it falls flat on its face, but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of film-making, it's very effective.

{"value":"I had high hopes for this movie, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I don't think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I hadn't already read the book. The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I've read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation. Probably many people using these terms don't realize where the terms came from.

{"value":"### Spoilers! ### <br /><br />What is this movie offering? Out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. It is sad to see Denzel Washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this.We are certainly hinted how the Mexicans cannot save themselves, outside forces needed, possibly militaristic, American ones. And we know the father is a shady character, he is a Mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed all of them thinking she died. And did she? Of course, she won't, she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the Hollywood fan. The trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the \"implausibly successful\"(as some critic pointed out)'Taken'. The nausea of such movies will take time to go. It is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt IMDb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure!

{"value":"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.<br /><br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see.

{"value":"A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) go to a doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive. It works but Adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby...<br /><br />Pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script--the basic idea is OK but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end. I saw every \"twist\" coming. The direction is poor--he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene. The production values are--to be nice--lousy. Very shabby. And, the gore scenes are too unpleasant (I almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with lousy special effects. The film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea HOW to end this film.<br /><br />Some good acting makes it somewhat bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it. This film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown--it's easy to see why.

{"value":"If you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them, then this one is for you! But if you are somewhat normal, and don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this one up. This movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.With the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.I've seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (BTK movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.We watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.If anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. As a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach.

{"value":"As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably, then, 'Dough for the Do-Do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached.

{"value":"This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. From the very first scene, i knew it would be a smash crash. It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission. As it turns out, the people in it were possessed by some random zombies. Well, some years later, some college kids are pulling some pledge prank. Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock. Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non-chalonte manner, with pledge over reacting and over-doing the whole \"eager to be popular role\" What really took the cake with this one is the final battle. Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns. For example, guns making a noise with no muzzle flash, and vice-versa. this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why they move in stop motion is a mystery), cheesy music, and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is crap.

{"value":"As far as I am concerned this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version, it is all macabre, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me of Nazis falling in love; who cares?<br /><br />This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this one we have leering John Gilbert and his gross relative the Prince lusting after this silly American actress, played by Mae Murray, possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again. I like my romances light and beautiful, with slow build ups; not harsh and sadistic like this one. And come on, those bee stung lips, get rid of them, girl!<br /><br />Go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar. Failing that, wait till TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sound version.

{"value":"I did not expect a lot from this movie, after the terrible \"Life is a Miracle\". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than \"Life ...\". I have impression that director/writer is just joking with the audience: \" let me see how much emptiness can you (audience) sustain\". Dialogues are empty, ... scenario is minimalistic. In few moments, photography is really nice. Few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this \"comedy\". I've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end. If you can lift yourself above this director's fiasco, ... you will find good acting of few legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek), and very good performance of Emir's son Stribor Kusturica.<br /><br />In short: too bad for such a great director ! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be making top-rated movies. Instead, he chooses to do this low-budget just-for-my-private theater movie, with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","expect","a","lot","from","thi","movi","after","the","terribl","life","be","a","miracl","it","turn","out","that","thi","movi","be","ten","time","wrong","than","life","i","have","impress","that","directorwrit","be","just","joke","with","the","audienc","let","me","see","how","much","empti","can","you","audienc","sustain","dialogu","be","empti","scenario","be","minimalist","in","few","moment","photographi","be","realli","nice","few","sarcast","line","be","semifunni","but","it","be","hard","to","genuin","laugh","dure","thi","comedi","i","have","laugh","to","myself","for","be","abl","to","watch","the","movi","until","the","end","if","you","can","lift","yourself","abov","thi","director","fiasco","you","will","find","good","act","of","few","legend","miki","manojlov","aleksandar","bercek","and","veri","good","perform","of","emir","son","stribor","kusturicabr","br","in","short","too","bad","for","such","a","great","director","emir","kusturica","be","still","young","and","should","be","make","toprat","movi","instead","he","choos","to","do","thi","lowbudget","justformypriv","theater","movi","with","arrog","attitud","toward","the","world","trend","and","neglig","toward","hi","old","fan"],"filtered":["expect","lot","thi","movi","terribl","life","miracl","turn","thi","movi","ten","time","wrong","life","impress","directorwrit","joke","audienc","let","see","much","empti","audienc","sustain","dialogu","empti","scenario","minimalist","moment","photographi","realli","nice","sarcast","line","semifunni","hard","genuin","laugh","dure","thi","comedi","laugh","abl","watch","movi","end","lift","abov","thi","director","fiasco","find","good","act","legend","miki","manojlov","aleksandar","bercek","veri","good","perform","emir","son","stribor","kusturicabr","br","short","bad","great","director","emir","kusturica","still","young","make","toprat","movi","instead","choos","thi","lowbudget","justformypriv","theater","movi","arrog","attitud","toward","world","trend","neglig","toward","hi","old","fan"],"filtered2":["expect","lot","terribl","life","miracl","turn","ten","time","wrong","life","impress","directorwrit","joke","audienc","let","see","empti","audienc","sustain","dialogu","empti","scenario","minimalist","moment","photographi","realli","nice","sarcast","line","semifunni","hard","genuin","laugh","dure","comedi","laugh","abl","watch","end","lift","abov","director","fiasco","find","good","act","legend","miki","manojlov","aleksandar","bercek","veri","good","perform","emir","son","stribor","kusturicabr","short","bad","great","director","emir","kusturica","still","young","make","toprat","instead","choos","lowbudget","justformypriv","theater","arrog","attitud","toward","world","trend","neglig","toward","old","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,8,9,13,15,21,24,25,38,51,58,64,67,72,75,96,105,107,124,127,130,133,135,140,152,165,166,168,171,188,214,239,248,262,272,418,424,434,454,545,563,584,704,1144,1166,1222,1372,1377,1569,1822,1874,2363,3164,3697,3972,4455,5128,5197,6775,7743],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,8,9,13,15,21,24,25,38,51,58,64,67,72,75,96,105,107,124,127,130,133,135,140,152,165,166,168,171,188,214,239,248,262,272,418,424,434,454,545,563,584,704,1144,1166,1222,1372,1377,1569,1822,1874,2363,3164,3697,3972,4455,5128,5197,6775,7743],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.519311641348122,1.7139899308309823,3.731402629253362,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,3.948450049740535,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2.1439533986393955,2.2323930368088845,2.4359679371086367,2.2642139034199635,4.642472950759303,2.366244071437088,2.317169775997098,2.3131195476980753,2.448847599972298,2.4423870329693536,4.978953423722071,2.373087554090762,2.5378812223426954,2.7303758068497004,2.6593400337329487,2.689504733779216,2.726701583487816,2.8028805344481915,3.164467636384302,3.212973749990824,3.4101163271295305,3.2556198060399626,3.442099372982581,6.919508616442604,3.5146700658174166,3.5900195030592035,8.459114466027536,4.246178114249808,4.3336974922663645,4.403125998698128,4.558366596889411,4.597282013139085,4.789173020949191,4.8184434032493035,5.129498826886393,5.5623629091826725,5.770002273960917,5.822646007446338,5.967828017290836,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7307825118001948E-4,1.7292487779162267E-4,1.7296757427976266E-4,1.7293280226459692E-4,1.7294916830304973E-4,1.7292392433601489E-4,1.7297770607724024E-4,1.7289819607643

{"value":"Carlos Mencia continually, violently, hatefully screaming \"B**ch!\" at women is like screaming \"N**ger!\" at black people, except it's worse. Remember, the B word, unlike the N word, is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence. \"B**ch!\" is the last thing women hear before they are raped, beaten, or murdered. This guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence. Sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman-bashing, so that he will sound like a hetero. And how about all the Nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side, clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman-hating. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia doesn't believe or support free speech for THEM!

{"value":"Sorry guys, I've already written my opinion of this movie but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a quite a lot of people who agree with me but what's scary is that there are some people who seem to really like this movie. I don't like to write nasty reviews or criticise other people's opinions but I think it's only fair to warn anybody out there who may be debating whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and I'll watch just about anything but this movie made it onto the incredibly short list of movies I watched and was happy to leave halfway through. If you really are incredibly tempted, watch the trailer...that's the mistake I made because the entire movie is essentially in the trailer...after that there are no surprises, just some shockingly bad dialogue to waste time.

{"value":"There are movies that are awful, and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long-forgotten and unwatchable. Also, lots of violence and bad stuff (not just cheesy stuff; you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content? Why, \"Final Justice,\" of course! <br /><br />Remember \"Mitchell?\" Joe Don Baker was the star of that movie, and that was riffed by Joel and the Bots on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\" Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place on the Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), that trio got to make fun of MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie, \"Final Justice.\" Of course, much of the naughty stuff that I mentioned was removed for television release, but still, I want to watch that episode (and \"Mitchell\" as well), because what does Joe Don \"hate\" the most? Why, none other than \"Mystery Science Theater 3000!\" <br /><br />P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby, check that store for the uncut tape!

{"value":"Is this a stupid movie? You bet!! I could not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary. Stupid moments? Plenty. Stupid characters? You bet. Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Oh well people gotta start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheesed. He is the most whiny doctor I've ever seen. He's got a melting man running amok out in Ventura County somewhere, he's not overly happy that his wife is pregnant (probably cause she's 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there's no crackers to be found anywhere. Plus he's got the not-too-helpful general on his hinder wanting to find astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though Mr. Nelson can't tell him anything. There also some random characters thrown in for good measure who encounter the melting man. Eventually the movie ends and out monster gets scooped into a trash can to become compost.

{"value":"The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough \"burlesque\" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know, in Warner Bros' cynical estimation of them, that what they're getting is garbage.","finished_norm":["the","competit","for","the","wrong","warner","bro","kai","franci","movi","be","stiff","i","have","onli","see","perhap","eight","of","them","but","comet","over","broadwai","be","the","wrong","so","far","the","veri","well","thing","about","it","be","that","it","short","oh","and","the","orrykelli","gown","of","cours","be","fine","jame","wong","howe","cinematographi","be","not","kai","franci","throughout","look","fatfac","and","far","littl","attract","than","she","normal","doe","minna","gombel","whom","i","do","not","know","otherwis","be","good","a","a","semitough","burlesqu","dancer","it","look","much","like","a","fashion","show","than","burlesqu","the","close","shoot","kai","franci","and","her","child","when","do","the","child","learn","that","kai","franci","be","her","mother","do","i","doze","off","walk","up","a","dirt","path","toward","a","prison","paint","in","misti","outlin","on","a","sound","stage","drop","be","beyond","ludicr","the","whole","film","be","so","cheap","so","implaus","and","so","careless","that","it","feel","infect","by","a","sour","cynic","on","the","part","of","everyon","who","make","it","warner","bro","toss","garbag","to","dolt","who","do","not","know","in","warner","bro","cynic","estim","of","them","that","what","thei","re","get","be","garbag"],"filtered":["competit","wrong","warner","bro","kai","franci","movi","stiff","onli","see","perhap","eight","comet","broadwai","wrong","far","veri","well","thing","short","oh","orrykelli","gown","cours","fine","jame","wong","howe","cinematographi","kai","franci","throughout","look","fatfac","far","littl","attract","normal","doe","minna","gombel","know","otherwis","good","semitough","burlesqu","dancer","look","much","like","fashion","show","burlesqu","close","shoot","kai","franci","child","child","learn","kai","franci","mother","doze","walk","dirt","path","toward","prison","paint","misti","outlin","sound","stage","drop","beyond","ludicr","whole","film","cheap","implaus","careless","feel","infect","sour","cynic","part","everyon","make","warner","bro","toss","garbag","dolt","know","warner","bro","cynic","estim","thei","re","get","garbag"],"filtered2":["competit","wrong","warner","bro","kai","franci","stiff","onli","see","perhap","eight","comet","broadwai","wrong","far","veri","well","thing","short","oh","orrykelli","gown","cours","fine","jame","wong","howe","cinematographi","kai","franci","throughout","look","fatfac","far","littl","attract","normal","doe","minna","gombel","know","otherwis","good","semitough","burlesqu","dancer","look","like","fashion","show","burlesqu","close","shoot","kai","franci","child","child","learn","kai","franci","mother","doze","walk","dirt","path","toward","prison","paint","misti","outlin","sound","stage","drop","beyond","ludicr","whole","cheap","implaus","careless","feel","infect","sour","cynic","part","everyon","make","warner","bro","toss","garbag","dolt","know","warner","bro","cynic","estim","re","get","garbag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,11,14,15,16,18,20,25,26,28,29,43,61,68,101,111,117,178,180,199,234,246,272,294,295,318,351,397,431,438,464,502,563,620,627,629,648,669,700,702,852,868,904,1037,1394,2058,2063,2096,2136,2149,2207,2215,2267,2500,2668,2688,3279,3318,3647,3855,3873,4476,4598,5319,5990,6247,6789,7492],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,11,14,15,16,18,20,25,26,28,29,43,61,68,101,111,117,178,180,199,234,246,272,294,295,318,351,397,431,438,464,502,563,620,627,629,648,669,700,702,852,868,904,1037,1394,2058,2063,2096,2136,2149,2207,2215,2267,2500,2668,2688,3279,3318,3647,3855,3873,4476,4598,5319,5990,6247,6789,7492],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.559277576165403,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.6608112036218214,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,4.197164082437498,2.1183455303375887,2.2797301185117202,2.532833256045391,5.419462958538709,2.558331832813986,2.673149229007135,2.673149229007135,2.8028805344481915,2.886778509330039,2.7910771187233068,2.902686292364678,3.0135689919434205,3.3176717946075294,3.2189558216683714,3.1797351085150902,3.2872346624216657,3.3132665011396125,3.459754308221302,3.7568101178222815,3.477726550625732,3.488143311483988,3.6105180246075443,3.7099788181381825,3.616452760127359,7.293333077447711,4.2078172463773615,3.944626193933877,3.9121030022283168,4.062925891962901,4.403125998698128,4.9676558014359795,5.3064295350454715,5.00274712124725,4.9676558014359795,10.232151613108506,5.039114765418124,4.9792166238370

{"value":"I watched the Unrated version of this film and realised about 30 minutes into it that I was never getting my time back. I persevered to the end hoping that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic eventually, the special FX would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I am a complete gore hound. I number some of the eighties splatter flicks amongst the greats of the film world. This however was not made in the eighties, if this film had come out in the early eighties the fax could be forgiven for looking so bad. It wasn't so it hasn't got that defence. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad lines I was wincing at the writing rather than squirming at torture. I don't like Hostel, never have, I thought it was over rated, over hyped and I felt nothing for the protagonists, however it shines as a beacon to greatness next to this garbage.

{"value":"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Horrible. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. The reason I'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on \"Of Mice and Men\" and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film \"Of Mice and Men\" and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified.

{"value":"Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant safety pin.......these are the words to best describe this terrible movie. I love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds..but this had got to be on of the worst ever made. The plot is paper thin and ridiculous, the acting is an abomination, the script is completely laughable(the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is-it's just so damn terribly written), the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures, the hair is big, lots of boobs bounce, men wear those cut tee-shirts that show off their stomachs(sickening that men actually wore them!!) and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again...in almost every scene there is trashy music, boobs and paramedics taking away bodies....and the gym still doesn't close for bereavement!! All joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back
