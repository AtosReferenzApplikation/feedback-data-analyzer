{"value":"How do you spell washed up fat Italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment- since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career. In this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day.<br /><br />He is fat, slow and very old looking in this movie, hardly a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing stock clown.<br /><br />It's time for Steven Seagal to retire- this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why.<br /><br />Plot: fat Italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response. This pretense, although pathetic and laughable, gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book.<br /><br />Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yeah. I did.","finished_norm":["how","do","you","spell","wash","up","fat","italian","who","can","bare","pull","off","a","martial","art","move","without","ne","some","heart","medic","in","thi","movi","we","see","steven","seagal","at","hi","low","level","of","accomplish","sinc","hi","career","start","it","have","be","a","steadi","declin","into","pathet","over","indulg","behavior","that","have","scuttl","hi","career","in","thi","movi","it","look","like","much","of","hi","train","consist","of","order","the","fetuccini","alfredo","at","hi","restaur","everi","daybr","br","he","be","fat","slow","and","veri","old","look","in","thi","movi","hardli","a","martial","art","action","hero","much","like","a","laugh","stock","clownbr","br","it","time","for","steven","seagal","to","retir","thi","movi","be","about","hour","of","reason","whybr","br","plot","fat","italian","gui","with","a","big","reput","on","the","forc","get","wind","that","a","crime","group","mai","be","plai","around","with","a","drug","design","by","the","militari","to","creat","the","ultim","warrior","respons","thi","pretens","although","pathet","and","laughabl","give","opportun","for","some","over","the","top","fight","scene","that","includ","blast","through","wall","like","a","comic","bookbr","br","do","i","mention","thi","movi","total","suck","and","steven","seagal","be","a","complet","joke","ye","i","do"],"filtered":["spell","wash","fat","italian","bare","pull","martial","art","move","without","ne","heart","medic","thi","movi","see","steven","seagal","hi","low","level","accomplish","sinc","hi","career","start","steadi","declin","pathet","indulg","behavior","scuttl","hi","career","thi","movi","look","like","much","hi","train","consist","order","fetuccini","alfredo","hi","restaur","everi","daybr","br","fat","slow","veri","old","look","thi","movi","hardli","martial","art","action","hero","much","like","laugh","stock","clownbr","br","time","steven","seagal","retir","thi","movi","hour","reason","whybr","br","plot","fat","italian","gui","big","reput","forc","get","wind","crime","group","mai","plai","around","drug","design","militari","creat","ultim","warrior","respons","thi","pretens","although","pathet","laughabl","give","opportun","top","fight","scene","includ","blast","wall","like","comic","bookbr","br","mention","thi","movi","total","suck","steven","seagal","complet","joke","ye"],"filtered2":["spell","wash","fat","italian","bare","pull","martial","art","move","without","ne","heart","medic","see","steven","seagal","low","level","accomplish","sinc","career","start","steadi","declin","pathet","indulg","behavior","scuttl","career","look","like","train","consist","order","fetuccini","alfredo","restaur","everi","daybr","fat","slow","veri","old","look","hardli","martial","art","action","hero","like","laugh","stock","clownbr","time","steven","seagal","retir","hour","reason","whybr","plot","fat","italian","gui","big","reput","forc","get","wind","crime","group","mai","plai","around","drug","design","militari","creat","ultim","warrior","respons","pretens","although","pathet","laughabl","give","opportun","top","fight","scene","includ","blast","wall","like","comic","bookbr","mention","total","suck","steven","seagal","complet","joke","ye"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,15,16,19,30,32,40,46,55,67,71,82,85,95,98,103,110,125,129,133,162,174,184,209,214,217,232,237,275,285,301,338,362,364,375,382,390,410,421,439,445,480,511,544,552,589,601,614,665,681,697,713,735,753,828,915,984,993,1009,1030,1085,1151,1194,1233,1386,1401,1494,1775,1783,1819,1830,1998,2618,2672,2773,2991,3069,3330,3455,4136,4690,4848,5384],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,15,16,19,30,32,40,46,55,67,71,82,85,95,98,103,110,125,129,133,162,174,184,209,214,217,232,237,275,285,301,338,362,364,375,382,390,410,421,439,445,480,511,544,552,589,601,614,665,681,697,713,735,753,828,915,984,993,1009,1030,1085,1151,1194,1233,1386,1401,1494,1775,1783,1819,1830,1998,2618,2672,2773,2991,3069,3330,3455,4136,4690,4848,5384],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.312380678011735,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,1.9536997889255368,1.9570915389266579,1.9214926742550966,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0323326556775485,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.2242236634876535,2.4106958340079214,2.3212364753796515,2.3586007221245198,2.456282578459816,2.496249838866882,2.6026896854443837,2.7303758068497004,2.6113665294700725,2.8377834061292515,2.640097787510554,2.7832848715031413,2.808171552082607,2

{"value":"OK, If you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong film.<br /><br />I revolves around two brothers. Max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. It however, does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. Most of the movie focus is on Max and his parting ways. Eventually Adam, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs).<br /><br />This movie has almost no climax. Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, Adam, is horrific.<br /><br />I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'.

{"value":"Richard Dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? Well, he'll likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER.<br /><br />This William Castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of Richard Dix's life through newsreel a la Citizen Kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. Also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.<br /><br />This is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead

{"value":"Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members.<br /><br />The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As is usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention. Other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made. My only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them.<br /><br />Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a

{"value":"This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless . . . because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!<br /><br />This film is even worse than white chicks! Little Man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby. Story is awful considering it was written by six people. The idea still wouldn't be too bad though, if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode. it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. So was the directing. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. it is racist and very offensive to midgets. I mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, the film-makers make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see midgets being just like babies. And for a character who is a midget, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. That is its lame excuse for showing something like that. It just was not worth it. Don't watch this film.

{"value":"THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME!!!!! It takes a lot to bring me to over-exaggeration about a movie, but this movie stunk up my house!! I haven't even finished the movie yet and I had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is. I'VE NEVER DONE THAT!! As a consumer, do not spend your money on this film. Wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something. It's barely TV worthy. I REALLY HATE TRASHING A MOVIE, BUT THIS MOVIE IS TRASH! Barely above porn. Should have and X rating! Good plot, some frontal nudity (if that floats your boat), but HORRIBLE high school level acting. Don't know how this movie received distribution. (Must have been a contractual thing.) Really, if you really like watching good movies, don't waste you time with this one. From one movie lover to another. YOU WILL BE MAD AT YOURSELF! Let me say this as well, if you've been through something like this perhaps you can relate and it will have some value for you. In that case I say watch it, you may take something away from it, if not just seeing something that's happened to you being acted out by someone else (has therapeutic

{"value":"Please, someone stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie. Write the studios, hell, write your local congressman even. I've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then I have watching ANY Stiller flick. Jack Black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap, and Christopher Walken, perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation, simply looks embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unfunny self,but now even with someone to bail him out, proves that he is way overrated as a comic. It's no wonder why this movie tanked badly, and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, Do not watch this flick, it is just awful, worst then Gothika (personally, i'd never thought i'd say that), worst the Plan 9, Worst the Ishtar, worst then The Golden Child. Please Hollywood, quit allowing Ben Stiller in your movies, he's not funny, he's a god awful actor, and he's bringing others down with him.

{"value":"The story is seen before, but that does'n matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director haven't spent his work on the storyboard. Alongside this, the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie. The funniest is, however, if you take a look at the movie's website, you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it remind us about hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It will have 1 stars because the story is OK. It is a pity that Ti West, has not spent more time to review his story. It is as if the movie was more important than the planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away... come. Everyone can make a movie, but not all will be just as good. So a word of advice to Ti West are: stop and labeling what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a storyboard.

{"value":"An executive, very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life, meets a boy with down syndrome, escaped from a residence . Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life... With this argument, the somehow Amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, I didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie. Anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to go on watching the movie. The French cinema, in general, has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life, opposed to the more stereotyped American cinema. But, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from heaven as Michael Landon...

{"value":"My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this film was. After 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself. It didn't.<br /><br />I can't understand the praise given to this film. The writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />One thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. I understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (like in Happiness). This was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing. This film might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film, because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much.<br /><br />I generally like these types of small quirky films (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the very worst films I have sat through in the last few years.","finished_norm":["my","girlfriend","and","i","be","stun","by","how","bad","thi","film","be","after","minut","we","would","have","call","it","quit","except","we","be","too","curiou","to","see","if","the","film","can","possibli","redeem","itself","it","didntbr","br","i","ca","not","understand","the","prais","give","to","thi","film","the","write","be","downright","aw","and","deliv","by","some","of","the","wrong","act","i","have","see","in","a","veri","long","timebr","br","on","thing","that","especi","annoi","me","about","thi","film","be","that","often","when","peopl","be","talk","to","each","other","there","be","a","unnatur","paus","between","line","i","understand","us","a","paus","to","creat","a","feel","of","awkward","like","in","happi","thi","be","not","that","typ","of","paus","it","be","just","simpli","bad","direct","thi","film","mai","actual","be","much","well","with","subtitl","and","mayb","the","oversea","market","be","the","well","on","for","thi","film","becaus","then","the","innan","dialogu","and","bad","act","would","not","be","notic","a","muchbr","br","i","gener","like","thi","typ","of","small","quirki","film","the","real","blond","walk","and","talk","love","and","amaz","but","thi","on","fail","on","so","mani","level","that","i","consid","it","on","of","the","veri","wrong","film","i","have","sit","through","in","the","last","few","year"],"filtered":["girlfriend","stun","bad","thi","film","minut","call","quit","except","curiou","see","film","possibli","redeem","didntbr","br","ca","understand","prais","give","thi","film","write","downright","aw","deliv","wrong","act","see","veri","long","timebr","br","thing","especi","annoi","thi","film","often","peopl","talk","unnatur","paus","line","understand","us","paus","creat","feel","awkward","like","happi","thi","typ","paus","simpli","bad","direct","thi","film","mai","actual","much","well","subtitl","mayb","oversea","market","well","thi","film","becaus","innan","dialogu","bad","act","notic","muchbr","br","gener","like","thi","typ","small","quirki","film","real","blond","walk","talk","love","amaz","thi","fail","mani","level","consid","veri","wrong","film","sit","last","year"],"filtered2":["girlfriend","stun","bad","minut","call","quit","except","curiou","see","possibli","redeem","didntbr","ca","understand","prais","give","write","downright","aw","deliv","wrong","act","see","veri","long","timebr","thing","especi","annoi","often","peopl","talk","unnatur","paus","line","understand","us","paus","creat","feel","awkward","like","happi","typ","paus","simpli","bad","direct","mai","actual","well","subtitl","mayb","oversea","market","well","becaus","innan","dialogu","bad","act","notic","muchbr","gener","like","typ","small","quirki","real","blond","walk","talk","love","amaz","fail","mani","level","consid","veri","wrong","sit","last","year"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,15,20,21,22,23,25,29,30,43,46,50,52,54,56,57,59,65,80,81,99,102,107,120,138,142,144,163,186,201,212,215,225,233,244,248,267,271,294,317,362,363,384,400,445,517,558,605,634,685,688,730,985,1241,1250,1516,1555,1556,1595,1645,2254,2734,2770,3096,3449,6673,6718],"values":[2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,15,20,21,22,23,25,29,30,43,46,50,52,54,56,57,59,65,80,81,99,102,107,120,138,142,144,163,186,201,212,215,225,233,244,248,267,271,294,317,362,363,384,400,445,517,558,605,634,685,688,730,985,1241,1250,1516,1555,1556,1595,1645,2254,2734,2770,3096,3449,6673,6718],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,3.205071257016622,2.4001215597131385,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.9073850067444174,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.056430207256609,2.087553710177271,2.1439533986393955,2.2044500422972613,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.2931108769894046,2.4000574358028657,5.143705159219666,2.561435818751577,5.196758667886523,2.605934685587711,2.641219492619754,2.6102777977348763,2.634508058031767,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,2.886778509330039,2.8529247828056143,3.058539100262467,3.0349689855553557,6.218409915418504,3.130944944345658,3.241201430615691,3.4198487640477615,3.4572130107926293,3.5474598886404074,3.5119855004467477,3.607563812710113,3.6016814428070463,3.767137231978131,4.170873731185678,4.3215761317340196,4.280272325592784,4.535724120139652,4.589376833631972,4.550761997504193,4.613282354485526,4.662879295624898,5.143104478942172,5.274680836730892,16.06807942855453,5.463272006538442,5.695894301807195,6.543192162

{"value":"Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the biggest regret of my life. Who ever even thought about this movie, or financed deserves a kick between the legs, because that's where they were thinking when they made this movie. It's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry. He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and such. Only the fat guy doesn't get a girl. Skin flicks don't annoy me, I take 'em for face value. But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick. It's about Fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyways. The dialogue is super-horrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porno movie, without any porn in it.

{"value":"The plot it's not so original. If someone saw \"L'ultimo Bacio\" there's nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome living everyday life that's is boring and false, with everyone asking to others what they think about them. Really boring after an half of hour because it's simple to understand where the story is going to finish. This because it's simple to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie, so even the hardest parts seem normal. To summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said. the family saw from a 30 years old, i don't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations. Really good how Muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining. Perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it.

{"value":"I saw this on TV the other night or rather I flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when I couldn't stand watching it any longer. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not \"so bad it's good\" just flat out bad. How did it get funded? Who thought this was a good idea? An actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but I think what they meant was \"save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @#$%.\" I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. To be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and stilted. The dialog was inane. By far the saddest thing was ship. In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls, I kid you not, they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb.

{"value":"So there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's KEVIN, the world's biggest wuss. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, bratty, and virginal girlfriend AMY. As he returns from work to... a random house... he finds his \"friends,\" the sexually confusing red-shorted KYLE and the truly revolting sluttish DAPHNE. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the trigger-happy sex-crazed macho lunkhead NICK. And there's the title creatures, horrid little dogeared puppets who kill people by giving them their heart's desire. Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy, yucky woman in spandex. Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades in a grade school cafeteria-- I mean nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat up a skinny thug with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne's already a disgusting slut, so she doesn't have a heart's desire. Along the way a truly hideous band sings a truly odd song. The hobgoblins randomly go back to where they came from then blow up. \"Citizen Kane\" cannot hold a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema.","finished_norm":["so","there","a","old","secur","guard","and","a","gui","who","die","and","then","there","kevin","the","world","big","wuss","kevin","want","to","impress","hi","incredibli","insensit","bratti","and","virgin","girlfriend","ami","a","he","return","from","work","to","a","random","hous","he","find","hi","friend","the","sexual","confus","redshort","kyl","and","the","truli","revolt","sluttish","daphn","thei","be","soon","join","by","daphn","boyfriend","the","triggerhappi","sexcraz","macho","lunkhead","nick","and","there","the","titl","creatur","horrid","littl","dogear","puppet","who","kill","peopl","by","give","them","their","heart","desir","kyl","heart","desir","be","to","mate","with","a","creepi","yucki","woman","in","spandex","nick","heart","desir","be","to","throw","grenad","in","a","grade","school","cafeteria","i","mean","nightclub","kevin","heart","desir","be","to","beat","up","a","skinni","thug","with","nunchuck","ami","heart","desir","be","to","be","a","disgust","slut","daphn","alreadi","a","disgust","slut","so","she","doe","not","have","a","heart","desir","along","the","wai","a","truli","hideou","band","sing","a","truli","odd","song","the","hobgoblin","randomli","go","back","to","where","thei","come","from","then","blow","up","citizen","kane","cannot","hold","a","candl","to","thi","true","masterpiec","of","american","cinema"],"filtered":["old","secur","guard","gui","die","kevin","world","big","wuss","kevin","want","impress","hi","incredibli","insensit","bratti","virgin","girlfriend","ami","return","work","random","hous","find","hi","friend","sexual","confus","redshort","kyl","truli","revolt","sluttish","daphn","thei","soon","join","daphn","boyfriend","triggerhappi","sexcraz","macho","lunkhead","nick","titl","creatur","horrid","littl","dogear","puppet","kill","peopl","give","heart","desir","kyl","heart","desir","mate","creepi","yucki","woman","spandex","nick","heart","desir","throw","grenad","grade","school","cafeteria","mean","nightclub","kevin","heart","desir","beat","skinni","thug","nunchuck","ami","heart","desir","disgust","slut","daphn","alreadi","disgust","slut","doe","heart","desir","along","wai","truli","hideou","band","sing","truli","odd","song","hobgoblin","randomli","go","back","thei","come","blow","citizen","kane","hold","candl","thi","true","masterpiec","american","cinema"],"filtered2":["old","secur","guard","gui","die","kevin","world","big","wuss","kevin","want","impress","incredibli","insensit","bratti","virgin","girlfriend","ami","return","work","random","hous","find","friend","sexual","confus","redshort","kyl","truli","revolt","sluttish","daphn","soon","join","daphn","boyfriend","triggerhappi","sexcraz","macho","lunkhead","nick","titl","creatur","horrid","littl","dogear","puppet","kill","peopl","give","heart","desir","kyl","heart","desir","mate","creepi","yucki","woman","spandex","nick","heart","desir","throw","grenad","grade","school","cafeteria","mean","nightclub","kevin","heart","desir","beat","skinni","thug","nunchuck","ami","heart","desir","disgust","slut","daphn","alreadi","disgust","slut","doe","heart","desir","along","wai","truli","hideou","band","sing","truli","odd","song","hobgoblin","randomli","go","back","come","blow","citizen","kane","hold","candl","true","masterpiec","american","cinema"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,14,18,23,30,33,34,37,38,48,55,63,67,70,76,82,88,161,165,213,223,264,293,296,304,310,324,328,330,343,409,414,418,427,449,488,519,614,659,678,687,730,754,755,761,768,859,927,938,963,1050,1174,1182,1309,1319,1443,1485,1591,1758,1898,2073,2195,2263,2298,2369,2443,2483,2722,2834,3669,4212,4298,4304,5052,5342,5646,6300,6308,6591,7017,8125,8541],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,14,18,23,30,33,34,37,38,48,55,63,67,70,76,82,88,161,165,213,223,264,293,296,304,310,324,328,330,343,409,414,418,427,449,488,519,614,659,678,687,730,754,755,761,768,859,927,938,963,1050,1174,1182,1309,1319,1443,1485,1591,1758,1898,2073,2195,2263,2298,2369,2443,2483,2722,2834,3669,4212,4298,4304,5052,5342,5646,6300,6308,6591,7017,8125,8541],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,1.9536997889255368,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,2.1337665533324026,2.020196584395323,2.0317223413467334,2.4323182980210873,2.448847599972298,2.8432628718938773,2.825563294794476,2.757740698455715,2.9012296278682137,2.9504565686333644,2.871119826396843,2.854312708080462,2.8753661172782943,3.1550424959247185,2.9292757465539174,8.91160338950968,3.22095782

{"value":"LOL! Not a bad way to start it. I thought this was original, but then I discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of KING KONG. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15. I saw this film when I was 9. The film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head! Not to mention the film's theme song by the Yetians. This is the worst creature effects I've ever seen. At the same time this film remains a holy grail of B-movies. Memorable quotes: \"Take a tranquilizer and go to bed.\" \"Put the Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power.\" I remember seeing this film on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is one scene where it was like KING KONG in reverse! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl (who was falling)! Also around that year was another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) which came from Hong Kong. There is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. This film will leave you laughing. It is like I said, just another KING KONG clone.

{"value":"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new \"Dukes\" movie is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)\"You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is.\" Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a DISGRACE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing right in the movie title was \"HAZZARD.\" Was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in NO way a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script.

{"value":"Three Russian aristocrats soak up the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite the fact they are down to their last franc. In order to support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter, and use the notes at the casinos, hoping to exchange the bogus currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, a US envoy, arrives at Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make pals with the visitors, hoping for financial assistance. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with continuous advance towards Helen, while disappointing the Count's maid, who loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. Its obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of American women and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats), rather than tell a story, and the film really can bore modern audiences, like me, easily by doing that. Even the acting, which is great in later EvS like Greed and the Wedding March, is just run of the mill here. The film could have used improvements on various levels.

{"value":"As a WWII naval history buff, and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I made it about 3/4 of the way through, but I should have turned it off at the sub attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would fire a torpedo at a DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then be able to \"run away\" from the DDE while submerged, is preposterous. And that's just a small detail. The whole movie was poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. I agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie. It's as if they decided that, since all those crappy WWII propaganda films were made with all-white casts, they needed to make one with black people. And as bad as those old movies were, this is actually worse. And it almost smacks of false advertising to headline Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out they had very minor roles. I have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I'm done.

{"value":"I love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes weren't all grey? <br /><br />Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Her \"eccentric\" garb is actually rather attractive and yes, she has an amazing hourglass figure. But I feel she was given her head rather too much. She probably developed this characterisation over many performances, and nobody told her \"If it gets a laugh, leave it out.\" She does too much deranged fooling about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth. The Madame Arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery. Arcati behaves like a retired headmistress (We'll really put our backs into it!). The contrast between her breezy, commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn't really brought out.<br /><br />Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings), the Americans feel they have to use the words \"Brit\", \"stiff\", \"lip\" and \"upper\". Oh, give it a rest! The three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks (Did he make love to you?

{"value":"This movie is just truly awful, the eye-candy that plays Ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this movie.<br /><br />The writer/director/producer/lead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times, but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causes.<br /><br />The script is poor, the casting very ordinary, but the dialogue and acting is just woeful. The homo-hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors (I think I've seen more passion in an corn flakes ad). The acting is stiff, and the dialogue forced (a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlight).<br /><br />I'm just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck

{"value":"Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic. Speaking of timeliness, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong. There were sly reference such as 'they paved paradise to put up a parking lot'. The filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers. Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie. Very little of what the characters said were believable. Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail. Although, there were two exceptions Kelli Williams liven things up as the future flower child and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was quite good.

{"value":"I got this movie in the $5 bin at walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. I might give it to one of my friends if I am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.<br /><br />I looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. It's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another. The drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam.<br /><br />Okay, here is my rant about this movie: To me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end. It doesn't. After the movie was over I through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.","finished_norm":["i","get","thi","movi","in","the","bin","at","walmart","i","would","not","recommend","watch","thi","move","i","mai","give","it","to","on","of","my","friend","if","i","be","angri","at","them","and","want","them","to","suffer","for","hoursbr","br","i","look","at","the","cover","and","skim","through","the","summari","and","think","it","be","a","war","movi","i","wish","i","would","have","know","how","bore","thi","movi","be","go","to","be","befor","turn","it","on","it","be","my","mistak","to","think","someth","be","go","to","happen","in","thi","movi","it","just","about","a","group","of","peopl","go","from","on","boot","camp","to","anoth","the","drill","sargent","treat","the","soldier","veri","badli","and","the","main","charact","try","to","help","peopl","get","out","of","fight","in","vietnambr","br","okai","here","be","my","rant","about","thi","movi","to","me","thi","movi","be","slow","and","hard","to","watch","it","be","just","on","of","that","movi","that","you","put","in","and","be","stick","watch","becaus","you","want","to","turn","it","off","but","your","hang","on","to","a","string","of","hope","that","it","mai","pick","up","toward","the","end","it","doe","not","after","the","movi","be","over","i","through","it","behind","my","tv","becaus","i","be","angri","that","i","wast","almost","hour","of","my","life","watch","it","and","anoth","minut","write","thi","review","to","warn","peopl","about","it"],"filtered":["get","thi","movi","bin","walmart","recommend","watch","thi","move","mai","give","friend","angri","want","suffer","hoursbr","br","look","cover","skim","summari","think","war","movi","wish","know","bore","thi","movi","go","befor","turn","mistak","think","someth","go","happen","thi","movi","group","peopl","go","boot","camp","anoth","drill","sargent","treat","soldier","veri","badli","main","charact","try","help","peopl","get","fight","vietnambr","br","okai","rant","thi","movi","thi","movi","slow","hard","watch","movi","put","stick","watch","becaus","want","turn","hang","string","hope","mai","pick","toward","end","doe","movi","behind","tv","becaus","angri","wast","almost","hour","life","watch","anoth","minut","write","thi","review","warn","peopl"],"filtered2":["get","bin","walmart","recommend","watch","move","mai","give","friend","angri","want","suffer","hoursbr","look","cover","skim","summari","think","war","wish","know","bore","go","befor","turn","mistak","think","someth","go","happen","group","peopl","go","boot","camp","anoth","drill","sargent","treat","soldier","veri","badli","main","charact","try","help","peopl","get","fight","vietnambr","okai","rant","slow","hard","watch","put","stick","watch","becaus","want","turn","hang","string","hope","mai","pick","toward","end","doe","behind","tv","becaus","angri","wast","almost","hour","life","watch","anoth","minut","write","review","warn","peopl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,10,12,15,16,18,22,23,24,26,30,36,37,46,53,59,65,73,75,79,89,94,96,108,131,159,161,171,172,174,176,179,181,185,191,232,275,298,314,390,393,399,410,416,446,448,491,527,563,593,633,657,848,849,908,1161,1729,1839,2259,2576,3002,4313,4428,8592],"values":[2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,10,12,15,16,18,22,23,24,26,30,36,37,46,53,59,65,73,75,79,89,94,96,108,131,159,161,171,172,174,176,179,181,185,191,232,275,298,314,390,393,399,410,416,446,448,491,527,563,593,633,657,848,849,908,1161,1729,1839,2259,2576,3002,4313,4428,8592],"values":[1.5932680941439847,2.912480743411154,3.8437990882891726,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,2.5958480334723544,4.094543182127343,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,3.311542587503466,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.9073850067444174,3.7901378413541957,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,1.9940046109572438,2.08112281984698,4.078141625743051,2.138507503627933,2.2512118082053005,2.300267965194495,2.4323182980210873,2.373087554090762,2.5001408943598484,2.456282578459816,2.5040471493269134,2.507968722980095,2.4442286541160034,2.518833027372001,2.5460113484259455,2.8377834061292515,2.7832848715031413,2.7819920465008363,3.189397019426827,3.132778125427319,3.120015873813468,3.129115117668582,3.2070272508030975,3.1401446412440817,3.233054746047873,3.2681460658591432,3.369778711402955,3.439602492783994,3.459754308221302,3.5227672760500357,3.550241531602284,4.00861390260916,3.827761853794566,3.880604335168946,4.081705786614497,8.655236892379966,4.6973654716960676,4.760735085628657,5.02684467282631,5.1994574154933035,5.482320201509136,5.999576715605417,5.9370563586240825,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.0

{"value":"It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor, and put him to waste in a film such as this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save this movie. In fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie. I believe it gets old, and that is the case here.<br /><br />There's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his conceit shows through in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining.<br /><br />However, because De Niro is IN this film, that makes it a draw if you are a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at his best, see \"Midnight Run\", \"Goodfellas\", or \"Cop Land\", or even go way back and check out \"Taxi Driver\" or \"Godfather II\".

{"value":"What?!?? Why are people saying this is \"mind blowing?\" Just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world has ended! Not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed. 1 was right the whole time, if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened. People giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what?... to make it rain? I admit the movie had it's parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But a lot of it was clichés one after another. And did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like \"Lord of The Rings?\" Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world; its pointless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thank god! How is robots turning against humans creative in any way! It's been done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie that's worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, those were good

{"value":"Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They are tortured... We learn North Korean Communists are bad people... We learn Americans' beards grow very slowly during days of torture...<br /><br />I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst out laughing at this movie. It was the scene when Mr. Reagan comes out from telling the Communists he wants to be on their side. Then, he asks for a bottle of brandy. Next, acting stone-cold sober, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean communist guard is as dumb as they come. So, the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes over to get something from a drawer, which is next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something; but, of course, Reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty. Ya gotta laugh! I think \"Prisoner of War\" will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it's wasteful. <br /><br />* Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve

{"value":"I saw this film opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me. Unfortunately, despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was paper thin....which doesn't inspire me to read \"Our Sunshine\". There were some other plus points, the support acting from Edgerton in particular, assured direction from Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well), and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush, much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it. But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?)....in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal...<br /><br />Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey's excellent \"Secret History

{"value":"James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a `mental illness facility' for a medical residence assignment with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he realizes that many interns are being killed by `The Ripper', who takes their souls to the devil, in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogs are so ridiculous, specially when the character of Helen, the blonde fiancé of James Bishop arrives in the asylum, that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a screenplay. And what about the return of James to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And the cast, composed of ham actors and actresses? Honestly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this film: the screenplay, the director or the cast. The correct answer certainly is all of them. I saw this flick on cable television, and I am astonished how can a producer spend money in such a garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot.

{"value":"LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake -- wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he's the star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I did know better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. Which this did. And with good reason. The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE, and \"journalist\" Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them. He is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe I should say for his horrible acting. I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard, looking like nothing so much as a hobo. You just know the director was not in control.

{"value":"An expedition led by hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. They meet beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy...and only Simira seems to know what's going on.<br /><br />A real snoozer. I caught this on late night TV when I was about 10. It put me to sleep! Seeing it again all these years later I can see why. It's slow-moving, the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in (and this is only 66 minutes long!), the acting ranges from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there's no violence or blood to be found. This movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics (involving a silly love triangle) than horror.<br /><br />This rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it straight, there's some good acting from Diane Brewster, it's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) aren't bad. They're not scary just mildly creepy. Still, this movie is pretty bad.

{"value":"Although I use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what I think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films, after watching this \"movie\" on Film Four last night I felt compelled to write something down, even if it just helps cleanse me once again.<br /><br />The film was possibly the shallowest experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? You sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock) had no real substance about them - I'm not sure if the first half-hour of the film didn't make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims... here I couldn't care less. In fact, the only character I did seem to care about was the dog, with the stag coming a close second. And both animals out-acted Dire (sic) and Scully, who were quite frankly terrible.

{"value":"This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a little Falk thrown in. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you'd hardly know it. I presume Reiser is under the impression that he's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle. He's not. Even more galling is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background. Dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen glows. The story is about Falk and Dukakis really, but we're subjected to a pointless, silly, preposterous road trip in which Reiser gets to show how very cute, precious and oh-so-deep with psychological insight (wrong!) he can be. For instance, In a restaurant scene that I imagine Reiser had hoped was \"Cassavetes-like\" there's a laughably false confrontation between Reiser and Falk that is so patently ridiculous, I was

{"value":"This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. But for me, it failed. I won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user \"reluctantpopstar\" gives a good description of it.<br /><br />But it didn't work for me. I found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. The viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. I don't think that this is the case here.<br /><br />As for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...I see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the \"action\".
