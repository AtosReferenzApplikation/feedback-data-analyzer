{"value":"This sequel is thoroughly uneven, incoherent and rambling in \"plot\" (if there really is one)and tries too damned hard to be modern (ridiculous, out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate) and cute (yawn: there are too many manufactured, belaboured jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she is normally very good) sweeps through this film, parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard! It's a film that isn't even good to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, characterisation and acceptable acting. This doesn't. It is bad.","finished_norm":["thi","sequel","be","thoroughli","uneven","incoher","and","rambl","in","plot","if","there","realli","be","oneand","try","too","damn","hard","to","be","modern","ridicul","out","of","period","and","charact","st","centuri","styl","song","predomin","and","cute","yawn","there","be","too","mani","manufactur","belabour","joke","with","anim","the","actor","in","hi","film","be","secondari","to","the","juvenil","plot","even","glenn","close","and","she","be","normal","veri","good","sweep","through","thi","film","parodi","herself","a","the","origin","de","vill","and","the","lead","from","sunset","boulevard","it","a","film","that","be","not","even","good","to","look","at","thi","be","a","veri","good","exampl","of","a","bad","and","pointless","sequel","even","basic","instinct","have","a","plot","characteris","and","accept","act","thi","doe","not","it","be","bad"],"filtered":["thi","sequel","thoroughli","uneven","incoher","rambl","plot","realli","oneand","try","damn","hard","modern","ridicul","period","charact","st","centuri","styl","song","predomin","cute","yawn","mani","manufactur","belabour","joke","anim","actor","hi","film","secondari","juvenil","plot","even","glenn","close","normal","veri","good","sweep","thi","film","parodi","origin","de","vill","lead","sunset","boulevard","film","even","good","look","thi","veri","good","exampl","bad","pointless","sequel","even","basic","instinct","plot","characteris","accept","act","thi","doe","bad"],"filtered2":["sequel","thoroughli","uneven","incoher","rambl","plot","realli","oneand","try","damn","hard","modern","ridicul","period","charact","st","centuri","styl","song","predomin","cute","yawn","mani","manufactur","belabour","joke","anim","actor","secondari","juvenil","plot","even","glenn","close","normal","veri","good","sweep","parodi","origin","de","vill","lead","sunset","boulevard","even","good","look","veri","good","exampl","bad","pointless","sequel","even","basic","instinct","plot","characteris","accept","act","doe","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,10,13,15,16,18,21,32,36,41,50,69,157,171,214,274,277,286,295,307,328,380,387,531,700,729,741,743,750,855,889,1128,1163,1294,1538,1590,2554,2597,2655,2973,3005,3233,3376,3798,4281,5475,6359],"values":[3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,10,13,15,16,18,21,32,36,41,50,69,157,171,214,274,277,286,295,307,328,380,387,531,700,729,741,743,750,855,889,1128,1163,1294,1538,1590,2554,2597,2655,2973,3005,3233,3376,3798,4281,5475,6359],"values":[2.0358433949768115,2.7780513171783934,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,4.1133933855221025,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.717994385570355,2.127032521151058,2.3360150694757706,2.373087554090762,2.7303758068497004,2.748952192422636,3.1163992333432793,2.780700890737216,2.7910771187233068,2.8767855639325206,3.1550424959247185,3.102062070196872,6.721038771980316,3.4272107604888307,3.616452760127359,3.7952092507568174,3.7165362186843414,3.7568101178222815,4.030886538218284,3.9201351739255808,3.9571003681590526,4.315570107673808,4.2860694432771105,4.605250182788262,4.550761997504193,4.573751515728891,5.243909178064138,5.243909178064138,5.259176650194926,5.373120909544144,5.649374286172302,5.521540914662417,5.850044981634453,5.7446844659766265,5.967828017290836,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852426E-4,2.081041609493373E-4,2.0815554347424249E-4,2.081136975517067E-4,2.0813339304459226E-4,2.0810301352577515E-4,2.0816773645214077E-4,2.0807205119149422E-4,2.0810420493002428E-4,2.0831925807556937E-4,2.099722107549349E-4,2.0810454866435657E-4,2.0830163682280343E-4,2.0832333825958511E-4,2.0822870240647164E-4,2.0811451728144003E-4,2.081861167241696E-4,2.0828408981847635E-4,2.081252613366419E-4,2.0812450041003694E-4,2.0831174003631432E-4,2.081453523601863E-4,2.0814566737013864E-4,2.0827900771323661E-4,2.0812533641266428E-4,2.0832582823766927E-4,2.0817741897229786E-4,2.0810369454473188E-4,2.0819803986654232E-4,2.0826158490941724E-4,2.081463733468272E-4,2.0825785201168063E-4,2.0836010141789857E-4,2.085534919000551E-4,2.0817705923586522E-4,2.0811439105668619E-4,2.0818942804771032E-4,2.08135527016561E-4,2.0807227326983925E-4,2.0812519688363532E-4,2.0833377389740333E-4,2.082194897084141E-4,2.0825832659544335E-4,2.0808262900365453E-4,2.081252498046005E-4,2.0811431279772914E-4,2.081847576057067E-4,2.082208571028849E-4,2.0817851656820442E-4,2.0814551990552908E-4,2.0811482744843303E-4,2.085412209325507E-4,2.0816719513391506E-4,2.0812520210255749E-4,2.0816608032148438E-4,2.081039074631014E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793592E-4,2.0811511961501384E-4,2.0810378867208398E-4,2.082702766950434E-4,2.08186671785107

{"value":"This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline. This movie is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While the acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and plodding with no real direction. Occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots, they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script. As a huge fan of good horror movies, I'm always irritated that something this bad gets made.

{"value":"\"Power Play\" starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell, \"Power Play\" has no redeeming value or interest. \"Power Play\" has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play. It's awful, simply awful.<br /><br />Bottom line, if \"Power Play\" was made in the 60's or 70's it would be considered a poor \"B\" class movie. The fact that \"Power Play\" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a \"D\" class movie? If so, \"Power Play\" casts the mold.","finished_norm":["power","plai","start","off","interest","but","it","go","down","hill","fast","the","onli","good","actor","be","tobin","bell","and","he","have","a","veri","small","part","beyond","bell","power","plai","have","no","redeem","valu","or","interest","power","plai","have","much","earthquak","in","a","few","dai","than","california","have","in","a","year","the","earthquak","scene","in","the","mall","be","so","contriv","and","complet","unbeliev","and","all","the","action","scene","look","like","a","bunch","of","grader","putt","on","a","plai","it","aw","simpli","awfulbr","br","bottom","line","if","power","plai","be","make","in","the","or","it","would","be","consid","a","poor","b","class","movi","the","fact","that","power","plai","be","make","in","be","realli","sad","be","there","such","a","thing","a","a","have","class","movi","if","so","power","plai","cast","the","mold"],"filtered":["power","plai","start","interest","go","hill","fast","onli","good","actor","tobin","bell","veri","small","part","beyond","bell","power","plai","redeem","valu","interest","power","plai","much","earthquak","dai","california","year","earthquak","scene","mall","contriv","complet","unbeliev","action","scene","look","like","bunch","grader","putt","plai","aw","simpli","awfulbr","br","bottom","line","power","plai","make","consid","poor","b","class","movi","fact","power","plai","make","realli","sad","thing","class","movi","power","plai","cast","mold"],"filtered2":["power","plai","start","interest","go","hill","fast","onli","good","actor","tobin","bell","veri","small","part","beyond","bell","power","plai","redeem","valu","interest","power","plai","earthquak","dai","california","year","earthquak","scene","mall","contriv","complet","unbeliev","action","scene","look","like","bunch","grader","putt","plai","aw","simpli","awfulbr","bottom","line","power","plai","make","consid","poor","b","class","fact","power","plai","make","realli","sad","thing","class","power","plai","cast","mold"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,11,13,15,16,19,29,40,41,57,60,61,71,92,97,103,107,129,132,138,146,201,317,363,365,419,451,455,502,542,571,628,634,642,860,1018,1180,1213,1947,2542,2546,3471,5280,5677,5720],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,11,13,15,16,19,29,40,41,57,60,61,71,92,97,103,107,129,132,138,146,201,317,363,365,419,451,455,502,542,571,628,634,642,860,1018,1180,1213,1947,2542,2546,3471,5280,5677,5720],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.62476135602347,1.3195384777338066,11.399478130824516,1.5687599167621034,1.834162586674748,3.676353282473182,1.8818517047392527,1.9214926742550966,2.0489535369135887,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.4106958340079214,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.326138445979858,2.561435818751577,2.8529247828056143,3.0349689855553557,19.113126273492803,3.1758963322079246,3.216957819005698,3.2787058260741455,3.3132665011396125,3.4471119148061256,3.467417180966871,7.215127625420226,3.5119855004467477,3.622422927113863,3.8538340941043407,4.268777946167049,4.263079925052412,4.251780369798478,10.179516996473758,5.672363804397,5.214056214914456,5.604922523601468,12.978249881848246,6.389041482367141,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691627E-4,1.8602795149399927E-4,1.8607388323225527E-4,1.8603647642975694E-4,1.8605408257553726E-4,1.860269257919961E-4,1.860847827485873E-4,1.8599924801951197E-4,1.860279908091051E-4,1.862202305795431E-4,1.8769783390787707E-4,1.8602829807924038E-4,1.8620447863330688E-4,1.8622387792744188E-4,1.8613928128212602E-4,1.8603720920051163E-4,1.8610121319542614E-4,1.8618879305904958E-4,1.8604681349948778E-4,1.860461332938787E-4,1.8621351007268015E-4,1.8606477321704622E-4,1.8606505480995558E-4,1.861842500762341E-4,1.860468806112581E-4,1.862261037624283E-4,1.8609343812280905E-4,1.8602753456675998E-4,1.8611187150105948E-4,1.8616867552698427E-4,1.8606568589487276E-4,1.8616533862436826E-4,1.8625674115804863E-4,1.8642961629456632E-4,1.8609311654811618E-4,1.860370963659951E-4,1.8610417324549052E-4,1.8605599017042668E-4,1.8599944653923116E-4,1.8604675588381722E-4,1.862332065267212E-4,1.8613104589010137E-4,1.8616576286309942E-4,1.8600870371092388E-4,1.8604680319079416E-4,1.860370264089438E-4,1.8609999825564628E-4,1.8613226822794952E-4,1.8609441928299887E-4,1.8606492298876032E-4,1.860374864642149E-4,1.864186470619605E-4,1.8608429885475173E-4,1.860467605491031E-4,1.8608330230440967E-4,1.8602772489821677E-4,0.9852969376159039,1.860567483299058E-4,1.8603774763703467E-4,1.8602761870884735E-4,1.8617644526627004E-4,1.861017093741126E-4,1.860275409444182E-4,1.8600862792677184E-4,1.8598992270454952E-

{"value":"All Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film. The story is absent and could easily be a short. The acting is poor, but the animation and music is pretty good. Otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! However, if you have the chance to see the film for free, do so. Then you won't have to waste money. Still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. Otherwise, they're one hit wonders who never had a hit.","finished_norm":["all","hyp","what","well","wai","to","describ","a","movi","about","peopl","who","be","upset","becaus","thei","ca","not","releas","their","film","through","a","mainstream","distributor","consequ","thei","do","it","themselv","otherwis","the","hyp","of","the","film","doe","not","justifi","the","content","in","the","film","the","stori","be","absent","and","can","easili","be","a","short","the","act","be","poor","but","the","anim","and","music","be","pretti","good","otherwis","do","not","wast","your","time","do","not","believ","the","hyp","howev","if","you","have","the","chanc","to","see","the","film","for","free","do","so","then","you","wo","not","have","to","wast","monei","still","the","filmmak","do","a","good","job","of","press","their","stori","and","creat","cliffhang","with","their","selfindulg","miniseri","otherwis","thei","re","on","hit","wonder","who","never","have","a","hit"],"filtered":["hyp","well","wai","describ","movi","peopl","upset","becaus","thei","ca","releas","film","mainstream","distributor","consequ","thei","themselv","otherwis","hyp","film","doe","justifi","content","film","stori","absent","easili","short","act","poor","anim","music","pretti","good","otherwis","wast","time","believ","hyp","howev","chanc","see","film","free","wo","wast","monei","still","filmmak","good","job","press","stori","creat","cliffhang","selfindulg","miniseri","otherwis","thei","re","hit","wonder","never","hit"],"filtered2":["hyp","well","wai","describ","peopl","upset","becaus","ca","releas","mainstream","distributor","consequ","themselv","otherwis","hyp","doe","justifi","content","stori","absent","easili","short","act","poor","anim","music","pretti","good","otherwis","wast","time","believ","hyp","howev","chanc","see","free","wo","wast","monei","still","filmmak","good","job","press","stori","creat","cliffhang","selfindulg","miniseri","otherwis","re","hit","wonder","never","hit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,17,18,20,21,22,23,33,42,64,68,78,81,89,91,113,118,126,146,175,272,277,289,323,327,362,388,406,436,486,583,627,668,686,1142,1589,1724,1827,1964,2306,2531,3068,3113,3434,4664,5320],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,17,18,20,21,22,23,33,42,64,68,78,81,89,91,113,118,126,146,175,272,277,289,323,327,362,388,406,436,486,583,627,668,686,1142,1589,1724,1827,1964,2306,2531,3068,3113,3434,4664,5320],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9418936859054116,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,1.6219954307453837,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,3.9880092219144876,2.0105926690411424,2.1521782565202803,2.354379525480895,2.2391270689902285,2.326138445979858,2.3791142619576227,2.8028805344481915,3.1163992333432793,2.8282659991423613,3.0433232530252132,2.9674191958529437,3.058539100262467,6.182885002738823,3.121829110937649,3.2070272508030975,3.3066947359763783,3.4986697244709752,10.433179651877197,3.5813614403160887,3.6016814428070463,4.263079925052412,13.988637886874695,4.6973654716960676,4.77960356993304,4.900964426937307,5.0768550934009715,5.1994574154933035,5.501738287366237,5.649374286172302,5.604922523601468,6.032366538428407,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.155988596824736E-4,2.1540780663323986E-4,2.1546099248468377E-4,2.1541767793321654E-4,2.154380646612074E-4,2.154066189395788E-4,2.1547361338862637E-4,2.153745699479331E-4,2.154078521574777E-4,2.156304528310064E-4,2.1734141771275785E-4,2.1540820795554652E-4,2.156122131408862E-4,2.156346762135927E-4,2.155367190105505E-4,2.1541852643227146E-4,2.1549263873662993E-4,2.1559405030503593E-4,2.1542964756197315E-4,2.1542885992980744E-4,2.1562267093784904E-4,2.1545044370220877E-4,2.1545076976778378E-4,2.155887898376922E-4,2.1542972527287157E-4,2.1563725358021154E-4,2.1548363572753687E-4,2.15407323859649E-4,2.1550498033487075E-4,2.1557075556130381E-4,2.1545150052150501E-4,2.1556689165339268E-4,2.1567272961560584E-4,2.1587290735061628E-4,2.1548326336575624E-4,2.1541839577752028E-4,2.1549606627473253E-4,2.1544027352728249E-4,2.1537479982036326E-4,2.1542958084691703E-4,2.1564547810166157E-4,2.1552718298266575E-4,2.1556738289319743E-4,2.1538551900010986E-4,2.1542963562520202E-4,2.1541831477197857E-4,2.1549123191840142E-4,2.155285983673578E-4,2.1548477184478565E-4,2.1545061712774065E-4,2.1541884748491812E-4,2.1586020571993608E-4,2.1547305307223884E-4,2.1542958624900304E-4,2.1547189913423295E-4,2.1540754425062418E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.15441151424766E-4,2.1541914990540821E-4,2.1540742129050463E-4,2.155797523947593E-4,2.1549321327804527E-4,2.1540733124454658E-4,2.1538543124717898E-4,2.1536377186288144E-4,2.1555849480439055E-4,2.15417883894033E-4,2.15515804851789

{"value":"Fans of goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual buckets of blood being sloshed about, for there is precious little in the way of bloodletting in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try and tell the bizarre story, relying on bargain-basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been doubled if the cast had turned out their pockets for change one day. Oddly enough, while cheap and very poorly acted (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the total outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout. Imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget! Overall, it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget.","finished_norm":["fan","of","goremeist","herschel","gordon","lewi","should","look","elsewher","if","thei","be","pick","up","thi","film","for","hi","usual","bucket","of","blood","be","slosh","about","for","there","be","preciou","littl","in","the","wai","of","bloodlet","in","thi","film","instead","lewi","decid","to","try","and","tell","the","bizarr","stori","reli","on","bargainbas","special","effect","on","a","budget","which","can","have","probabl","be","doubl","if","the","cast","have","turn","out","their","pocket","for","chang","on","dai","oddli","enough","while","cheap","and","veri","poorli","act","especi","by","mccabe","a","mitchel","the","total","outlandish","of","the","plot","keep","attent","throughout","imagin","what","thi","film","can","have","be","like","with","a","decent","budget","overal","it","strain","for","champagn","tast","on","a","beer","budget"],"filtered":["fan","goremeist","herschel","gordon","lewi","look","elsewher","thei","pick","thi","film","hi","usual","bucket","blood","slosh","preciou","littl","wai","bloodlet","thi","film","instead","lewi","decid","try","tell","bizarr","stori","reli","bargainbas","special","effect","budget","probabl","doubl","cast","turn","pocket","chang","dai","oddli","enough","cheap","veri","poorli","act","especi","mccabe","mitchel","total","outlandish","plot","keep","attent","throughout","imagin","thi","film","like","decent","budget","overal","strain","champagn","tast","beer","budget"],"filtered2":["fan","goremeist","herschel","gordon","lewi","look","elsewher","pick","usual","bucket","blood","slosh","preciou","littl","wai","bloodlet","instead","lewi","decid","try","tell","bizarr","stori","reli","bargainbas","special","effect","budget","probabl","doubl","cast","turn","pocket","chang","dai","oddli","enough","cheap","veri","poorli","act","especi","mccabe","mitchel","total","outlandish","plot","keep","attent","throughout","imagin","like","decent","budget","overal","strain","champagn","tast","beer","budget"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,14,15,16,17,21,32,33,36,90,92,93,96,106,132,134,140,148,152,184,203,249,256,265,267,278,309,340,351,354,398,412,438,446,636,823,872,1307,1426,2035,2099,2170,2237,2350,2530,3228,3259,4115,4792,5040],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,14,15,16,17,21,32,33,36,90,92,93,96,106,132,134,140,148,152,184,203,249,256,265,267,278,309,340,351,354,398,412,438,446,636,823,872,1307,1426,2035,2099,2170,2237,2350,2530,3228,3259,4115,4792,5040],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,2.0477128419653545,2.0489535369135887,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.159084361316692,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,2.3131195476980753,2.496249838866882,2.569760528637609,2.6754694156628323,8.24685657726791,2.73529586597515,2.7085302779237206,2.8336934208777267,2.848772527704847,2.948928684455311,3.0135689919434205,3.185521045582134,3.143848349181566,3.107414446935464,3.1797351085150902,3.233054746047873,3.530930586689197,3.850067611308864,3.857614816944247,4.436351646326448,4.449957298382227,4.979216623837056,5.214056214914456,5.00274712124725,10.645380111834504,5.0768550934009715,5.156897801074508,5.521540914662417,5.770002273960917,5.822646007446338,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255705E-4,2.2737792632708265E-4,2.2743406769354596E-4,2.2738834617097752E-4,2.2740986578072427E-4,2.2737667263379277E-4,2.2744738993572323E-4,2.2734284269338733E-4,2.2737797438108294E-4,2.2761294487884276E-4,2.2941898734736617E-4,2.2737834995069828E-4,2.2759369161694292E-4,2.276174029529932E-4,2.275140023100701E-4,2.2738924182076205E-4,2.27467472514179E-4,2.2757451948007191E-4,2.2740098094688521E-4,2.274001495463369E-4,2.2760473054921063E-4,2.2742293271974009E-4,2.2742327690463966E-4,2.2756896669080758E-4,2.2740106297614504E-4,2.2762012354277285E-4,2.2745796921172086E-4,2.2737741672596983E-4,2.274804999297561E-4,2.2754993025739278E-4,2.274240482660327E-4,2.2754585163377146E-4,2.276575709662824E-4,2.2786887249241986E-4,2.2745757615795533E-4,2.273891039055822E-4,2.2747109051910816E-4,2.2741219739254252E-4,2.273430853397301E-4,2.2740091052450196E-4,2.2762880509736257E-4,2.2750393636919395E-4,2.275463701715621E-4,2.2735440017971107E-4,2.2740096834679283E-4,2.273890183985972E-4,2.274659875196632E-4,2.27505430406208E-4,2.2745916846251928E-4,2.2742311578245462E-4,2.2738958071416695E-4,2.2785546503755472E-4,2.2744679848279366E-4,2.2740091622677958E-4,2.2744558042094628E-4,2.273776493639772E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441373E-4,2.2738989994003437E-4,2.273775195710164E-4,2.2755942704103584E-4,2.27468078982615

They were interesting for about five minutes, afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long.<br /><br />The video was filmed in a very creative way though. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music.","finished_norm":["i","find","the","documentari","entitl","fast","cheap","and","out","of","control","to","be","a","fairli","interest","documentari","the","documentari","contain","four","mini","documentari","about","four","interest","man","each","on","of","thi","man","be","extrem","involv","with","hi","job","show","sheer","love","and","enjoy","for","on","jobbr","br","the","sad","part","i","must","sai","would","have","to","be","the","subject","in","which","thi","individu","workedstudi","thei","be","interest","for","about","five","minut","afterward","becom","bore","and","last","entir","too","longbr","br","the","video","be","film","in","a","veri","creativ","wai","though","i","veri","much","enjoi","the","film","of","on","thing","with","a","voic","dub","over","anoth","it","plai","out","excel","and","conjur","coincid","nice","with","the","music"],"filtered":["find","documentari","entitl","fast","cheap","control","fairli","interest","documentari","documentari","contain","four","mini","documentari","four","interest","man","thi","man","extrem","involv","hi","job","show","sheer","love","enjoy","jobbr","br","sad","part","must","sai","subject","thi","individu","workedstudi","thei","interest","five","minut","afterward","becom","bore","last","entir","longbr","br","video","film","veri","creativ","wai","though","veri","much","enjoi","film","thing","voic","dub","anoth","plai","excel","conjur","coincid","nice","music"],"filtered2":["find","documentari","entitl","fast","cheap","control","fairli","interest","documentari","documentari","contain","four","mini","documentari","four","interest","man","man","extrem","involv","job","show","sheer","love","enjoy","jobbr","sad","part","must","subject","individu","workedstudi","interest","five","minut","afterward","becom","bore","last","entir","longbr","video","veri","creativ","wai","though","veri","enjoi","thing","voic","dub","anoth","plai","excel","conjur","coincid","nice","music"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[15,28,29,33,38,39,40,45,54,59,60,61,73,86,108,115,118,141,144,198,200,240,241,262,289,329,351,428,455,504,542,550,580,606,624,711,737,819,824,949,1125,1537,1626,2238,2810,3106,3627,5151,5935],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[15,28,29,33,38,39,40,45,54,59,60,61,73,86,108,115,118,141,144,198,200,240,241,262,289,329,351,428,455,504,542,550,580,606,624,711,737,819,824,949,1125,1537,1626,2238,2810,3106,3627,5151,5935],"values":[2.4001215597131385,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,3.632592212924433,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,5.514529923709773,1.8818517047392527,1.8950689206770979,2.031112399272319,2.138507503627933,2.201553588425805,2.354379525480895,2.2657547357741192,2.2931108769894046,2.5439726117360975,2.5308211829319704,2.7666071276613566,2.6627744961815836,2.726701583487816,2.8282659991423613,2.951986790814132,3.0135689919434205,3.3721070011625462,3.2787058260741455,3.3956930001684253,3.4471119148061256,3.4751392270607813,3.5039747767006686,7.168478280287408,15.696702333850343,3.6375061693251913,3.68099128126493,3.835141961092188,3.9081109809587793,4.086456389373095,4.251780369798478,4.613282354485526,4.613282354485526,5.051537285416681,5.3064295350454715,5.907203395474402,5.649374286172302,6.214688095222362,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961301E-4,2.116930065387446E-4,2.1174527517734903E-4,2.117027076039157E-4,2.1172274275403085E-4,2.116918393273706E-4,2.117576784283853E-4,2.1166034303434365E-4,2.1169305127789745E-4,2.119118131072543E-4,2.1359327166514615E-4,2.1169340094007584E-4,2.1189388796842007E-4,2.119159636557949E-4,2.1181969576676975E-4,2.117035414702402E-4,2.1177637567609546E-4,2.118760383584709E-4,2.1171447081128614E-4,2.1171369676217526E-4,2.1190416541618502E-4,2.1173490831315615E-4,2.1173522875559035E-4,2.1187086861014468E-4,2.1171454718202677E-4,2.1191849657462003E-4,2.1176752792775898E-4,2.1169253209079157E-4,2.1178850443817667E-4,2.1185314534259426E-4,2.1173594690714997E-4,2.1184934806943375E-4,2.1195336081055499E-4,2.1215008639459396E-4,2.1176716198751712E-4,2.1170341306868626E-4,2.117797441048321E-4,2.1172491352726227E-4,2.1166056894252505E-4,2.1171440524675981E-4,2.1192657926066708E-4,2.1181032419177943E-4,2.118498308375972E-4,2.1167110326541545E-4,2.1171445908036977E-4,2.117033334601199E-4,2.117749931190512E-4,2.1181171516755485E-4,2.117686444521781E-4,2.117350787478903E-4,2.1170385698619613E-4,2.1213760380898734E-4,2.1175712777489442E-4,2.1171441055568453E-4,2.117559937370448E-4,2.1169274868102977E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850268E-4,2.1170415419131505E-4,2.1169262784141027E-4,2.118619870217947E-4,2.1177694030929744E-4,2.1169253934833342E-4,2.1167101702582153E-4,2.1164973116690402E-4,2.11

{"value":"This was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in New York City and centering around a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he''s a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent. <br /><br />It's kind of fun to watch until a profane tough New York City-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over. That ruined the film for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed women. <br /><br />The hairdo on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: it odd to hear a film made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen's) with just mono sound.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","strang","kind","of","film","about","a","lowlif","in","new","york","citi","and","center","around","a","main","charact","the","titl","name","plai","by","brad","pitt","who","think","he","a","ricki","nelsontyp","musician","except","he","have","no","real","talent","br","br","it","kind","of","fun","to","watch","until","a","profan","tough","new","york","citytyp","woman","with","horribl","accent","enter","the","pictur","and","take","over","that","ruin","the","film","for","me","it","must","have","be","catherin","keen","who","usual","plai","tough","and","garbagemouth","woman","br","br","the","hairdo","on","pitt","a","exagger","pompadour","be","fun","to","look","at","i","can","pictur","johnni","depp","plai","thi","role","well","on","last","note","it","odd","to","hear","a","film","make","in","other","than","woodi","allen","with","just","mono","sound"],"filtered":["thi","strang","kind","film","lowlif","new","york","citi","center","around","main","charact","titl","name","plai","brad","pitt","think","ricki","nelsontyp","musician","except","real","talent","br","br","kind","fun","watch","profan","tough","new","york","citytyp","woman","horribl","accent","enter","pictur","take","ruin","film","must","catherin","keen","usual","plai","tough","garbagemouth","woman","br","br","hairdo","pitt","exagger","pompadour","fun","look","pictur","johnni","depp","plai","thi","role","well","last","note","odd","hear","film","make","woodi","allen","mono","sound"],"filtered2":["strang","kind","lowlif","new","york","citi","center","around","main","charact","titl","name","plai","brad","pitt","think","ricki","nelsontyp","musician","except","real","talent","kind","fun","watch","profan","tough","new","york","citytyp","woman","horribl","accent","enter","pictur","take","ruin","must","catherin","keen","usual","plai","tough","garbagemouth","woman","hairdo","pitt","exagger","pompadour","fun","look","pictur","johnni","depp","plai","role","well","last","note","odd","hear","make","woodi","allen","mono","sound"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,10,12,16,20,31,40,70,80,87,98,122,128,141,143,144,178,179,216,230,232,259,264,265,276,311,417,559,560,595,710,772,827,1109,1170,1314,1345,1674,1761,2046,2484,2926,3062,3272,3587,5650,5865,7343,7863],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,10,12,16,20,31,40,70,80,87,98,122,128,141,143,144,178,179,216,230,232,259,264,265,276,311,417,559,560,595,710,772,827,1109,1170,1314,1345,1674,1761,2046,2484,2926,3062,3272,3587,5650,5865,7343,7863],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.4070669811451506,4.885490627496221,4.189351572503368,1.9951803900462557,4.230048743045324,2.0881990796736947,4.497869534746497,2.3409902041158843,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.2931108769894046,2.532833256045391,2.507968722980095,2.6070186965339692,2.7121382192999195,2.6102777977348763,5.492910624448097,2.757740698455715,2.73529586597515,2.7884729505849193,5.8406676183565125,3.1932880749197934,3.5727776966246974,3.4623020803001006,3.6284289511740746,3.6528204042982337,3.8059428063999263,8.125851783925802,8.526159850104824,4.2860694432771105,4.4637506205145625,4.760735085628657,4.9909126636002465,5.156897801074508,4.900964426937307,5.3064295350454715,5.626901430320244,5.604922523601468,5.583416318380505,11.935656034581672,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.014580719987593E-4,2.0127954981638413E-4,2.0132924729208173E-4,2.0128877367343214E-4,2.01307823268228E-4,2.0127844002166892E-4,2.0134104041092708E-4,2.0124849307261752E-4,2.0127959235475933E-4,2.0148759300272546E-4,2.0308633840816445E-4,2.0127992481659644E-4,2.0147054962498738E-4,2.0149153938033807E-4,2.014000070350727E-4,2.0128956652077813E-4,2.0135881791649252E-4,2.014535780607694E-4,2.0129995823319928E-4,2.0129922226057968E-4,2.0148032151161326E-4,2.013193903875393E-4,2.0131969506698976E-4,2.0144866261914582E-4,2.0130003084716297E-4,2.014939477015631E-4,2.013504054005045E-4,2.0127909870714837E-4,2.0137035004885463E-4,2.0143181118237826E-4,2.01320377891732E-4,2.0142820070206635E-4,2.0152709691999225E-4,2.0171414531445814E-4,2.0135005746134323E-4,2.012894444354651E-4,2.013620206478004E-4,2.0130988725827623E-4,2.0124870786807913E-4,2.0129989589387802E-4,2.015016327896794E-4,2.013910964601512E-4,2.0142865972223045E-4,2.0125872399380604E-4,2.0129994707934206E-4,2.0128936874294856E-4,2.0135750336924311E-4,2.0139241901200337E-4,2.0135146700162263E-4,2.0131955243836528E-4,2.0128986651609025E-4,2.0170227676361404E-4,2.0134051684480385E-4,2.0129990094164976E-4,2.0133943859176385E-4,2.0127930464302856E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585442E-4,2.0129014910129944

The fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine. Everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it. Seriously. I felt like it killed several brain cells after I watched this garbage. The positive reviews of this a$$crap were obviously made by the \"filmmaker\" (and I use the term VERY loosely) himself and/or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life. Trust me, stay the hell away from this video. You'll thank me for it. Avoid it like

{"value":"After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire, with wooden acting, lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing, one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies, sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie, all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid.","finished_norm":["after","read","the","other","review","for","thi","film","i","be","of","the","opinion","that","the","high","marker","be","probabl","pai","studio","lackei","a","the","film","i","see","be","absolut","dire","with","wooden","act","lacklustr","script","and","plod","predict","direct","on","of","the","few","plu","point","have","to","be","the","stun","sceneri","a","thi","film","featur","some","stun","backdrop","with","great","sweep","vista","and","dramat","sky","and","wide","open","prairi","sadli","when","the","much","memor","thing","in","a","film","be","the","part","featur","behind","the","actor","thi","have","to","be","a","warn","sign","a","to","the","qualiti","of","the","movi","all","in","all","a","thoroughli","uninspir","addit","to","the","western","genr","which","even","at","the","veri","reason","price","it","can","be","obtain","on","dvd","be","well","to","avoid"],"filtered":["read","review","thi","film","opinion","high","marker","probabl","pai","studio","lackei","film","see","absolut","dire","wooden","act","lacklustr","script","plod","predict","direct","plu","point","stun","sceneri","thi","film","featur","stun","backdrop","great","sweep","vista","dramat","sky","wide","open","prairi","sadli","much","memor","thing","film","part","featur","behind","actor","thi","warn","sign","qualiti","movi","thoroughli","uninspir","addit","western","genr","even","veri","reason","price","obtain","dvd","well","avoid"],"filtered2":["read","review","opinion","high","marker","probabl","pai","studio","lackei","see","absolut","dire","wooden","act","lacklustr","script","plod","predict","direct","plu","point","stun","sceneri","featur","stun","backdrop","great","sweep","vista","dramat","sky","wide","open","prairi","sadli","memor","thing","part","featur","behind","actor","warn","sign","qualiti","thoroughli","uninspir","addit","western","genr","even","veri","reason","price","obtain","dvd","well","avoid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,15,20,21,29,41,51,61,66,77,95,102,145,148,176,211,222,242,247,305,319,322,335,337,393,467,527,538,706,749,756,769,876,891,932,1074,1138,1185,1549,1556,1582,1590,1648,1758,1909,2440,3001,3233,3924,6983,7890],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,15,20,21,29,41,51,61,66,77,95,102,145,148,176,211,222,242,247,305,319,322,335,337,393,467,527,538,706,749,756,769,876,891,932,1074,1138,1185,1549,1556,1582,1590,1648,1758,1909,2440,3001,3233,3924,6983,7890],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,1.9463902258768238,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.34599021453259,2.3018654096236517,2.5040471493269134,2.5687161421197025,2.5771019354959765,2.689504733779216,2.7303758068497004,5.7225627547931115,2.9056060024680126,2.885344817328191,2.908534262247101,2.973659465713028,3.120015873813468,3.342254038012865,3.439602492783994,3.43462735814388,3.6284289511740746,3.7165362186843414,3.7636829971100436,4.0536665665501035,3.8844878351953436,3.8767358583910254,4.058285512406398,4.110553940952155,4.224077767249142,4.235066888824737,4.528289141652134,9.178753667263944,4.621379564718146,4.573751515728891,4.706176101378222,5.00274712124725,4.8796870284900224,5.102830579804232,5.444579873526289,5.521540914662417,5.822646007446338,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164666E-4,2.2324275812784218E-4,2.2329787848933367E-4,2.2325298847310007E-4,2.232741167202932E-4,2.2324152723462225E-4,2.2331095844892404E-4,2.2320831253640853E-4,2.2324280530791694E-4,2.2347350255652812E-4,2.2524669975505126E-4,2.232431740473023E-4,2.2345459944065005E-4,2.2347787955470628E-4,2.233763593891774E-4,2.2325386783430916E-4,2.2333067579914008E-4,2.234357759744349E-4,2.2326539346890386E-4,2.232645771884737E-4,2.2346543761534026E-4,2.2328694601974765E-4,2.2328728394518978E-4,2.234303241699845E-4,2.2326547400635315E-4,2.2348055066696395E-4,2.2332134532680116E-4,2.232422577944993E-4,2.2334346629394178E-4,2.234116339392788E-4,2.232880412783561E-4,2.2340762949082027E-4,2.2351731705956898E-4,2.2372477578809873E-4,2.2332095942123798E-4,2.232537324272992E-4,2.2333422800586636E-4,2.23276405928668E-4,2.2320855076990678E-4,2.2326532432724475E-4,2.2348907433600588E-4,2.2336647651074388E-4,2.234081385983156E-4,2.2321965983456373E-4,2.2326538109796083E-4,2.232536484753718E-4,2.233292178112128E-4,2.2336794337671966E-4,2.2332252276763831E-4,2.2328712575322472E-4,2.2325420056448948E-4,2.2371161216552587E-4,2.2331037775234796E-4,2.2326532992581892E-4,2.2330918184256562E-4,2.2324248620167697E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760425E-4,2.2325451398481244E-4,2.2324235876917278E-4,2.2342095801135593E-4,2.2333

{"value":"After hearing raves about this movie for years, I finally decided to rent it and watch. Let me start by saying that I'm glad that the rental was free from the local library. This move was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot made no sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to nuke that backwater Texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all of the hype that I have heard about this movie. Dallas provided as good a detail of the life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.","finished_norm":["after","hear","rave","about","thi","movi","for","year","i","final","decid","to","rend","it","and","watch","let","me","start","by","sai","that","i","be","glad","that","the","rental","be","free","from","the","local","librari","thi","move","be","slow","bore","unrealist","and","the","plot","make","no","sens","after","hour","i","be","readi","to","nuke","that","backwat","texa","town","and","put","the","group","of","that","charact","out","of","their","miseri","i","realiz","that","tast","be","subject","but","believ","me","i","just","do","not","understand","all","of","the","hyp","that","i","have","hear","about","thi","movi","dalla","provid","a","good","a","detail","of","the","life","in","texa","a","thi","movi","rend","it","onli","if","you","want","to","understand","how","movi","studio","can","pai","enough","monei","to","review","to","convinc","the","gener","public","that","a","bad","movi","be","good"],"filtered":["hear","rave","thi","movi","year","final","decid","rend","watch","let","start","sai","glad","rental","free","local","librari","thi","move","slow","bore","unrealist","plot","make","sens","hour","readi","nuke","backwat","texa","town","put","group","charact","miseri","realiz","tast","subject","believ","understand","hyp","hear","thi","movi","dalla","provid","good","detail","life","texa","thi","movi","rend","onli","want","understand","movi","studio","pai","enough","monei","review","convinc","gener","public","bad","movi","good"],"filtered2":["hear","rave","year","final","decid","rend","watch","let","start","glad","rental","free","local","librari","move","slow","bore","unrealist","plot","make","sens","hour","readi","nuke","backwat","texa","town","put","group","charact","miseri","realiz","tast","subject","believ","understand","hyp","hear","dalla","provid","good","detail","life","texa","rend","onli","want","understand","studio","pai","enough","monei","review","convinc","gener","public","bad","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,9,10,11,32,37,57,71,75,91,93,108,124,126,156,159,173,174,176,212,216,225,249,275,322,390,405,410,450,475,478,533,550,686,695,740,780,872,932,1227,1264,1334,1505,1589,1950,2154,2902,3186,6084,6906],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,9,10,11,32,37,57,71,75,91,93,108,124,126,156,159,173,174,176,212,216,225,249,275,322,390,405,410,450,475,478,533,550,686,695,740,780,872,932,1227,1264,1334,1505,1589,1950,2154,2902,3186,6084,6906],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.834162586674748,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.138507503627933,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.3451551414151686,2.300267965194495,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,2.5040471493269134,5.196758667886523,5.2140373930679385,2.641219492619754,2.6754694156628323,2.7832848715031413,2.885344817328191,3.132778125427319,3.109204957709252,3.2070272508030975,3.469984576472117,3.3721070011625462,3.3243163373261977,6.849501469295936,3.4751392270607813,3.6016814428070463,3.6715125373103863,3.7165362186843414,3.7775721092707104,3.857614816944247,4.058285512406398,4.246178114249808,4.327618446189983,4.383707912841026,4.535724120139652,4.662879295624898,10.02944662458793,5.185068678041204,5.390512652256013,5.501738287366237,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612976E-4,2.1169300653874429E-4,2.1174527517734868E-4,2.1170270760391538E-4,2.1172274275403053E-4,2.1169183932737026E-4,2.1175767842838498E-4,2.116603430343433E-4,2.116930512778971E-4,2.1191181310725398E-4,2.1359327166514582E-4,2.1169340094007549E-4,2.118938879684197E-4,2.1191596365579459E-4,2.1181969576676942E-4,2.1170354147023986E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847054E-4,2.1171447081128582E-4,2.117136967621749E-4,2.119041654161847E-4,2.117349083131558E-4,2.1173522875559E-4,2.1187086861014433E-4,2.1171454718202644E-4,2.1191849657461968E-4,2.1176752792775863E-4,2.1169253209079125E-4,2.1178850443817634E-4,2.1185314534259394E-4,2.1173594690714965E-4,2.1184934806943342E-4,2.1195336081055463E-4,2.121500863945936E-4,2.1176716198751676E-4,2.1170341306868593E-4,2.1177974410483178E-4,2.1172491352726194E-4,2.1166056894252473E-4,2.1171440524675946E-4,2.1192657926066673E-4,2.1181032419177907E-4,2.1184983083759687E-4,2.1167110326541513E-4,2.1171445908036942E-4,2.1170333346011959E-4,2.1177499311905089E-4,2.1181171516755453E-4,2.1176864445217775E-4,2.1173507874788997E-4,2.1170385698619578E-4,2.12137603808987E-4,2.1175712777489407E-4,2.117144105556842E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102942E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502648E-4,2.1170415419131472E-4,2.1169262784140994E-4,2.11861987021794

Could it be: The confusing storyline, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez, and the annoying editing? It's got to be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) go on a mystical road trip. They meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too. The movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to subtle, don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments, and weak special effects.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.","finished_norm":["bullfight","be","make","in","but","it","be","be","releas","on","video","year","late","for","some","reason","i","wonder","why","can","it","be","the","confus","storylin","the","incomprehens","dialogu","sai","by","oliv","martinez","and","the","annoi","edit","it","get","to","be","i","think","the","plot","be","mari","michel","forb","and","jacqu","oliv","martinez","go","on","a","mystic","road","trip","thei","meet","a","lot","of","wacki","charact","and","avoid","some","evil","on","too","the","movi","look","great","and","there","be","a","lot","of","styl","but","there","be","no","substanc","much","movi","when","try","to","subtl","do","not","call","attent","to","themselv","with","unansw","plot","develop","and","weak","special","effectsbr","br","do","not","be","fool","by","the","cover","willem","dafo","be","in","it","for","minut","at","much"],"filtered":["bullfight","make","releas","video","year","late","reason","wonder","confus","storylin","incomprehens","dialogu","sai","oliv","martinez","annoi","edit","get","think","plot","mari","michel","forb","jacqu","oliv","martinez","go","mystic","road","trip","thei","meet","lot","wacki","charact","avoid","evil","movi","look","great","lot","styl","substanc","much","movi","try","subtl","call","attent","themselv","unansw","plot","develop","weak","special","effectsbr","br","fool","cover","willem","dafo","minut","much"],"filtered2":["bullfight","make","releas","video","year","late","reason","wonder","confus","storylin","incomprehens","dialogu","oliv","martinez","annoi","edit","get","think","plot","mari","michel","forb","jacqu","oliv","martinez","go","mystic","road","trip","meet","lot","wacki","charact","avoid","evil","look","great","lot","styl","substanc","try","subtl","call","attent","themselv","unansw","plot","develop","weak","special","effectsbr","fool","cover","willem","dafo","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,10,12,16,32,36,51,57,59,72,95,142,150,175,203,240,248,271,320,321,327,335,348,350,379,380,427,436,491,515,636,921,1042,1057,1080,1434,2003,2276,2291,2502,3027,3088,3833,4623,5856,5883,8255],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,10,12,16,32,36,51,57,59,72,95,142,150,175,203,240,248,271,320,321,327,335,348,350,379,380,427,436,491,515,636,921,1042,1057,1080,1434,2003,2276,2291,2502,3027,3088,3833,4623,5856,5883,8255],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,3.841892750832105,2.0323326556775485,2.2844323215331563,2.332712011146513,2.3791142619576227,2.569760528637609,2.7666071276613566,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,2.938298364153555,3.09496984188738,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.0103169565570433,3.0135689919434205,3.1272886331425473,3.102062070196872,3.233054746047873,3.2070272508030975,3.369778711402955,3.3956930001684253,3.530930586689197,4.3521595551061,4.115443926246347,4.181290492043933,4.229557233013768,4.477736862489302,4.911775343041523,10.428112429828913,5.259176650194926,5.156897801074508,5.5623629091826725,5.463272006538442,6.342521466732247,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572,6.342521466732247,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651717E-4,2.316691787225998E-4,2.317263796324287E-4,2.3167979521786182E-4,2.3170172096235688E-4,2.3166790136863882E-4,2.3173995330228226E-4,2.3163343296338695E-4,2.3166922768351242E-4,2.3190863272655847E-4,2.3374876022784935E-4,2.3166961034116852E-4,2.3188901610218283E-4,2.3191317493693838E-4,2.3180782283696837E-4,2.3168070777104303E-4,2.3176041489471845E-4,2.3186948213389045E-4,2.3169266844704975E-4,2.316918213556661E-4,2.3190026336973317E-4,2.3171503451076993E-4,2.317153851913936E-4,2.3186382454808488E-4,2.316927520244293E-4,2.3191594687179618E-4,2.3175073223857324E-4,2.3166865950389993E-4,2.3177368817377578E-4,2.3184442884434947E-4,2.3171617111051646E-4,2.318402732457831E-4,2.3195410103209608E-4,2.3216939040434886E-4,2.3175033176679253E-4,2.3168056725302106E-4,2.317641011814398E-4,2.317040965781599E-4,2.3163368018913952E-4,2.316925966956007E-4,2.3192479227141053E-4,2.3179756692385698E-4,2.3184080156982067E-4,2.3164520857154724E-4,2.3169265560915865E-4,2.31680480132282E-4,2.3175890187423557E-4,2.3179908915749517E-4,2.317519541225619E-4,2.3171522102838585E-4,2.3168105306030687E-4,2.3215572991360756E-4,2.3173935068699478E-4,2.3169260250549613E-4,2.3173810963694047E-4,2.3166889653243207E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908934E-4,2.3168137831085217E-4,2.3166876428991793E-4,2.3185410485865144E-4,2.3176103280889675E-4,2.3166866744629155E-4,2.3164511419405116E-4,2.3162181971902597E-4,2.3183124250942034E-4,2.316800167268867E-4,2.3178532984537487E-4,2.31853

{"value":"Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice. If it's stamped \"Copolla\" it's automatically great stuff, right? Wrong! It's a neat spoof of filmdom's pretensions. But it's terribly \"in.\" I worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it. But once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it.

{"value":"If this film was a comedy, I would have given it a 10. Oh my, where do I begin? Put it this way -- I've seen lots of terrible horror films, but this one makes Troll 2 look like freakin' Saving Private Ryan. It's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film, changed their mind in midproduction and decided to do a comedy, then went back to horror, and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno (softcore at that). Everything about this film is simply terrible: the musical score (someone shoot the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the directing, the cinematography, the acting.

{"value":"Seems everyone in this film is channeling Woody Allen. They stammer and pause and stammer some more. Only for REALLY die-hard DeNero fans! It tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very, very low budget film made by college students. The most often used word in the whole film is \"hum\". The film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties/early seventies though. If you like films where people are CONSTANTLY talking over each other, horrible lighting (even if it is for \"art's sake\"), and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting, then you might like this - but you need to be really bored. I found this CD in the dollar bin and now I know why.","finished_norm":["seem","everyon","in","thi","film","be","channel","woodi","allen","thei","stammer","and","paus","and","stammer","some","much","onli","for","realli","diehard","denero","fan","it","try","to","appear","a","edgi","and","artist","but","it","come","off","a","look","like","a","veri","veri","low","budget","film","make","by","colleg","student","the","much","often","us","word","in","the","whole","film","be","hum","the","film","doe","peg","the","atmospher","of","the","late","sixtiesearli","seventi","though","if","you","like","film","where","peopl","be","constantli","talk","over","each","other","horribl","light","even","if","it","be","for","art","sake","and","make","you","feel","like","you","be","sit","in","on","a","lame","polit","meet","then","you","mai","like","thi","but","you","ne","to","be","realli","bore","i","find","thi","cd","in","the","dollar","bin","and","now","i","know","why"],"filtered":["seem","everyon","thi","film","channel","woodi","allen","thei","stammer","paus","stammer","much","onli","realli","diehard","denero","fan","try","appear","edgi","artist","come","look","like","veri","veri","low","budget","film","make","colleg","student","much","often","us","word","whole","film","hum","film","doe","peg","atmospher","late","sixtiesearli","seventi","though","like","film","peopl","constantli","talk","horribl","light","even","art","sake","make","feel","like","sit","lame","polit","meet","mai","like","thi","ne","realli","bore","find","thi","cd","dollar","bin","know"],"filtered2":["seem","everyon","channel","woodi","allen","stammer","paus","stammer","onli","realli","diehard","denero","fan","try","appear","edgi","artist","come","look","like","veri","veri","low","budget","make","colleg","student","often","us","word","whole","hum","doe","peg","atmospher","late","sixtiesearli","seventi","though","like","peopl","constantli","talk","horribl","light","even","art","sake","make","feel","like","sit","lame","polit","meet","mai","like","ne","realli","bore","find","cd","dollar","bin","know"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,11,13,15,16,18,23,26,34,35,36,38,43,46,56,86,108,110,111,140,150,170,186,217,230,244,246,256,258,350,353,373,382,400,575,626,724,728,814,835,1038,1156,1270,1345,1761,2260,2771,3065,3232,3331,3549,4588,7856],"values":[2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,11,13,15,16,18,23,26,34,35,36,38,43,46,56,86,108,110,111,140,150,170,186,217,230,244,246,256,258,350,353,373,382,400,575,626,724,728,814,835,1038,1156,1270,1345,1761,2260,2771,3065,3232,3331,3549,4588,7856],"values":[1.2399534312410465,2.5841531782306313,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,2.031112399272319,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,2.317169775997098,2.332712011146513,2.4214486257841834,2.571852579609833,2.6113665294700725,2.7121382192999195,2.634508058031767,2.673149229007135,2.748952192422636,2.7061321952397077,3.0135689919434205,3.0266839340212486,3.070535816550098,3.235085203598255,3.130944944345658,3.6314455447135003,3.6528204042982337,3.7987743169213135,3.7740817043309423,3.9363956947973615,3.8614098879127985,4.145296889396028,4.224077767249142,4.3521595551061,4.760735085628657,5.156897801074508,5.02684467282631,5.3560264761848435,5.5623629091826725,5.5623629091826725,5.541743621979936,5.878215858601149,6.137727054086234,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.982080342507922E-4,1.980323920911722E-4,1.9808128781854373E-4,1.9804146714364122E-4,1.980602094193927E-4,1.9803130020030506E-4,1.9809289068399772E-4,1.980018363726987E-4,1.9803243394329382E-4,1.98237079004905E-4,1.9981003252786682E-4,1.980327610416649E-4,1.9822031058076123E-4,1.9824096171727905E-4,1.9815090602457136E-4,1.9804224720031677E-4,1.9811038139259552E-4,1.9820361281160047E-4,1.9805247126764285E-4,1.9805174716815778E-4,1.9822992482167908E-4,1.980715899312674E-4,1.9807188969545332E-4,1.9819877666871465E-4,1.9805254271015624E-4,1.9824333118607782E-4,1.9810210459216484E-4,1.9803194825949067E-4,1.9812172748195068E-4,1.9818219708903905E-4,1.9807256150447322E-4,1.9817864485507678E-4,1.9827594562220641E-4,1.9845997644414877E-4,1.981017622661587E-4,1.9804212708455439E-4,1.9811353245559576E-4,1.9806224011196367E-4,1.9800204770295608E-4,1.9805240993401544E-4,1.9825089229392255E-4,1.9814213920018098E-4,1.9817909647006302E-4,1.9801190224276897E-4,1.980524602937261E-4,1.9804205261315317E-4,1.9810908805238016E-4,1.9814344041586428E-4,1.9810314906692177E-4,1.9807174936779603E-4,1.980425423559316E-4,1.984482993636085E-4,1.98092375564345E-4,1.980

{"value":"As a \"Jane Eyre\" fan I was excited when this movie came out. \"At last,\" I thought, \"someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author.\" Wrong!!! If the casting director was intending to cast a \"Jane\" who was plain he certainly succeeded. However, surely he could have found one who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book.

{"value":"The only good thing about \"People I Know\" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid performing in. The first big turn-off I had was the way in which Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent; at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone. Dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot. The supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting, and within an hour I still saw no signs of a sturdy plot. The story overall is a real bore, and I had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake.<br /><br />This movie will surely bore you as well...avoid at all costs.","finished_norm":["the","onli","good","thing","about","peopl","i","know","be","that","it","serv","a","a","perfect","exampl","of","movi","that","al","pacino","should","avoid","perform","in","the","big","turnoff","i","have","be","the","wai","in","which","pacino","try","to","portrai","a","georgia","accent","at","time","it","be","weak","and","unattract","while","in","other","segment","it","seem","too","overdo","dialogu","and","charact","interact","be","terribl","along","with","a","weak","plot","the","support","cast","do","a","extrem","perfunctori","job","in","keep","the","movi","interest","and","within","a","hour","i","still","see","no","sign","of","a","sturdi","plot","the","stori","overal","be","a","real","bear","and","i","have","to","slap","myself","in","the","face","a","few","time","to","keep","myself","awakebr","br","thi","movi","will","sure","bear","you","a","wellavoid","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["onli","good","thing","peopl","know","serv","perfect","exampl","movi","al","pacino","avoid","perform","big","turnoff","wai","pacino","try","portrai","georgia","accent","time","weak","unattract","segment","seem","overdo","dialogu","charact","interact","terribl","along","weak","plot","support","cast","extrem","perfunctori","job","keep","movi","interest","within","hour","still","see","sign","sturdi","plot","stori","overal","real","bear","slap","face","time","keep","awakebr","br","thi","movi","sure","bear","wellavoid","cost"],"filtered2":["onli","good","thing","peopl","know","serv","perfect","exampl","al","pacino","avoid","perform","big","turnoff","wai","pacino","try","portrai","georgia","accent","time","weak","unattract","segment","seem","overdo","dialogu","charact","interact","terribl","along","weak","plot","support","cast","extrem","perfunctori","job","keep","interest","within","hour","still","see","sign","sturdi","plot","stori","overal","real","bear","slap","face","time","keep","awakebr","sure","bear","wellavoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,10,11,17,23,26,29,32,33,35,36,60,64,80,82,92,105,119,134,166,174,248,251,289,307,324,329,335,379,412,459,469,525,559,672,677,815,836,876,1317,1490,1531,1913,1977,2298,3810,5021],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,10,11,17,23,26,29,32,33,35,36,60,64,80,82,92,105,119,134,166,174,248,251,289,307,324,329,335,379,412,459,469,525,559,672,677,815,836,876,1317,1490,1531,1913,1977,2298,3810,5021],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.0489535369135887,2.1765612129984904,2.1653408989309972,4.488792363340481,2.4423870329693536,2.456282578459816,2.689504733779216,2.6942272927333892,2.8282659991423613,2.8767855639325206,2.8753661172782943,2.951986790814132,2.908534262247101,6.254577266285095,3.107414446935464,3.2850956241729166,3.328770687675578,6.829941411188657,3.5727776966246974,3.616452760127359,3.6559115968679063,3.7881170224473255,3.7881170224473255,3.8844878351953436,4.646072177308517,4.558366596889411,4.869215728622727,4.848596441419991,4.900964426937307,11.043081829324834,5.770002273960917,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805368E-4,2.1925531043720612E-4,2.1930944626706047E-4,2.1926535805328205E-4,2.1928610891855613E-4,2.192541015295698E-4,2.1932229259911864E-4,2.1922148009526662E-4,2.1925535677457455E-4,2.1948193342720797E-4,2.2122345868647722E-4,2.1925571892772607E-4,2.194633679490942E-4,2.1948623224568874E-4,2.193865253813078E-4,2.1926622170779204E-4,2.1934165776813408E-4,2.1944488069798194E-4,2.1927754147741074E-4,2.1927673977696312E-4,2.1947401253786476E-4,2.192987090676412E-4,2.1929904095723235E-4,2.1943952627086753E-4,2.192776205763414E-4,2.1948885564790872E-4,2.193324939519084E-4,2.192548190405609E-4,2.1935421980567524E-4,2.1942116987548033E-4,2.192997847633019E-4,2.194172369524271E-4,2.1952496533805891E-4,2.1972871854514234E-4,2.1933211493919256E-4,2.192660887193527E-4,2.19345146527165E-4,2.1928835723826457E-4,2.1922171407356026E-4,2.192774735707245E-4,2.1949722707154424E-4,2.19376819025782E-4,2.194177369665054E-4,2.1923262471379985E-4,2.1927752932743112E-4,2.1926600626693155E-4,2.1934022582203967E-4,2.1937825969134975E-4,2.19333650361901E-4,2.1929888559081104E-4,2.1926654849491648E-4,2.1971579004444698E-4,2.1932172227464707E-4,2.192774790692998E-4,2.1932054772559216E-4,2.1925504336804666E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630285E-4,2.1926685631708633E-4,2.192549182116765E-4,2.194303274057624E-4,2.1934224257171364E-4,2.192548265573637E-4,2.1923253539347113E-4,2.1921048914035586E-4,2.1940869

{"value":"Simply terrible! Why wouldn't you use actual actors? Look, this has to stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or any message sent via these low-budget films...please for the love of god use real actors! Most will work for free...take advantage of that! Now back to my comment...anyway, the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn't funny on any level. As for the quality...in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew...guess what? It was one guy with what looked like a Sony Camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish...and it wasn't even good

{"value":"I watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on, it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful. I urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be, surely it was deliberate. I cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish, unrehearsed, badly executed way that it was beyond belief. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, think I am exaggerating? Well give it airtime and think again. Dreadful, utterly dreadful. If this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film

(Which is pretty easy to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's

{"value":"There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award. Well, it does not deserve an audience as well. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly, the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least. Every frame, you feel you are getting the \"full picture\", its like someone is \"cropping your view\" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I will be honest, I could not bear to watch the entire movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal.<br /><br />Take my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.","finished_norm":["there","be","no","artist","valu","in","thi","movi","to","deserv","ani","award","good","it","doe","not","deserv","a","audienc","a","good","iron","on","of","the","award","be","for","cinematographi","but","frankli","the","camera","movem","be","disconcert","to","sai","the","littl","everi","frame","you","feel","you","be","get","the","full","pictur","it","like","someon","be","crop","your","view","from","the","edg","the","stori","be","pathet","good","i","will","be","honest","i","can","not","bear","to","watch","the","entir","movi","the","part","that","suck","the","much","be","when","i","see","the","soldier","parti","in","their","barrack","and","on","of","the","soldier","coax","to","drink","liquor","thi","and","mani","other","similar","scene","remind","me","so","much","of","steven","seagalbr","br","take","my","advic","stai","awai","from","thi","piec","of","crap"],"filtered":["artist","valu","thi","movi","deserv","ani","award","good","doe","deserv","audienc","good","iron","award","cinematographi","frankli","camera","movem","disconcert","sai","littl","everi","frame","feel","get","full","pictur","like","someon","crop","view","edg","stori","pathet","good","honest","bear","watch","entir","movi","part","suck","much","see","soldier","parti","barrack","soldier","coax","drink","liquor","thi","mani","similar","scene","remind","much","steven","seagalbr","br","take","advic","stai","awai","thi","piec","crap"],"filtered2":["artist","valu","deserv","ani","award","good","doe","deserv","audienc","good","iron","award","cinematographi","frankli","camera","movem","disconcert","littl","everi","frame","feel","get","full","pictur","like","someon","crop","view","edg","stori","pathet","good","honest","bear","watch","entir","part","suck","see","soldier","parti","barrack","soldier","coax","drink","liquor","mani","similar","scene","remind","steven","seagalbr","take","advic","stai","awai","piec","crap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,14,17,18,19,27,31,43,50,61,85,139,155,168,198,218,231,311,312,313,336,366,421,423,451,525,589,602,629,644,657,667,724,850,1004,1102,1194,1246,1283,1333,1401,1552,1659,5074,6283],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,14,17,18,19,27,31,43,50,61,85,139,155,168,198,218,231,311,312,313,336,366,421,423,451,525,589,602,629,644,657,667,724,850,1004,1102,1194,1246,1283,1333,1401,1552,1659,5074,6283],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,2.011190219103739,2.2939035841256437,2.3074766467914385,2.4894767118610357,2.5439726117360975,2.5940874818617203,2.7049353070058615,2.9203338091782562,2.8824835850471584,2.907069060519773,2.9233055795674137,3.008694896185175,3.2597778161886266,6.328935272768604,3.216957819005698,3.4149707055943286,3.530930586689197,3.506637894120152,3.488143311483988,3.5670958631572662,8.01722780521832,3.6652429242967908,3.7987743169213135,3.9241755834625858,8.352137096125563,4.160564361526816,4.499089986959872,4.315570107673808,4.3773181147422555,4.383707912841026,4.470719289830655,4.597282013139085,4.688631791727313,6.137727054086234,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816468E-4,2.2324275812784234E-4,2.232978784893338E-4,2.232529884731002E-4,2.2327411672029337E-4,2.232415272346224E-4,2.2331095844892418E-4,2.2320831253640867E-4,2.2324280530791707E-4,2.2347350255652826E-4,2.252466997550514E-4,2.2324317404730245E-4,2.2345459944065019E-4,2.2347787955470644E-4,2.2337635938917753E-4,2.2325386783430932E-4,2.2333067579914025E-4,2.2343577597443506E-4,2.2326539346890402E-4,2.2326457718847384E-4,2.234654376153404E-4,2.232869460197478E-4,2.2328728394518994E-4,2.2343032416998463E-4,2.232654740063533E-4,2.2348055066696412E-4,2.233213453268013E-4,2.2324225779449947E-4,2.2334346629394194E-4,2.2341163393927894E-4,2.2328804127835623E-4,2.234076294908204E-4,2.2351731705956912E-4,2.237247757880989E-4,2.2332095942123814E-4,2.2325373242729934E-4,2.233342280058665E-4,2.2327640592866816E-4,2.2320855076990692E-4,2.232653243272449E-4,2.2348907433600602E-4,2.2336647651074405E-4,2.2340813859831577E-4,2.2321965983456386E-4,2.2326538109796097E-4,2.2325364847537192E-4,2.2332921781121294E-4,2.233679433767198E-4,2.2332252276763845E-4,2.2328712575322486E-4,2.2325420056448962E-4,2.2371161216552603E-4,2.233103777523481E-4,2.2326532992581908E-4,2.2330918184256576E-4,2.2324248620167713E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.232773157576044E-4,2.232545139848126E-4,2.2324235876917291E-4,2.2342095801135606E-4,2.2333127123814602E-4,2.2324226544800528E-4,2.2321956888982685E-4,2.2319712169645208E-4,2.2339892722621766E-4,2.232532

{"value":"This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I have seen. It is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by Bronte. George C Scott is ridiculous and bumbling as Rochester -- when not just plain old acting angry. Susannah York has the most dated 1970's hairstyle I have ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly speak to each other, so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love, is gone. The ending is ludicrous.<br /><br />Please, rent the Timothy Dalton version instead. It is so true to the book, it's like having the novel read aloud to you. Dalton is superb as Rochester. G. C.

{"value":"Such great actors such a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and awful character, the movie is not funny at all, a subconscious message can be seen \"IT IS A DAMN CRAP!!!\", \"IT SUUCKS SO BADLY!!\", \"THROW YOUR TV THROUGH WINDOW\", and so on. It is simply disgusting and irksome. In addition to foolish plot, sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colourful that it might cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about the decoration in movie but this from \"Free Money\" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! \"Free Money\" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a viewer gets nothing!

{"value":"I have seen some pretty bad movies, and this is right up there. No plot to speak of, it's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap-opera. I just wanted to smack that little girl because, well lets just say, she's real suspicious all the way through the movie. The monsters running around wearing some bling was funny. I also saw a bit of \"Silent Hill\" in there. And I read that this was done by, and or stared a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it's no wonder that it didn't make much sense. It seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more. The FX are very good, the look of the movie, the monsters, and even the acting also good. But the story and the telling of it, just aren't there.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","some","pretti","bad","movi","and","thi","be","right","up","there","no","plot","to","speak","of","it","like","on","of","that","bad","coma","episod","on","a","soapopera","i","just","want","to","smack","that","littl","girl","becaus","good","let","just","sai","she","real","suspici","all","the","wai","through","the","movi","the","monster","run","around","wear","some","bling","be","funni","i","conjur","see","a","bite","of","silent","hill","in","there","and","i","read","that","thi","be","do","by","and","or","stare","a","finnish","metal","band","lordi","so","it","no","wonder","that","it","do","not","make","much","sens","it","seem","to","be","a","vehicl","for","promot","there","band","and","noth","much","the","fx","be","veri","good","the","look","of","the","movi","the","monster","and","even","the","act","conjur","good","but","the","stori","and","the","tell","of","it","just","be","not","there"],"filtered":["see","pretti","bad","movi","thi","right","plot","speak","like","bad","coma","episod","soapopera","want","smack","littl","girl","becaus","good","let","sai","real","suspici","wai","movi","monster","run","around","wear","bling","funni","conjur","see","bite","silent","hill","read","thi","stare","finnish","metal","band","lordi","wonder","make","much","sens","seem","vehicl","promot","band","noth","much","fx","veri","good","look","movi","monster","even","act","conjur","good","stori","tell"],"filtered2":["see","pretti","bad","right","plot","speak","like","bad","coma","soapopera","want","smack","littl","girl","becaus","good","let","real","suspici","wai","monster","run","around","wear","bling","funni","conjur","see","bite","silent","hill","read","stare","finnish","metal","band","lordi","wonder","make","sens","seem","vehicl","promot","band","noth","fx","veri","good","look","monster","even","act","conjur","good","stori","tell"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,9,14,15,16,17,21,22,32,33,35,37,39,49,62,78,80,84,90,98,121,124,137,145,154,173,175,344,413,514,927,1018,1225,1423,1476,1558,2139,2148,2798,4090,4462,5457,8332],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,9,14,15,16,17,21,22,32,33,35,37,39,49,62,78,80,84,90,98,121,124,137,145,154,173,175,344,413,514,927,1018,1225,1423,1476,1558,2139,2148,2798,4090,4462,5457,8332],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,1.6920303308087352,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.0477128419653545,2.0881990796736947,2.2190595059394194,2.2323930368088845,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,2.348499626138016,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.983093497946387,6.934834361933742,3.405285399859865,8.503560739596956,4.268777946167049,4.470719289830655,4.470719289830655,4.589376833631972,4.573751515728891,5.2288713006995975,5.170884043049248,5.339219357868463,5.822646007446338,6.948657270302562,6.2980697041614135,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164655E-4,2.232427581278421E-4,2.232978784893336E-4,2.2325298847309999E-4,2.2327411672029313E-4,2.2324152723462217E-4,2.2331095844892396E-4,2.2320831253640845E-4,2.2324280530791686E-4,2.2347350255652804E-4,2.2524669988761704E-4,2.232431740473022E-4,2.2345459944064997E-4,2.234778795547062E-4,2.2337635938917728E-4,2.2325386783430908E-4,2.2333067579914E-4,2.2343577597443482E-4,2.2326539346890378E-4,2.2326457718847362E-4,2.2346543761534018E-4,2.2328694601974757E-4,2.232872839451897E-4,2.2343032416998442E-4,2.2326547400635307E-4,2.2348055066696387E-4,2.2332134532680108E-4,2.2324225779449922E-4,2.233434662939417E-4,2.2341163393927872E-4,2.23288041278356E-4,2.2340762949082018E-4,2.235173170595689E-4,2.2372477578809865E-4,2.233209594212379E-4,2.2325373242729912E-4,2.2333422800586625E-4,2.232764059286679E-4,2.232085507699067E-4,2.2326532432724466E-4,2.234890743360058E-4,2.233664765107438E-4,2.2340813859831552E-4,2.2321965983456365E-4,2.2326538109796072E-4,2.2325364847537168E-4,2.2332921781121273E-4,2.2336794337671957E-4,2.2332252276763823E-4,2.2328712575322464E-4,2.232542005644894E-4,2.237116121655258E-4,2.2331037775234788E-4,2.2326532992581884E-4,2.2330918184256554E-4,2.232424862016769E-4,0.982355596708907,2.2327731575760417E-4,2.2325451398481235E-4,2.2324235876917267E-4,2.2342095801135584E-4,2.2333127123814577E-4,2.2324226544800504E-4,2.2321956888982664E-4,2.2319712169645184E-4,2.2339892722621741E-4,2.2325320192525592E-4,2.2335468452716256E-4,2.2342023346478724E-4,2.2331887205251033E-4,2.2326562563335225E-4,2.2321986151580686E-

{"value":"This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. Full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense ! I cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10. My guess is they are stooges of the movie maker. <br /><br />If I could give this movie a zero, I would. Too bad IMDb doesn't allow that. <br /><br />The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. Whats sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed. Take my word, don't waste your $8 on this piece of trash.

{"value":"Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching the show I thought it was good. But the plots just got worse. The storyline were either too boring or predictable. George isn't always funny, he sometimes acts stupid. His jokes are overdone. His mom is the silliest character of the show. How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was the daughter in law, but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. Don't know how these shows get to play for so long. <br /><br />If you're really bored like I was and have nothing else to watch, I'd suggest you watch this.","finished_norm":["serious","i","mean","veri","serious","when","i","start","watch","the","show","i","think","it","be","good","but","the","plot","just","get","wrong","the","storylin","be","either","too","bore","or","predict","georg","be","not","alwai","funni","he","sometim","act","stupid","hi","joke","be","overdo","hi","mom","be","the","silli","charact","of","the","show","how","can","a","mother","treat","her","own","son","that","wai","okai","if","it","be","the","daughter","in","law","but","thi","be","her","own","son","i","give","thi","show","a","just","becaus","the","few","show","be","a","littl","funni","the","actor","constanc","mari","and","masiela","lusha","do","a","great","job","do","not","know","how","thi","show","get","to","plai","for","so","long","br","br","if","you","re","realli","bore","like","i","be","and","have","noth","els","to","watch","i","have","suggest","you","watch","thi"],"filtered":["serious","mean","veri","serious","start","watch","show","think","good","plot","get","wrong","storylin","either","bore","predict","georg","alwai","funni","sometim","act","stupid","hi","joke","overdo","hi","mom","silli","charact","show","mother","treat","son","wai","okai","daughter","law","thi","son","give","thi","show","becaus","show","littl","funni","actor","constanc","mari","masiela","lusha","great","job","know","thi","show","get","plai","long","br","br","re","realli","bore","like","noth","els","watch","suggest","watch","thi"],"filtered2":["serious","mean","veri","serious","start","watch","show","think","good","plot","get","wrong","storylin","either","bore","predict","georg","alwai","funni","sometim","act","stupid","joke","overdo","mom","silli","charact","show","mother","treat","son","wai","okai","daughter","law","son","give","show","becaus","show","littl","funni","actor","constanc","mari","masiela","lusha","great","job","know","show","get","plai","long","re","realli","bore","like","noth","els","watch","suggest","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,7,10,12,13,14,15,21,22,25,26,28,30,32,33,40,41,49,51,62,68,71,88,99,108,136,191,196,197,207,214,289,337,371,385,397,426,434,500,515,646,680,849,921,1029,1121,1977],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,7,10,12,13,14,15,21,22,25,26,28,30,32,33,40,41,49,51,62,68,71,88,99,108,136,191,196,197,207,214,289,337,371,385,397,426,434,500,515,646,680,849,921,1029,1121,1977],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,2.8828493162168796,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,7.726147096759545,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,4.045224089013853,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,2.0317223413467334,2.056430207256609,4.277015007255866,2.346825985579986,2.5460113484259455,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.5531798379045583,2.7303758068497004,2.8282659991423613,2.973659465713028,6.093369201455837,3.09496984188738,3.3176717946075294,3.3909310864081816,6.820232654259061,3.3814747511661465,3.3956930001684253,3.5900195030592035,3.8095464139032247,3.880604335168946,4.3521595551061,4.280272325592784,4.403125998698128,4.900964426937307]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875901E-4,2.0127954981638384E-4,2.0132924729208143E-4,2.0128877367343184E-4,2.013078232682277E-4,2.0127844002166862E-4,2.0134104041092678E-4,2.0124849307261722E-4,2.0127959235475903E-4,2.0148759300272516E-4,2.0308633840816412E-4,2.0127992481659612E-4,2.0147054962498708E-4,2.0149153938033774E-4,2.014000070350724E-4,2.0128956652077783E-4,2.013588179164922E-4,2.0145357806076908E-4,2.0129995823319898E-4,2.0129922226057935E-4,2.0148032151161296E-4,2.01319390387539E-4,2.0131969506698947E-4,2.014486626191455E-4,2.0130003084716267E-4,2.0149394770156278E-4,2.013504054005042E-4,2.0127909870714804E-4,2.0137035004885433E-4,2.0143181118237796E-4,2.013203778917317E-4,2.0142820070206602E-4,2.0152709691999195E-4,2.0171414531445784E-4,2.0135005746134294E-4,2.012894444354648E-4,2.0136202064780008E-4,2.013098872582759E-4,2.012487078680788E-4,2.012998958938777E-4,2.015016327896791E-4,2.013910964601509E-4,2.0142865972223013E-4,2.0125872399380572E-4,2.0129994707934176E-4,2.0128936874294826E-4,2.0135750336924282E-4,2.0139241901200307E-4,2.0135146700162233E-4,2.0131955243836498E-4,2.0128986651608995E-4,2.0170227676361374E-4,2.0134051684480352E-4,2.0129990094164946E-4,2.0133943859176353E-4,2.0127930464302826E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585412E-4,2.0129014910129914E-4,2.012791897476682E-4,2.0144021792777868E-4,2.0135935477464623E-4,2.0127910560768187E-4,2.0125864199645058E-4,2.0123840321685922E-4,2.0142035458908876E-4,2.01288

{"value":"Action, violence, sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie. And everything they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is (un)known for his violent (without reason)movies (Commando, The Base). The story is weird but stupid. The actors play their stupid characters very well...I'm not telling they are stupid but I mean they are very bad actors. It's another low-budget unknown B series action movie. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than Misbegotten...don't rent it...and, by the way, don't rent any of the movies I mentioned....I give it 1and a half out of5.","finished_norm":["action","violenc","sex","and","coars","languag","be","the","thing","that","the","charact","do","dure","the","whole","movi","and","everyth","thei","do","be","do","without","reason","mark","l","lester","be","unknown","for","hi","violent","without","reasonmovi","commando","the","base","the","stori","be","weird","but","stupid","the","actor","plai","their","stupid","charact","veri","wellim","not","tell","thei","be","stupid","but","i","mean","thei","be","veri","bad","actor","it","anoth","lowbudget","unknown","b","seri","action","movi","if","you","see","someth","like","oper","delta","forc","drive","the","patriot","sanctuari","or","someth","like","thi","bad","movi","from","the","same","kind","than","misbegottendont","rend","itand","by","the","wai","do","not","rend","ani","of","the","movi","i","mentionedi","give","it","and","a","half","out","of"],"filtered":["action","violenc","sex","coars","languag","thing","charact","dure","whole","movi","everyth","thei","without","reason","mark","l","lester","unknown","hi","violent","without","reasonmovi","commando","base","stori","weird","stupid","actor","plai","stupid","charact","veri","wellim","tell","thei","stupid","mean","thei","veri","bad","actor","anoth","lowbudget","unknown","b","seri","action","movi","see","someth","like","oper","delta","forc","drive","patriot","sanctuari","someth","like","thi","bad","movi","kind","misbegottendont","rend","itand","wai","rend","ani","movi","mentionedi","give","half"],"filtered2":["action","violenc","sex","coars","languag","thing","charact","dure","whole","everyth","without","reason","mark","l","lester","unknown","violent","without","reasonmovi","commando","base","stori","weird","stupid","actor","plai","stupid","charact","veri","wellim","tell","stupid","mean","veri","bad","actor","anoth","lowbudget","unknown","b","action","see","someth","like","oper","delta","forc","drive","patriot","sanctuari","someth","like","bad","kind","misbegottendont","rend","itand","wai","rend","ani","mentionedi","give","half"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,10,15,17,27,29,30,33,40,41,53,73,88,90,95,111,122,125,129,136,193,206,239,254,334,338,453,461,533,625,642,717,966,1094,1222,1420,1512,2138,3270,4148,4290,6453,8293,8512],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,10,15,17,27,29,30,33,40,41,53,73,88,90,95,111,122,125,129,136,193,206,239,254,334,338,453,461,533,625,642,717,966,1094,1222,1420,1512,2138,3270,4148,4290,6453,8293,8512],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,3.400636547121535,1.8950689206770979,2.0317223413467334,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.1183455303375887,2.2489347673732487,4.448447326975307,4.821391668015843,7.040477956739958,2.517840471459249,2.597304642813496,2.6593400337329487,2.889652074525771,2.942840385588056,2.9720957437368454,3.41740676039221,3.358217889001879,6.849501469295936,3.6194333882654965,3.622422927113863,3.7398317812878634,4.026392148630444,4.218628162481577,4.3336974922663645,4.573751515728891,9.132058939269962,5.170884043049248,6.255510089742618,5.9370563586240825,5.999576715605417,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852442E-4,2.0810416094933746E-4,2.0815554347424268E-4,2.0811369755170686E-4,2.0813339304459242E-4,2.0810301352577532E-4,2.0816773645214096E-4,2.0807205119149439E-4,2.0810420493002447E-4,2.0831925807556954E-4,2.099722107549351E-4,2.0810454866435673E-4,2.083016368228036E-4,2.0832333825958528E-4,2.0822870240647183E-4,2.0811451728144022E-4,2.081861167241698E-4,2.0828408981847654E-4,2.0812526133664205E-4,2.0812450041003713E-4,2.0831174003631451E-4,2.0814535236018646E-4,2.081456673701388E-4,2.082790077132368E-4,2.0812533641266447E-4,2.0832582823766946E-4,2.0817741897229805E-4,2.0810369454473207E-4,2.0819803986654248E-4,2.0826158490941743E-4,2.081463733468274E-4,2.0825785201168082E-4,2.0836010141789873E-4,2.085534919000553E-4,2.0817705923586538E-4,2.0811439105668635E-4,2.081894280477105E-4,2.081355270165612E-4,2.080722732698394E-4,2.0812519688363548E-4,2.0833377389740352E-4,2.0821948970841427E-4,2.0825832659544354E-4,2.0808262900365472E-4,2.0812524980460067E-4,2.081143127977293E-4,2.0818475760570689E-4,2.0822085710288507E-4,2.0817851656820458E-4,2.0814551990552927E-4,2.081148274484332E-4,2.085412209325509E-4,2.0816719513391523E-4,2.0812520210255767E-4,2.0816608032148454E-4,2.0810390746310155E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793609E-4,2.0811511961501403E-4,2.0810378867208417E-4,2.0827027669504357E-4,2.0818667178510762E-4,2.0810370167923632E-4,2.0808254422608635E-4,2.0806161922774777E-4,2.08249739867355
