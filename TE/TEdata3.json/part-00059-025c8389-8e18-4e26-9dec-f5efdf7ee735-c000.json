{"value":"The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat down to watch this, I was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were, this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones. Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong.<br /><br />When I watched the first ten minutes of it, I was actually really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it'll improve. It didn't.<br /><br />Not only is this just a dire film by itself, it didn't need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back!? The acting in it was TERRIBLE, the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well. The way they made Springwood was just totally wrong. Pays no respect to the first one at-all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really over-the-top.<br /><br />Some people are saying that this film was \"funny\". This film is not \"funny\" at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be \"funny\"? I would call it funnily crap. This film is supposed to be a Horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, wouldn't that information have surfaced like in the first one!? The ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy, exactly like the rest of it. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. Just shows itself up.<br /><br />Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good in the beginning, yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin. They shouldn't have even bothered making this film. Nor any of the other sequels, except the third one. The third one's the only decent one out of all the sequels.<br /><br />If this was a DVD by itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have chucked it out when I got it.<br /><br />Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel.<br /><br />- a complete MOCKERY of the first film <br /><br />So please, don't waste your time on this worthless junk.","finished_norm":["the","in","the","seri","be","brilliant","easili","on","of","the","well","horror","film","of","all","time","thi","be","the","crappi","when","i","sit","down","to","watch","thi","i","be","actual","think","that","how","bad","the","and","on","be","thi","would","have","to","be","good","after","the","previou","terribl","on","boi","be","i","wrong","incredibli","wrongbr","br","when","i","watch","the","ten","minut","of","it","i","be","actual","realli","tempt","to","turn","it","off","but","i","think","no","mayb","it","will","improv","it","didntbr","br","not","onli","be","thi","just","a","dire","film","by","itself","it","do","not","ne","anoth","sequel","becaus","the","last","two","and","have","alreadi","be","terribl","enough","conjur","how","mani","time","can","you","bring","freddi","back","the","act","in","it","be","terribl","the","storylin","be","predict","and","crap","and","it","conjur","have","flaw","in","it","a","good","the","wai","thei","make","springwood","be","just","total","wrong","pai","no","respect","to","the","on","atal","to","add","to","thi","the","whole","thing","seem","realli","overthetopbr","br","some","peopl","be","sai","that","thi","film","be","funni","thi","film","be","not","funni","at","all","sinc","when","be","freddi","krueger","suppos","to","be","funni","i","would","call","it","funnili","crap","thi","film","be","suppos","to","be","a","horror","film","not","a","comedi","if","freddi","have","a","daughter","would","not","that","inform","have","surfac","like","in","the","on","the","end","be","conjur","just","plain","stupid","and","cheesi","exactli","like","the","rest","of","it","thi","on","complet","destroi","the","essenc","and","uniqu","of","the","on","just","show","itself","upbr","br","such","a","shame","that","we","craven","creat","someth","so","good","in","the","begin","yet","it","have","to","be","drag","down","becaus","of","thi","trash","that","belong","in","the","bin","thei","should","not","have","even","bother","make","thi","film","nor","ani","of","the","other","sequel","except","the","on","the","on","the","onli","decent","on","out","of","all","the","sequelsbr","br","if","thi","be","a","dvd","by","itself","and","not","part","of","the","nightmar","on","elm","street","dvd","set","that","i","get","i","would","have","chuck","it","out","when","i","get","itbr","br","summari","a","pathet","and","poor","attempt","at","a","sequelbr","br","a","complet","mockeri","of","the","film","br","br","so","pleas","do","not","wast","your","time","on","thi","worthless","junk"],"filtered":["seri","brilliant","easili","well","horror","film","time","thi","crappi","sit","watch","thi","actual","think","bad","thi","good","previou","terribl","boi","wrong","incredibli","wrongbr","br","watch","ten","minut","actual","realli","tempt","turn","think","mayb","improv","didntbr","br","onli","thi","dire","film","ne","anoth","sequel","becaus","last","two","alreadi","terribl","enough","conjur","mani","time","bring","freddi","back","act","terribl","storylin","predict","crap","conjur","flaw","good","wai","thei","make","springwood","total","wrong","pai","respect","atal","add","thi","whole","thing","seem","realli","overthetopbr","br","peopl","sai","thi","film","funni","thi","film","funni","sinc","freddi","krueger","suppos","funni","call","funnili","crap","thi","film","suppos","horror","film","comedi","freddi","daughter","inform","surfac","like","end","conjur","plain","stupid","cheesi","exactli","like","rest","thi","complet","destroi","essenc","uniqu","show","upbr","br","shame","craven","creat","someth","good","begin","yet","drag","becaus","thi","trash","belong","bin","thei","even","bother","make","thi","film","ani","sequel","except","onli","decent","sequelsbr","br","thi","dvd","part","nightmar","elm","street","dvd","set","get","chuck","get","itbr","br","summari","pathet","poor","attempt","sequelbr","br","complet","mockeri","film","br","br","pleas","wast","time","thi","worthless","junk"],"filtered2":["brilliant","easili","well","horror","time","crappi","sit","watch","actual","think","bad","good","previou","terribl","boi","wrong","incredibli","wrongbr","watch","ten","minut","actual","realli","tempt","turn","think","mayb","improv","didntbr","onli","dire","ne","anoth","sequel","becaus","last","two","alreadi","terribl","enough","conjur","mani","time","bring","freddi","back","act","terribl","storylin","predict","crap","conjur","flaw","good","wai","make","springwood","total","wrong","pai","respect","atal","add","whole","thing","seem","realli","overthetopbr","peopl","funni","funni","sinc","freddi","krueger","suppos","funni","call","funnili","crap","suppos","horror","comedi","freddi","daughter","inform","surfac","like","end","conjur","plain","stupid","cheesi","exactli","like","rest","complet","destroi","essenc","uniqu","show","upbr","shame","craven","creat","someth","good","begin","yet","drag","becaus","trash","belong","bin","even","bother","make","ani","sequel","except","onli","decent","sequelsbr","dvd","part","nightmar","

{"value":"The screenwriter poorly attempted to re-create the \"Exorcist'. But put in some blah-blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged. There is no substance whatsoever in this entire film. It had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about. Extremely boring, I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so I had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever. Nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about.<br /><br />They use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me (as it intended, I hate CGI) just ruined the movie even more. Some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how \"thought-provoking\" and \"slow-paced-without-action-because it's an intelligent film\" it was. What is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy Heath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion? Seems like an uninspired concept. Oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the \"sin-eater\" (movie was originally going to be titled \"sin-eater\"). Lame concept but the movie took the \"sin-eater\" thing too seriously, making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was. Yeah, I know there were really sin-eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy.<br /><br />Nothing in the movie was executed right and I forget why I even bothered to see this movie. If you want horror films that actually have depth, watch Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or any of the Romero \"Dead Trilogy\" films. Nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people, mainstream movie fans think that though (same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece). If you want mind-numbingly boring horror, watch the Order.

{"value":"This low budget B horror's plot comes with all the amenities - mad scientist complete with sidekick, malicious corporate greed of pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering, and information technology....can't leave that out.<br /><br />Start with strange sequence of hot looking nameless boaters that foolishly decide to take a dip in the waters near an uncharted island and end up chum for swarming hammerhead sharks.....<br /><br />Cut to weak back story implying the stock decline of a generic pharma corporation which motivates its wicked Shakespeare quoting CEO to entertain an un-solicited offer made by a former employee/scientist that was jilted out of his job as head of research and who also happens to be a nut...of course (total Herbert West wannabe). He is offering up a new stem cell technology that could make tons o' cash...or so it seems...This lures in several employees to his Moreau-ish island (must have been quite an impressive exit package from the company when he was let go for him to afford an island) to validate his scientific findings including the CEO and, co-incidentally, the ex-fiancé of the mad scientist's son now morphed sharkuman (how convenient)....<br /><br />The plan, sort of, is to rekindle lost love between the former nuptials while exacting revenge on the former colleagues for his termination. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter? He has his own friggen' island after all...).<br /><br />Soon, everyone is on the run (from endless supply of security guards toting heavy weaponry, from mutant plants  can there be an uncharted island without man-eating plants?, from sharky son's appetite for carnage, from quack daddy's breeding plans, and from lack of a cell phone signal)...and they all must learn to work together to get off the island alive! <br /><br />Will anyone escape?

{"value":"Darkman 3: Die Darkman Die is directed by Bradford May, the same guy who made the first Darkman sequel too. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2, and is nothing special, in my opinion. Larry Drake is no more as a main villain, who is now played by great Jeff Fahey, whose character once again wants to get Darkman's work and create this time some ultra strong humans in order to get the leadership of the whole city. The film is pretty much the same in plot and execution as Darkman 2, but I was mostly irritated by the presence of many scenes from Darkman 2. These sequels were made in short time and with little money, so these kind of decisions had to be made. Couple of scenes are pretty stylish and exiting, but still this is pretty tired film and often irritatingly stupid, too. The characters scream and laugh too much and it is very annoying. There is no any philosophical depth in the film, and this is like a remake of Darkman 2 which it still cannot equal. Darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larry Drake's ability to play great villain. Darkman 3 offers only some nice scenes and moments, but mostly this film is tired and full of cliches. The few positive things in this movie are flashback edits (Westlake's nightmares) and couple of truly surprising plot turns and tricks. And worth mentioning is also pretty nasty death scene of the main villain which was pretty comic book like and inventive without any gore. Far more interesting than the death of main villain in part two. <br /><br />Darkman 3 is worst in the whole series, and we must remember that these two sequels were made directly to video and they don't come even close to Raimi's original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2 was okay actioner with plenty of great scenes and suspense, but this last (?) entry is tired and often stupid and boring piece of sequel. It has some merits as mentioned, but overall feeling is that this should not been made in the first place. May is talented director so hopefully he can get some more noteworthy projects in the future.<br /><br

{"value":"I'll get to the movie in a minute. First, someone wanted \"proof\" about Clinton's comments at Georgetown, where he claimed that the USA \"deserved\" the 9-11 attacks. Well, here's what Clinton said:<br /><br />\"In the first Crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned a synagogue with 300 Jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a Muslim on the Temple Mount. I can tell you that story is still being told today in the Middle East and we are still paying for it.\"<br /><br />WE'RE still paying for it? Whaddya mean \"we\", paleface? The Marines didn't storm the Temple Mount. <br /><br />But in truth, Clinton never really came out and flatly said that we \"deserved\" 9-11. Like all his statements during his presidency, he IMPLIED that we deserved 9-11. Just point out \"fact\" A, B, C, and maybe D, and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion X. When in truth, most of Clinton's \"Facts\" added up to guacamole.<br /><br />But that's beside the point. We're here to talk movies, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver \"Captain Conspiracy\" Stone does a movie, you can't escape his warped politics. It was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the Reagan Era, and what better time than when Stone's dreams almost came true, on the day Reagan nearly bought the farm. Unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in Hinckley's assassination attempt, he invents one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of Constitutional authority, Haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands together like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to \"Release the Hounds.\" Stone even recruits the smarmiest person in Hollywood to play our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. A guy you love to hate on sight.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is OK. Average, hovering on below average. Don't bother renting or buying.

{"value":"Or \"Marlowe At Sea\". Yet another ridiculously overrated old film with Bogey. Quite talky, too. Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, calls women \"slim\" and \"dames\" and other such nonsense, is the only \"real male\" i.e. alpha male in the movie (the only other alpha male male being the head of Gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male), and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction. The character clichés are all here. Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in \"Casablanca\", and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him? It doesn't, so he can't be a cynic; Hawks wanted it both ways: a character who is both the \"cool lone cynic\" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. I don't think so... Bacall does her non-chalant \"cool babe\" routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not all-too interesting so-called \"sexual innuendo\" exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues sound silly by today's standards. \"Just purse your lips and whistle...\". A load of crap... She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older, and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (In real life she is very much like her face: a Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears; very unsuitable for her character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready.<br /><br />If you're interested in reading my \"biographies\" of Bogart, Bacall, Huston, and other Hollywood personalities, contact me by

{"value":"I didn't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do. It passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although admittedly it's no better quality than that. It's true that the acting isn't great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me. The Becks are on a trip described by John (Stewart Moss) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now that's romantic!) The work part has something to do with touring caves, which in itself sounds strange (how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work?) but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine (huh? That connection completely lost me.) Bitten by a bat while he's in the cave, he begins to transform into what I guess was supposed to be a human-bat hybrid (although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape-man of some sort) and a killing spree starts. Here's another problem. The first killing is a nurse in a hospital. At first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is of a young girl, who is described as having her throat ripped out. The sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse's (meaning throat ripped out? - How could anyone think that was an accident?) And what's with the sheriff? He seems pretty no-nonsense until the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her, after which everything seems to go back to normal. It's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most irritating theme songs I've ever heard in a movie. Even for all that, there was something here that kept me watching. Sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half.

{"value":"It seems to me, as a recent film school graduate, that in these times of New Zealand film reaching new heights, the general public seems to think every New Zealand film made is great. Sione's Wedding proves this is dead wrong.<br /><br />It's completely overrated and not funny, and far from the 'hilarious' film other users of IMDb have commented. The only really funny thing I found in this film was Derek the wannabe black guy, but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we'd all heard before.<br /><br />Being of half-Samoan decent, I wanted to see how the film was going to deal with Polynesian representation. It was a complete balls-up - I know it's a supposed comedy, but I didn't feel like the characters had anything new to say about Polynesian identity, even if it was in a tongue-in-cheek manner. I was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's relationships - Mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women, comes to slightly turn his ways when the 'Dusky Maiden' comes to town, has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women. I didn't understand why they did this.<br /><br />All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh, but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema. The jokes are lame at best, the acting, particularly of Sefa's girlfriend, APPALLING, and honestly I would've been happy if I had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save myself the $15 ticket price.<br /><br />I think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it's the second step (behind No. 2, of course, a far superior film to this one) in the birth of Polynesian cinema. I hope Pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from Sione's Wedding in how to NOT reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say. Even if it is done in a comedic

{"value":"Let me tell you something about this movie. I have seen it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me. I really liked it. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool.<br /><br />I saw it again a few days ago. It was horrible. Really. I don't know why I thought it was funny before but now... I didn't laugh at all. There was nothing even slightly entertaining. It was just dumb. The story was weak. The acting was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best.<br /><br />What is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist. Really. Don't get me wrong, usually I don't complain about racism in movies. However I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'The Shaolin Temple' or about the fact that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys or... Whatever, you get the point. There are people seeing racism everywhere. I wonder how would they react to a movie like 'The Meteor Man'. Why? I will tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good guys. In fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Don't get me wrong, I don't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green... What I do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie. This is the only movie like that that I have ever seen. It is just not realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie which is the case with 'The street Fighter' there is no problem - in Japan most of the people are Asians. But if there is only one white man in an American movie there is some sort of problem - in USA most of the people are white. It is like filming a Japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one Asian as a bad guy. Just not real.<br /><br />That is it. I am giving the movie the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I hadn't have fun with it as a kid.","finished_norm":["let","me","tell","you","someth","about","thi","movi","i","have","see","it","twice","the","time","i","be","a","kid","and","the","movi","be","quit","entertain","to","me","i","realli","like","it","i","think","it","be","funni","and","interest","and","the","main","charact","be","kind","of","coolbr","br","i","see","it","again","a","few","dai","ago","it","be","horribl","realli","i","do","not","know","why","i","think","it","be","funni","befor","but","now","i","do","not","laugh","at","all","there","be","noth","even","slightli","entertain","it","be","just","dumb","the","stori","be","weak","the","act","be","noth","special","there","be","great","actor","in","thi","movi","but","still","the","act","be","mediocr","at","bestbr","br","what","be","the","wrong","be","the","fact","that","thi","movi","be","racist","realli","do","not","get","me","wrong","usual","i","do","not","complain","about","racism","in","movi","howev","i","have","see","peopl","complain","about","the","lack","of","black","man","in","movi","like","the","shaolin","templ","or","about","the","fact","that","the","onli","black","man","in","the","street","fighter","be","on","of","the","bad","gui","or","whatev","you","get","the","point","there","be","peopl","see","racism","everywher","i","wonder","how","would","thei","react","to","a","movi","like","the","meteor","man","why","i","will","tell","you","why","there","be","no","asian","in","thi","movi","there","be","no","white","peopl","among","the","good","gui","in","fact","there","be","onli","on","white","gui","in","the","entir","movi","and","he","be","the","leader","of","the","bad","gui","all","the","good","gui","be","african","american","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","do","not","care","be","the","good","gui","be","black","or","white","or","yellow","or","pink","or","green","what","i","do","care","about","be","the","fact","that","we","can","bare","see","a","white","person","in","thi","movi","thi","be","the","onli","movi","like","that","that","i","have","ever","see","it","be","just","not","realist","if","there","be","onli","on","black","man","in","a","japanes","movi","which","be","the","case","with","the","street","fighter","there","be","no","problem","in","japan","much","of","the","peopl","be","asian","but","if","there","be","onli","on","white","man","in","a","american","movi","there","be","some","sort","of","problem","in","usa","much","of","the","peopl","be","white","it","be","like","film","a","japanes","movi","with","entir","white","cast","and","onli","on","asian","a","a","bad","gui","just","not","realbr","br","that","be","it","i","be","give","the","movi","the","rate","of","it","would","be","if","i","have","not","have","fun","with","it","a","a","kid"],"filtered":["let","tell","someth","thi","movi","see","twice","time","kid","movi","quit","entertain","realli","like","think","funni","interest","main","charact","kind","coolbr","br","see","dai","ago","horribl","realli","know","think","funni","befor","laugh","noth","even","slightli","entertain","dumb","stori","weak","act","noth","special","great","actor","thi","movi","still","act","mediocr","bestbr","br","wrong","fact","thi","movi","racist","realli","get","wrong","usual","complain","racism","movi","howev","see","peopl","complain","lack","black","man","movi","like","shaolin","templ","fact","onli","black","man","street","fighter","bad","gui","whatev","get","point","peopl","see","racism","everywher","wonder","thei","react","movi","like","meteor","man","tell","asian","thi","movi","white","peopl","among","good","gui","fact","onli","white","gui","entir","movi","leader","bad","gui","good","gui","african","american","get","wrong","care","good","gui","black","white","yellow","pink","green","care","fact","bare","see","white","person","thi","movi","thi","onli","movi","like","ever","see","realist","onli","black","man","japanes","movi","case","street","fighter","problem","japan","much","peopl","asian","onli","white","man","american","movi","sort","problem","usa","much","peopl","white","like","film","japanes","movi","entir","white","cast","onli","asian","bad","gui","realbr","br","give","movi","rate","fun","kid"],"filtered2":["let","tell","someth","see","twice","time","kid","quit","entertain","realli","like","think","funni","interest","main","charact","kind","coolbr","see","dai","ago","horribl","realli","know","think","funni","befor","laugh","noth","even","slightli","entertain","dumb","stori","weak","act","noth","special","great","actor","still","act","mediocr","bestbr","wrong","fact","racist","realli","get","wrong","usual","complain","racism","howev","see","peopl","complain","lack","black","man","like","shaolin","templ","fact","onli","black","man","street","fighter","bad","gui","whatev","get","point","peopl","see","racism","everywher","wonder","react","like","meteor","man","tell","asian","white","peopl","among","good","gui","fact","onli","white","gui","entir","leader","bad","gui","good","gui","african","american","get","wrong","care","good","gui","black","whit

{"value":"The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /><br />Like \"The Man From Planet X,\" this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing. Meaning, we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction. And yes, it's another \"classic\" released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound--by Midnite Movies.<br /><br />So, the main reason to watch this film? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on Mars. (What, you thought \"Angry Red Planet\" referred to Neptune?) Prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship, inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the \"puny female\" member of the crew. It'd be somewhat offensive by today's standards if it weren't so damn funny. But Mars is the real reason we're watching this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming bloody red. It's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness. It's really quite a sightas are the (ha ha) aliens viewers are to witness. The best being the \"ratbatspidercrab.\" You think that's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It's a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing combining traits of rats, bats, spiders, and crabs. It bounds along all puppety and scares the sh*t out of our \"heroic crew.\" There are other weird, and poorly imagined, aliens to be seen, but that one takes the cake. Eventually, after their harrowing experience on Mars, the sexist crew boards their \"ship\" and returns to whatever planet it was they came from.<br /><br />This ain't for everyone. Science Fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers, and some general film buffs.

{"value":"Slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching. Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are about to graduate from Holden University with Honors in lying, cheating and scheming. The three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now, during final exams, these big-men-on-campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school. The plot is very stupid and there's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while. Slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre. The comedy in Slackers is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie. Its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny. Though for every joke that works there's at least eight more that don't. The screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy. Even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman plays the freaky Ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film. This is directed by Dewey Nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much. The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon though, she's not in the movie very much. The film is very short at only 86 minutes long however, that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor. Slackers isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average. When compared to other films in the genre there's a lot better out there such as Not Another Teen Movie, American Pie and its sequels , Scary Movie 1 & 2 etc. So unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then Slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else. Rating 4.3/10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping.","finished_norm":["slacker","be","just","anoth","teen","movi","that","not","realli","worth","watch","dave","devon","sawa","sam","jason","segel","and","jeff","michael","c","maronna","be","about","to","graduat","from","holden","univers","with","honor","in","lie","cheat","and","scheme","the","three","roommat","have","proudli","scam","their","wai","through","the","last","four","year","of","colleg","and","now","dure","final","exam","thi","bigmenoncampu","be","about","to","be","bust","by","the","much","unlik","dude","in","school","the","plot","be","veri","stupid","and","there","no","reason","why","to","watch","thi","unless","your","look","to","shut","off","you","brain","for","a","littl","while","slacker","be","just","a","predict","teen","flick","that","realli","add","noth","new","to","the","genr","the","comedi","in","slacker","be","either","hit","or","miss","but","there","no","real","true","funni","or","origin","moment","in","the","movi","it","realli","just","a","collect","of","gag","and","some","be","actual","pretti","funni","though","for","everi","joke","that","work","there","at","littl","eight","much","that","do","not","the","screenplai","be","full","of","peni","and","breast","joke","that","some","high","school","and","colleg","student","mai","enjoi","even","if","thei","do","thei","probabl","wo","not","rememb","thi","film","after","awhil","a","it","not","a","veri","memor","comedi","jason","schwartzman","plai","the","freaki","ethan","and","after","appear","in","some","good","comedi","he","have","stoop","pretti","low","jaim","king","and","devon","sawa","be","the","other","main","star","but","thei","do","a","rather","poor","job","in","thi","film","thi","be","direct","by","dewei","nick","and","thi","be","hi","film","so","you","ca","not","blame","him","too","much","the","funni","charact","be","probabl","laura","prepon","though","she","not","in","the","movi","veri","much","the","film","be","veri","short","at","onli","minut","long","howev","that","mai","be","too","long","for","some","peopl","who","do","not","realli","like","thi","typ","of","humor","slacker","be","not","the","wrong","film","of","but","certainli","be","below","averag","when","compar","to","other","film","in","the","genr","there","a","lot","well","out","there","such","a","not","anoth","teen","movi","american","pie","and","it","sequel","scari","movi","etc","so","unless","you","have","see","much","of","them","and","you","re","look","for","someth","new","then","slacker","mai","fit","that","bill","but","it","well","if","you","just","watch","someth","els","rate","a","below","averag","teen","comedi","that","worth","skip"],"filtered":["slacker","anoth","teen","movi","realli","worth","watch","dave","devon","sawa","sam","jason","segel","jeff","michael","c","maronna","graduat","holden","univers","honor","lie","cheat","scheme","three","roommat","proudli","scam","wai","last","four","year","colleg","dure","final","exam","thi","bigmenoncampu","bust","much","unlik","dude","school","plot","veri","stupid","reason","watch","thi","unless","look","shut","brain","littl","slacker","predict","teen","flick","realli","add","noth","new","genr","comedi","slacker","either","hit","miss","real","true","funni","origin","moment","movi","realli","collect","gag","actual","pretti","funni","though","everi","joke","work","littl","eight","much","screenplai","full","peni","breast","joke","high","school","colleg","student","mai","enjoi","even","thei","thei","probabl","wo","rememb","thi","film","awhil","veri","memor","comedi","jason","schwartzman","plai","freaki","ethan","appear","good","comedi","stoop","pretti","low","jaim","king","devon","sawa","main","star","thei","rather","poor","job","thi","film","thi","direct","dewei","nick","thi","hi","film","ca","blame","much","funni","charact","probabl","laura","prepon","though","movi","veri","much","film","veri","short","onli","minut","long","howev","mai","long","peopl","realli","like","thi","typ","humor","slacker","wrong","film","certainli","averag","compar","film","genr","lot","well","anoth","teen","movi","american","pie","sequel","scari","movi","etc","unless","see","much","re","look","someth","new","slacker","mai","fit","bill","well","watch","someth","els","rate","averag","teen","comedi","worth","skip"],"filtered2":["slacker","anoth","teen","realli","worth","watch","dave","devon","sawa","sam","jason","segel","jeff","michael","c","maronna","graduat","holden","univers","honor","lie","cheat","scheme","three","roommat","proudli","scam","wai","last","four","year","colleg","dure","final","exam","bigmenoncampu","bust","unlik","dude","school","plot","veri","stupid","reason","watch","unless","look","shut","brain","littl","slacker","predict","teen","flick","realli","add","noth","new","genr","comedi","slacker","either","hit","miss","real","true","funni","origin","moment","realli","collect","gag","actual","pretti","funni","though","everi","joke","work","littl","eight","screenplai","full","peni","breast","joke","high","school","colleg","student","mai

{"value":"As has been stated countless times, \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" is NOT a remake of the (generally disregarded) mid-'80s sequel to Wes Craven's 1977 original. But wishing to give this postmodern sequel-to-a-remake the official stamp of Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (a double threat alongside his son, Jonathan) has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality--in plain English, HORRIBLE. Former music-video director Martin Weisz takes the reins from Alexandre Aja, and is clearly in way over his head--yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the Cravens' Screen writing 101 scrawl. Not only are the characters (in this case, a gang of goofball National Guards(wo)men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls (played without a lick of irony, mind you), but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren't funny. After viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise, their fate against the repulsive, roaming cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time out--as in the original '80s sequel--the script is so simplistic (barely existent, actually) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks (we're treated to a combo childbirth-murder during the opening credits, plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't ejected the DVD by the midpoint!). Even the mutants in this outing are personality-free freaks of no memorable stature--the tacky, rubbery-looking makeup FX seems, like the rest of the film, to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment. I really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja's otherwise excellent film, and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of \"Hills 2,\" setting the stage--VERY lamely setting the stage--for a third installment...yet the Cravens and Weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions work that they'd be hard-pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face.","finished_norm":["a","have","be","state","countless","time","the","hill","have","ey","be","not","a","remak","of","the","gener","disregard","mid","sequel","to","we","craven","origin","but","wish","to","give","thi","postmodern","sequeltoaremak","the","offici","stamp","of","diminish","return","craven","himself","a","doubl","threat","alongsid","hi","son","jonathan","have","decid","to","pen","a","film","that","be","of","the","same","qualityin","plain","english","horribl","former","musicvideo","director","martin","weisz","take","the","rein","from","alexandr","aja","and","be","clearli","in","wai","over","hi","headyet","on","wonder","how","anyon","can","have","creat","a","watchabl","film","from","the","craven","screen","write","scrawl","not","onli","be","the","charact","in","thi","case","a","gang","of","goofbal","nation","guardswomen","send","to","investig","the","turbul","hill","of","the","origin","remak","complet","obnoxi","and","prone","to","realli","annoi","genr","pitfal","plai","without","a","lick","of","ironi","mind","you","but","thei","be","constantli","crack","joke","that","be","not","funni","after","view","their","total","ineptitud","dure","a","train","exercis","their","fate","against","the","repuls","roam","cannib","be","painfulli","obviou","onli","thi","time","outa","in","the","origin","sequelth","script","be","so","simplist","bare","exist","actual","that","ani","potenti","subtext","be","jettison","in","favor","of","up","the","ant","in","repuls","shock","we","re","treat","to","a","combo","childbirthmurd","dure","the","open","credit","plu","a","gratuit","rape","for","that","who","have","not","eject","the","dvd","by","the","midpoint","even","the","mutant","in","thi","out","be","personalityfre","freak","of","no","memor","statureth","tacki","rubberylook","makeup","fx","seem","like","the","rest","of","the","film","to","be","try","to","hide","it","face","from","embarrass","i","realli","groan","at","the","lame","surpris","at","the","end","of","aja","otherwis","excel","film","and","the","produc","quit","liter","go","for","break","at","the","end","of","hill","set","the","stageveri","lame","set","the","stagefor","a","installmentyet","the","craven","and","weisz","have","creat","a","film","that","be","such","a","cynic","bastard","of","what","make","the","version","work","that","thei","have","be","hardpress","to","find","a","audienc","after","thi","insult","slap","in","the","face"],"filtered":["state","countless","time","hill","ey","remak","gener","disregard","mid","sequel","craven","origin","wish","give","thi","postmodern","sequeltoaremak","offici","stamp","diminish","return","craven","doubl","threat","alongsid","hi","son","jonathan","decid","pen","film","qualityin","plain","english","horribl","former","musicvideo","director","martin","weisz","take","rein","alexandr","aja","clearli","wai","hi","headyet","wonder","anyon","creat","watchabl","film","craven","screen","write","scrawl","onli","charact","thi","case","gang","goofbal","nation","guardswomen","send","investig","turbul","hill","origin","remak","complet","obnoxi","prone","realli","annoi","genr","pitfal","plai","without","lick","ironi","mind","thei","constantli","crack","joke","funni","view","total","ineptitud","dure","train","exercis","fate","repuls","roam","cannib","painfulli","obviou","onli","thi","time","outa","origin","sequelth","script","simplist","bare","exist","actual","ani","potenti","subtext","jettison","favor","ant","repuls","shock","re","treat","combo","childbirthmurd","dure","open","credit","plu","gratuit","rape","eject","dvd","midpoint","even","mutant","thi","personalityfre","freak","memor","statureth","tacki","rubberylook","makeup","fx","seem","like","rest","film","try","hide","face","embarrass","realli","groan","lame","surpris","end","aja","otherwis","excel","film","produc","quit","liter","go","break","end","hill","set","stageveri","lame","set","stagefor","installmentyet","craven","weisz","creat","film","cynic","bastard","make","version","work","thei","hardpress","find","audienc","thi","insult","slap","face"],"filtered2":["state","countless","time","hill","ey","remak","gener","disregard","mid","sequel","craven","origin","wish","give","postmodern","sequeltoaremak","offici","stamp","diminish","return","craven","doubl","threat","alongsid","son","jonathan","decid","pen","qualityin","plain","english","horribl","former","musicvideo","director","martin","weisz","take","rein","alexandr","aja","clearli","wai","headyet","wonder","anyon","creat","watchabl","craven","screen","write","scrawl","onli","charact","case","gang","goofbal","nation","guardswomen","send","investig","turbul","hill","origin","remak","complet","obnoxi","prone","realli","annoi","genr","pitfal","plai","without","lick","ironi","mind","constantli","crack","joke","funni","view","total","ineptitud","dure","train","exercis","fate","repuls","roam","cannib","painfulli","obviou","onli","time","outa","origin","sequelth","script","simplist","bare","exist","actual","ani","potenti","subtext","je

{"value":"What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this one.<br /><br />His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta, it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. Why? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character, who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film, only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham's character.<br /><br />Before anyone starts to say I'm missing the point... I'm not. I get it OK? Opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story, although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this, he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations... again, why?<br /><br />There are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out, or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply didn't care. Frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that I didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble.<br /><br />A waste of two hours of my

{"value":"Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the 'arthouse/festival crap' trashcan. It's not the greatest film of 2005, nor is it complete garbage. It just has a lot of problems. I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any 'ideological fears', or 'conservative taboos' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called 'courageous' and 'uncompromising' abroad. It was banned because the censors knew 99% of the Russian film-goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film.<br /><br />So we have a strong opening shot. Wonderful sound design, excellent premise - laden with meaning and symbolism. The usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film's strongest aspects (not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge). Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup. An amusing and well-written bar conversation among the 3 (main?) characters, and we feel pathos for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and all that. Then the movie starts slowing down. We begin to wonder what -yawn- lies ahead.<br /><br />The rest is quite boring, simply put. Sure, the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings, and there are some slightly amusing moments. Nice sound, sure. But the enjoyment of this movie, not to mention the plot, are seriously compromised by the pacing problems. And this, this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the (nicely-shot) abject misery and bleakness, is what ultimately will make people angry at the 'offensive' stuff (personally, the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing, in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear).<br /><br />If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time (the entire film), watch Particulars of the National Hunt. Much more rewarding post-Soviet stuff.

{"value":"Well I'll start with the good points. The movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning sign came with an actual \"warning\" on the film. When it started the following \"warning\" was displayed: \"The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic.\" I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then. The first words of the film were: \"I'm at the glue factory.\" It was some guy talking on his phone, and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I don't know why. So the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts imitating him. The budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. That's what is looked like they were doing. The script was horrible, and the big \"twist\" was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer. Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes. Without any more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare himself to an \"army of one\" because soldiers are really just murderers. Then they tried to make an attempt at \"Satanic Worship\" by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting. The great \"computer hacker\" was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone address. I'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason.

{"value":"I guess I only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is \"Entrails of a Virgin\". You already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid-80's production from Japan. Now, there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in Japan, but Kazuo Komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls. Not even attempting to tell a story, \"Entrails of a Virgin\" simply presents a hodgepodge of UN-arousing semi-pornographic sex and truly poor gore-effects that wouldn't even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80's horror. Images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly under-aged girl. He dumps her not even a minute after climaxing (typical) and she begs him to stay, even if she has to share him with other women. I don't get it. Is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy? Because it's really clichéd and wrongful. Anyways, back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models. Surprised by upcoming fog on their way home, the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex-demon who kills them all. The acting performances are amateurish, the dialogs inane and primitive and Komizu's direction is weak and uninspired. I can tolerate all that, including the woman-unfriendly portrayal of sex, but I came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably mean-spirited wrestling sequence. One of the males brutally hits, kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony. This sequence is, in my humble opinion, the absolute low-point of Asian exploitation cinema. One to avoid and maybe even

{"value":"It is not obvious from viewing this film (so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don't swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own.<br /><br />One specific, for instance, is researching the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am not a Christian, nor a member of _any_ faith. But I am an intelligent and discerning human. While the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation of how SOME Muslims view their obligation to Islam; I remind you that there is more to Islam than the views of the fundamentalists. Just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, so, too, there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among Jews and Muslims.<br /><br />When you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand. One grain will not be enough, you'll need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a definite bias. Be your own brain.","finished_norm":["it","be","not","obviou","from","view","thi","film","so","i","recommend","viewer","research","the","peopl","who","present","their","case","in","it","but","thi","present","on","the","realiti","of","islam","and","it","encourag","of","violenc","and","intoler","against","all","nonmuslim","be","lack","object","and","conjur","complet","fail","to","factor","in","the","human","condit","it","be","on","thing","to","docum","that","the","koran","sai","mani","thing","about","how","a","devout","muslim","be","requir","to","interact","with","nonmuslim","but","ani","realist","be","abl","to","realiz","that","not","everi","human","who","feel","himself","or","herself","to","be","a","follow","of","islam","will","agre","with","and","compli","with","all","tenet","of","that","faith","and","system","there","be","reason","to","call","much","about","the","present","into","question","such","that","viewer","ne","to","see","the","present","with","a","healthi","skeptic","do","not","swallow","it","all","hook","line","and","sinker","without","some","think","of","your","ownbr","br","on","specif","for","instanc","be","research","the","person","walid","shoebat","who","claim","to","be","a","former","muslim","who","perpetr","a","act","of","terror","in","bethlehem","there","be","mani","wise","peopl","in","the","world","who","believ","neither","of","thi","assert","i","be","not","nor","have","i","ever","be","a","muslim","i","have","never","read","the","koran","i","be","not","a","christian","nor","a","member","of","ani","faith","but","i","be","a","intellig","and","discern","human","while","the","film","be","quit","disturb","in","it","present","of","how","some","muslim","view","their","oblig","to","islam","i","remind","you","that","there","be","much","to","islam","than","the","view","of","the","fundamentalist","just","a","their","be","fundamentalist","and","evangel","christian","so","too","there","be","variat","in","the","intens","of","belief","and","oblig","among","jew","and","muslimsbr","br","when","you","watch","thi","film","you","ne","to","have","the","salt","shaker","on","hand","on","grain","will","not","be","enough","you","will","ne","much","pleas","us","your","own","mind","and","think","for","yourself","research","what","be","present","and","evalu","the","state","of","the","world","and","how","islam","fit","within","it","base","on","much","than","what","be","sai","in","minut","of","video","there","be","a","common","thread","of","polit","affili","among","that","who","put","thi","film","togeth","indic","a","definit","bia","be","your","own","brain"],"filtered":["obviou","view","thi","film","recommend","viewer","research","peopl","present","case","thi","present","realiti","islam","encourag","violenc","intoler","nonmuslim","lack","object","conjur","complet","fail","factor","human","condit","thing","docum","koran","sai","mani","thing","devout","muslim","requir","interact","nonmuslim","ani","realist","abl","realiz","everi","human","feel","follow","islam","agre","compli","tenet","faith","system","reason","call","much","present","question","viewer","ne","see","present","healthi","skeptic","swallow","hook","line","sinker","without","think","ownbr","br","specif","instanc","research","person","walid","shoebat","claim","former","muslim","perpetr","act","terror","bethlehem","mani","wise","peopl","world","believ","neither","thi","assert","ever","muslim","never","read","koran","christian","member","ani","faith","intellig","discern","human","film","quit","disturb","present","muslim","view","oblig","islam","remind","much","islam","view","fundamentalist","fundamentalist","evangel","christian","variat","intens","belief","oblig","among","jew","muslimsbr","br","watch","thi","film","ne","salt","shaker","hand","grain","enough","ne","much","pleas","us","mind","think","research","present","evalu","state","world","islam","fit","within","base","much","sai","minut","video","common","thread","polit","affili","among","put","thi","film","togeth","indic","definit","bia","brain"],"filtered2":["obviou","view","recommend","viewer","research","peopl","present","case","present","realiti","islam","encourag","violenc","intoler","nonmuslim","lack","object","conjur","complet","fail","factor","human","condit","thing","docum","koran","mani","thing","devout","muslim","requir","interact","nonmuslim","ani","realist","abl","realiz","everi","human","feel","follow","islam","agre","compli","tenet","faith","system","reason","call","present","question","viewer","ne","see","present","healthi","skeptic","swallow","hook","line","sinker","without","think","ownbr","specif","instanc","research","person","walid","shoebat","claim","former","muslim","perpetr","act","terror","bethlehem","mani","wise","peopl","world","believ","neither","assert","ever","muslim","never","read","koran","christian","member","ani","faith","intellig","discern","human","quit","disturb","present","muslim","view","oblig","islam","remind","islam","view","fundamentalist","fundamentalist","evangel","christian

{"value":"Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who \"took one\" for Reagan during the attempt on his life. Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Troubles arise as we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraph test, he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series).<br /><br />As the presidential assassination plot unfolds, Pete finds himself on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady, and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service? <br /><br />The one, big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Isn't that what the movie's supposed to be about? One would think so! But the audience is never let in on why the assassin(s) want to kill the Prez. Hmm. Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere? <br /><br />And what's with David Breckinridge's (Kiefer's) new partner, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? Seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a$$-candy. What was her purpose again?

{"value":"This is one of the very worst films Clark Gable made. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of making.<br /><br />Gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going' to the slammer (like the gangster talk?). She holds out hope that he'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there--unknown to either of them, gosh, that she's \"in the family way\". Eventually, the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten about Gable's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow. Leonard Maltin says \"the stars are at their best here\". By what standard? Best at producing unintended chuckles? Gimme a break!<br /><br />PS--after saying this, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin is going to find me and kick my butt. Hmmm. However, despite my comment, I think Mr. Maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet (I hope that appeased him).<br /><br />UPDATE--2/2/08. Because I disliked this film so much the first time (especially the ridiculous ending), I decided to watch it once again. After all, sometimes when I watch a film again I like it much more and realize that I was a bit too harsh. While that has been the case with several films in recent months, I still disliked this film--even the second time. Most of it was not because of the first half of the film. In the first half, Harlow's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable. But when she was sent to prison, it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred. The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb--it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons. I stand by my original review (despite all the \"NOT HELPFULS\") and think that aside from PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, it might just be the worst Gable film.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","veri","wrong","film","clark","gabl","make","onli","parnel","be","obvious","wrong","it","be","just","so","painfulli","clichéd","and","the","dialog","be","so","lousi","that","it","be","someth","neither","gabl","nor","jean","harlow","should","have","be","proud","of","makingbr","br","gabl","be","a","heel","whose","illeg","activ","result","in","hi","girl","go","to","the","slammer","like","the","gangster","talk","she","hold","out","hope","that","he","will","do","the","right","thing","but","he","just","leav","her","thereunknown","to","either","of","them","gosh","that","she","in","the","famili","wai","eventu","the","rogu","return","to","do","the","right","thing","and","somehow","thei","tie","thi","all","togeth","into","a","happi","end","thei","seem","to","have","forget","about","gabl","ne","to","take","the","rap","and","spend","sever","year","in","the","hoosegow","leonard","maltin","sai","the","star","be","at","their","well","here","by","what","standard","well","at","produc","unintend","chuckl","gimm","a","breakbr","br","psafter","sai","thi","my","wife","think","leonard","maltin","be","go","to","find","me","and","kick","my","butt","hmmm","howev","despit","my","comment","i","think","mr","maltin","be","the","fine","review","and","human","be","on","the","planet","i","hope","that","appeas","himbr","br","updat","becaus","i","dislik","thi","film","so","much","the","time","especi","the","ridicul","end","i","decid","to","watch","it","onc","again","after","all","sometim","when","i","watch","a","film","again","i","like","it","much","much","and","realiz","that","i","be","a","bite","too","harsh","while","that","have","be","the","case","with","sever","film","in","recent","month","i","still","dislik","thi","filmeven","the","time","much","of","it","be","not","becaus","of","the","half","of","the","film","in","the","half","harlow","charact","be","amazingli","stupid","but","at","littl","it","be","believ","but","when","she","be","send","to","prison","it","be","all","cliché","until","the","final","ridicul","marriag","scene","occur","the","bottom","line","be","that","thi","sequenc","be","embarrassingli","dumbit","just","make","no","sens","at","all","and","be","akin","to","turn","the","movi","into","some","wacki","fairi","tale","instead","of","a","love","stori","about","two","con","i","stand","by","my","origin","review","despit","all","the","not","help","and","think","that","asid","from","parnel","and","possibli","polli","at","the","circu","it","mai","just","be","the","wrong","gabl","film"],"filtered":["thi","veri","wrong","film","clark","gabl","make","onli","parnel","obvious","wrong","painfulli","clichéd","dialog","lousi","someth","neither","gabl","jean","harlow","proud","makingbr","br","gabl","heel","whose","illeg","activ","result","hi","girl","go","slammer","like","gangster","talk","hold","hope","right","thing","leav","thereunknown","either","gosh","famili","wai","eventu","rogu","return","right","thing","somehow","thei","tie","thi","togeth","happi","end","thei","seem","forget","gabl","ne","take","rap","spend","sever","year","hoosegow","leonard","maltin","sai","star","well","standard","well","produc","unintend","chuckl","gimm","breakbr","br","psafter","sai","thi","wife","think","leonard","maltin","go","find","kick","butt","hmmm","howev","despit","comment","think","mr","maltin","fine","review","human","planet","hope","appeas","himbr","br","updat","becaus","dislik","thi","film","much","time","especi","ridicul","end","decid","watch","onc","sometim","watch","film","like","much","much","realiz","bite","harsh","case","sever","film","recent","month","still","dislik","thi","filmeven","time","much","becaus","half","film","half","harlow","charact","amazingli","stupid","littl","believ","send","prison","cliché","final","ridicul","marriag","scene","occur","bottom","line","thi","sequenc","embarrassingli","dumbit","make","sens","akin","turn","movi","wacki","fairi","tale","instead","love","stori","two","con","stand","origin","review","despit","help","think","asid","parnel","possibli","polli","circu","mai","wrong","gabl","film"],"filtered2":["veri","wrong","clark","gabl","make","onli","parnel","obvious","wrong","painfulli","clichéd","dialog","lousi","someth","neither","gabl","jean","harlow","proud","makingbr","gabl","heel","whose","illeg","activ","result","girl","go","slammer","like","gangster","talk","hold","hope","right","thing","leav","thereunknown","either","gosh","famili","wai","eventu","rogu","return","right","thing","somehow","tie","togeth","happi","end","seem","forget","gabl","ne","take","rap","spend","sever","year","hoosegow","leonard","maltin","star","well","standard","well","produc","unintend","chuckl","gimm","breakbr","psafter","wife","think","leonard","maltin","go","find","kick","butt","hmmm","howev","despit","comment","think","mr","maltin","fine","review","human","planet","hope","appeas","himbr","updat","becaus","dislik","time","especi","ridicul","end","decid","watch","onc","sometim","w

{"value":"Ignoring (if possible) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance. That's a far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot's overburdened with \"wow\" symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere. A gross example is the giant peach float, obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory. It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free, but nevertheless irrelevant, prop! The peach is given a cursory, unexplained wash-down at one stage but that's where it ends.<br /><br />Similarly, the contrived \"black spot\" road sign where Steph's parents were killed, is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past, but her escape to what? She's had a pretty good deal where she was, especially considering her visual disability and the unending, loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.<br /><br />The Guinness' prize for corny melodrama, however, goes to the characterization of Alan. Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but \"rats\" on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss! hiss! As a supervisor, Alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work. He implements redundancies until, surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic, unemployed failure. No cliché-free zones here, mate! Not only this, but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic, don't ask about detail. What's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why doesn't the hotel, where the couple makes love, eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and, among other pandemoniums, the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion.

{"value":"I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. I never go by other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? I swear, I'm amazed there weren't any GROUP HUG ^-^ moments.<br /><br />I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English. The clichéd, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gonna happen.<br /><br />And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, \"I have to get my mom's shawl!!!\" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mom's shawl (that didn't match the dress By the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they take her BACK to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God.<br /><br />My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not just the, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was the, \"HE stole the bellhop's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel\" and \"It's the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!\" moments. Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable. Disney movies aren't even this predictable.<br /><br />I'm gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn't buy it for $15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would've been better if only one thing would've happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. Oh, how lovely that would've been.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money. Go see a GOOD movie.","finished_norm":["i","wish","i","can","give","thi","movi","a","zero","out","of","ten","befor","go","to","thi","movi","the","dai","after","it","come","out","i","come","on","imdb","to","check","out","the","comment","a","comment","call","the","movi","predict","and","cheesi","with","terribl","dialog","i","never","go","by","other","peopl","opinion","so","i","wast","seven","dollar","for","thi","crap","movi","it","have","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","the","person","who","write","the","script","should","be","push","off","a","cliff","sinc","when","do","scari","movi","have","sappi","scene","i","swear","i","be","amaz","there","be","not","ani","group","hug","momentsbr","br","i","think","i","jump","onc","and","that","becaus","i","zone","out","think","about","my","research","paper","for","english","the","clichéd","birdscat","pop","out","of","nowher","thing","when","you","think","someth","be","gonna","happenbr","br","and","the","charact","be","stupid","my","friend","and","i","almost","die","laugh","when","the","alarm","go","off","and","the","main","charact","sai","i","have","to","get","my","mom","shawl","you","idiot","screw","the","shawl","safeti","be","just","a","few","step","awai","but","no","my","mom","shawl","that","do","not","match","the","dress","by","the","wai","be","wayyyi","much","import","than","my","health","and","safeti","and","to","top","it","all","off","thei","take","her","back","to","her","hous","know","that","the","killer","know","where","she","live","godbr","br","my","friend","and","i","conjur","predict","the","entir","movi","and","not","just","the","i","bet","he","hide","under","the","bed","moment","it","be","the","he","steal","the","bellhop","cloth","and","sneak","out","of","the","hotel","and","it","the","detect","come","down","the","hallwai","not","the","killer","moment","movi","should","never","be","thi","predict","disnei","movi","be","not","even","thi","predictablebr","br","i","be","gonna","complet","my","rant","now","by","sai","thi","be","a","terribl","movi","i","be","glad","i","go","to","see","it","in","theater","so","i","would","not","bui","it","for","and","then","hate","it","it","be","just","bad","it","would","have","be","well","if","onli","on","thing","would","have","happen","if","after","be","shoot","by","the","detect","the","killer","would","have","fall","down","in","the","same","posit","he","get","shoot","in","knife","in","hand","fall","and","stab","the","girl","on","hi","wai","down","oh","how","love","that","would","have","beenbr","br","do","not","wast","your","time","or","monei","go","see","a","good","movi"],"filtered":["wish","give","thi","movi","zero","ten","befor","go","thi","movi","dai","come","come","imdb","check","comment","comment","call","movi","predict","cheesi","terribl","dialog","never","go","peopl","opinion","wast","seven","dollar","thi","crap","movi","wrong","movi","ever","seenbr","br","person","write","script","push","cliff","sinc","scari","movi","sappi","scene","swear","amaz","ani","group","hug","momentsbr","br","think","jump","onc","becaus","zone","think","research","paper","english","clichéd","birdscat","pop","nowher","thing","think","someth","gonna","happenbr","br","charact","stupid","friend","almost","die","laugh","alarm","go","main","charact","sai","get","mom","shawl","idiot","screw","shawl","safeti","step","awai","mom","shawl","match","dress","wai","wayyyi","much","import","health","safeti","top","thei","take","back","hous","know","killer","know","live","godbr","br","friend","conjur","predict","entir","movi","bet","hide","bed","moment","steal","bellhop","cloth","sneak","hotel","detect","come","hallwai","killer","moment","movi","never","thi","predict","disnei","movi","even","thi","predictablebr","br","gonna","complet","rant","sai","thi","terribl","movi","glad","go","see","theater","bui","hate","bad","well","onli","thing","happen","shoot","detect","killer","fall","posit","get","shoot","knife","hand","fall","stab","girl","hi","wai","oh","love","beenbr","br","wast","time","monei","go","see","good","movi"],"filtered2":["wish","give","zero","ten","befor","go","dai","come","come","imdb","check","comment","comment","call","predict","cheesi","terribl","dialog","never","go","peopl","opinion","wast","seven","dollar","crap","wrong","ever","seenbr","person","write","script","push","cliff","sinc","scari","sappi","scene","swear","amaz","ani","group","hug","momentsbr","think","jump","onc","becaus","zone","think","research","paper","english","clichéd","birdscat","pop","nowher","thing","think","someth","gonna","happenbr","charact","stupid","friend","almost","die","laugh","alarm","go","main","charact","get","mom","shawl","idiot","screw","shawl","safeti","step","awai","mom","shawl","match","dress","wai","wayyyi","import","health","safeti","top","take","back","hous","know","killer","know","live","godbr","friend","conjur","predict","entir","bet","hide","bed","moment","steal","bellhop","cloth","sneak","hotel","detect","come","hallwai","killer

{"value":"The question, when one sees a movie this bad, is not necessarily, \"How did a movie this bad get made?\" or even, \"Why did I see this awful in the first place?\" but, \"What have I learned from this experience?\" Here's what I learned:<br /><br />- Just because the \"rules\" of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them, without a shred of humor or irony.<br /><br />- If your movie has to be described as **loosely** based on the video game, you have script problems.<br /><br />- The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character does always know kung-fu.<br /><br />- While you may be proud that you figured out how to do the \"the Matrix effect\" on a budget, that doesn't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea.<br /><br />- Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee choice roles.<br /><br />- Whenever a scene doesn't edit together, just use some footage from the video game, no one will notice.<br /><br />- If your cousin's rap-metal band offers to write your movie's theme for free, politely decline.<br /><br />- Zombie movies are not about people killing zombies. They're about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible. That's what makes them SCARY.<br /><br />- White people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.<br /><br />- If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, \"What was that?\" or, \"Where are we?\"<br /><br />- Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.<br /><br />- A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from \"student film\" to \"major studio release\".

{"value":"I suppose many people comment/review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- I'm writing due to the latter.<br /><br />I was excited for the sequel to \"Wargames\" .. I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, I felt it was worth watching more than once. This being 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this film. Computers, Gaming, Terror, Military over-zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film, and \"Wargames: The Dead Code\" had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick.<br /><br />The movie failed on pretty much every level, but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects. \"The Dead Code\" was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands -- none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen. Until finally he \"wins\" by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody is near the gas). Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (the real life war machine) that he is a high level terror threat.<br /><br />Even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - The government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity. They say things like \"He has expert knowledge of bio-terror\" ... He displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio-Terror. So then a movie-long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles ensues. They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter.. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him.. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.<br /><br />Ugh...

{"value":"I was very disappointed by this movie. I thought that \"Scary Movie\" although not a great movie was very good and funny. \"Scary Movie 2\" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.<br /><br />The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great.<br /><br />Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy.<br /><br />Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.<br /><br />Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.<br /><br />Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \"Scary Movie\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny.<br /><br />The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.<br /><br />Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.<br /><br />But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor. That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.","finished_norm":["i","be","veri","disappoint","by","thi","movi","i","think","that","scari","movi","although","not","a","great","movi","be","veri","good","and","funni","scari","movi","on","the","other","hand","be","bore","not","funni","and","at","time","plain","stupidbr","br","the","exorcistamityvil","spoof","be","probabl","the","well","part","of","the","movi","jame","wood","be","greatbr","br","now","i","will","admit","that","i","be","at","a","disadvantag","sinc","i","have","not","see","a","few","of","the","movi","that","thi","parodi","unlik","the","where","i","have","basic","see","them","all","but","bad","comedi","be","still","bad","comedybr","br","someth","that","realli","hurt","thi","movi","be","the","time","which","ruin","some","of","what","mai","have","be","good","joke","scene","and","joke","drag","out","wai","to","longbr","br","conjur","the","same","joke","keep","get","repeat","again","and","again","for","exampl","the","talk","bird","okai","it","be","funni","the","and","mayb","even","the","time","but","it","keep","get","repeat","to","the","point","of","annoi","the","routin","between","the","wheelchair","gui","and","hanson","chri","elliott","be","amus","at","but","it","keep","get","repeat","and","end","up","stupid","and","even","tastelessbr","br","some","joke","even","get","repeat","from","the","movi","for","exampl","the","cream","i","guess","you","would","call","it","of","cindi","anna","fari","be","funni","in","scari","movi","becaus","cindi","have","be","hold","out","on","give","her","boyfriend","sex","for","so","long","that","essenti","he","have","blue","ball","from","hell","and","it","be","funni","when","he","cream","her","but","thi","time","around","it","be","out","of","place","and","not","funnybr","br","the","bathroom","and","sexual","humor","in","gener","be","much","amus","and","good","time","the","time","around","the","scat","humor","be","excess","though","and","rather","unneccessari","in","the","filmbr","br","toru","spell","be","annoi","and","realli","have","no","place","in","thi","moviebr","br","but","i","do","enjoi","shorti","marlon","wayan","who","in","my","opinion","be","the","funni","charact","in","the","film","the","scene","with","him","and","the","pot","plant","be","on","of","my","favorit","from","the","filmbr","br","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","love","the","wayan","famili","and","their","humor","that","be","why","thi","film","be","so","disappoint","thei","have","a","lot","much","comic","abil","than","endless","scat","joke"],"filtered":["veri","disappoint","thi","movi","think","scari","movi","although","great","movi","veri","good","funni","scari","movi","hand","bore","funni","time","plain","stupidbr","br","exorcistamityvil","spoof","probabl","well","part","movi","jame","wood","greatbr","br","admit","disadvantag","sinc","see","movi","thi","parodi","unlik","basic","see","bad","comedi","still","bad","comedybr","br","someth","realli","hurt","thi","movi","time","ruin","mai","good","joke","scene","joke","drag","wai","longbr","br","conjur","joke","keep","get","repeat","exampl","talk","bird","okai","funni","mayb","even","time","keep","get","repeat","point","annoi","routin","wheelchair","gui","hanson","chri","elliott","amus","keep","get","repeat","end","stupid","even","tastelessbr","br","joke","even","get","repeat","movi","exampl","cream","guess","call","cindi","anna","fari","funni","scari","movi","becaus","cindi","hold","give","boyfriend","sex","long","essenti","blue","ball","hell","funni","cream","thi","time","around","place","funnybr","br","bathroom","sexual","humor","gener","much","amus","good","time","time","around","scat","humor","excess","though","rather","unneccessari","filmbr","br","toru","spell","annoi","realli","place","thi","moviebr","br","enjoi","shorti","marlon","wayan","opinion","funni","charact","film","scene","pot","plant","favorit","filmbr","br","get","wrong","love","wayan","famili","humor","thi","film","disappoint","thei","lot","much","comic","abil","endless","scat","joke"],"filtered2":["veri","disappoint","think","scari","although","great","veri","good","funni","scari","hand","bore","funni","time","plain","stupidbr","exorcistamityvil","spoof","probabl","well","part","jame","wood","greatbr","admit","disadvantag","sinc","see","parodi","unlik","basic","see","bad","comedi","still","bad","comedybr","someth","realli","hurt","time","ruin","mai","good","joke","scene","joke","drag","wai","longbr","conjur","joke","keep","get","repeat","exampl","talk","bird","okai","funni","mayb","even","time","keep","get","repeat","point","annoi","routin","wheelchair","gui","hanson","chri","elliott","amus","keep","get","repeat","end","stupid","even","tastelessbr","joke","even","get","repeat","exampl","cream","guess","call","cindi","anna","fari","funni","scari","becaus","cindi","hold","give","boyfriend","sex","long","essenti","blue","ball","hell","funni","cream","time","around","place","funnybr","bathroom","sexual","humor","gener","amus","good","time","time","around","scat","humor","excess","

{"value":"Baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies. The script, the music, just about everything in this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />The sound FX do not sound real, they stick out way too much (technical gadgets etc.) If they are trying to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps, because those gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that. Natural sounds like footsteps and such are non-existent, which gives it a void-like atmosphere.<br /><br />Directing seems to be OK for such a low budget film (I sure hope it was a low budget production), although it does seem fairly amateurish at times.<br /><br />Most characters seem empty and false, they simply haven't casted this movie very well. I'd imagine it would've been a better idea to make Baldwin speak some Spanish than to make Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive, that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used. I mean, could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? It's should've a long ago buried corpse in movie production. The production team ever heard of subtitles? This movie again manages to depict European police as lazy and corrupt, the societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean if the plot again goes like \"The Interpol can't do jack, so let's call one American to bring down this international syndicate\" or whatever.<br /><br />Sony Pictures treads on the same path as Columbia before it, just producing movies for the hell of it. I'd imagine them to have some self respect also. Are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because Sony puts out something good a few times a year?! Maybe they should've used the same team as who were making Di Que Si - Say I Do. It's spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat.

{"value":"A complete waste of time<br /><br />Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and dialogues are poorly written, the direction is lacklustre and the acting borders on hammy.This movie was clearly aiming for the Rang De Basanti crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made RDB connect with its audience_great script, terrific acting, good direction and a powerful social message that was never preached but shown.<br /><br />Compared to that near-masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes such as the hero taking a leak on the villain's Persian rug and the hero's mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less! All of this might have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a downturn in movie quality and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but movie-making has become_should have become_more subtle and thoughtful of late.<br /><br />Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it! He resorts to sermonizing without a care as to the audience's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say. Maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khans.<br /><br />Even if you don't agree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that Rang De Basanti was much much better and Mr.Santoshi should have left the industry-bashing to Om Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? That's right!!Santoshi has depicted the industry as a place of back-biting, bitching and the casting couch which the hero happily indulges in with a starlet curiously named Sania.

{"value":"In Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase \"nonfiction novel\" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script, which he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, Richard Brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story. This is the first problem with the TV remake --color changes the tone of the story. In addition, the confinement of shooting a film for TV makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment, and execution) so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it's just another version of Law and Order spin-offs. <br /><br />Hollywood's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age. Usually, that's a mistake, and this is no exception.<br /><br />All of the actors are competent. The script is OK. The directing doesn't get in the way. It's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument. It doesn't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward Smith and Hickock that the original film provokes. At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling: \"Ho hum, who cares?\"<br /><br />See the original first, on as large a screen as you can, then watch the TV version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967.<br /><br />Wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about Capote and the original book.

{"value":"One of the more 'literate' Lone Stars, with time spent on character development and interaction, dialog and acting business. The opening scene sets the stage (literally) for the personalities of the gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his buddy, John Scott (John Wayne) the rodeo (say Roh-Day-oh) star, both of whom are slightly randy. The film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky Mary Kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he'd been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent). And oh, of course, they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end.<br /><br />The high point is Scott continually and deliberately ogling Mary's butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. It all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. <br /><br />Sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are sorely missing here. No Yakima Canutt. Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. No George Hayes. Tedious Stooge-like bi-play between Scott and Charlie, with Charlie swinging at Scott, Scott stomping on his foot and then punching him (repeated two more times!). The skilled Paul Fix is underused. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. The villain looks too old and fat. So does Chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. Mary Kornman, of the twenties \"Our Gang\" (see 'Mary, Queen of Tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but that's about it for this one. Seeds of a better western lie buried here.<br /><br />P.S. The ultra-short colorized version, which looks good, moves along so fast, it's over if you blink more than once. Thankfully though, the embarrassing scenes with Eddy Chandler have been

{"value":"The first Home Alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting. This one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. The new score is quite bad(though the new \"setting traps\" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. It (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it's still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). The fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that isn't the first time in the series). It's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I could follow it, but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. I recommend this to huge fans of the series only.

{"value":"I saw this not too long ago, and I must say: This movie is terrible. I watch crappy movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings. \"Everyone picks on me. The only girl that thinks I'm not trailer-trash likes one of the guys that pick on me. I want to kill everybody. Wah.\" OK, I'm exaggerating. But the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies.<br /><br />Adding to what I just said, the kid's mom is promiscuous, he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on, mom's boyfriend tells him to leave, kid refuses, insisting that he isn't going to leave his own house. Boyfriend chases kid into corn field. He kills kid right in front of mom, mom screams in terror, boyfriend is like, \"OMG! I didn't mean to!\" Then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it. Kid was killed under a scarecrow, though. So, like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow, he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance. His victims \"haven't been stalked like this before...\" (Scarecrow's official tag line)<br /><br />To make matters worse, this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days. That's right, 8 days. I was going to give this movie a 2, because in spite of itself, it has one or two redeeming moments. (They're spoilers, so I won't spoil it for you, if you actually want to see this crap.) I could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting, the horrible special effects, the abysmal script, and the bad camera work, but I simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level.<br /><br />This movie isn't nearly as good as I'm making it out to be. If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you enjoy watching bad movies, like I do, then watch this at your own risk. Everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all

{"value":"This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time. For one, it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters. The plot, about mistaken identity, payroll robbery and murder, is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western, but Wayne's strapping good looks, easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. Plump, balding Eddy Chandler isn't quite believable as Wayne's womanizing \"partner\", and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. On the other hand, Wayne's love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little \"Mary\" of the early \"Little Rascals\" fame. She is a grown-up 20-year-old now, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's leading ladies in these Lone Star/Monogram \"B's\" were fairly bland and colorless, but Mary is perky, cute and, yes, sexy. There's a scene in the general store, where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of \"nerve tonic\", which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. Wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. Wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. Anyway, it's an interesting little \"B\", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final gunfight isn't handled all that well, and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while, but all in all, it's worth a look, if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.","finished_norm":["thi","earli","john","wayn","lone","star","western","have","a","bite","much","go","for","it","than","the","runofthemil","oater","wayn","have","be","make","for","lone","star","up","until","that","time","for","on","it","have","hi","old","friend","paul","fix","in","it","fix","be","a","much","well","actor","then","the","standard","lone","star","villain","bring","a","much","ne","profession","to","the","surround","instead","of","the","usual","hesit","lineread","often","deliv","in","thi","oater","the","plot","about","mistak","ident","payrol","robberi","and","murder","be","a","trite","and","perfunctori","a","you","have","expect","it","to","be","in","a","lowbudget","western","but","wayn","strap","good","look","easygo","charm","and","wai","with","a","line","go","a","long","wai","to","make","thi","much","enjoy","plump","bald","eddi","chandler","be","not","quit","believ","a","wayn","woman","partner","and","there","a","run","gag","about","someth","that","happen","whenev","chandler","and","wayn","be","about","to","get","into","a","fistfight","that","grow","tiresom","on","the","other","hand","wayn","love","interest","be","plai","by","none","other","than","mari","kornman","the","littl","mari","of","the","earli","littl","rascal","fame","she","be","a","grownup","yearold","now","blond","and","cute","a","a","button","much","of","wayn","lead","ladi","in","thi","lone","starmonogram","b","be","fairli","bland","and","colorless","but","mari","be","perki","cute","and","ye","sexi","there","a","scene","in","the","gener","store","where","she","work","in","which","wayn","ask","her","to","get","him","a","bottl","of","nerv","tonic","which","happen","to","be","on","the","top","shelf","so","she","have","to","get","a","ladder","and","climb","up","to","the","top","shelf","wayn","ogl","her","pert","littl","backsid","a","she","ascend","the","step","then","again","a","she","come","down","then","again","a","few","minut","late","when","he","ask","her","to","climb","up","and","get","him","anoth","bottl","be","surprisingli","raci","for","a","film","make","in","wayn","make","no","attempt","to","hide","the","fact","that","he","be","definit","check","out","her","butt","anywai","it","a","interest","littl","b","not","great","but","not","a","choppi","and","random","a","mani","of","hi","lonestar","product","of","the","time","the","final","gunfight","be","not","handl","all","that","good","and","chandler","get","somewhat","irrit","after","a","while","but","all","in","all","it","worth","a","look","if","onli","to","see","a","cute","and","sexi","mari","kornman"],"filtered":["thi","earli","john","wayn","lone","star","western","bite","much","go","runofthemil","oater","wayn","make","lone","star","time","hi","old","friend","paul","fix","fix","much","well","actor","standard","lone","star","villain","bring","much","ne","profession","surround","instead","usual","hesit","lineread","often","deliv","thi","oater","plot","mistak","ident","payrol","robberi","murder","trite","perfunctori","expect","lowbudget","western","wayn","strap","good","look","easygo","charm","wai","line","go","long","wai","make","thi","much","enjoy","plump","bald","eddi","chandler","quit","believ","wayn","woman","partner","run","gag","someth","happen","whenev","chandler","wayn","get","fistfight","grow","tiresom","hand","wayn","love","interest","plai","none","mari","kornman","littl","mari","earli","littl","rascal","fame","grownup","yearold","blond","cute","button","much","wayn","lead","ladi","thi","lone","starmonogram","b","fairli","bland","colorless","mari","perki","cute","ye","sexi","scene","gener","store","work","wayn","ask","get","bottl","nerv","tonic","happen","top","shelf","get","ladder","climb","top","shelf","wayn","ogl","pert","littl","backsid","ascend","step","come","minut","late","ask","climb","get","anoth","bottl","surprisingli","raci","film","make","wayn","make","attempt","hide","fact","definit","check","butt","anywai","interest","littl","b","great","choppi","random","mani","hi","lonestar","product","time","final","gunfight","handl","good","chandler","get","somewhat","irrit","worth","look","onli","see","cute","sexi","mari","kornman"],"filtered2":["earli","john","wayn","lone","star","western","bite","go","runofthemil","oater","wayn","make","lone","star","time","old","friend","paul","fix","fix","well","actor","standard","lone","star","villain","bring","ne","profession","surround","instead","usual","hesit","lineread","often","deliv","oater","plot","mistak","ident","payrol","robberi","murder","trite","perfunctori","expect","lowbudget","western","wayn","strap","good","look","easygo","charm","wai","line","go","long","wai","make","enjoy","plump","bald","eddi","chandler","quit","believ","wayn","woman","partner","run","gag","someth","happen","whenev","chandler","wayn","get","fistfight","grow","tiresom","hand","wayn","love","interest","plai","none","mari","kornman","littl","mari","earli","littl","rascal","fame","grownup","yearold","blond","cute","button","wayn","lead","ladi"

{"value":"Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour. The opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black & white placard. The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds.<br /><br />Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can't blame it on the subtitles). Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.<br /><br />It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don't even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera). People flit on & off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It's as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie. With bad songs.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try watching the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do, too.
