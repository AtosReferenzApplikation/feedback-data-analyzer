{"value":"OK this movie was really \"unique\" shall we say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the movie, even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie. but she said that she can't remember to much of it. well thats her excuse but whats everyone else's??? i can't imagine they all had a coke problem.whatever it wasn't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was OK and it had some pretty funny moments. although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste. oh well i guess i was disappointed cause Carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her.","finished_norm":["okai","thi","movi","be","realli","uniqu","shall","we","sai","carri","fisher","be","by","far","the","much","talent","in","the","movi","even","though","it","be","sai","she","have","a","coke","problem","dure","the","movi","but","she","sai","that","she","ca","not","rememb","to","much","of","it","good","that","her","excus","but","what","everyon","els","i","ca","not","imagin","thei","all","have","a","coke","problemwhatev","it","be","not","all","that","bad","i","mean","i","guess","the","plot","be","okai","and","it","have","some","pretti","funni","moment","although","the","part","where","the","gui","get","that","thing","shove","in","hi","head","be","a","littl","too","violent","for","my","tast","oh","good","i","guess","i","be","disappoint","caus","carri","fisher","be","like","so","awesom","and","thi","movi","do","noth","for","her"],"filtered":["okai","thi","movi","realli","uniqu","shall","sai","carri","fisher","far","much","talent","movi","even","though","sai","coke","problem","dure","movi","sai","ca","rememb","much","good","excus","everyon","els","ca","imagin","thei","coke","problemwhatev","bad","mean","guess","plot","okai","pretti","funni","moment","although","part","gui","get","thing","shove","hi","head","littl","violent","tast","oh","good","guess","disappoint","caus","carri","fisher","like","awesom","thi","movi","noth"],"filtered2":["okai","realli","uniqu","shall","carri","fisher","far","talent","even","though","coke","problem","dure","ca","rememb","good","excus","everyon","els","ca","imagin","coke","problemwhatev","bad","mean","guess","plot","okai","pretti","funni","moment","although","part","gui","get","thing","shove","head","littl","violent","tast","oh","good","guess","disappoint","caus","carri","fisher","like","awesom","noth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,9,13,14,29,32,49,55,61,62,78,81,86,88,101,167,187,188,191,196,208,234,237,239,243,246,276,290,340,453,617,621,872,966,1301,1679,2859,3109,4720,5263],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,9,13,14,29,32,49,55,61,62,78,81,86,88,101,167,187,188,191,196,208,234,237,239,243,246,276,290,340,453,617,621,872,966,1301,1679,2859,3109,4720,5263],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.6920303308087352,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,3.899514464849456,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.4609576687888097,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,5.092022696851891,2.478925055209576,2.6289494000279396,2.673149229007135,2.640097787510554,2.6593400337329487,5.255682733347156,2.673149229007135,2.7884729505849193,2.8612813773965557,2.948928684455311,3.2872346624216657,3.5119855004467477,7.0893719235153645,3.857614816944247,4.026392148630444,4.3773181147422555,4.706176101378222,5.390512652256013,5.463272006538442,12.429376190444724,12.778082964734281]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.864131131832704E-5,8.804358223346065E-5,8.87280371314432E-5,8.821536558764629E-5,8.821681089709204E-5,8.809350142454514E-5,8.835550384082354E-5,8.805625993400826E-5,8.825424250665394E-5,9.791326445185729E-5,0.7419049035408081,8.791411771621392E-5,8.955499112703331E-5,9.083251275391854E-5,8.797822377374132E-5,8.773508992226007E-5,8.992353199277825E-5,8.836378208459811E-5,8.808963379490659E-5,8.816264443925238E-5,8.901566973263274E-5,8.845132823240847E-5,8.855204348823613E-5,8.8647448383176E-5,8.932777200716546E-5,8.886061290726039E-5,9.259614426352896E-5,8.79402537773296E-5,8.794260638506344E-5,8.816540848102317E-5,9.003934359854181E-5,8.835866215798789E-5,9.484553881226072E-5,8.860720203585175E-5,8.803597278878916E-5,8.844231683712018E-5,8.79477585440519E-5,8.799972919862261E-5,8.773464913407462E-5,8.775741154976834E-5,8.795494281774515E-5,8.888268109333072E-5,8.843103083938127E-5,8.808139926336671E-5,8.915168062340411E-5,8.811520538572257E-5,9.104283609764999E-5,8.970402465536964E-5,8.777922406405579E-5,8.797322151730532E-5,8.794270908967698E-5,9.041774750381507E-5,8.797453039112801E-5,8.774962069697584E-5,8.871279836350718E-5,8.799719029474607E-5,9.463130702063368E-5,8.792466917581126E-5,8.777820894768683E-5,8.81973241325082E-5,8.907216746337808E-5,0.10721620447051201,8.776196978279242E-5,8.796631008804463E-5,8.773571030018636E-5,8.976573278748685E-5,8.849151225947283E-5,0.14404024769158985,8.82257874068377E-5,8.854738442622061E-5,8.773250956233024E-5,8.822763701914175E-5,8.965863072215146E-5,8.788973109264828E-5,9.006495614373661E-5,8.812210261251773E-5,8.881179037473448E-5,8.826901178160541E-5,8.770500283665672E-5,8.781371921130338E-5]}}
{"value":"I very much looked forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. But, if another one is made, I beg them to take better care at editing. This story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.","finished_norm":["i","veri","much","look","forward","to","thi","movi","it","a","good","famili","movi","howev","if","michael","landon","jr","edit","team","do","a","well","job","of","edit","the","movi","would","be","much","well","too","mani","scene","out","of","context","i","do","hope","there","be","anoth","movi","from","the","seri","thei","re","all","veri","good","but","if","anoth","on","be","make","i","beg","them","to","take","well","care","at","edit","thi","stori","be","all","over","the","place","and","do","not","seem","to","have","a","center","which","be","unfortun","becaus","the","other","movi","of","the","seri","be","great","i","enjoi","the","stori","of","willi","and","missi","thei","re","both","great","role","model","plu","the","romant","side","of","the","viewer","alwai","enjoi","a","good","love","stori"],"filtered":["veri","much","look","forward","thi","movi","good","famili","movi","howev","michael","landon","jr","edit","team","well","job","edit","movi","much","well","mani","scene","context","hope","anoth","movi","seri","thei","re","veri","good","anoth","make","beg","take","well","care","edit","thi","stori","place","seem","center","unfortun","becaus","movi","seri","great","enjoi","stori","willi","missi","thei","re","great","role","model","plu","romant","side","viewer","alwai","enjoi","good","love","stori"],"filtered2":["veri","look","forward","good","famili","howev","michael","landon","jr","edit","team","well","job","edit","well","mani","scene","context","hope","anoth","re","veri","good","anoth","make","beg","take","well","care","edit","stori","place","seem","center","unfortun","becaus","great","enjoi","stori","willi","missi","re","great","role","model","plu","romant","side","viewer","alwai","enjoi","good","love","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,15,16,17,19,20,22,31,35,50,51,54,68,73,113,128,164,181,182,197,200,205,227,279,289,348,425,466,699,723,749,864,1102,1315,1472,1845,1968,2795],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,15,16,17,19,20,22,31,35,50,51,54,68,73,113,128,164,181,182,197,200,205,227,279,289,348,425,466,699,723,749,864,1102,1315,1472,1845,1968,2795],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,3.83116108203179,1.312380678011735,3.4960351200691706,1.2979240167361772,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.717994385570355,3.4279798616619646,1.8113893252729412,4.012839573363895,3.7901378413541957,2.1521782565202803,2.3409902041158843,2.3930275298746078,2.4442286541160034,2.7365296724240786,2.558331832813986,5.061642365863941,2.571852579609833,2.6005321873043625,2.7910771187233068,2.8282659991423613,9.03095086967113,3.226987993365636,3.4446025032006995,3.5813614403160887,3.865219416329466,3.7165362186843414,3.9782428047328615,4.390138803171316,4.4637506205145625,4.550761997504193,4.9227044135737135,4.85885294158718,5.482320201509136]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.903165430274467E-5,9.836386070607044E-5,9.912854592828484E-5,9.855578013385944E-5,9.855739485935551E-5,9.841963131687288E-5,9.871234509027577E-5,9.83780244592834E-5,9.859921412131136E-5,1.093904457485699E-4,0.9646911769945569,9.821922063784755E-5,1.0005243368442886E-4,1.0147970363606167E-4,9.829084106892361E-5,9.801920759271388E-5,1.0046417411414586E-4,9.87215936918987E-5,9.841531033204495E-5,9.849687912636598E-5,9.944989420149469E-5,9.88194018099934E-5,9.893192269049254E-5,9.90385107410748E-5,9.97985804302851E-5,9.927666195008528E-5,1.0345006422052941E-4,9.824842031157471E-5,9.825104868690382E-5,9.849996716314087E-5,1.0059356090610154E-4,9.87158736185539E-5,1.0596312793797044E-4,9.899354680387795E-5,9.835535929873638E-5,9.880933411842044E-5,9.825680477083659E-5,9.831486731324246E-5,9.801871513628975E-5,9.804414571316807E-5,9.8264831169569E-5,9.93013169212438E-5,9.879672520041236E-5,9.840611056651041E-5,9.960184799500195E-5,9.844387936948353E-5,1.0171468062769722E-4,1.002189366009383E-4,9.806851504324975E-5,9.828525245879662E-5,9.825116343033024E-5,1.0101632049952919E-4,9.828671475598071E-5,9.8035441633445E-5,9.911152090489793E-5,9.831203080453936E-5,1.0572378435862202E-4,9.823100891674023E-5,9.806738093713338E-5,0.027569920418182334,9.951301447416268E-5,9.852910520633166E-5,9.80492382524182E-5,9.82775308867316E-5,9.801990069000023E-5,1.0028787802696878E-4,9.886429612188414E-5,9.865370069613777E-5,9.856742357617792E-5,9.892671750329446E-5,9.80163247685685E-5,9.856948999603977E-5,1.0016822168895146E-4,9.819197546696001E-5,1.0062217569850274E-4,9.84515850743007E-5,9.92221165457881E-5,9.861571461876049E-5,9.798559376394562E-5,9.810705363712363E-5]}}
{"value":"The plot doesn't offer any new excitements, it even starts the same as cube I. This time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery, except for having an extra exit, which is not guarded, very ingenious. The characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode, they just became \"flat\" as in a soap opera. <br /><br />If somebody makes it to the normal exit, the person would be asked some questions, like \"do you believe in god?\", its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps. Really there is nothing much else to say about it.","finished_norm":["the","plot","doe","not","offer","ani","new","excit","it","even","start","the","same","a","cube","i","thi","time","there","be","no","other","enhanc","for","the","cube","machineri","except","for","have","a","extra","exit","which","be","not","guard","veri","ingeni","the","charact","be","conjur","not","so","good","elabor","a","in","the","episod","thei","just","becom","flat","a","in","a","soap","opu","br","br","if","somebodi","make","it","to","the","normal","exit","the","person","would","be","ask","some","question","like","do","you","believ","in","god","it","not","realli","creativ","or","origin","and","especi","in","my","opinion","it","doe","not","fit","into","the","mysteri","of","the","cube","with","it","trap","realli","there","be","noth","much","els","to","sai","about","it"],"filtered":["plot","doe","offer","ani","new","excit","even","start","cube","thi","time","enhanc","cube","machineri","except","extra","exit","guard","veri","ingeni","charact","conjur","good","elabor","episod","thei","becom","flat","soap","opu","br","br","somebodi","make","normal","exit","person","ask","question","like","believ","god","realli","creativ","origin","especi","opinion","doe","fit","mysteri","cube","trap","realli","noth","much","els","sai"],"filtered2":["plot","doe","offer","ani","new","excit","even","start","cube","time","enhanc","cube","machineri","except","extra","exit","guard","veri","ingeni","charact","conjur","good","elabor","becom","flat","soap","opu","somebodi","make","normal","exit","person","ask","question","like","believ","god","realli","creativ","origin","especi","opinion","doe","fit","mysteri","cube","trap","realli","noth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,10,13,15,18,27,32,39,49,69,71,87,91,115,153,196,233,267,306,352,378,403,507,524,538,594,676,700,1001,1082,1128,1154,1200,1343,1591,2368,2533,3022,3090,6052],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,10,13,15,18,27,32,39,49,69,71,87,91,115,153,196,233,267,306,352,378,403,507,524,538,594,676,700,1001,1082,1128,1154,1200,1343,1591,2368,2533,3022,3090,6052],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,2.430631986809635,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.6920303308087352,2.127032521151058,1.9214926742550966,2.115024371522662,2.0105926690411424,2.201553588425805,2.3409902041158843,2.478925055209576,2.6102777977348763,2.7085302779237206,2.8739486825973213,3.1236456418640466,3.130944944345658,3.189397019426827,3.365138331846453,3.4028786598293,3.43462735814388,3.490764544963862,3.6105180246075443,3.616452760127359,4.035401218572811,4.165705761027235,4.251780369798478,4.291900363587903,4.499089986959872,4.520909034354511,4.733083554298147,17.55013494490336,5.170884043049248,11.043081829324834,5.426230734858092,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.372612530879674E-5,8.316154047226929E-5,8.380804215082535E-5,8.33237983904409E-5,8.332516355706541E-5,8.320869162996194E-5,8.345616593748608E-5,8.317351519070352E-5,8.336051957319468E-5,0.13853806570318977,0.4841183311373725,8.303925479945118E-5,8.458914131135945E-5,8.579582399944797E-5,8.309980615779376E-5,8.287015414776397E-5,8.493724648092268E-5,8.346398515028086E-5,8.320503846149063E-5,8.327400064477127E-5,8.40797254421928E-5,8.354667683921074E-5,8.36418074053601E-5,8.373192207164841E-5,0.10335091055543102,8.393326656203828E-5,8.746166163853595E-5,8.306394160851913E-5,8.306616376348274E-5,8.327661141963705E-5,8.504663630009571E-5,8.345914912506232E-5,8.958632661759635E-5,8.3693907395769E-5,8.315435297347645E-5,8.353816512836291E-5,8.307103023378495E-5,8.312011910072804E-5,8.28697378014092E-5,8.289123803465663E-5,8.307781613745161E-5,8.395411106089308E-5,8.352750494241946E-5,8.319726053707464E-5,8.420819449025538E-5,8.32291921002981E-5,0.028953213856944788,8.472991088801756E-5,8.291184103880188E-5,8.30950812779047E-5,8.306626077309616E-5,8.540405760083065E-5,8.309631757430039E-5,8.288387918687487E-5,8.379364837692028E-5,8.311772097979603E-5,0.23876556832307128,8.304922117760261E-5,8.291088221092527E-5,8.330675733913898E-5,8.413309035764467E-5,8.330124612328432E-5,8.289554351235868E-5,8.308855308936894E-5,8.28707401255572E-5,8.478819728659826E-5,8.358463265050645E-5,8.340658514509371E-5,8.333364231678392E-5,8.363740668966297E-5,8.286771686952865E-5,8.333538936755785E-5,8.468703406135107E-5,8.301622042112183E-5,8.507082862235001E-5,8.323570687389911E-5,8.388715125287416E-5,8.337446988763515E-5,8.284173539964373E-5,8.294442342029019E-5]}}

{"value":"This very unfunny failed TV Pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th Annivesery DVD Special Edition \"Blazing Saddles\". Imagine the movie without the satire, humor, or writing skills.

What the hell was Lou Gossett Jr. thinking when he signed onto this disaster??

{"value":"This is the biggest load of crap that I have seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching \"28 Days later\" and \"Magnolia\". There is absolutely no point to this movie, except to see some really sick and twisted sex/rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieving herself on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialog having to use the \"F\" word at least a couple of times in it. It has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget. My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crud.

{"value":"This is probably one of the worst French movies I have seen so far, among more than 100 french movies I have ever seen. Terrible screenplay and very medioacre/unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless. with all that it doesn't matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story.<br /><br />One of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do NOT attract people, as an audience I don't care what happens to them. <br /><br />It amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes, man, I love almost all the awarded movies in cannes, but not this one. A major disappointment for me.","finished_norm":["thi","be","probabl","on","of","the","wrong","french","movi","i","have","see","so","far","among","much","than","french","movi","i","have","ever","see","terribl","screenplai","and","veri","medioacreunprofession","act","caus","the","direct","powerless","with","all","that","it","doe","not","matt","how","nice","western","french","scene","and","fanci","music","can","add","to","the","storybr","br","on","of","the","kei","weak","of","thi","movi","be","that","thi","two","charact","do","not","attract","peopl","a","a","audienc","i","do","not","care","what","happen","to","them","br","br","it","amaz","me","how","thi","movi","win","juri","prize","in","cann","man","i","love","almost","all","the","award","movi","in","cann","but","not","thi","on","a","major","disappoint","for","me"],"filtered":["thi","probabl","wrong","french","movi","see","far","among","much","french","movi","ever","see","terribl","screenplai","veri","medioacreunprofession","act","caus","direct","powerless","doe","matt","nice","western","french","scene","fanci","music","add","storybr","br","kei","weak","thi","movi","thi","two","charact","attract","peopl","audienc","care","happen","br","br","amaz","thi","movi","win","juri","prize","cann","man","love","almost","award","movi","cann","thi","major","disappoint"],"filtered2":["probabl","wrong","french","see","far","among","french","ever","see","terribl","screenplai","veri","medioacreunprofession","act","caus","direct","powerless","doe","matt","nice","western","french","scene","fanci","music","add","storybr","kei","weak","two","charact","attract","peopl","audienc","care","happen","amaz","win","juri","prize","cann","man","love","almost","award","cann","major","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,15,18,19,21,23,25,44,45,47,54,94,101,102,118,131,148,166,168,187,205,262,299,379,404,408,453,489,648,685,703,770,826,899,1004,1236,1930,2462,3218,4633,5706,8139],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,15,18,19,21,23,25,44,45,47,54,94,101,102,118,131,148,166,168,187,205,262,299,379,404,408,453,489,648,685,703,770,826,899,1004,1236,1930,2462,3218,4633,5706,8139],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.354379525480895,2.2512118082053005,2.3018654096236517,2.4423870329693536,2.4894767118610357,2.4732161909892554,2.571852579609833,2.726701583487816,2.7949961309240425,3.1272886331425473,3.1419947805322432,3.130944944345658,3.2872346624216657,3.3956930001684253,3.6105180246075443,3.607563812710113,3.6746621462132825,4.0536665665501035,3.8204358137024927,12.591365871781843,4.176068548062782,4.396611317676934,4.848596441419991,5.129498826886393,5.5623629091826725,12.429376190444724,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.592037318472096E-5,8.534099202179287E-5,8.600443685793231E-5,8.550750230553123E-5,8.55089032496858E-5,8.538937889088663E-5,8.564333886786731E-5,8.535328056700928E-5,8.554518585668509E-5,9.490771398029254E-5,0.15542034695939463,8.521550155385439E-5,0.8378666573004516,8.804431339125525E-5,8.527763980862789E-5,8.504196920603394E-5,8.716323474910346E-5,8.56513630022562E-5,8.538562998220126E-5,8.545639948815E-5,8.628324027438389E-5,8.573622182912687E-5,8.583384552441528E-5,8.592632186591983E-5,8.658576224185965E-5,8.613294308109229E-5,8.97538083796798E-5,8.524083534112851E-5,8.524311573309747E-5,8.545907868475612E-5,8.727549139601376E-5,8.564640023716974E-5,9.193415540063763E-5,8.588731092248958E-5,8.53336161570163E-5,8.572748704807986E-5,8.524810974115549E-5,8.529848510190948E-5,8.504154194830472E-5,8.506360564774579E-5,8.525507348602347E-5,8.615433386101728E-5,8.571654748589301E-5,8.537764821825413E-5,8.64150761680373E-5,8.541041662618427E-5,8.824818063908926E-5,8.695046541992238E-5,8.508474860400176E-5,8.527279110170608E-5,8.524321528508506E-5,8.764227979605079E-5,8.527405979827234E-5,8.505605394336096E-5,8.598966585998039E-5,8.529602413235356E-5,9.172649967882046E-5,8.522572912531924E-5,8.508376464769572E-5,8.549001465180402E-5,8.633800374795542E-5,8.548435900105955E-5,8.506802396102057E-5,8.526609182602428E-5,8.504257054080831E-5,8.701027935612422E-5,8.577517236528303E-5,8.559245868955458E-5,8.551760421603856E-5,8.582932947720083E-5,8.503946805296182E-5,8.551939705255063E-5,8.690646490115273E-5,8.519186350330761E-5,8.730031773723794E-5,8.541710213536016E-5,8.608561920747105E-5,8.555950177323264E-5,8.501280567511779E-5,8.511818488648106E-5]}}

{"value":"After being hugely entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as a cad in \"The Tailor of Panama\" (which I rate 10/10 across the board: casting, acting, script, story, editing, pace, music, emotional impact, etc.), I enthusiastically anticipated this film. I was hugely disappointed. It is a script reading not a film, vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, bankrupt in every way that \"The Tailor of Panama\" is rich and satisfying. Blame it on the screen writing and directing. I sat in the theater waiting for the \"good part;\" it never came. I neither laughed nor cried, although one line of dialog did make me smile. Worth $7? Hardly.","finished_norm":["after","be","huge","entertain","by","mr","brosnan","perform","a","a","cad","in","the","tailor","of","panama","which","i","rate","across","the","board","cast","act","script","stori","edit","pace","music","emot","impact","etc","i","enthusiast","anticip","thi","film","i","be","huge","disappoint","it","be","a","script","read","not","a","film","vulgar","for","the","sake","of","be","vulgar","bankrupt","in","everi","wai","that","the","tailor","of","panama","be","rich","and","satisfi","blame","it","on","the","screen","write","and","direct","i","sit","in","the","theater","wait","for","the","good","part","it","never","come","i","neither","laugh","nor","cry","although","on","line","of","dialog","do","make","me","smile","worth","hardli"],"filtered":["huge","entertain","mr","brosnan","perform","cad","tailor","panama","rate","across","board","cast","act","script","stori","edit","pace","music","emot","impact","etc","enthusiast","anticip","thi","film","huge","disappoint","script","read","film","vulgar","sake","vulgar","bankrupt","everi","wai","tailor","panama","rich","satisfi","blame","screen","write","direct","sit","theater","wait","good","part","never","come","neither","laugh","cry","although","line","dialog","make","smile","worth","hardli"],"filtered2":["huge","entertain","mr","brosnan","perform","cad","tailor","panama","rate","across","board","cast","act","script","stori","edit","pace","music","emot","impact","etc","enthusiast","anticip","huge","disappoint","script","read","vulgar","sake","vulgar","bankrupt","everi","wai","tailor","panama","rich","satisfi","blame","screen","write","direct","sit","theater","wait","good","part","never","come","neither","laugh","cry","although","line","dialog","make","smile","worth","hardli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,17,21,33,34,42,61,65,77,85,92,102,105,107,118,133,145,187,192,195,202,219,237,244,331,348,357,424,429,432,444,503,506,546,665,718,856,898,937,1270,1303,1333,1685,1796,2261,2753,3059,6296,7129,7628],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,17,21,33,34,42,61,65,77,85,92,102,105,107,118,133,145,187,192,195,202,219,237,244,331,348,357,424,429,432,444,503,506,546,665,718,856,898,937,1270,1303,1333,1685,1796,2261,2753,3059,6296,7129,7628],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,3.8927804517536475,2.011190219103739,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1439533986393955,2.354379525480895,2.3212364753796515,2.34599021453259,2.4732161909892554,2.5318267134339894,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,2.5792094178355414,2.640097787510554,2.634508058031767,2.932274249550174,3.0103169565570433,3.2829611516442836,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.235085203598255,6.507094532875981,3.3490645070153917,3.449627639403373,3.4572130107926293,3.5929222627171646,3.634471265630037,3.900174431363043,3.892300374932137,4.030886538218284,4.3521595551061,4.390138803171316,4.436351646326448,4.662879295624898,4.77960356993304,5.051537285416681,10.781025304512026,5.426230734858092,13.086384324388797,6.948657270302562,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.952303318767161E-5,6.90542231217288E-5,6.95910538599048E-5,6.918895600932394E-5,6.919008959247009E-5,6.909337567404162E-5,6.929886905417406E-5,6.906416647864451E-5,6.921944790176332E-5,7.679519890622729E-5,0.7392618935953386,6.895268168698121E-5,0.07303305352532129,7.124163332864227E-5,6.900296126315989E-5,6.8812266850203E-5,7.05287027696982E-5,6.930536183511463E-5,6.909034222000401E-5,6.914760582965072E-5,6.981664947193882E-5,6.937402591114364E-5,6.945301876412914E-5,6.952784660205848E-5,7.006143710501392E-5,6.969503551275872E-5,7.262488240460803E-5,6.897318068702211E-5,6.897502588113224E-5,6.914977371914722E-5,7.061953597141047E-5,6.9301346181213E-5,7.438912448922747E-5,6.949628064145734E-5,6.904825489239455E-5,6.936695810580121E-5,6.89790668154891E-5,6.901982836886378E-5,6.881192113181064E-5,6.882977411884536E-5,6.898470157529776E-5,6.971234400255588E-5,6.93581062873467E-5,6.908388372338412E-5,6.992332534949916E-5,6.911039849546428E-5,7.140659384861781E-5,7.035653907224576E-5,6.884688208049618E-5,6.899903790016988E-5,6.897510643427557E-5,7.091632520967185E-5,6.900006447431302E-5,6.882366360773944E-5,6.957910181008515E-5,6.901783705921545E-5,7.422109850069427E-5,6.896095739347578E-5,6.884608590580112E-5,6.917480575967549E-5,6.986096169556477E-5,6.917022945280169E-5,6.883334922599457E-5,6.899361713733685E-5,6.881275342417756E-5,7.040493791081581E-5,0.026552764393955992,6.925769902436254E-5,6.919713003643099E-5,6.944936457492197E-5,6.881024302579914E-5,6.919858072184714E-5,7.032093576405108E-5,6.893355480

{"value":"As I was watching this movie I was thinking,OK it'll get good any moment...I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete waste of 92 minutes. All seriousness aside the best part was when the Wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good. And the tail end was really kind of dumb as well. There was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down. The worse part is there was more talk of the Wendigo then there was Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad,you definitely couldn't tell it by this movie.","finished_norm":["a","i","be","watch","thi","movi","i","be","thinkingok","it","will","get","good","ani","momenti","be","wrong","the","real","well","part","of","thi","movi","be","when","it","be","over","a","complet","wast","of","minut","all","serious","asid","the","well","part","be","when","the","wendigo","final","show","up","which","be","at","the","end","and","you","can","not","realli","even","see","him","that","good","and","the","tail","end","be","realli","kind","of","dumb","a","good","there","be","too","mani","section","in","the","movi","where","you","think","someth","be","go","to","happen","but","be","a","let","down","the","wrong","part","be","there","be","much","talk","of","the","wendigo","then","there","be","wendigo","for","the","creatur","to","be","so","badyou","definit","can","not","tell","it","by","thi","movi"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","thinkingok","get","good","ani","momenti","wrong","real","well","part","thi","movi","complet","wast","minut","serious","asid","well","part","wendigo","final","show","end","realli","even","see","good","tail","end","realli","kind","dumb","good","mani","section","movi","think","someth","go","happen","let","wrong","part","much","talk","wendigo","wendigo","creatur","badyou","definit","tell","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["watch","thinkingok","get","good","ani","momenti","wrong","real","well","part","complet","wast","minut","serious","asid","well","part","wendigo","final","show","end","realli","even","see","good","tail","end","realli","kind","dumb","good","mani","section","think","someth","go","happen","let","wrong","part","talk","wendigo","wendigo","creatur","badyou","definit","tell"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13,20,24,25,27,28,50,53,59,61,80,89,90,94,103,122,124,156,186,371,392,420,761,936,1879,3361,5296],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13,20,24,25,27,28,50,53,59,61,80,89,90,94,103,122,124,156,186,371,392,420,761,936,1879,3361,5296],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,2.330690080046114,2.6420723132238515,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,5.645555114217758,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,2.3451551414151686,2.571852579609833,3.0466846007279185,3.0670934723591254,3.3023374306074227,3.9405024767500145,3.965503778955432,4.869215728622727,5.719991853386255,21.10700594187658]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.2284254041087934E-4,1.220141844426472E-4,1.229627283801675E-4,1.2225224842562108E-4,1.2225425139107085E-4,1.2208336437869366E-4,1.2244645740981823E-4,1.2203175368794239E-4,1.2230612555608338E-4,1.3569196987616043E-4,0.6305767474420839,1.2183476753246024E-4,1.2410875305094888E-4,1.2587919168438518E-4,1.2192360817397683E-4,1.2158666392606763E-4,1.2461949116526617E-4,1.224579297186129E-4,1.2207800446870247E-4,1.2217918542930742E-4,1.23361340707869E-4,1.2257925453928924E-4,1.2271882961664306E-4,1.2285104539151985E-4,1.2379386405055658E-4,1.2314645699221206E-4,1.283233001002816E-4,1.2187098789174907E-4,1.2187424822608211E-4,1.221830159447621E-4,1.247799873453144E-4,1.2245083432728618E-4,1.3144059762942433E-4,1.2279527045459666E-4,1.22003638981387E-4,1.2256676620091297E-4,1.2188138828627899E-4,1.2195341121937115E-4,1.2158605306483738E-4,1.2161759809647237E-4,1.2189134452923568E-4,1.231770399337189E-4,1.22551125630927E-4,1.220665927380048E-4,0.0534084404445957,1.2211344256332746E-4,1.2617066586800705E-4,1.243152894497786E-4,1.2164782671818349E-4,1.2191667585450585E-4,1.2187439055808794E-4,1.2530439403936962E-4,1.2191848974221876E-4,1.2160680123285692E-4,1.2294160990912784E-4,1.2194989270867435E-4,1.3114370696829986E-4,1.2184939015122233E-4,1.2164641993085464E-4,1.222272458828009E-4,1.2343963743733955E-4,1.2221915985524568E-4,1.2162391507121174E-4,1.2190709772986367E-4,1.215875236696719E-4,0.30654091343888895,1.22634943110398E-4,1.223737127262371E-4,1.2226669138371967E-4,1.2271237290920715E-4,1.2158308796397683E-4,1.222692546476293E-4,1.242523807902289E-4,1.2180097161105189E-4,1.248154821960936E-4,1.2212300100564635E-4,1.2307879684779883E-4,1.2232659338567753E-4,1.2154496808499639E-4,1.2169563142071688E-4]}}

refund.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","like","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","in","my","life","surpass","the","previou","much","godaw","movi","spawn","of","slithi","which","i","see","when","i","be","about","br","br","bad","act","stilt","and","ridicul","dialog","incomprehens","plot","mishmash","cut","scene","even","the","music","be","annoi","do","i","leav","anyth","out","good","the","special","effect","be","not","bad","but","cgi","doe","not","a","decent","movi","makebr","br","i","ca","not","believ","i","actual","spend","monei","to","see","thi","movi","if","anyon","have","the","contact","info","for","hyungra","shim","the","director","pleas","forward","it","to","my","user","name","at","gmail","and","i","will","contact","him","to","person","demand","a","refund"],"filtered":["thi","movi","like","wrong","movi","ever","see","life","surpass","previou","much","godaw","movi","spawn","slithi","see","br","br","bad","act","stilt","ridicul","dialog","incomprehens","plot","mishmash","cut","scene","even","music","annoi","leav","anyth","good","special","effect","bad","cgi","doe","decent","movi","makebr","br","ca","believ","actual","spend","monei","see","thi","movi","anyon","contact","info","hyungra","shim","director","pleas","forward","user","name","gmail","contact","person","demand","refund"],"filtered2":["like","wrong","ever","see","life","surpass","previou","godaw","spawn","slithi","see","bad","act","stilt","ridicul","dialog","incomprehens","plot","mishmash","cut","scene","even","music","annoi","leav","anyth","good","special","effect","bad","cgi","doe","decent","makebr","ca","believ","actual","spend","monei","see","anyon","contact","info","hyungra","shim","director","pleas","forward","user","name","gmail","contact","person","demand","refund"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,9,18,19,21,25,32,44,52,58,74,75,81,91,104,106,118,126,143,153,158,203,271,274,283,303,309,346,432,699,784,1012,1680,2087,2332,2501,2690,3083,4168,4274,4276,4763,4978],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,9,18,19,21,25,32,44,52,58,74,75,81,91,104,106,118,126,143,153,158,203,271,274,283,303,309,346,432,699,784,1012,1680,2087,2332,2501,2690,3083,4168,4274,4276,4763,4978],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,1.865701314626681,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0728240170322856,2.159084361316692,2.354379525480895,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.569760528637609,2.757740698455715,2.748952192422636,2.7678802023081546,2.868298950055202,2.848772527704847,3.023389038124396,3.235085203598255,3.5813614403160887,3.7636829971100436,4.297765483040301,4.662879295624898,9.935311602871959,5.143104478942172,5.156897801074508,5.243909178064138,5.463272006538442,5.907203395474402,5.907203395474402,5.907203395474402,6.0662680901040895,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.669435277442489E-5,8.610975248618178E-5,8.677917370188095E-5,8.627776271174199E-5,8.627917627574611E-5,8.615857522918647E-5,8.641482290385163E-5,8.61221517278818E-5,8.631578572021406E-5,0.1398219511196008,0.49321185613110613,8.598313158715592E-5,0.04451256231523394,8.88374256535568E-5,8.604582958974187E-5,8.58080360420356E-5,8.79484101640582E-5,8.642291932047128E-5,8.615479254994471E-5,8.622619955490735E-5,0.22569878989980832,8.650854256441288E-5,8.660704566402445E-5,8.670035504195797E-5,8.736573572486675E-5,8.690883752236261E-5,9.056231994927831E-5,8.600869358380056E-5,8.601099451777575E-5,8.622890288599301E-5,8.806167803043015E-5,8.641791185028469E-5,9.276230776124E-5,8.66609926839229E-5,8.6102310178854E-5,8.649972909955666E-5,8.60160335123738E-5,8.606686265957683E-5,8.580760493552465E-5,8.582986738704753E-5,8.60230599873743E-5,8.693042099264096E-5,8.648869099266455E-5,8.614673888544412E-5,8.719351209327447E-5,8.617980247457502E-5,8.904312935860095E-5,8.77337241867994E-5,8.585120080123567E-5,8.604093720516766E-5,8.601109496653792E-5,0.09025262834717468,8.604221733028352E-5,8.582224765613017E-5,8.676426964525492E-5,8.606437952135314E-5,9.255278145524804E-5,8.599345128964014E-5,8.585020798134967E-5,8.626011752742505E-5,8.711574539687767E-5,8.625441092999495E-5,8.583432550094432E-5,8.603417758171906E-5,8.580864279369569E-5,8.77940769331121E-5,8.654784397101892E-5,8.636348439164118E-5,8.62879556213018E-5,8.660248893579059E-5,8.580551235831845E-5,8.628976460787024E-5,8.768932730681526E-5,8.595928060261007E-5,8.808672800989846E-5,8.618654820750759E-5,8.686108735040337E-5,8.633023059601544E-5,8.57786098030229E-5,8.588493828119859E-5]}}
{"value":"The worst, and chock full of people who really ought to know better, (the cast have six Oscars between them). It's set in 'contemporary' Africa, (it was made in 1979), and is about the slave trade. It's appallingly scripted and acted, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden reach a career low in this one), and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus. It's also ludicrously plotted. You don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone.

{"value":"I read some comments on the internet about this film like \"...harder then Hostel...\", \"the camera never screens of when it's getting really brutal...\". But none of them is true. The camera never screens of, because there is nothing to screen of. The same scene is repeated hundred and hundred times again. Women lies on a table, killer rapes women a few times, killer cuts women into pieces (you never see this during the whole film!). Police come and arrested him. Killer fools the jury. Film over. In Germany we would say :\"Viel Lärm um Nichts\". All in all, one of the most boring films I ever see. Absolutely non-recommendable.","finished_norm":["i","read","some","comment","on","the","internet","about","thi","film","like","hard","then","hostel","the","camera","never","screen","of","when","it","get","realli","brutal","but","none","of","them","be","true","the","camera","never","screen","of","becaus","there","be","noth","to","screen","of","the","same","scene","be","repeat","hundr","and","hundr","time","again","woman","lie","on","a","tabl","killer","rape","woman","a","few","time","killer","cut","woman","into","piec","you","never","see","thi","dure","the","whole","film","polic","come","and","arrest","him","killer","fool","the","juri","film","over","in","germani","we","would","sai","viel","lärm","um","nicht","all","in","all","on","of","the","much","bore","film","i","ever","see","absolut","nonrecommend"],"filtered":["read","comment","internet","thi","film","like","hard","hostel","camera","never","screen","get","realli","brutal","none","true","camera","never","screen","becaus","noth","screen","scene","repeat","hundr","hundr","time","woman","lie","tabl","killer","rape","woman","time","killer","cut","woman","piec","never","see","thi","dure","whole","film","polic","come","arrest","killer","fool","juri","film","germani","sai","viel","lärm","um","nicht","much","bore","film","ever","see","absolut","nonrecommend"],"filtered2":["read","comment","internet","like","hard","hostel","camera","never","screen","get","realli","brutal","none","true","camera","never","screen","becaus","noth","screen","scene","repeat","hundr","hundr","time","woman","lie","tabl","killer","rape","woman","time","killer","cut","woman","piec","never","see","dure","whole","polic","come","arrest","killer","fool","juri","germani","viel","lärm","um","nicht","bore","ever","see","absolut","nonrecommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,13,19,22,34,42,44,49,70,108,111,145,171,192,218,222,231,239,252,280,303,304,370,471,650,746,988,1057,1191,1328,1994,2002,2650,2666,3964,4721,5706],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,13,19,22,34,42,44,49,70,108,111,145,171,192,218,222,231,239,252,280,303,304,370,471,650,746,988,1057,1191,1328,1994,2002,2650,2666,3964,4721,5706],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.3982850089458962,4.865986292236151,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,6.2840273587550515,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,2.34599021453259,2.373087554090762,7.595480140301968,2.5940874818617203,2.5771019354959765,5.409870614011723,2.6593400337329487,9.129969759075639,2.8028805344481915,2.868298950055202,2.871119826396843,2.9958122703541616,3.496027715008137,3.6621227969605474,4.00861390260916,4.039936373738201,4.181290492043933,4.3215761317340196,8.780277606342633,5.051537285416681,4.9227044135737135,5.290429193699031,5.444579873526289,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.38469068923735E-5,0.05229680946330546,8.39289419059509E-5,8.344399958549335E-5,8.344536672147911E-5,8.332872677437298E-5,8.357655808323506E-5,8.329349959030793E-5,8.348077374146889E-5,9.261736143027727E-5,0.7835884813135983,8.315904551778099E-5,8.471116786404301E-5,8.591959128771919E-5,8.321968422626572E-5,8.29897009249772E-5,8.505977520295275E-5,8.358438857586515E-5,8.332506833591607E-5,8.339413000262167E-5,8.420101712203769E-5,8.366719955412199E-5,0.05122670326002019,8.385271201751584E-5,8.449623850317978E-5,8.405434696331977E-5,8.758783202986836E-5,8.318376793953115E-5,8.318599330012973E-5,8.33967445437375E-5,8.516932282562544E-5,8.357954557429625E-5,8.971556200685855E-5,8.381464250244813E-5,8.327430973006105E-5,8.365867556445544E-5,8.319086679070174E-5,8.324002647223303E-5,8.298928397800976E-5,8.301081522705076E-5,8.319766248357323E-5,0.10650341906545713,8.364800000034736E-5,8.331727919122656E-5,8.432967149690249E-5,8.334925681826531E-5,8.611853872607345E-5,8.485214051199248E-5,8.303144795266536E-5,8.321495253036228E-5,8.318609044968721E-5,8.552725973496578E-5,8.321619061021367E-5,8.300344576354678E-5,8.391452736788413E-5,8.323762489182117E-5,8.951291751955588E-5,8.316902627322423E-5,8.303048774160341E-5,8.342693395112188E-5,8.425445902061725E-5,8.342141478490075E-5,8.301512691574624E-5,8.320841492439621E-5,8.299028774808991E-5,8.491051099333106E-5,8.370521011968917E-5,8.352690576661298E-5,8.345385771248172E-5,8.375806028958742E-5,8.29872601307745E-5,8.345560728351511E-5,8.480920183209914E-5,8.313597791053198E-5,8.519355004722544E-5,8.335578098994451E-5,8.400816512916066E-5,8.34947441803456E-5,8.296124118055636E-5,8.306407733682598E-5]}}
{"value":"\"It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable.\" And for good reason: they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And let's not kid ourselves: critics were mostly supportive of Allen's Bergman pretensions, Allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding. What I don't get is this: why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, but the contemporaneous Brian DePalma was excoriated for \"ripping off\" Hitchcock in his suspense/horror films? In Robin Wood's view, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree with that.","finished_norm":["it","appear","that","mani","critic","find","the","idea","of","a","woodi","allen","drama","unpalat","and","for","good","reason","thei","be","unbear","wooden","and","pretenti","imit","of","bergman","and","let","not","kid","ourselv","critic","be","mostli","support","of","allen","bergman","pretens","allen","whine","accus","to","the","contrari","notwithstand","what","i","do","not","get","be","thi","why","be","allen","gener","applaud","for","hi","origin","in","imit","bergman","but","the","contemporan","brian","depalma","be","excori","for","rip","off","hitchcock","in","hi","suspensehorror","film","in","robin","wood","view","it","a","strang","form","of","cultur","snobberi","i","would","have","to","agre","with","that"],"filtered":["appear","mani","critic","find","idea","woodi","allen","drama","unpalat","good","reason","thei","unbear","wooden","pretenti","imit","bergman","let","kid","ourselv","critic","mostli","support","allen","bergman","pretens","allen","whine","accus","contrari","notwithstand","get","thi","allen","gener","applaud","hi","origin","imit","bergman","contemporan","brian","depalma","excori","rip","hitchcock","hi","suspensehorror","film","robin","wood","view","strang","form","cultur","snobberi","agre"],"filtered2":["appear","mani","critic","find","idea","woodi","allen","drama","unpalat","good","reason","unbear","wooden","pretenti","imit","bergman","let","kid","ourselv","critic","mostli","support","allen","bergman","pretens","allen","whine","accus","contrari","notwithstand","get","allen","gener","applaud","origin","imit","bergman","contemporan","brian","depalma","excori","rip","hitchcock","suspensehorror","robin","wood","view","strang","form","cultur","snobberi","agre"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,38,50,69,95,114,123,124,169,225,312,417,458,463,510,579,622,655,690,824,880,890,1047,1345,1627,1684,1692,1760,1962,2053,2485,2703,2774,3236,3279,3391,3455,6095],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,38,50,69,95,114,123,124,169,225,312,417,458,463,510,579,622,655,690,824,880,890,1047,1345,1627,1684,1692,1760,1962,2053,2485,2703,2774,3236,3279,3391,3455,6095],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.519311641348122,1.717994385570355,2.127032521151058,2.0323326556775485,2.4433074195966826,2.2619070973220485,2.2323930368088845,2.4214486257841834,2.641219492619754,2.8824835850471584,3.1932880749197934,3.2850956241729166,3.3467891931782563,3.374440724508766,7.128534013913577,3.4933926673701317,3.7297814454343623,3.607563812710113,3.8767358583910254,4.110553940952155,3.8767358583910254,4.140259095366071,19.04294034251463,4.944927550358424,9.448067437556459,4.956227105612356,5.156897801074508,4.838444069955973,5.02684467282631,5.390512652256013,5.339219357868463,17.387933281092533,5.521540914662417,5.5623629091826725,5.626901430320244,5.649374286172302,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.78204103643719E-5,6.736308148216731E-5,6.78867652066824E-5,6.749451475409624E-5,6.749562057573016E-5,6.740127518636748E-5,6.760173602256435E-5,6.737278132573719E-5,6.752425989844924E-5,0.053672302177088745,0.22663890854171884,6.726402680261991E-5,6.851947650685674E-5,0.23974310397229961,6.73130750292728E-5,6.712705073274912E-5,6.880145104422682E-5,6.760806979495037E-5,6.739831602178247E-5,6.745417724254799E-5,6.810683597004002E-5,0.0988044465725632,6.775211059782895E-5,6.782510589798145E-5,6.834562874081085E-5,6.798820034326342E-5,7.084629512709738E-5,6.728402378104692E-5,6.7285823786254E-5,6.745629204031408E-5,6.889005973594208E-5,6.760415248462883E-5,0.10903643293833455,6.779431298945378E-5,6.735725941509058E-5,6.766815756965378E-5,6.728976575791105E-5,6.732952905865049E-5,6.712671348101878E-5,6.714412924744047E-5,6.729526252214883E-5,6.800508494721419E-5,6.765952253270948E-5,6.739201569409227E-5,6.821089934961946E-5,6.741788111797763E-5,0.2453943894496381,6.863350364498788E-5,6.716081823419003E-5,6.730924774965349E-5,6.728590236664652E-5,6.917958058979035E-5,6.731024918294064E-5,6.71381683830803E-5,6.787510586320588E-5,6.732758651628259E-5,7.240341980510958E-5,6.727209983661718E-5,6.716004155785607E-5,6.748071104482302E-5,6.815006298492526E-5,6.747624681195076E-5,6.714761680002326E-5,6.73039597415939E-5,6.712752539050086E-5,6.868071719339736E-5,6.770579751069689E-5,6.756157424899799E-5,6.750248859883966E-5,6.774854589991208E-5,6.712507647191378E-5,6.750390375689192E-5,6.859877226372643E-5,6.72453683374751E-5,0.021766280301778664,6.742315825957975E-5,6.795084570419401E-5,6.753556002784822E-5,6.710403078345077E-5,6.718721083835073E-5]}}

{"value":"You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We have seen it before. You might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not

{"value":"There are no spoilers in this review. There's nothing to spoil.<br /><br />No plot, nothing; most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch, but this didn't even do that. Clips, three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips... OK, so perhaps they were short on production time, but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely. What a waste of time.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this got made, in fact. Scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes, but somehow this got through....<br /><br />Thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode.","finished_norm":["there","be","no","spoiler","in","thi","review","there","noth","to","spoilbr","br","no","plot","noth","much","clip","show","at","littl","try","to","tie","the","clip","into","the","plot","by","some","tenuou","stretch","but","thi","do","not","even","do","that","clip","three","line","to","lead","into","the","next","intermin","sequenc","of","dull","clip","okai","so","perhap","thei","be","short","on","product","time","but","thei","have","have","be","well","off","skip","thi","episod","entir","what","a","wast","of","timebr","br","i","be","not","sure","how","thi","get","make","in","fact","scrub","be","usual","much","well","at","subvert","trope","but","somehow","thi","get","throughbr","br","thank","heaven","thei","be","back","on","form","by","the","next","episod"],"filtered":["spoiler","thi","review","noth","spoilbr","br","plot","noth","much","clip","show","littl","try","tie","clip","plot","tenuou","stretch","thi","even","clip","three","line","lead","next","intermin","sequenc","dull","clip","okai","perhap","thei","short","product","time","thei","well","skip","thi","episod","entir","wast","timebr","br","sure","thi","get","make","fact","scrub","usual","much","well","subvert","trope","somehow","thi","get","throughbr","br","thank","heaven","thei","back","form","next","episod"],"filtered2":["spoiler","review","noth","spoilbr","plot","noth","clip","show","littl","try","tie","clip","plot","tenuou","stretch","even","clip","three","line","lead","next","intermin","sequenc","dull","clip","okai","perhap","short","product","time","well","skip","entir","wast","timebr","sure","get","make","fact","scrub","usual","well","subvert","trope","somehow","get","throughbr","thank","heaven","back","form","next"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,8,14,20,28,32,36,49,63,89,97,107,119,157,176,190,191,198,224,265,272,297,318,349,367,490,549,651,690,931,1175,1220,1250,1543,1563,4686,4892,5204],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,8,14,20,28,32,36,49,63,89,97,107,119,157,176,190,191,198,224,265,272,297,318,349,367,490,549,651,690,931,1175,1220,1250,1543,1563,4686,4892,5204],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,2.330690080046114,1.5452294193519092,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,3.3840606616174704,1.8729627573220065,1.9940046109572438,2.0545557924622586,2.1439533986393955,2.1653408989309972,2.3360150694757706,2.5040471493269134,2.558331832813986,2.5460113484259455,2.5439726117360975,2.689504733779216,2.73529586597515,2.8028805344481915,5.626981427120414,2.902686292364678,3.0568369721919364,3.0791938792932125,3.3490645070153917,3.4471119148061256,3.5474598886404074,3.607563812710113,3.9241755834625858,4.263079925052412,4.30366520516749,4.280272325592784,4.706176101378222,18.96886415144568,6.032366538428407,6.2980697041614135,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.076092654142433E-5,9.0148904395583E-5,9.084972616584792E-5,9.032479548020711E-5,9.032627535028668E-5,9.020001726798576E-5,9.046828475753275E-5,9.016188524876538E-5,9.03646020347101E-5,1.0025459314824805E-4,0.8382690631462864,9.001634408747393E-5,9.169645451102498E-5,9.30045245836395E-5,9.008198306654103E-5,8.983303533206115E-5,9.207380802651244E-5,9.047676095293127E-5,9.019605715453198E-5,9.02708136493272E-5,9.114423671628113E-5,9.05664005281161E-5,9.066952411462248E-5,9.076721035744255E-5,9.146380206556337E-5,9.098547212979135E-5,0.05638963328706624,9.004310512121453E-5,9.004551398514645E-5,9.027364378561902E-5,0.03141754872724745,9.047151859723892E-5,9.711351121609144E-5,0.0670185968465374,9.01411129917942E-5,9.05571736498848E-5,9.005078934396647E-5,9.010400273501008E-5,8.983258400362834E-5,8.985589072041711E-5,9.005814540997258E-5,9.100806801634857E-5,9.054561777828843E-5,9.018762571662703E-5,9.128349993658485E-5,9.022224022020505E-5,9.321987723655552E-5,9.184905176975649E-5,8.987822482149802E-5,9.007686119478421E-5,9.004561914566073E-5,9.257984135370185E-5,9.007820136675488E-5,8.98479135706268E-5,9.083412300433493E-5,9.010140312017129E-5,9.689415665540727E-5,9.002714785645224E-5,8.987718543138946E-5,9.030632261287092E-5,9.120208543618013E-5,9.030034833595921E-5,8.986055795115304E-5,9.006978449754117E-5,8.983367054463369E-5,9.191223548356668E-5,9.060754544660032E-5,9.041453810868698E-5,9.033546650878274E-5,9.066475364384477E-5,8.98303932698606E-5,9.033736034952089E-5,9.18025723644209E-5,8.999137432431139E-5,9.22186139503578E-5,9.022930237536934E-5,9.093548213954585E-5,9.037972447659419E-5,8.980222879585722E-5,8.991354482611903E-5]}}

{"value":"My life is about saving animals. I do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life. I can't even kill a spider, I put it outdoors. The scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies, with Sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. It simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The ending - the foster parents adopt Sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty.

{"value":"After I got done watching this movie I was so upset that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. That's 2 hours I'll never get back. Ugh. When you start this you might think \"Wow this is really good!\" But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending I have ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The acting is bland, the story line is anything but original and there's nothing especially unique about this except that it's the WORST MOVIE EVER!!!

{"value":"What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, at least make the action look somewhat realistic. Why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games? ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the last scene in the movie....what was that? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of

{"value":"No wonder this was released straight to DVD here in Australia, no redeeming features what so ever. The dialog was hokey, the acting, awful and the script sucked!! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior John Badham film, Wargames from the 80s, well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea!! Amanda Walsh was good in it as the eye candy/love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other main lead- that is about it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out Hackers or the original Wargames film- both are better than this piece of

{"value":"You know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of pathetic. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. Around 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we compromised to fast forward to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, don't watch this movie.

{"value":"\"Visitor Q\" is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter, etc. The film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following. However, with home video quality and a slapdash production, \"Visitor Q\" just doesn't hold up even as a curiosity. Genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible, make-up is awful, and everything else is amateurish at best. A waste of time.

{"value":"I read the running man from Kings books as Bachman and I felt for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been SO much more. The trouble? It was set during the big action movie craze. I watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing. I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause. Yes it had funny scenes (or laughable) though I think that it did not save the movie in my eyes. If you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of John as he gets his final revenge.<br /><br />I give this movie a low number. It may not have been this low if I had not read the book.","finished_norm":["i","read","the","run","man","from","king","book","a","bachman","and","i","feel","for","the","main","charact","john","and","hi","famili","thi","movi","can","have","be","so","much","much","the","troubl","it","be","set","dure","the","big","action","movi","craze","i","watch","the","movi","and","be","in","pain","dure","the","whole","thing","i","feel","noth","for","the","charact","and","littl","for","hi","caus","ye","it","have","funni","scene","or","laughabl","though","i","think","that","it","do","not","save","the","movi","in","my","ey","if","you","read","the","book","you","can","feel","the","climax","and","the","fire","in","the","heart","of","john","a","he","get","hi","final","revengebr","br","i","give","thi","movi","a","low","numb","it","mai","not","have","be","thi","low","if","i","have","not","read","the","book"],"filtered":["read","run","man","king","book","bachman","feel","main","charact","john","hi","famili","thi","movi","much","much","troubl","set","dure","big","action","movi","craze","watch","movi","pain","dure","whole","thing","feel","noth","charact","littl","hi","caus","ye","funni","scene","laughabl","though","think","save","movi","ey","read","book","feel","climax","fire","heart","john","get","hi","final","revengebr","br","give","thi","movi","low","numb","mai","thi","low","read","book"],"filtered2":["read","run","man","king","book","bachman","feel","main","charact","john","famili","troubl","set","dure","big","action","craze","watch","pain","dure","whole","thing","feel","noth","charact","littl","caus","ye","funni","scene","laughabl","though","think","save","ey","read","book","feel","climax","fire","heart","john","get","final","revengebr","give","low","numb","mai","low","read","book"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,10,12,14,19,29,30,43,45,46,49,62,82,86,109,111,129,137,145,151,156,179,182,189,209,217,239,281,291,453,459,516,541,551,552,614,752,1137,2893],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,10,12,14,19,29,30,43,45,46,49,62,82,86,109,111,129,137,145,151,156,179,182,189,209,217,239,281,291,453,459,516,541,551,552,614,752,1137,2893],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,4.982433610865464,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,2.0226120445069267,2.020196584395323,2.031112399272319,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.4106958340079214,2.2939035841256437,7.03797064359777,8.400736460430558,2.3451551414151686,2.507968722980095,2.7365296724240786,2.498193474075453,2.6026896854443837,5.222733058940145,5.318680067465897,2.832333801361687,6.033663275156474,3.2872346624216657,3.2829611516442836,3.442099372982581,3.8023521382691974,3.528202072035993,3.424750734647968,3.553030933689863,3.719831114581194,4.181290492043933,5.463272006538442]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0169030664506397E-4,1.010045851341033E-4,1.0178979947068514E-4,1.0120165692494047E-4,1.0120331500014884E-4,1.0106185299006525E-4,1.0136242510093373E-4,1.0101912913437889E-4,1.012462569625133E-4,1.1232719528450819E-4,0.9345906347047548,1.0085606198769819E-4,1.0273849037047253E-4,1.0420407751095518E-4,1.0092960517597928E-4,1.0065067929429716E-4,1.0316128458562413E-4,1.0137192199505001E-4,1.0105741600196023E-4,1.0114117463212324E-4,1.0211977481718065E-4,1.0147235591783414E-4,1.0158789758905526E-4,1.0169734715469892E-4,1.0247782204741484E-4,1.0194189188782167E-4,1.0622733536165556E-4,1.0088604557018155E-4,1.0088874450816332E-4,1.0114434557184731E-4,1.0329414495882935E-4,1.013660483578119E-4,1.0880786601970071E-4,1.0165117609360022E-4,1.0099585549382008E-4,1.0146201794407747E-4,1.008946551227473E-4,1.0095427644063213E-4,1.0065017361714644E-4,1.0067628691575913E-4,1.0090289700211507E-4,1.0196720875842315E-4,1.0144907052087493E-4,1.0104796925500991E-4,1.0227580803672474E-4,1.0108675201778404E-4,1.0444536281010717E-4,1.029094633059077E-4,1.007013104768234E-4,1.0092386653128497E-4,1.0088886233204803E-4,1.0372825416356278E-4,1.0092536808601616E-4,1.006673491620446E-4,1.0177231738517375E-4,1.0095136378162577E-4,1.0856209690528136E-4,1.008681667405053E-4,1.0070014592393824E-4,1.0118095956523278E-4,1.0218458964763379E-4,1.0117426586923072E-4,1.0068151617181462E-4,1.0091593766211074E-4,1.0065139099881305E-4,0.05746449963108181,1.0151845548443164E-4,1.013022063106399E-4,1.012136129528197E-4,1.0158255266084977E-4,1.0064771907644144E-4,1.0121573484880224E-4,1.0285738687653037E-4,1.0082808537959587E-4,1.0332352795797595E-4,1.0109466459373052E-4,1.0188588213085948E-4,1.0126320044040644E-4,1.006161630522024E-4,1.0074088369668222E-4]}}

{"value":"This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply confusing. The acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DON'T SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","not","onli","poorli","script","and","direct","but","be","simpli","distast","a","beauti","novel","be","terribli","misrepres","in","thi","film","mani","chang","have","be","make","to","the","storylin","presum","to","streamlin","the","timefram","but","what","result","be","simpli","confus","the","act","ca","not","possibli","overcom","the","script","which","remov","the","charact","motiv","for","their","behavior","plu","the","convers","to","english","doe","not","work","when","everyon","refer","to","the","patriarch","esteban","a","esteban","horribl","pleas","pleas","pleas","read","the","gorgeou","novel","in","spanish","if","possibl","don","t","see","thi","film","it","will","ruin","for","you","what","can","be","a","wonder","experi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","onli","poorli","script","direct","simpli","distast","beauti","novel","terribli","misrepres","thi","film","mani","chang","make","storylin","presum","streamlin","timefram","result","simpli","confus","act","ca","possibli","overcom","script","remov","charact","motiv","behavior","plu","convers","english","doe","work","everyon","refer","patriarch","esteban","esteban","horribl","pleas","pleas","pleas","read","gorgeou","novel","spanish","possibl","see","thi","film","ruin","wonder","experi"],"filtered2":["onli","poorli","script","direct","simpli","distast","beauti","novel","terribli","misrepres","mani","chang","make","storylin","presum","streamlin","timefram","result","simpli","confus","act","ca","possibli","overcom","script","remov","charact","motiv","behavior","plu","convers","english","doe","work","everyon","refer","patriarch","esteban","esteban","horribl","pleas","pleas","pleas","read","gorgeou","novel","spanish","possibl","see","ruin","wonder","experi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,11,18,21,48,50,77,81,102,145,175,201,230,246,278,325,333,346,398,402,427,447,474,515,558,588,710,715,749,902,1153,1305,1494,1518,1607,1668,1858,2605,4270,8097],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,11,18,21,48,50,77,81,102,145,175,201,230,246,278,325,333,346,398,402,427,447,474,515,558,588,710,715,749,902,1153,1305,1494,1518,1607,1668,1858,2605,4270,8097],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,3.8927804517536475,1.949757232424728,2.087553710177271,2.34599021453259,2.3791142619576227,5.122871637503154,2.7121382192999195,2.673149229007135,2.8336934208777267,2.973659465713028,2.948928684455311,9.070167114373188,3.143848349181566,3.084424928710765,3.233054746047873,3.2070272508030975,7.293333077447711,3.3956930001684253,3.4572130107926293,3.6375061693251913,3.6528204042982337,3.68099128126493,3.7165362186843414,3.9201351739255808,4.213208095012239,4.456830177669989,4.558366596889411,4.5432147918688095,4.597282013139085,4.9676558014359795,4.8184434032493035,5.1994574154933035,5.907203395474402,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.41951704295921E-5,8.362742271216133E-5,8.427754618089093E-5,8.379058962121898E-5,8.379196243569224E-5,8.36748380170407E-5,8.392369870923316E-5,8.363946451459393E-5,8.382751652102388E-5,9.300205361625097E-5,0.9141069754935047,8.350445197840236E-5,8.506302116496583E-5,8.627646385329452E-5,8.356534255367494E-5,8.333440400190697E-5,0.030832142734722214,8.393156172631957E-5,8.367116438302365E-5,8.374051290181746E-5,8.455075147894085E-5,8.401471666531722E-5,8.411038016581325E-5,8.420099966669624E-5,8.484719908113594E-5,8.440347211625618E-5,8.79516337409939E-5,8.352927708632623E-5,0.04856655843245917,8.37431383025985E-5,8.552307910273937E-5,8.39266986090312E-5,9.00882013817155E-5,8.416277202744161E-5,8.362019494802447E-5,8.400615727070965E-5,8.353640542303315E-5,8.358576929247325E-5,8.33339853231234E-5,8.33556060035964E-5,8.354322934225342E-5,8.442443338882345E-5,8.39954373649573E-5,8.366334288561914E-5,8.467994022805188E-5,8.369545333379485E-5,8.647623763266922E-5,8.520457935190351E-5,8.337632442856796E-5,8.356059120436727E-5,8.353160924317807E-5,8.58825027261252E-5,8.356183442666322E-5,8.334820593055031E-5,8.426307177111033E-5,8.35833577369422E-5,8.988471519746106E-5,8.351447418955725E-5,8.337536022920743E-5,8.377345310363413E-5,8.460441535189401E-5,8.376791101320004E-5,8.335993560116905E-5,8.355402644403306E-5,8.333499326242734E-5,8.526319227880213E-5,8.405288511022075E-5,8.387384015851063E-5,8.380048869457379E-5,8.410595479670933E-5,8.33319530697081E-5,8.380224553256334E-5,8.5161462323433E-5,8.348128855835841E-5,8.554740695366732E-5,8.370200460404203E-5,8.435709846286943E-5,8.384154498701977E-5,8.330582604810159E-5,8.340908934098082E-5]}}
{"value":"Filmed in a documentary style, but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached. A recently divorced wannabe film maker(Myles Berkowitz)sees a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time. He intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications. The comedy is spotty at best; the rest is mishap after mishap. Also taking part are Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the enticing Elisabeth Wagner. Trying for credibility the fetching Tia Carrere is talked into a cameo. This will suffice as a handbook on how NOT to get a satisfactory

{"value":"Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it'd be otherwise.The story is so poor and Charlotte's character dies in such a foolish way, that you wonder if this's the ending they had thought of for this movie. I wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists, but I fear it doesn't. As for the rest of the cst, well I'd say they simply didn't act very well; although the blame should be put on the poor script.This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi dies in absurd way, since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie. I could give this movie 2/5","finished_norm":["charlott","deadli","beauti","and","lethal","kick","make","the","movi","cool","than","it","have","be","otherwiseth","stori","be","so","poor","and","charlott","charact","die","in","such","a","foolish","wai","that","you","wonder","if","thi","the","end","thei","have","think","of","for","thi","movi","i","wish","somebodi","can","tell","that","a","altern","end","exist","but","i","fear","it","doe","not","a","for","the","rest","of","the","cst","good","i","have","sai","thei","simpli","do","not","act","veri","good","although","the","blame","should","be","put","on","the","poor","scriptthi","movi","remind","me","of","rush","hour","where","zhang","ziyi","die","in","absurd","wai","sinc","she","have","be","the","onli","on","who","have","steal","the","show","dure","the","whole","movi","i","can","give","thi","movi"],"filtered":["charlott","deadli","beauti","lethal","kick","make","movi","cool","otherwiseth","stori","poor","charlott","charact","die","foolish","wai","wonder","thi","end","thei","think","thi","movi","wish","somebodi","tell","altern","end","exist","fear","doe","rest","cst","good","sai","thei","simpli","act","veri","good","although","blame","put","poor","scriptthi","movi","remind","rush","hour","zhang","ziyi","die","absurd","wai","sinc","onli","steal","show","dure","whole","movi","give","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["charlott","deadli","beauti","lethal","kick","make","cool","otherwiseth","stori","poor","charlott","charact","die","foolish","wai","wonder","end","think","wish","somebodi","tell","altern","end","exist","fear","doe","rest","cst","good","simpli","act","veri","good","although","blame","put","poor","scriptthi","remind","rush","hour","zhang","ziyi","die","absurd","wai","sinc","onli","steal","show","dure","whole","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,10,11,12,15,17,18,21,24,28,30,33,90,111,146,159,162,174,175,201,226,237,239,293,325,399,481,528,578,644,812,869,898,928,1082,1363,1787,1944,3885,3938,5093,5145],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,10,11,12,15,17,18,21,24,28,30,33,90,111,146,159,162,174,175,201,226,237,239,293,325,399,481,528,578,644,812,869,898,928,1082,1363,1787,1944,3885,3938,5093,5145],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,2.803707089537043,2.0477128419653545,2.1183455303375887,4.652276891959716,2.300267965194495,2.3586007221245198,2.456282578459816,2.3791142619576227,2.561435818751577,2.5940874818617203,2.640097787510554,2.6593400337329487,5.802459255736427,2.973659465713028,3.129115117668582,3.353630724994973,3.4198487640477615,3.575630765607104,3.5670958631572662,3.952924996748572,3.9161110236258554,3.892300374932137,4.017463517886143,4.165705761027235,4.436351646326448,4.798834931860927,4.900964426937307,5.822646007446338,11.874112717248165,6.600350576034347,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.922921767456756E-5,8.862752419969974E-5,8.931651868965245E-5,8.88004468931429E-5,8.880190178848711E-5,8.867777447579753E-5,8.89415146019946E-5,8.864028598407491E-5,8.883958166018389E-5,9.856266629029335E-5,0.79713831213474,8.849720101947224E-5,9.014895739099765E-5,9.14349520771541E-5,8.856173225526171E-5,8.831698583809773E-5,9.051994257434443E-5,8.89498477505541E-5,0.10503957321534889,8.874737607597956E-5,8.960605899089726E-5,8.903797454113695E-5,8.913935778278512E-5,8.923539544300473E-5,8.992023125862239E-5,8.944997376362224E-5,9.32102807306712E-5,8.85235104259077E-5,8.852587863712281E-5,8.875015845003473E-5,9.063652229125326E-5,8.89446938664431E-5,9.547459420753279E-5,8.919488216502415E-5,8.86198642859995E-5,8.90289033784954E-5,8.85310649673907E-5,8.858338031314101E-5,8.831654212642016E-5,8.833945551200219E-5,8.853829689020044E-5,8.947218831515884E-5,0.03704164725792415,8.866559204801007E-5,8.974297196294442E-5,8.869962238674896E-5,9.16466703735189E-5,9.02989793722043E-5,8.836141269603341E-5,8.855669682176289E-5,8.852598202291643E-5,9.101743592994344E-5,0.05398505068830223,8.833161298700618E-5,8.930117885181574E-5,8.858082457018905E-5,9.525894154080661E-5,8.850782246077532E-5,8.836039084698691E-5,8.878228577950705E-5,8.966293143829021E-5,8.877641232630074E-5,8.834404397713958E-5,8.854973955300442E-5,8.831761033063064E-5,9.036109677853646E-5,8.907842508552353E-5,8.88886749978622E-5,8.88109378342105E-5,8.913466781991612E-5,8.831438836413856E-5,8.881279971391915E-5,9.025328436738105E-5,8.847265265359042E-5,9.066230470959067E-5,8.87065653588452E-5,8.940082741958256E-5,8.885444889116164E-5,8.828669920232298E-5,8.839613662956614E-5]}}
