{"value":"Oh Dear, Jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game, and he's way out of his league. The script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as Michael Dudikoff (80's action B'movie king), Michael Jai White (Last seen in the Sci Fi flop Spawn') as well as Surviving the Games' William MacNamara (who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film!) stoop this low for employment. If you are a fan of Jerry then stick to his TV show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half. After I had finished sitting through this I managed to catch the last half an hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, I think that says more than enough!!!<br

{"value":"Jimmy Dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish. Hysterical if viewed through the eyes of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which I rate as a 10. I mean, the sight of this obese, corn-fed hog trouncing around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory, if you make it that far into the film. This ugly, hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of \"Booty Call\", \"Pumpkinhead\", \"Swarm\", and \"The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh\". A -gulp- film like this proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc. get behind on their mortgage, or get stoned to the point of insanity. It begs the question \"who was so stupid to finance such a whale?\" But then, had good judgment prevailed and \"Final Justice\" never was, then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice-over in

{"value":"I loved this movie, I'll admit it. This has to be the best (straight to?) video movie I've seen. Well... me and my friend decided just for shits n' giggles that we'd rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the Sasquatch, we literally watched that part about three to four times, it was that amazing (hysterically, of course). And why? Oh why does the main character have to roll that much? Like honestly, we know that you're in danger, rolling that much isn't gonna help all that much. But really, if this movie is in you're local video store RENT IT. It is worth the money and it's not even that bad, like it's bad, but not incredibly bad.

{"value":"I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (\"The highway belongs to me...ME!\"), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the \"plot\", but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road.

{"value":"Terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk. It was excruciating to sit through. Just awful. Do not waste one penny on this. The movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch. This \"horror\" film was not even in the least bit scary, creepy or disturbing. It was in no way visually appealing. The acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor/actress opening their mouth. Plus the entire story, i don't know why someone would make a movie with this story AGAIN. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket don't waste one moment viewing this movie.

{"value":"VERY BAD MOVIE........and I mean VERY BAD...THe plot is predictable, and it's EALLY cheesy, the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason I didn't give the movie a one, other than that...this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch.....I feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of cliché....bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but I feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy, very poorly portrayed from idea to screen, i think. The Plot is somewhat predictable at times, tho the dancing I can say AT TIMES, is pretty good, The break dance battle twist was good.....IF u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a

{"value":"This movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue wasn't too stiff... but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a Doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a Doctor - and it just goes south from there.<br /><br />On top of that, the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the Godzilla-looking thing in Curse of the Demon. There's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of Logan's Run.<br /><br />In the end, the cinematography couldn't save this movie. Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors, the story just doesn't go anywhere.

this.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","seem","like","it","be","go","to","be","well","than","it","end","up","be","the","cinematographi","be","good","the","act","seem","solid","the","dialogu","be","not","too","stiff","but","then","about","twenti","minut","in","there","thi","long","scene","with","a","doctor","who","you","know","be","actual","a","patient","at","the","asylum","pretend","to","be","a","doctor","and","it","just","go","south","from","therebr","br","on","top","of","that","the","demon","be","about","the","silli","look","hellspawn","sinc","the","godzillalook","thing","in","curs","of","the","demon","there","conjur","some","odd","demon","worshipp","who","wear","mask","that","look","like","the","explod","teen","from","the","begin","of","logan","runbr","br","in","the","end","the","cinematographi","can","not","save","thi","movi","despit","some","pretti","solid","perform","by","the","actor","the","stori","just","doe","not","go","anywher","i","think","hellbor","would","have","be","a","well","titl","for","thi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","seem","like","go","well","end","cinematographi","good","act","seem","solid","dialogu","stiff","twenti","minut","thi","long","scene","doctor","know","actual","patient","asylum","pretend","doctor","go","south","therebr","br","top","demon","silli","look","hellspawn","sinc","godzillalook","thing","curs","demon","conjur","odd","demon","worshipp","wear","mask","look","like","explod","teen","begin","logan","runbr","br","end","cinematographi","save","thi","movi","despit","pretti","solid","perform","actor","stori","doe","go","anywher","think","hellbor","well","titl","thi"],"filtered2":["seem","like","go","well","end","cinematographi","good","act","seem","solid","dialogu","stiff","twenti","minut","long","scene","doctor","know","actual","patient","asylum","pretend","doctor","go","south","therebr","top","demon","silli","look","hellspawn","sinc","godzillalook","thing","curs","demon","conjur","odd","demon","worshipp","wear","mask","look","like","explod","teen","begin","logan","runbr","end","cinematographi","save","despit","pretti","solid","perform","actor","stori","doe","go","anywher","think","hellbor","well","titl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,12,16,17,18,19,20,21,24,26,29,35,39,41,52,59,78,99,105,147,162,189,248,264,364,385,391,514,629,693,768,881,1073,1292,1299,1340,1368,1520,1566,1572,1915,1991,2157,2271,3061,4210],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,12,16,17,18,19,20,21,24,26,29,35,39,41,52,59,78,99,105,147,162,189,248,264,364,385,391,514,629,693,768,881,1073,1292,1299,1340,1368,1520,1566,1572,1915,1991,2157,2271,3061,4210],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,2.912480743411154,1.066728610262888,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,2.926338025798268,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,2.056430207256609,2.1765612129984904,2.2844323215331563,2.3586007221245198,2.498193474075453,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,2.9878441007049847,3.09496984188738,3.109204957709252,3.405285399859865,6.976286622967976,7.692630523380627,3.8059428063999263,4.086456389373095,13.607172360418957,4.3336974922663645,4.5432147918688095,4.5432147918688095,4.436351646326448,9.101523995008385,4.74221603786142,4.573751515728891,5.039114765418124,4.956227105612356,4.9676558014359795,5.02684467282631,5.672363804397,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.385789357363647E-5,7.335985253070345E-5,7.3930155431905E-5,7.350298620621512E-5,7.350419046988899E-5,7.340144630055598E-5,7.361975248634822E-5,7.337041587012024E-5,7.353537931168518E-5,0.2426343989432835,0.4146146869731977,7.325197984251598E-5,7.461919172083407E-5,7.568365088725662E-5,7.330539442205984E-5,7.310280994017686E-5,0.03307887061977651,7.362665010145099E-5,7.339822370632788E-5,7.345905778379847E-5,7.416981725246035E-5,7.369959548066067E-5,7.378351365081778E-5,7.386300711128306E-5,7.442986774397156E-5,7.404062048928195E-5,7.715314751814623E-5,7.327375698447841E-5,7.327571722907591E-5,7.346136084430045E-5,7.502276487155535E-5,7.362238406579495E-5,7.902739261577035E-5,7.382947296796778E-5,7.335351217374863E-5,7.369208698756357E-5,7.328001012145968E-5,7.332331321588762E-5,7.310244266574911E-5,7.312140881201638E-5,7.328599621658786E-5,7.405900818813145E-5,7.368268324558957E-5,7.339136251322213E-5,7.428314452330106E-5,7.341953051919995E-5,7.585889693118735E-5,7.474336974021422E-5,7.313958347950331E-5,7.330122643178551E-5,7.327580280482275E-5,0.14552566791094448,7.330231701429224E-5,7.311491730181826E-5,7.391745815471365E-5,7.332119774523948E-5,0.15861190405167166,7.326077155112675E-5,7.313873766217921E-5,7.348

{"value":"They made me watch this in school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. The episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience.I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.This accounts for cheesy acting very often. Also, very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched. I don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them. Though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, It ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched, and old. I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it.","finished_norm":["thei","make","me","watch","thi","in","school","and","it","be","terribl","the","movi","be","outdat","the","episod","becom","confus","becaus","fact","be","combin","with","fiction","to","make","the","stori","much","interestingth","teacher","talk","about","it","a","a","treat","but","realli","it","be","a","painfulli","bore","experiencei","have","read","that","veri","few","peopl","who","appear","in","thi","be","actor","but","much","of","them","them","do","what","thei","do","in","the","movi","in","real","lifethi","account","for","cheesi","act","veri","often","conjur","veri","often","the","stori","becom","mildli","outrag","and","farfetch","i","do","not","like","the","wai","some","of","the","line","be","write","and","wish","thei","have","much","mean","to","them","though","it","be","write","to","be","educ","funni","suspens","and","hip","it","end","up","be","bore","spindri","farfetch","and","old","i","hope","no","on","take","time","to","watch","thi","movi","becaus","you","would","be","just","fine","not","see","it"],"filtered":["thei","make","watch","thi","school","terribl","movi","outdat","episod","becom","confus","becaus","fact","combin","fiction","make","stori","much","interestingth","teacher","talk","treat","realli","painfulli","bore","experiencei","read","veri","peopl","appear","thi","actor","much","thei","movi","real","lifethi","account","cheesi","act","veri","often","conjur","veri","often","stori","becom","mildli","outrag","farfetch","like","wai","line","write","wish","thei","much","mean","though","write","educ","funni","suspens","hip","end","bore","spindri","farfetch","old","hope","take","time","watch","thi","movi","becaus","fine","see"],"filtered2":["make","watch","school","terribl","outdat","becom","confus","becaus","fact","combin","fiction","make","stori","interestingth","teacher","talk","treat","realli","painfulli","bore","experiencei","read","veri","peopl","appear","actor","real","lifethi","account","cheesi","act","veri","often","conjur","veri","often","stori","becom","mildli","outrag","farfetch","like","wai","line","write","wish","mean","though","write","educ","funni","suspens","hip","end","bore","spindri","farfetch","old","hope","take","time","watch","becaus","fine","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,8,13,15,17,21,22,23,24,31,33,39,41,62,65,67,80,86,88,97,107,108,115,145,166,169,181,186,296,399,400,427,464,529,543,849,916,968,1114,1240,1447,1501,1560,1714,1738,2227,4118,4245],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,8,13,15,17,21,22,23,24,31,33,39,41,62,65,67,80,86,88,97,107,108,115,145,166,169,181,186,296,399,400,427,464,529,543,849,916,968,1114,1240,1447,1501,1560,1714,1738,2227,4118,4245],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1317941569733974,3.6001823395697077,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,2.0226120445069267,3.8147700134888347,1.9570915389266579,1.9951803900462557,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,2.0545557924622586,2.1439533986393955,4.277015007255866,4.40310717685161,2.34599021453259,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.4442286541160034,2.571852579609833,2.9504565686333644,3.129115117668582,6.261889888691316,3.233054746047873,3.2872346624216657,3.4648563601051974,3.477726550625732,3.880604335168946,4.100845126825194,3.9911462095687695,4.364659717870332,4.3095999406873045,4.477736862489302,4.597282013139085,4.573751515728891,4.74221603786142,4.751432692966343,5.129498826886393,5.878215858601149,11.874112717248165]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.847771227047727E-5,7.7948518710046E-5,7.855449411527323E-5,7.810060541140612E-5,7.810188500189432E-5,7.79927141744005E-5,7.822467543414571E-5,7.795974278740938E-5,7.813502470889247E-5,8.66865446915754E-5,0.749658610596838,7.78338985743258E-5,7.928662969361302E-5,8.041767088832154E-5,7.789065424121077E-5,7.767539807954099E-5,7.961291372068455E-5,7.823200449576927E-5,7.79892900065782E-5,7.8053929261734E-5,7.880914680689123E-5,7.830951261581024E-5,7.839867987597978E-5,7.848314566041971E-5,7.908546348289099E-5,7.867186877313735E-5,0.01940009318456035,7.785703787871575E-5,7.785912073681065E-5,7.80563763789028E-5,7.97154463856409E-5,7.82274716191524E-5,0.06215251015146231,7.844751395305578E-5,7.794178176312379E-5,7.830153446571215E-5,7.786368215004626E-5,7.790969385740086E-5,7.767500783206071E-5,7.769516031269108E-5,7.787004267602883E-5,7.869140662440558E-5,7.829154251872864E-5,7.798199964515125E-5,7.89295627099601E-5,7.801192956274572E-5,8.060387858998614E-5,7.941857506063755E-5,7.771447180746352E-5,7.788622554272414E-5,7.785921166532909E-5,8.005046255765369E-5,7.7887384

{"value":"As a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the Seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his snappy wardrobe and \"swank\" apartment don't fit the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character.He does his best to make it work but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice. The English accent and California looks can't hold a candle to Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J.Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes,but even his performance is just gruff, without style.<br /><br />It feels like the TV movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is.","finished_norm":["a","a","big","fan","of","the","origin","film","it","hard","to","watch","thi","show","the","garish","set","decor","and","harshli","light","set","rob","ani","styl","from","thi","remak","the","mood","be","never","there","instead","it","have","the","look","and","feel","of","so","mani","televis","movi","of","the","seventi","crenna","be","not","a","bad","choic","a","walter","neff","but","hi","snappi","wardrob","and","swank","apart","do","not","fit","the","mood","of","the","origin","or","make","him","a","interest","characterh","doe","hi","well","to","make","it","work","but","samantha","egger","be","a","realli","bad","choic","the","english","accent","and","california","look","ca","not","hold","a","candl","to","barbara","stanwick","velvet","voic","and","sex","appeal","lee","jcobb","try","mightili","to","fashion","barton","keyesbut","even","hi","perform","be","just","gruff","without","stylebr","br","it","feel","like","the","tv","movi","it","be","and","again","remind","me","of","what","a","remark","film","the","origin","still","be"],"filtered":["big","fan","origin","film","hard","watch","thi","show","garish","set","decor","harshli","light","set","rob","ani","styl","thi","remak","mood","never","instead","look","feel","mani","televis","movi","seventi","crenna","bad","choic","walter","neff","hi","snappi","wardrob","swank","apart","fit","mood","origin","make","interest","characterh","doe","hi","well","make","work","samantha","egger","realli","bad","choic","english","accent","california","look","ca","hold","candl","barbara","stanwick","velvet","voic","sex","appeal","lee","jcobb","try","mightili","fashion","barton","keyesbut","even","hi","perform","gruff","without","stylebr","br","feel","like","tv","movi","remind","remark","film","origin","still"],"filtered2":["big","fan","origin","hard","watch","show","garish","set","decor","harshli","light","set","rob","ani","styl","remak","mood","never","instead","look","feel","mani","televis","seventi","crenna","bad","choic","walter","neff","snappi","wardrob","swank","apart","fit","mood","origin","make","interest","characterh","doe","well","make","work","samantha","egger","realli","bad","choic","english","accent","california","look","ca","hold","candl","barbara","stanwick","velvet","voic","sex","appeal","lee","jcobb","try","mightili","fashion","barton","keyesbut","even","perform","gruff","without","stylebr","feel","like","tv","remind","remark","origin","still"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,9,13,16,18,20,27,28,36,42,43,48,50,60,64,69,81,82,105,109,125,140,152,171,172,254,353,380,414,428,483,559,570,572,588,644,663,676,689,808,1037,1129,1229,1559,2545,2675,3065,3138,4035,4160,4877,5052,5519,6029,6866,7405,7968,8054,8261],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,9,13,16,18,20,27,28,36,42,43,48,50,60,64,69,81,82,105,109,125,140,152,171,172,254,353,380,414,428,483,559,570,572,588,644,663,676,689,808,1037,1129,1229,1559,2545,2675,3065,3138,4035,4160,4877,5052,5519,6029,6866,7405,7968,8054,8261],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.1317941569733974,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,3.321622407243643,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,6.381097563453174,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.1765612129984904,4.251382278653714,2.2242236634876535,2.317169775997098,2.3131195476980753,2.373087554090762,2.5001408943598484,2.889652074525771,3.0266839340212486,3.102062070196872,3.1254654785810323,3.3721070011625462,3.613480989738201,3.5727776966246974,3.944626193933877,3.4933926673701317,3.6375061693251913,3.5670958631572662,3.7297814454343623,3.6105180246075443,3.634471265630037,7.604704276538395,4.062925891962901,8.394243914521228,4.3215761317340196,4.6295428753573065,5.214056214914456,5.521540914662417,5.5623629091826725,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,5.907203395474402,6.489124940924123,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.4000770478830847E-5,5.363663065914252E-5,5.405360431735404E-5,5.374128201575603E-5,5.374216250615593E-5,5.366704170270845E-5,5.3826655004180725E-5,0.08083045042832838,5.376496604692652E-5,5.964929491520978E-5,0.5075595401221313,5.3557760168882216E-5,5.4557389203297845E-5,5.5335662348506924E-5,5.359681392888818E-5,5.344869546003653E-5,5.478190630945496E-5,5.383169815545398E-5,5.366468552163101E-5,5.3709164004509826E-5,5.42288316673115E-5,5.388503174634858E-5,5.394638802969749E-5,5.400450921222043E-5,5.44189660757752

{"value":"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says \"that didn't really happen, this happened\" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'.

{"value":"\"While traveling in the mountains, a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly departs, leaving no trace of its presence. Unbeknownst to the man, he has been attacked by a werewolf and now he's inherited the curse associated with such creatures. Now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Horrifically re-produced from the original Spanish, \"The Fury of the Wolf Man\" loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form. Lycanthropic Paul Naschy's werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual. Dominatrix scientist Perla Cristal and sexy assistant Verónica Luján never get close enough to truly titillate.

{"value":"I read the book and the book was fascinating.<br /><br />This movie, it's direction, the screenplay, and the acting were totally insufferable. I cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story.<br /><br />I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. Would not ever recommend this film to anyone I know. <br /><br />Simply, one of he worst adaptations I have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth.<br /><br />The cinematography was indeed the only highlight.

{"value":"After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, location shooting, etc. This one takes place at a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. Mabel Normand is there with her friend also, and Chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and Mabel's friends. He then woos Mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior. Lots of slapstick in here, but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching Chaplin develop. The print I saw was badly deteriorated, which may have affected its enjoyment. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * of 4

{"value":"Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. It initially looks great but ultimately provides NO satisfaction--none.<br /><br />The plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic plot AND Robin Williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! It's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible Popeye picture Williams did at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school.<br /><br />The film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. I really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment.","finished_norm":["watch","thi","movi","be","like","eat","a","banquet","of","noth","but","meringu","it","initi","look","great","but","ultim","provid","no","satisfactionnonebr","br","the","plot","be","a","muddl","mess","about","a","toi","factori","and","the","forc","of","evil","so","how","be","it","possibl","that","with","thi","basic","plot","and","robin","william","that","the","movi","still","turn","out","so","badli","it","becaus","the","pictur","be","all","appear","with","no","substanc","whatsoevermuch","like","the","terribl","popey","pictur","william","do","at","the","begin","of","hi","film","career","the","film","must","have","cost","a","fortun","but","perhap","there","be","not","enough","monei","leav","over","to","hire","writer","who","have","graduat","grade","schoolbr","br","the","film","be","on","unfunni","joke","that","go","on","and","on","and","on","and","on","i","realli","be","unsur","why","it","be","make","in","the","placeit","certainli","be","not","make","to","provid","ani","sort","of","entertain"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","like","eat","banquet","noth","meringu","initi","look","great","ultim","provid","satisfactionnonebr","br","plot","muddl","mess","toi","factori","forc","evil","possibl","thi","basic","plot","robin","william","movi","still","turn","badli","becaus","pictur","appear","substanc","whatsoevermuch","like","terribl","popey","pictur","william","begin","hi","film","career","film","must","cost","fortun","perhap","enough","monei","leav","hire","writer","graduat","grade","schoolbr","br","film","unfunni","joke","go","realli","unsur","make","placeit","certainli","make","provid","ani","sort","entertain"],"filtered2":["watch","like","eat","banquet","noth","meringu","initi","look","great","ultim","provid","satisfactionnonebr","plot","muddl","mess","toi","factori","forc","evil","possibl","basic","plot","robin","william","still","turn","badli","becaus","pictur","appear","substanc","whatsoevermuch","like","terribl","popey","pictur","william","begin","career","must","cost","fortun","perhap","enough","monei","leav","hire","writer","graduat","grade","schoolbr","unfunni","joke","go","realli","unsur","make","placeit","certainli","make","provid","ani","sort","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,13,16,22,27,32,49,51,64,74,93,96,126,141,147,166,169,195,214,269,286,287,311,318,321,338,389,402,407,448,511,599,694,719,735,837,938,948,1014,1226,1412,1439,1464,1627,2530,2940,3181,4393],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,13,16,22,27,32,49,51,64,74,93,96,126,141,147,166,169,195,214,269,286,287,311,318,321,338,389,402,407,448,511,599,694,719,735,837,938,948,1014,1226,1412,1439,1464,1627,2530,2940,3181,4393],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,2.742262257014735,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.883428577602134,1.9486336368009016,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.2391270689902285,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.51289241584188,2.7303758068497004,2.76533567167316,2.780700890737216,2.841890188081905,5.8406676183565125,2.902686292364678,3.09496984188738,2.9720957437368454,3.0914425013694116,3.084424928710765,3.120015873813468,3.2681460658591432,3.3909310864081816,3.6254214301101193,7.343025074620773,7.715229633888494,3.7132521434831514,3.7881170224473255,3.952924996748572,4.049068857301474,4.1302590120314875,4.3095999406873045,4.605250182788262,4.477736862489302,4.506310234933358,4.944927550358424,5.156897801074508,5.541743621979936,5.501738287366237,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.544774048380045E-5,7.493897873147634E-5,7.552155783311444E-5,7.508519346739661E-5,7.508642365375508E-5,7.498146783862164E-5,7.520447322984959E-5,7.494976945474772E-5,7.511828385891356E-5,8.33396353959182E-5,0.7462761346853204,7.482878400224887E-5,7.62254261482758E-5,7.731279860175338E-5,7.488334837093694E-5,7.467640310516229E-5,7.653911256810487E-5,7.521151932132406E-5,7.497817587562023E-5,7.504031945252845E-5,7.576637855526391E-5,7.528603490488341E-5,7.537175947699806E-5,7.54529640942048E-5,7.603202682990175E-5,7.563440073423504E-5,7.88139272568597E-5,7.485102991363033E-5,7.485303235397246E-5,7.504267208814617E-5,7.663768651570005E-5,7.520716145603032E-5,8.072851689496786E-5,7.54187081031417E-5,7.49325018935521E-5,7.527836478580466E-5,7.485741765410523E-5,7.49016528803277E-5,7.467602792487525E-5,7.469540233175735E-5,7.48635326044496E-5,7.565318424218206E-5,7.526875862118635E-5,7.497116699015377E-5,7.588214528115357E-5,7.499994133372263E-5,0.08283812476432433,7.63522771932578E-5,7.471396822268092E-5,7.487909066152578E-5,7.485311977180185E-5,7.6959767938

{"value":"Anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful suckfest. The acting is stiff, the stock generic soundtrack is laughable, the direction is bland and strangest of all, the teacher really isn't all that attractive (making the student's blatant advances all the more awkward). The creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude. I'm certain that some starving kids in Africa could have used the money squandered on this project. Hell, the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it.

{"value":"Tom Wolfe's sprawling, brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among New York snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served. The film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman Tom Hanks as an uncaring Yuppie, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) as the darling of New York's literati. The most serious miscasting was in the director's chair. Robert Altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all of his visual sophistication, has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. The resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status.

{"value":"Supposedly a \"social commentary\" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970's, \"Nightmare\" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised \"babe in prison\" movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of \"Gilligan's Island\") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard.

{"value":"The first scene in 'Problem Child' has a baby peeing into a nun's face. For this movie, that's witty. A nasty, mean-spirited 'comedy', it's inept on so many levels it beggars belief. John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from Hell, and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note, annoying performances and puerile humour. And what the hell's Jack Warden doing in this mess? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it's done with the crudity, the movie is made so badly it's quite a bizarre experience. But never mind all that. The lowlight of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me, you will want to smack him right in the

{"value":"I saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man. They drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or,duh, burn him. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film. Where is the mummy? Really just a curse unleashed.

{"value":"<br /><br />The movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie. It´s about the boy who is picked on, has no parents and is madly in love with the schools #1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can´t guess coming in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. Maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest. You can´t get away from thinking of movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All of those titles are better. I almost walked out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation, BUT not even that is anything to put in the christmas-tree!

{"value":"A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into Frosty the Snowman's evil twin. Then goes on a killing spree. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it is scary. If you're five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie which may become a cult film. I'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm just not in it. Even though I didn't like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I found amusing. Such as the bathtub scene and the post-explosion scene with the Picasso reference. It was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill Jack and he just doesn't seem to want to die. In short, \"Jack Frost\" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie

{"value":"The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better.<br /><br />No, the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come.<br /><br />But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin-music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40+ women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then by all means, don't miss it.<br /><br />I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a pretty horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it.<br /><br />The verdict: 4/10.

{"value":"Man, was I disappointed.<br /><br />1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /><br />2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateurish script.<br /><br />3) The movie suffers from horrible pacing. It jumps around through in a jumbled, confusing manner.<br /><br />4) The story doesn't even make sense. Why does he want to break the football streak? What about the stupid violin music? None of it is explained.<br /><br />5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv, saying \"Lookit me! Lookit me I'm being funny!\" This was a bad attempt at making another \"Love At First Bite\".<br /><br />I like Larry Cohen movies, but man he failed here. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll.

{"value":"And thats about all that is. This thing is slow. The actors have ability, they just don't seem motivated to put forth the effort. The plot isn't that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all. The accents, when there are any, are British. Uh, lots of these folks are supposed to be Danes. OK, OK, accents aren't that important. But language is. I don't think they used words like \"yeah\" and \"OK\" in Beowulf's day. And that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him? Did he ever reload that thing? Did he ever sight it in? Or was Beowulf just that bad an aim? Well, his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters. Those were rather off too. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Just one that I can think of.

{"value":"This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />I find \"The Wooden Horse\" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but \"The Wooden Horse\" is told in a very plain way. It's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. The first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. The latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film!

{"value":"was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing any plot details--on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place. It was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard. Later on, in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven. This was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn't be an option. These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had. Also, I found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer.","finished_norm":["be","sort","of","enjoi","thi","movi","until","the","issu","of","ed","norton","facial","hair","without","reveal","ani","plot","detailson","on","afternoon","he","be","sport","a","light","beard","but","by","the","same","even","the","beard","be","go","and","a","veri","luxuri","moustach","be","in","place","it","be","much","full","than","the","moustach","that","go","with","the","beard","late","on","in","the","cours","of","a","dark","night","in","the","open","the","moustach","be","go","and","he","appear","clean","haven","thi","be","on","a","occas","where","stop","to","shave","would","not","be","a","option","thi","continu","discrep","total","distract","me","from","the","rest","of","the","movi","and","ruin","ani","credibl","it","have","previous","have","conjur","i","find","the","lengthi","scene","of","the","cowboi","alon","in","hi","bedroom","be","wai","too","reminisc","of","de","niro","in","taxi","driver","even","if","it","be","mean","to","be","a","homag","it","be","lai","on","too","thickli","for","thi","viewer"],"filtered":["sort","enjoi","thi","movi","issu","ed","norton","facial","hair","without","reveal","ani","plot","detailson","afternoon","sport","light","beard","even","beard","go","veri","luxuri","moustach","place","much","full","moustach","go","beard","late","cours","dark","night","open","moustach","go","appear","clean","haven","thi","occas","stop","shave","option","thi","continu","discrep","total","distract","rest","movi","ruin","ani","credibl","previous","conjur","find","lengthi","scene","cowboi","alon","hi","bedroom","wai","reminisc","de","niro","taxi","driver","even","mean","homag","lai","thickli","thi","viewer"],"filtered2":["sort","enjoi","issu","ed","norton","facial","hair","without","reveal","ani","plot","detailson","afternoon","sport","light","beard","even","beard","go","veri","luxuri","moustach","place","full","moustach","go","beard","late","cours","dark","night","open","moustach","go","appear","clean","haven","occas","stop","shave","option","continu","discrep","total","distract","rest","ruin","ani","credibl","previous","conjur","find","lengthi","scene","cowboi","alon","bedroom","wai","reminisc","de","niro","taxi","driver","even","mean","homag","lai","thickli","viewer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,15,19,27,32,33,38,39,88,125,150,164,169,184,199,200,210,226,242,269,279,315,336,353,368,433,457,710,750,806,813,833,1208,1356,1376,1495,1676,1706,1734,2077,2228,2344,2386,2391,2425,2436,2982,3024,3029,3226,3432,3584,3933,4438,4884,6944,8310],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,15,19,27,32,33,38,39,88,125,150,164,169,184,199,200,210,226,242,269,279,315,336,353,368,433,457,710,750,806,813,833,1208,1356,1376,1495,1676,1706,1734,2077,2228,2344,2386,2391,2425,2436,2982,3024,3029,3226,3432,3584,3933,4438,4884,6944,8310],"values":[1.852034211452262,2.912480743411154,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,2.600540117735859,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,2.0317223413467334,2.2242236634876535,2.332712011146513,2.3930275298746078,2.4214486257841834,2.496249838866882,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.687151791517189,2.5940874818617203,2.689504733779216,2.76533567167316,2.7910771187233068,2.854312708080462,2.9233055795674137,3.0266839340212486,3.1346146732346205,3.164467636384302,3.3243163373261977,3.6528204042982337,4.030886538218284,3.880604335168946,3.8204358137024927,3.900174431363043,4.297765483040301,4.396611317676934,4.535724120139652,4.5432147918688095,4.770124825978496,4.671389985292807,4.911775343041523,4.944927550358424,5.039114765418124,5.051537285416681,5.129498826886393,5.3064295350454715,5.129498826886393,5.102830579804232,5.541743621979936,5.444579873526289,5.541743621979936,6.2980697041614135,5.719991853386255,17.467938022339016,5.770002273960917,5.967828017290836,6.600350576034347,20.383519771425913,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.014881148687129E-5,4.981064632718025E-5,5.019787660547484E-5,4.990783273967252E-5,4.990865042332202E-5,4.983888810368425E-5,4.998711593997906E-5,4.9817818734778854E-5,4.9929827352043533E-5,0.09889778249652,0.2907368391285076,4.9737401791725116E-5,0.04590165207959462,5.1388483442181364E-5,4.977366978625606E-5,4.963611683828326E-5,5.087422768312659E-5,4.9991799355424066E-5,4.9836699992669645E-5,0.05935127000963374,5.0360604715878486E-5,5.004132857828469E-5,5.0098308222462276E-5,5.0152283530590137E-5,5.0537176541107444E-5,5.027288133510148E-5,5.2386257761991916E-5,4.9752188265237364E-5,4.975351925278699E-5,4.987956951245699E-5,5.093974808551066E-5,4.998890275754454E-5,0.12589179659595218,5.0129514164309545E-5,4.9806341284749414E-5,5.003623038245675E-5,4.9756434086130725E-5,4.9785836477861544E-5,4.9635

{"value":"I see a lot of movies. Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. Computers where still \"a big mystery\" for the most of us and the movie was convincing, in it's own way.<br /><br />This one, however, looks like a low budget Wednesday night special. Total crap, from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot is so weak, you won't believe it until you see the movie (which I would not recommend in the first place). I can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie. But hey, with that script I would've been surprised if ANYONE could do a good job acting. Lots of cliché scenes. CGI looks like it's taken out of the '86 version.<br /><br />Bah, no, I'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this.

This episode, however, is proof that the show has jumped the shark.

However, there is such thing as ridiculous as in \"this is the worst thing I've ever seen.\" And indeed, this is the worst episode of Stargate I've ever seen.

I am aware that the translation of book to movie isn't perfect but this movie was the worst ever. The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it. I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie. This really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written.<br /><br />The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen even though I was skeptical at first about Mary-Louise Parker. I only wish they'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","know","what","margaret","atwood","be","think","to","allow","thi","movi","to","have","the","same","name","a","her","book","i","have","alwai","be","a","big","fan","of","the","robber","bride","and","be","so","excit","to","learn","there","be","a","movi","in","the","work","i","be","awar","that","the","translat","of","book","to","movi","be","not","perfect","but","thi","movi","be","the","wrong","ever","the","name","of","the","woman","be","correct","and","some","of","the","back","stori","be","correct","but","that","be","about","it","i","feel","like","i","lose","a","good","portion","of","my","time","try","to","make","it","through","thi","movi","thi","realli","should","have","be","a","miniseri","to","tell","the","stori","the","wai","it","be","writtenbr","br","the","actor","for","roz","toni","chari","and","zenia","be","wellchosen","even","though","i","be","skeptic","at","about","marylouis","parker","i","onli","wish","thei","have","have","a","well","script","to","work","with","becaus","thi","realli","have","noth","to","do","with","the","book","at","all"],"filtered":["know","margaret","atwood","think","allow","thi","movi","name","book","alwai","big","fan","robber","bride","excit","learn","movi","work","awar","translat","book","movi","perfect","thi","movi","wrong","ever","name","woman","correct","back","stori","correct","feel","like","lose","good","portion","time","try","make","thi","movi","thi","realli","miniseri","tell","stori","wai","writtenbr","br","actor","roz","toni","chari","zenia","wellchosen","even","though","skeptic","marylouis","parker","onli","wish","thei","well","script","work","becaus","thi","realli","noth","book"],"filtered2":["know","margaret","atwood","think","allow","name","book","alwai","big","fan","robber","bride","excit","learn","work","awar","translat","book","perfect","wrong","ever","name","woman","correct","back","stori","correct","feel","like","lose","good","portion","time","try","make","realli","miniseri","tell","stori","wai","writtenbr","actor","roz","toni","chari","zenia","wellchosen","even","though","skeptic","marylouis","parker","onli","wish","well","script","work","becaus","realli","noth","book"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,11,12,13,17,20,22,25,26,33,36,41,43,44,48,49,63,70,77,82,86,90,140,143,151,197,221,399,430,521,524,677,1430,1456,1465,1625,2023,2174,2414,3056,3114,4745,4935,7215],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,11,12,13,17,20,22,25,26,33,36,41,43,44,48,49,63,70,77,82,86,90,140,143,151,197,221,399,430,521,524,677,1430,1456,1465,1625,2023,2174,2414,3056,3114,4745,4935,7215],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,2.5541073880211935,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,3.3910232448024944,1.6920303308087352,1.8729627573220065,2.094675786251684,1.9463902258768238,2.020196584395323,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,2.317169775997098,4.681980408231769,8.400736460430558,2.558331832813986,2.6423424573643777,3.129115117668582,3.2189558216683714,3.4076979462652486,3.4028786598293,3.6559115968679063,4.558366596889411,4.8085911068062925,8.96960805942479,4.671389985292807,5.259176650194926,5.3560264761848435,5.170884043049248,5.850044981634453,5.649374286172302,6.489124940924123,6.101359409915359,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.6533045811006999,8.262326159339759E-5,8.326557866694578E-5,8.278446926635025E-5,8.278582559667428E-5,8.267010755625913E-5,8.291598003928544E-5,8.263515880319048E-5,8.282095276426833E-5,9.188532607428119E-5,0.34019534473920077,8.250176743784205E-5,8.40416220146843E-5,8.524049421969603E-5,8.256192686600757E-5,8.23337613222672E-5,8.438747400736628E-5,8.292374864073906E-5,8.266647803361516E-5,8.273499384605551E-5,8.353550343656562E-5,8.30059050919935E-5,8.31004199074701E-5,8.318995128945096E-5,8.382839142701828E-5,8.338999253935325E-5,8.689554940800618E-5,8.252629445684561E-5,8.252850222848881E-5,8.27375877221847E-5,8.449615578014082E-5,8.291894391761303E-5,8.900646208911237E-5,8.31521826707874E-5,8.261612061705696E-5,8.299744847481212E-5,8.253333719963691E-5,8.258210832955742E-5,8.233334767079336E-5,8.235470873969413E-5,8.254007918025216E-5,8.341070211822688E-5,8.298685728894859E-5,8.265875045329347E-5,8.366314094429396E-5,8.269047533340409E-5,8.543786920385153E-5,8.418148043349862E-5,8.237517838697862E-5,8.255723256880174E-5,8.252859861018905E-5,8.485126360356459E-5,8.2558460863034E-5,8.234739752345348E-5,8.325127805947843E-5,8.2579725730919E-5,8.880541927699362E-5,8.25116693067164E-5,8.237422576529771E-5,8.27

{"value":"CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. An easily forgotten movie. Even in spite of a good car chase sequence, this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly. A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence breed the same in return. This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive-in fare. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can't boost the calibre of this crime drama.

{"value":"OK, how's this for original- this mean, rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers, and two creepy servants, provided they spend the week in his spooky old house. What happens that night will surprise only those who haven't seen a movie or television show before. After a string of murders in which the victims look like they're bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twist ending. The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks. There are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of \"Matlock.\" I will give credit where it's due- the closing scene is clever and amusing, if you're still awake.","finished_norm":["okai","how","thi","for","origin","thi","mean","rich","old","geezer","leav","hi","estat","to","hi","adult","child","all","of","them","ungrat","loser","and","two","creepi","servant","provid","thei","spend","the","week","in","hi","spooki","old","hous","what","happen","that","night","will","surpris","onli","that","who","have","not","see","a","movi","or","televis","show","befor","after","a","string","of","murder","in","which","the","victim","look","like","thei","re","ble","restaur","ketchup","we","have","a","painfulli","obviou","twist","end","the","cast","be","lead","by","some","onc","respect","actor","must","have","be","desper","for","their","paycheck","there","be","conjur","a","few","secondti","actor","who","be","rise","at","the","time","but","long","forget","now","a","a","result","the","film","gener","all","the","drama","and","mysteri","of","a","episod","of","matlock","i","will","give","credit","where","it","due","the","close","scene","be","clever","and","amus","if","you","re","still","awak"],"filtered":["okai","thi","origin","thi","mean","rich","old","geezer","leav","hi","estat","hi","adult","child","ungrat","loser","two","creepi","servant","provid","thei","spend","week","hi","spooki","old","hous","happen","night","surpris","onli","see","movi","televis","show","befor","string","murder","victim","look","like","thei","re","ble","restaur","ketchup","painfulli","obviou","twist","end","cast","lead","onc","respect","actor","must","desper","paycheck","conjur","secondti","actor","rise","time","long","forget","result","film","gener","drama","mysteri","episod","matlock","give","credit","due","close","scene","clever","amus","re","still","awak"],"filtered2":["okai","origin","mean","rich","old","geezer","leav","estat","adult","child","ungrat","loser","two","creepi","servant","provid","spend","week","spooki","old","hous","happen","night","surpris","onli","see","televis","show","befor","string","murder","victim","look","like","re","ble","restaur","ketchup","painfulli","obviou","twist","end","cast","lead","onc","respect","actor","must","desper","paycheck","conjur","secondti","actor","rise","time","long","forget","result","gener","drama","mysteri","matlock","give","credit","due","close","scene","clever","amus","re","still","awak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,11,16,19,24,28,30,39,41,47,64,67,68,69,74,79,88,92,94,99,141,157,180,191,210,213,225,236,273,283,295,326,356,373,383,403,435,447,463,535,568,663,694,695,708,734,755,788,857,922,937,955,1240,1525,1729,2158,2622,2637,3069,3123,3295,3636,5960],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,11,16,19,24,28,30,39,41,47,64,67,68,69,74,79,88,92,94,99,141,157,180,191,210,213,225,236,273,283,295,326,356,373,383,403,435,447,463,535,568,663,694,695,708,734,755,788,857,922,937,955,1240,1525,1729,2158,2622,2637,3069,3123,3295,3636,5960],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.5538940054862738,3.1375198335242067,1.7064694353107215,1.883428577602134,3.9141830778533158,4.012839573363895,2.127032521151058,1.9486336368009016,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.0489535369135887,2.08112281984698,2.056430207256609,2.2657547357741192,2.3360150694757706,2.7097314792693545,2.5460113484259455,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.641219492619754,2.617923930016232,2.9674191958529437,2.7678802023081546,2.7910771187233068,2.942840385588056,3.028335462059722,3.0316467233633775,3.0433232530252132,3.189397019426827,3.2829611516442836,3.2070272508030975,3.3467891931782563,3.4986697244709752,3.4471119148061256,3.7297814454343623,3.6715125373103863,3.6284289511740746,3.6683728173057184,3.79165684915245,3.79165684915245,3.753391311073496,3.9612932464190886,4.030886538218284,4.030886538218284,4.017463517886143,4.3095999406873045,4.6973654716960676,4.6973654716960676,5.064116067623542,5.339219357868463,5.408212229355414,5.5623629091826725,5.463272006538442,5.626901430320244,5.649374286172302,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.091162342775127E-5,6.050088211100285E-5,6.097121877885147E-5,6.0618926427199116E-5,6.061991960005933E-5,6.053518506663306E-5,6.0715225188785585E-5,6.050959384270223E-5,6.064564146802383E-5,0.2208280204841272,0.6439958399322077,0.02607016537453209,6.15394765090487E-5,6.241735066389044E-5,6.045596975775545E-5,6.028889554163989E-5,6.179272662570567E-5,6.072091374708803E-5,6.053252734872933E-5,6.0582698051401334E-5,6.116887118751545E-5,6.078107280733506E-5,6.0850281279605654E-5,6.091584063277083E-5,6.138333841430333E-5,6.106232083512879E-5,6.362926480167798E-5,6.042987792666015E-5,6.043149456741406E-
