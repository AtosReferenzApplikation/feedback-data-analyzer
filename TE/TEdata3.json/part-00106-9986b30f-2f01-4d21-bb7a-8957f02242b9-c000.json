{"value":"Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) as they face off against Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (Who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie, the most poignant is Who's idea was it to cast country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets. No, don't get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg. Strangely one suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, however Lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it. However despite the disastrous casting, Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. He gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson is playing a robot) despite the miscasting, Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasted but basically Knights is baffling failure. You stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper. (This is a movie where a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack) Worst of all it ends in a what if sequel, thankfully this has yet to materialize although I still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event.<br /><br />* out of

{"value":"I'm starting to write this review during a break as I watch the movie. It's the first time I've tried doing that, but I'm having trouble getting through this one without occasional breaks. That's not because it's intense but because it's bad.<br /><br />It's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable, especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on screen being tragic and bitchy, self-indulgent and self-pitying. This would have been a much better movie if they'd just left that character out of the story.<br /><br />He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe somebody decided that if they couldn't make Ryan believable they'd just make him obnoxious. The problem with that is: Who cares if a spoiled, whining, obnoxious jerk is dying? Not me.<br /><br />The ONLY thing this character has going for him is the fact that he's dying, and sorry, but that's just not enough. Dying doesn't make anybody special. We're ALL dying, sooner or later. It doesn't give anybody the right to expect sympathy while acting like a jerk.<br /><br />The other two characters, and the actors playing them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are very much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pitying interruptions, would have made a much better movie.

{"value":"What begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns, almost instantaneously, into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible.<br /><br />What, for instance, causes Gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at Tommy's parents house? Why would Heinrich, although admittedly a sleezebag, want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life, by robbing and possibly murdering his customers? Why does the seemingly sensible Tommy believe that Heinrich could be a murderer (based almost entirely on a dream), and even if that were believable, why wouldn't he go to the police? And why didn't Gale activate the alarm when she got home, especially after scolding Howie about it being off? Of course, all of these events are necessary for the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely) to unfold. And it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his date rape, to the coroner's misidentification of Gale, to the final \"joke\" about Gale and Howie still being dead, is more tasteless and pathetic than

{"value":"After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll film and I picked out Seed because I happened to stumble on it in a local DVD-store and it's supposed to be one of his better films.<br /><br />While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. Maybe he should stick to comedy?! The few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times.<br /><br />I hope Uwe Boll will one day learn what makes a good film, because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then.

those.","finished_norm":["after","have","see","and","love","postal","ye","i","actual","love","postal","i","decid","to","try","anoth","uw","boll","film","and","i","pick","out","se","becaus","i","happen","to","stumbl","on","it","in","a","local","dvdstore","and","it","suppos","to","be","on","of","hi","well","filmsbr","br","while","the","to","minut","of","the","film","be","veri","promis","and","seem","like","the","begin","of","a","not","too","mainstream","psycholog","thriller","it","soon","go","downhil","from","there","and","eventu","degrad","into","on","of","the","much","gener","slasher","film","i","have","see","so","far","includ","a","massiv","amount","of","plot","hole","unrealist","emot","respons","and","subpar","act","it","seem","like","boll","try","hi","well","to","come","up","with","a","decent","plot","but","after","a","while","just","give","up","on","it","mayb","he","should","stick","to","comedi","the","few","good","thing","about","thi","film","be","that","he","doe","manag","to","creat","a","overal","creepi","atmospher","that","the","special","effect","be","well","than","i","expect","and","the","soundtrack","doe","go","good","with","the","overal","atmospher","but","the","unbal","pace","of","thi","film","combin","with","the","utter","gener","natur","thereof","make","he","last","half","hour","quit","tediou","to","watch","which","ruin","my","experi","altogeth","there","be","a","veri","fairli","good","do","shock","scene","but","thei","seem","to","be","there","for","the","shock","valu","alon","and","let","not","forget","the","camera","work","that","be","pretti","nauseat","at","timesbr","br","i","hope","uw","boll","will","on","dai","learn","what","make","a","good","film","becaus","between","a","lot","of","horribl","film","he","doe","seem","to","make","a","decent","film","everi","now","and","then","se","just","be","not","on","of","that"],"filtered":["see","love","postal","ye","actual","love","postal","decid","try","anoth","uw","boll","film","pick","se","becaus","happen","stumbl","local","dvdstore","suppos","hi","well","filmsbr","br","minut","film","veri","promis","seem","like","begin","mainstream","psycholog","thriller","soon","go","downhil","eventu","degrad","much","gener","slasher","film","see","far","includ","massiv","amount","plot","hole","unrealist","emot","respons","subpar","act","seem","like","boll","try","hi","well","come","decent","plot","give","mayb","stick","comedi","good","thing","thi","film","doe","manag","creat","overal","creepi","atmospher","special","effect","well","expect","soundtrack","doe","go","good","overal","atmospher","unbal","pace","thi","film","combin","utter","gener","natur","thereof","make","last","half","hour","quit","tediou","watch","ruin","experi","altogeth","veri","fairli","good","shock","scene","thei","seem","shock","valu","alon","let","forget","camera","work","pretti","nauseat","timesbr","br","hope","uw","boll","dai","learn","make","good","film","becaus","lot","horribl","film","doe","seem","make","decent","film","everi","se"],"filtered2":["see","love","postal","ye","actual","love","postal","decid","try","anoth","uw","boll","pick","se","becaus","happen","stumbl","local","dvdstore","suppos","well","filmsbr","minut","veri","promis","seem","like","begin","mainstream","psycholog","thriller","soon","go","downhil","eventu","degrad","gener","slasher","see","far","includ","massiv","amount","plot","hole","unrealist","emot","respons","subpar","act","seem","like","boll","try","well","come","decent","plot","give","mayb","stick","comedi","good","thing","doe","manag","creat","overal","creepi","atmospher","special","effect","well","expect","soundtrack","doe","go","good","overal","atmospher","unbal","pace","combin","utter","gener","natur","thereof","make","last","half","hour","quit","tediou","watch","ruin","experi","altogeth","veri","fairli","good","shock","scene","seem","shock","valu","alon","let","forget","camera","work","pretti","nauseat","timesbr","hope","uw","boll","dai","learn","make","good","becaus","lot","horribl","doe","seem","make","decent","everi","se"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,15,18,19,20,21,22,29,30,32,34,35,36,48,52,54,59,72,73,78,85,94,101,106,120,124,127,130,132,144,147,149,163,174,181,203,206,209,225,230,231,249,301,309,333,345,362,373,412,416,430,446,449,451,456,457,475,506,508,546,683,710,714,716,731,755,772,796,810,819,835,915,968,1024,1235,1264,1505,1701,1735,1779,1848,1937,2526,2550,2617,2976,3055,3092,3268,3560,5599,6886,7041],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,15,18,19,20,21,22,29,30,32,34,35,36,48,52,54,59,72,73,78,85,94

{"value":"I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: The story (or actually the lack there of) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance'. Bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only 'director' Bilal didn't take himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic, it looks like Bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here. Well, there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, only pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated, it is quite a problem that the CGI-effects look so fake. If the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilal's a dead guy, since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie.","finished_norm":["i","love","scienc","fiction","i","be","fascin","by","egyptian","mythologi","and","i","appreci","digit","anim","i","figur","a","movi","that","combin","thi","three","would","be","at","littl","enjoy","i","can","not","have","be","much","wrong","the","stori","or","actual","the","lack","there","of","be","complet","uninspir","and","lack","imagin","while","imagin","usual","be","the","big","compon","of","ani","scienc","fiction","stori","the","dialogu","and","act","be","even","wrong","than","in","a","averag","porno","movi","especi","thoma","kretschmann","give","new","mean","to","the","term","bad","perform","bad","act","would","not","have","be","such","a","huge","problem","if","onli","director","bilal","do","not","take","himself","so","serious","all","the","line","sound","like","thei","be","suppos","to","be","poetic","it","look","like","bilal","realli","think","he","have","make","a","piec","of","art","here","good","there","no","art","or","poetri","to","be","find","in","thi","piec","of","junk","onli","pretenti","thi","man","should","realli","stick","to","make","comic","sinc","he","fail","on","all","possibl","account","a","a","director","wrong","of","all","be","the","terribl","digit","anim","which","be","so","ugli","that","it","actual","turn","watch","thi","movi","into","a","physic","pain","experi","the","graphic","look","so","fake","thei","even","make","the","werewolf","in","van","hels","look","like","live","actor","and","sinc","half","the","charact","be","cgianim","it","be","quit","a","problem","that","the","cgieffect","look","so","fake","if","the","egyptian","god","actual","exist","then","bilal","a","dead","gui","sinc","thei","will","no","doubt","take","gruesom","reveng","on","him","for","the","ridicul","wai","in","which","he","portrai","them","in","thi","disastr","bad","movi"],"filtered":["love","scienc","fiction","fascin","egyptian","mythologi","appreci","digit","anim","figur","movi","combin","thi","three","littl","enjoy","much","wrong","stori","actual","lack","complet","uninspir","lack","imagin","imagin","usual","big","compon","ani","scienc","fiction","stori","dialogu","act","even","wrong","averag","porno","movi","especi","thoma","kretschmann","give","new","mean","term","bad","perform","bad","act","huge","problem","onli","director","bilal","take","serious","line","sound","like","thei","suppos","poetic","look","like","bilal","realli","think","make","piec","art","good","art","poetri","find","thi","piec","junk","onli","pretenti","thi","man","realli","stick","make","comic","sinc","fail","possibl","account","director","wrong","terribl","digit","anim","ugli","actual","turn","watch","thi","movi","physic","pain","experi","graphic","look","fake","thei","even","make","werewolf","van","hels","look","like","live","actor","sinc","half","charact","cgianim","quit","problem","cgieffect","look","fake","egyptian","god","actual","exist","bilal","dead","gui","sinc","thei","doubt","take","gruesom","reveng","ridicul","wai","portrai","thi","disastr","bad","movi"],"filtered2":["love","scienc","fiction","fascin","egyptian","mythologi","appreci","digit","anim","figur","combin","three","littl","enjoy","wrong","stori","actual","lack","complet","uninspir","lack","imagin","imagin","usual","big","compon","ani","scienc","fiction","stori","dialogu","act","even","wrong","averag","porno","especi","thoma","kretschmann","give","new","mean","term","bad","perform","bad","act","huge","problem","onli","director","bilal","take","serious","line","sound","like","suppos","poetic","look","like","bilal","realli","think","make","piec","art","good","art","poetri","find","piec","junk","onli","pretenti","man","realli","stick","make","comic","sinc","fail","possibl","account","director","wrong","terribl","digit","anim","ugli","actual","turn","watch","physic","pain","experi","graphic","look","fake","even","make","werewolf","van","hels","look","like","live","actor","sinc","half","charact","cgianim","quit","problem","cgieffect","look","fake","egyptian","god","actual","exist","bilal","dead","gui","sinc","doubt","take","gruesom","reveng","ridicul","wai","portrai","disastr","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,21,25,27,30,31,33,38,41,45,52,54,55,58,82,87,88,96,103,105,107,116,120,149,162,166,167,178,183,206,215,218,224,228,248,265,267,274,277,333,340,352,371,382,402,415,416,444,459,469,480,528,567,639,643,736,818,858,871,895,910,916,961,962,968,970,1047,1146,1258,1482,1501,1549,1945,2105,2315,2420,3861,3862,4472,4598,4921,6211,6354],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,21,2

{"value":"William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />One tale is the old retread of \"The Hook\", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies.<br /><br />Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. A bit corny, but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale. The acting is understandably not award worthy. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H.

{"value":"Standard \"paint-by-numbers\" monster fare, filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big-creature movies. It's like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them, which were shuffled, and dealt. Whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script. <br /><br />Characters are so cliché-ridden, that you can play a game of \"Guess who ends up as a monster meal\" after less than ten minutes into the movie, and probably get every single one right--including the order that they will get devoured. Many of the characters are so obnoxious, that you root for the creature to shut them up. Some of the main characters include: a Billy Idol clone who surfs with sharks, a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls, a Capt. Ahab guy with a vendetta, and Ahab's girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar. Oh, and a big, big beast in need of anger management therapy.<br /><br />Along the way, people argue a lot, pretty girls run around with wet t-shirts, couples make out on exotic beaches, explosions occur, ruins of a shrine appear, and greasy-faced pirates drop by. <br /><br />Amusing, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the callousness by characters when other people were killed. After one violent demise, they make one-liner jokes. I could almost hear rim shots.<br /><br />Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes to waste, and you want to laugh at a so-bad-it's-good-movie. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one.","finished_norm":["standard","paintbynumb","monster","fare","fill","with","a","bunch","of","routin","plot","devic","from","bigcreatur","movi","it","like","somebodi","have","a","deck","of","card","with","plot","idea","from","other","movi","write","on","them","which","be","shuffl","and","deal","whatev","plot","line","and","charact","come","up","in","the","deal","be","then","toss","into","the","script","br","br","charact","be","so","clichéridden","that","you","can","plai","a","game","of","guess","who","end","up","a","a","monster","meal","after","littl","than","ten","minut","into","the","movi","and","probabl","get","everi","singl","on","rightinclud","the","order","that","thei","will","get","devour","mani","of","the","charact","be","so","obnoxi","that","you","root","for","the","creatur","to","shut","them","up","some","of","the","main","charact","includ","a","billi","idol","clone","who","surf","with","shark","a","loudmouth","brat","who","flash","bankrol","a","capt","ahab","gui","with","a","vendetta","and","ahab","girlfriend","who","doe","sleazi","danc","at","a","bar","oh","and","a","big","big","beast","in","ne","of","anger","manag","therapybr","br","along","the","wai","peopl","argu","a","lot","pretti","girl","run","around","with","wet","tshirt","coupl","make","out","on","exot","beach","explos","occur","ruin","of","a","shrine","appear","and","greasyfac","pirat","drop","by","br","br","amus","for","the","much","part","but","on","thing","bother","me","the","callous","by","charact","when","other","peopl","be","kill","after","on","violent","demis","thei","make","onelin","joke","i","can","almost","hear","rim","shotsbr","br","overal","okai","if","you","have","minut","to","wast","and","you","want","to","laugh","at","a","sobaditsgoodmovi","otherwis","you","mai","want","to","skip","thi","on"],"filtered":["standard","paintbynumb","monster","fare","fill","bunch","routin","plot","devic","bigcreatur","movi","like","somebodi","deck","card","plot","idea","movi","write","shuffl","deal","whatev","plot","line","charact","come","deal","toss","script","br","br","charact","clichéridden","plai","game","guess","end","monster","meal","littl","ten","minut","movi","probabl","get","everi","singl","rightinclud","order","thei","get","devour","mani","charact","obnoxi","root","creatur","shut","main","charact","includ","billi","idol","clone","surf","shark","loudmouth","brat","flash","bankrol","capt","ahab","gui","vendetta","ahab","girlfriend","doe","sleazi","danc","bar","oh","big","big","beast","ne","anger","manag","therapybr","br","along","wai","peopl","argu","lot","pretti","girl","run","around","wet","tshirt","coupl","make","exot","beach","explos","occur","ruin","shrine","appear","greasyfac","pirat","drop","br","br","amus","much","part","thing","bother","callous","charact","peopl","kill","violent","demis","thei","make","onelin","joke","almost","hear","rim","shotsbr","br","overal","okai","minut","wast","want","laugh","sobaditsgoodmovi","otherwis","mai","want","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["standard","paintbynumb","monster","fare","fill","bunch","routin","plot","devic","bigcreatur","like","somebodi","deck","card","plot","idea","write","shuffl","deal","whatev","plot","line","charact","come","deal","toss","script","charact","clichéridden","plai","game","guess","end","monster","meal","littl","ten","minut","probabl","get","everi","singl","rightinclud","order","get","devour","mani","charact","obnoxi","root","creatur","shut","main","charact","includ","billi","idol","clone","surf","shark","loudmouth","brat","flash","bankrol","capt","ahab","gui","vendetta","ahab","girlfriend","doe","sleazi","danc","bar","oh","big","big","beast","ne","anger","manag","therapybr","along","wai","peopl","argu","lot","pretti","girl","run","around","wet","tshirt","coupl","make","exot","beach","explos","occur","ruin","shrine","appear","greasyfac","pirat","drop","amus","part","thing","bother","callous","charact","peopl","kill","violent","demis","make","onelin","joke","almost","hear","rim","shotsbr","overal","okai","minut","wast","want","laugh","sobaditsgoodmovi","otherwis","mai","want","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,10,14,18,23,24,29,32,33,34,37,40,46,50,55,59,61,65,72,76,77,78,82,84,85,89,98,107,110,123,131,133,137,148,169,179,191,214,216,234,243,253,301,324,345,374,412,413,419,439,443,468,492,496,545,553,556,616,627,708,710,730,761,904,931,966,1070,1082,1253,1284,1362,1455,1519,1554,1573,1576,1616,1711,1712,1774,1811,1852,1874,2143,2199,2224,2456,2597,2812,3030,3298,3592,3865,3873,4328,4502,4599,5863,5963,6297,6393,8080,8411],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]}

{"value":"Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is brought to trial but goes totally free. He then rapes Kathy!<br /><br />Objectionable and sick rape film. This movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape. What it is is a badly written and (for the most part) badly acted drama. It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face. To be totally honest however, Hemingway's acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie just went too far when 15 year old Mariel is raped (thankfully that wasn't shown). I do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead. But seriously--having a young girl raped is just revolting.<br /><br />Acting doesn't help. For instance, Margaux was no actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and an actual model I believe) but her acting left a lot to be desired. It lessens the film. Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as the rapist. He wasn't bad but the terrible script worked against him.<br /><br />I do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people.

{"value":"Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not on the payroll apparently. <br /><br />A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation she said, \"Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates. Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O'Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was \"missing the hoop\" or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.<br /><br />So...watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. I thought \"The Last Samurai\" was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be.

{"value":"OK this movie was made for one reason and one reason only TO MAKE MONEY!!The producers obviously didn't care about killing a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg-13 how many pg-13 slashers movies have turned out to be good? Thats like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NONE!! Prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that.<br /><br />My problem with Prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him.....................<br /><br />1)The way he escapes, he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent!! WHAT THE HELL? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2)His intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self, he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her, so does he want to kill her, love her or just plain rape her?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all of his skills?

{"value":"Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute.<br /><br />Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his renditions of \"Havin' My Baby\" and \"Movin' On Up\" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang (if you remember, he \"coordinated\" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun.<br /><br />Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure.

{"value":"A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket. He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he becomes attracted with her ability. His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the pointless \"10 Items or Less\" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie does not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again. Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family?

{"value":"This film reminded me so much of \"A History of Violence\" which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble. Don't these men have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap. Funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small British town except maybe put a mans head in it.<br /><br />Sam Peckinpah who made the \"Wild Bunch\" which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not believable. First of all the location is wrong and does not work. Why place it in England? I would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the American South in the 1930's or something. Second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife.<br /><br />Sam Peckinpah

{"value":"Schlocky '70s horror films...ya gotta love 'em. In contrast to today's boring slasher flicks, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.<br /><br />This is a B movie about the making of a B movie...that went horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an over-the-hill, B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home. Her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add \"realism\". Unfortunately, \"realism\" is something they could have done without.<br /><br />John Carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director.<br /><br />The horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (At least there's truth in advertising.) It's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that there was a movie being made above him.

{"value":"Songwriter Robert Taylor (as Terry) is \"dizzy, slap-happy\" and can't see straight over otherworldly Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). \"She makes the sun shine, even when it's raining,\" Mr. Taylor explains. But, Mr. Taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near Ms. Shearer. Finally, at the Palm Beach casino Shearer frequents, Taylor proclaims \"I love you!\" Shearer brushes him off, as she is engaged to George Sanders (as Tony). However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as \"Her Cardboard Lover\", to make Mr. Sanders jealous.<br /><br />This film's title invites the obvious and appropriate three-word review: \"Her Cardboard Movie\". It is most notable as the last film appearance for Shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from \"He Who Gets Slapped\" (1924, playing another Consuelo) to \"The Women\" (1939). To be fair, this was likely the kind of Shearer film MGM believed audiences wanted to see. However, the part is unflattering.<br /><br />Plucked and powered, Taylor and Shearer were better off in \"The Escape\" (1940). If Shearer had continued, she might have become a better actress than \"leading lady\"; apparently, she was no longer interested, and certainly didn't need the money.

{"value":"BE WARNED. This movie is such a mess. It's a catastrophe. Don't waste your time with this one. I warned you!<br /><br />The acting, story, dialogue, music... basically everything is so over the top, it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to throw up (if the dialogue/acting/story wasn't doing it, it's everyone being shot crooked). You'll feel like you're watching a comedy. The problem is, the parts that are supposedly funny isn't even funny. The acting, story, cinematography, you can feel everything is just trying WAAAAY too hard -- but it never succeeds. Practically every shot is canted, but so what?! This movie just feels like a student film. No wonder they shot this in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film.<br /><br />If you're easily amused or like poor acting, writing, editing, directing, full of clichés, everything that's forced in your face, oh and did I mention poor acting? (well, actually, it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!) then I guess you'll like this movie.<br /><br />I had to watch this for a class. I would have turned it off right away if I could. If you still can't tell by now, I HATED this movie. It made me want to throw up and get my time back... at least I didn't have to pay for this garbage.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum, you know... the guy from Jurassic Park/Independence Day, is in this movie

{"value":"I had recently been watching Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in it. I failed, horribly. Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences, but Johnny Test is \"entertainment\" in it's lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the running gags aren't much gags at all. Kids will love it, and that's about it.<br /><br />Now, this isn't to say that it's all bad. The original opening theme was actually pretty catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a shame, because that was really one of the best things it had going for it.<br /><br />Some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. With a little work, the characters could work well together, but they're too one-dimensional. Then again, this makes it easy for the kids to follow. <br /><br />The pace is a bit too fast as well. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for clever writing. This is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth. On the upside, however, the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest, and that's really the entirety of the target audience.<br /><br />Overall, the show looks very good on paper, but just doesn't succeed in being funny or interesting.

{"value":"Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens, resolved most of the snags; such as the \"whore bitch\" ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had \"no friends,\" as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls . . . and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.<br /><br />It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had a bit more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.<br /><br />Trifling matters, you may well say. I agree, although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job.

{"value":"This isn't one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's better films, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all his heavy drinking, so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery. Then, he escapes and is chased about the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite staff chasing them about, they escape at which point it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon recaptured. However, he awakens and everything AFTER the surgery has all been a dream--there was no sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton isn't as big an incompetent as he seemed in the dream.<br /><br />A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film. Sure, making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low, but in its day it was guaranteed laughs. I'd laugh, too, if there was just something funny to respond to! A lot of energy and that's all.<br /><br />FYI--during one of the chase sequences, Fatty wonders into a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the odds of that?). And, shortly after this, he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted. As a result, the five is now on the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular participant. HOWEVER, the number SHOULD have appeared backwards on Fatty's shirt but came out front-ways--a mistake, as they should have realized the mirror image would have been a backwards

{"value":"I caught this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese \"Green Card\". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I an not adverse to a light hearted films, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this \"a refreshing breath of comedy\". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting.

{"value":"You can't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days, and I had expected it to be campy anyway. (It's not all that campy in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who don't take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to, which kind of shocked me; I assumed the whole purpose with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story, but they use lots of words like \"technological\" and \"physicality\" in the script to get their point across. (Although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members.) Nobody cares about this stupid storyline, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft-core homoeroticisms (which aren't all that edgy). I would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a TV-quality look and acting level. There are a few \"sexy\" scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers, feeling themselves up; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny. And I liked the digs at L. Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones, but it still isn't any good.

{"value":"No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing was of the release was awful. The Gong Show had already \"jumped the shark\" by the time the movie came out, so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic, 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously so, since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think the gag of having everyone, everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and the Unknown Comic again (although, to make the movie \"spicy,\" they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out, this is Phil Hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name he was born with. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions, even though he's much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap

{"value":"After a few lean years, 1968 was a pretty swell time for Elvis: not only did he make that celebrated \"Comeback\" TV Special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore, personally I can forgive him for the misstep that was STAY AWAY, JOE which, at best, emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are indeed embarrassing  as, respectively, a dopey Indian father to Elvis' character and a bawdy bartender who has her eye on Mr. Presley too - but one is glad to see Elvis surrounded by top veteran Hollywood talent like Katy Jurado (as Meredith's Mexican wife), the two Jones  Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic Chief Thundercloud who is Meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day! <br /><br />While there is a surprising (if not unwelcome given their usual blandness) lack of songs, there seems to be no shortage of free-for-all parties were the male Indians hit the bottle steadily while Presley practices his womanizing skills behind their backs! As can be expected, the typically 'Western' Arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy, snoring bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point. On the other hand, the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well

{"value":"THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most over-directed, over-the-top, over-everything mess I've ever seen come out of France. There's nothing worse than a French production trying to out-do films made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror/action/buddy flick. I almost stopped it halfway through because I knew it wouldn't amount to anything but French guys trying to show-off.<br /><br />The film starts off promisingly, like some sort of expansive horror film, but it quickly shifts genres, from horror to action to x-files type to buddy flick, that in the end, CR is all of it and also none of it. It's so full of clichés that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with fades outs and fades ins just at the right expositionary moments, made me groan. I thought only films made in Hollywood used this hackneyed technique.<br /><br />The chase scene, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so over-directed and over-done that it's almost a thing of beauty. The climax on top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the killer(s) with Cassel and Reno playing \"buddies\" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, completely derailed what little credibility

{"value":"My first review of 2010 is \"Into The Blue 2: The Reef\". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef.<br /><br />Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing. A few more days past and the two hired divers found out that they a part of a major deadly plot in which they can't escape otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two big containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core.<br /><br />The movie also has a back story about another person (brother of the lead character) trying to patch things up with his girlfriend, I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple which to me is a complete waste and wasn't needed to be shown.<br /><br />However apart from that, this movie does have some good underwater photography and the colors blend in well which is why it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel only by name. None of the original actors or characters return, it has a dumb plot, stupid characters and a boring

{"value":"The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie.<br /><br />Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater.<br /><br />Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a \"50% loss in revenue\" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%.

{"value":"Let me first state that I enjoy watching \"bad\" movies. It's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's delusional ego doesn't just border on talentless ineptitude, it has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs, and stars as blunt object Arthur Sailes battling scorned wives and the Christian forces of evil as he and his partner Ben \"dead behind the eyes\" Sheets struggle for marital equality. As a libertarian I believe gays should have a right to get married. Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes. The portrayal of all things Christian are so ugly and ham-fisted, trademark Mraovich, that you can't possibly take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor, the bible toting Jesus freak, is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role. That's because Sam \"multitasking\" Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think leading man do the words pasty, balding, and chubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines like domino's pizza, cold and usually wrong. The final tally: you suck at writing, directing, acting and casting. That's the Ed Wood quadruple crown.

{"value":"'The Fox and the Child' is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary 'March of the Penguins.' It focuses around a young girl (wonderfully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her blooming friendship with a fox.<br /><br />There are some truly mesmerizing moments here; badgers mucking about, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-littered forest; one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times. However, there's simply not quite enough of them.<br /><br />Beautifully shot; the cinematography is dazzling. The bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful. It's undeniably a very lush production.<br /><br />The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed. The score is also far too fluffy, or at least it is for my liking; and the screenplay, while subtle, seemingly jumps from one scenario to another, ultimately leaving me almost baffled.<br /><br />While there's a nice moral at the heart of the film, and the rather quiet performance from Noël-Bruneau is quite lovely, the real star is the fox.

{"value":"Remakes (and sequels) have been a staple of Cinema from the beginning of the media. It is pretty much a hit or miss venture though. If you take what's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards, you can have a success. Note, such films like THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) succeeded in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail, miserably.<br /><br />BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is the template for this film. It is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it IMDb**********Ten. The story is simple, Love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. Why, it just happened for the two (2) principals involved at the wrong time. These are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither are conventionally leading Star material, but quality Character Actors. For the details watch the film.<br /><br />Now what went wrong? A T.V. Movie, remade practically scene for scene with name actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least scored IMDb******Six. Both actors though appear disinterested, just showing up to punch their time-clocks and pick up their checks. Neither are involved with their characters or with each other. You do not believe they are in Love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them. That should not be and that's why it fails in its intent. Sometimes it is just better to leave things

{"value":"This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />Now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. It's simply a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word \"designed\" in the loosest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.<br /><br />I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. It sure hasn't been for me. In fact, I think I might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. Next time you're at the video store and you see the The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give them all a miss and play Duck Hunt instead.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","review","of","the","wizard","not","to","be","confus","with","the","wiz","or","mr","wizard","the","wizard","be","a","lateeighti","film","about","a","serious","silent","boi","abil","to","plai","video","game","and","walk","dure","the","entir","open","credit","the","wiz","be","a","unnecessari","updat","of","the","wizard","of","oz","and","mr","wizard","be","that","gui","that","attach","straw","togeth","and","have","some","kid","drink","tang","out","of","itbr","br","now","that","we","have","get","all","that","out","of","the","wai","let","me","sai","thi","there","realli","no","reason","to","see","thi","movi","it","simpli","a","minut","nintendo","commerci","design","to","capit","on","the","powerglov","the","legend","of","zelda","and","super","mario","brother","i","us","the","word","design","in","the","loos","sens","possibl","becaus","it","seem","like","thi","movi","be","write","over","a","weekend","by","a","crack","team","of","peopl","who","have","never","plai","nintendo","and","direct","by","a","man","with","littl","sens","of","styl","than","my","grandmoth","mayb","if","the","writer","and","director","sit","down","and","actual","plai","some","game","togeth","thei","have","realiz","that","thei","be","about","to","film","total","rubbish","and","instead","go","to","vocat","school","to","learn","how","to","instal","car","stereosbr","br","i","hope","that","thi","have","be","a","enlighten","experi","for","you","it","sure","have","not","be","for","me","in","fact","i","think","i","mai","have","lose","a","few","braincel","in","the","act","of","watch","thi","movi","and","write","about","it","next","time","you","re","at","the","video","store","and","you","see","the","the","wiz","the","wizard","and","the","wizard","of","oz","all","sit","there","on","the","shelf","in","a","pretti","littl","row","give","them","all","a","miss","and","plai","duck","hunt","instead"],"filtered":["thi","review","wizard","confus","wiz","mr","wizard","wizard","lateeighti","film","serious","silent","boi","abil","plai","video","game","walk","dure","entir","open","credit","wiz","unnecessari","updat","wizard","oz","mr","wizard","gui","attach","straw","togeth","kid","drink","tang","itbr","br","get","wai","let","sai","thi","realli","reason","see","thi","movi","simpli","minut","nintendo","commerci","design","capit","powerglov","legend","zelda","super","mario","brother","us","word","design","loos","sens","possibl","becaus","seem","like","thi","movi","write","weekend","crack","team","peopl","never","plai","nintendo","direct","man","littl","sens","styl","grandmoth","mayb","writer","director","sit","actual","plai","game","togeth","thei","realiz","thei","film","total","rubbish","instead","go","vocat","school","learn","instal","car","stereosbr","br","hope","thi","enlighten","experi","sure","fact","think","mai","lose","braincel","act","watch","thi","movi","write","next","time","re","video","store","see","wiz","wizard","wizard","oz","sit","shelf","pretti","littl","row","give","miss","plai","duck","hunt","instead"],"filtered2":["review","wizard","confus","wiz","mr","wizard","wizard","lateeighti","serious","silent","boi","abil","plai","video","game","walk","dure","entir","open","credit","wiz","unnecessari","updat","wizard","oz","mr","wizard","gui","attach","straw","togeth","kid","drink","tang","itbr","get","wai","let","realli","reason","see","simpli","minut","nintendo","commerci","design","capit","powerglov","legend","zelda","super","mario","brother","us","word","design","loos","sens","possibl","becaus","seem","like","write","weekend","crack","team","peopl","never","plai","nintendo","direct","man","littl","sens","styl","grandmoth","mayb","writer","director","sit","actual","plai","game","togeth","realiz","total","rubbish","instead","go","vocat","school","learn","instal","car","stereosbr","hope","enlighten","experi","sure","fact","think","mai","lose","braincel","act","watch","write","next","time","re","video","store","see","wiz","wizard","wizard","oz","sit","shelf","pretti","littl","row","give","miss","plai","duck","hunt","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,12,13,14,21,22,23,30,33,35,40,42,45,46,52,55,56,58,59,65,68,78,95,97,102,114,119,124,152,163,173,176,181,184,198,201,221,239,240,242,244,255,258,270,282,284,287,294,296,297,333,356,357,371,374,380,381,402,405,427,430,431,667,681,723,793,847,940,1081,1098,1125,1225,1247,1342,1377,1565,1926,1949,2125,2164,2477,2559,2602,2896,3145,3220,3380,3979,4121,5016,7009],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,12,13,14,21,22,23,30,33,35,40,42,45,46,5

{"value":"Justin goes home to live with his strict, hard-nosed police detective father, but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartments each with bizarre tenants residing in them. Straight-laced idealist Justin is thrust into the world of the occult, murder, under-aged drinking and other dastardly things. Ho-hum <br /><br />Wow, have I seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewers on here saw??? Clever, compelling, original, intense, clever, genius????!!? I witnessed none of those things. What I DID see was an uninteresting, bland, trite, extremely clichéd low-budget thriller that was ripe with implausibilities and no tension in the least bit as the killer is telegraphed as soon into the film as he gives his monologue/debate/discussion. And where are these humorous laugh-out-loud moments? I never so much as chuckled, perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />DVD Extras: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; Second commentary with various contributers as well as isolated music tracks; 4 featurettes (Making of, on the set, turning 1 room into 4, & Inside the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose,

{"value":"I remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time.<br /><br />Right before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.<br /><br />Because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of \"The Fellowship of the Rings\" and part of \"The Two Towers\" -- was pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.<br /><br />Its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that I found lacking in the Jackson movies. Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.<br /><br />This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. Several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long TV special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. All I will say about that is that it was a
