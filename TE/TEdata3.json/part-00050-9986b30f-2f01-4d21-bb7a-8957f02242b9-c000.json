{"value":"I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believe that the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film. Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of TR's character. <br /><br />Like TR all of the Stoddard sons serve in World War I, in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /><br />But what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things? That's Susan Hayward's job here. In one of her earliest prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son, has an affair with another, and starts making a play for the third. It's an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an Oscar in I Want to Live.<br /><br />I suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as Theodore Roosevelt was and Warner Baxter portrays, everyone is afraid to tell Father what's going on. The sons and also their governess Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot gets a little silly. Bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for their kids. Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial reversals in business. Bergman has to be let go. She goes back to France and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up. <br /><br />I'm sorry, but I can't believe the kids need a governess now. Hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn't the kids who brought her back. In the normal course of things, Bergman would have gotten on with her life. <br /><br />One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I have was edited out. Possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have.<br /><br />It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have done another film together in the Fifties when Hayward was at her heights and Bergman had just made a comeback.<br /><br />Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons. And I'm willing to believe that a good deal of Ingrid was left on the cutting room floor.","finished_norm":["i","just","see","adam","have","four","son","for","the","time","and","the","thing","that","strike","me","be","that","i","believ","that","the","model","us","be","theodor","roosevelt","and","hi","four","son","thei","be","approxim","the","same","ag","a","the","four","boi","in","thi","film","warner","baxter","in","hi","portray","of","adam","stoddard","talk","about","the","same","valu","and","famili","tradit","that","you","would","have","hear","from","our","th","presid","without","some","of","the","much","boister","aspect","of","tr","charact","br","br","like","tr","all","of","the","stoddard","son","serv","in","world","war","i","in","thi","case","though","the","young","onli","lose","a","ey","instead","of","be","kill","br","br","but","what","if","a","femal","minx","get","into","thi","all","male","household","and","disrupt","thing","that","susan","hayward","job","here","in","on","of","her","earli","promin","role","hayward","be","a","flirtati","amor","girl","who","marri","on","son","have","a","affair","with","anoth","and","start","make","a","plai","for","the","it","a","earli","forerunn","of","the","kind","of","a","part","that","late","bring","her","a","oscar","in","i","want","to","livebr","br","i","suppos","that","with","a","power","a","model","of","decorum","a","theodor","roosevelt","be","and","warner","baxter","portrai","everyon","be","afraid","to","tell","father","what","go","on","the","son","and","conjur","their","gover","ingrid","bergman","here","where","the","plot","get","a","littl","silli","bergman","be","introduc","to","u","a","a","gover","hire","by","baxter","and","wife","fai","wrai","for","their","kid","wrai","die","and","baxter","suffer","some","financi","revers","in","busi","bergman","have","to","be","let","go","she","go","back","to","franc","and","year","late","come","back","to","the","famili","when","the","kid","be","grow","up","br","br","i","be","sorri","but","i","ca","not","believ","the","kid","ne","a","gover","now","hayward","be","quit","right","when","she","confront","her","that","it","be","not","the","kid","who","bring","her","back","in","the","normal","cours","of","thing","bergman","would","have","get","on","with","her","life","br","br","on","of","the","previou","review","sai","that","a","quarter","to","a","of","the","film","i","have","be","edit","out","possibli","that","can","be","the","reason","for","the","mani","plot","hole","we","havebr","br","it","too","bad","that","ingrid","and","susan","can","not","have","do","anoth","film","togeth","in","the","fifti","when","hayward","be","at","her","height","and","bergman","have","just","make","a","comebackbr","br","susan","hayward","be","the","main","reason","to","see","adam","have","four","son","and","i","be","will","to","believ","that","a","good","deal","of","ingrid","be","leav","on","the","cut","room","floor"],"filtered":["see","adam","four","son","time","thing","strike","believ","model","us","theodor","roosevelt","hi","four","son","thei","approxim","ag","four","boi","thi","film","warner","baxter","hi","portray","adam","stoddard","talk","valu","famili","tradit","hear","th","presid","without","much","boister","aspect","tr","charact","br","br","like","tr","stoddard","son","serv","world","war","thi","case","though","young","onli","lose","ey","instead","kill","br","br","femal","minx","get","thi","male","household","disrupt","thing","susan","hayward","job","earli","promin","role","hayward","flirtati","amor","girl","marri","son","affair","anoth","start","make","plai","earli","forerunn","kind","part","late","bring","oscar","want","livebr","br","suppos","power","model","decorum","theodor","roosevelt","warner","baxter","portrai","everyon","afraid","tell","father","go","son","conjur","gover","ingrid","bergman","plot","get","littl","silli","bergman","introduc","u","gover","hire","baxter","wife","fai","wrai","kid","wrai","die","baxter","suffer","financi","revers","busi","bergman","let","go","go","back","franc","year","late","come","back","famili","kid","grow","br","br","sorri","ca","believ","kid","ne","gover","hayward","quit","right","confront","kid","bring","back","normal","cours","thing","bergman","get","life","br","br","previou","review","sai","quarter","film","edit","possibli","reason","mani","plot","hole","havebr","br","bad","ingrid","susan","anoth","film","togeth","fifti","hayward","height","bergman","make","comebackbr","br","susan","hayward","main","reason","see","adam","four","son","believ","good","deal","ingrid","leav","cut","room","floor"],"filtered2":["see","adam","four","son","time","thing","strike","believ","model","us","theodor","roosevelt","four","son","approxim","ag","four","boi","warner","baxter","portray","adam","stoddard","talk","valu","famili","tradit","hear","th","presid","without","boister","aspect","tr","charact","like","tr","stoddard","son","serv","world","war","case","though","young","onli","lose","ey","instead","kill","femal","minx","get","male","household","disrupt","thing","susan","hayward","job","earli","prom

{"value":"This is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized, but how can you be harsh on a film that features non-stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises, taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits? Prior to being a horror film, \"Aerobicide\" is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids, silicons and other body-stimulating fitness products. If you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80's tunes, there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left. Plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health-freaks with a big safety pin (yeah). The film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun-bathing device. Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa. You don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident, now do you? Investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer (and Charles Napier look-alike!) and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80's beauty I've ever seen! Looking through the credits, her name's Dianne Copeland apparently, and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile Troma-movie called \"Surf Nazis Must Die\". What a wasted opportunity! She may not have been a great actress, but she sure had two other BIG advantages that would help her move upwards in show business. The amount of gore and the quality of the make-up effects are nothing special, neither. We're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh. The plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable, but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore, anyway. \"Aerobicide\" (a.k.a. \"Killer Workout\") is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night, but nevertheless feel like watching a film! It actually would make a terrific double-feature with \"Death Spa\". Both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty

{"value":"The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but with Ollie receiving the bulk (!) of the punishment-- see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'Towed in a Hole' (1932) as some some classic examples.<br /><br />Here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan's father?) the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. It doesn't come off. It's merely another third-rate tedious 30s comedy, heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures (Ollie's finger wiggling, Stan's blank stares, etc.) or comic abilities.<br /><br />The film begins with them running from the police. Since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshot's mansion. The premise for the 'humor', Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. They are not playing 'Stan and Ollie' in this film. Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.<br /><br />Stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny, but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here. He's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot, but none of it rises much above the silly. We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree's name, the \"Call me a cab! Okay you're a cab!\" joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns, and a non-sequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two, and James Finlayson is still doing his silent-era full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'Sons of the Desert'(1933) where we get to see them do what we love about them -- be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years.<br /><br />Since this film does not play to any of their strengths, why bother with it?

{"value":"There can be no questions of spoilers for this movie, the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways.<br /><br />A blatant rip-off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films. It ends up a sleazy waste of time, where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them. They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening. It's painful to watch, and not helped by the mental 80's fashions worn by the cast.<br /><br />Basically, some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement, and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds. The guards new recruit, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, gets his gang of 80's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem... Hobgoblins.<br /><br />All life is here, with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock, his 80's slut girlfriend, the 'hero's frigid and prissy girlfriend, and the young hero, lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway.<br /><br />First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene, where the ex-military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours. Then there's some running around, terminating in a real pie-fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand-grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them. Then the film sorta ends, and alls well that ends well.<br /><br />It's not. This is like watching a train wreck, you cant take your eyes off it, it's so bad. Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater, but god-awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut. The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast, and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight. This scores 2 out of 10 at most, on a good

{"value":"A young couple Mandy Pullman (Mitch Martin) and Roy Seeley (Matt Birman) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen. They decide to start playing practical jokes on each other. Mandy hides in an old run down cabin, she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant. Roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed. Dr. Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes) and his daughter Jenny (Erin Flannery) are both new to Galen after the death of Sam's wife. Sam is called into action by Police Chief Hank Walden (John Ireland) when Mandy and Roy are found. He performs the autopsy on Roy and treats Mandy for her horrific injuries. Soon after a curator at the local museum named Carolyn Davis (Denise Furgusson) is also attacked and raped. A local journalist named Laura Kincaid (Kerrie Keane) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier. More rapes and murders occur. Meanwhile Jenny's boyfriend Tim Galen (Duncan MacIntosh) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts. Tim's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus - a shape-shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce! Directed by John Hough this is one seriously dull horror film. The script by George Franklin based on the novel by Ray Russell is slow to say the least. Nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending I've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. As the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes, but none are shown on screen. There is only one gore scene in the entire film too. The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes. Everything about this film production-wise is very static and flat, the film has no energy or pace. The acting is dull and you don't feel or care for anyone. Check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions.

{"value":"This movie was so bad I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I had high hopes for Horrorfest that year, which was also the first year I attended Horrorfest, and I have to say Horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level. Mad kudos to the advertisers because I'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year. The Hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones I've seen (the other ones I saw were Unrest, Dark Ride, and Reincarnation). The movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which I thought was a rather interesting plot, only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some 'coming of age' tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire. Which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film. And to make the plot even more ridiculous, they add in a set of horny twins who can't wait to take a 'bite' out of one another, and some deadly creature locked in the basement, which if I had discovered what 'it' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film, I would have left the theater halfway into the movie.<br /><br />Complete waste of money and time. Cut forty minutes out of this film, and make it into an episode on some show like Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural and it would have received more praise than this. Absolute rubbish! So bad that two years later, I have to come back to IMDb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Also, while you're reading this, steer clear from the rest of the Horrorfest movies in the future. The most you could do is rent them from Blockbusters or watch it online somewhere. Horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who can't make it onto the big screen, and all the crap about 'stuff they don't show you in theaters', they weren't referring to blood or guts, or horror...they were referring to the movies themselves. Because they're horrendous. Think of Horrorfest as a less renowned version of Sundance Film Festival, but for horror movies.<br /><br />Sorry for all the 'hate', but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their

{"value":"I'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. It's a first and last attempt by writer-director Soo Lyu. \"Rub and Tug\" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's program to promote home-grown film-making. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts like \"New Waterford Girl\" it opens the door for untalented novices like Lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. <br /><br />You don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. <br /><br />Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in \"Exotica\". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in \"New Waterford Girl\". Her shallow performance in \"Rub and Tug\" should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of \"Waterford\" director Alan Moyle's skill in working with young actors. <br /><br />You quickly conclude that Lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and lame \"deus ex machina\" device toward the end is hardly a surprise. Still it could be worse, the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a

{"value":"Once upon a time in the mid 1990s I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new American produced DOCTOR WHO TVM . As soon as it was announced that the Doctor`s arch enemy the Master was going to be played by Eric Roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed \" Who is Eric Roberts ? \" . I should point out this was before the IMDB came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume , but one helpful soul wrote into a publication I wrote for to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite F Murray Abraham , the film was called BY THE SWORD and was about a fencing school . Actually looking back now Roberts is best known for THE POPE OF GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN but that didn`t stop the person putting the boot into both Roberts and BY THE SWORD and his mind was made up that this American Master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle . Strangely most fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master but after they saw the DOCTOR WHO TVM a great many fans ( Myself among them ) thought Roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing American production <br /><br />Yeah I`m digressing but BY THE SWORD was a film that I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I`d heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didn`t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and I was fairly disappointed with it . I know nothing about fencing ( Everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not . I don`t fence ) so I don`t know how accurate it all is , but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991 , the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn`t have worked a lot better if it`d had been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid 1980s . You could argue this would have meant the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard being off centre for most of the film but I wasn`t convinced about their love/hate relationship and

{"value":"You don't expect much from a PRC picture, and with rare exceptions--mainly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few by Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers--that's exactly what you get: not much. This \"epic\" about Nazis in Africa trying to incite an Arab revolt against the British isn't much different. The script, by longtime PRC hacks Arthur St. Claire and Sherman Lowe, is trite, laughable, full of unfunny \"wisecracks\" and plot holes the size of Outer Mongolia. The direction, by longtime PRC no-budget specialist Al Herman, is semi-comatose at best. The performances, though--except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead Walter Woolf King--aren't really half bad. Veteran comedian Parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film. He plays a guy from Brooklyn masquerading as a razor-blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up. He's got great comic timing, charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time. Duncan Renaldo is fairly convincing as an Arab sheik--despite his Spanish accent--and veteran bad guy George J. Lewis as Renaldo's Arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy, even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes. Joan Woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch, and she and Renaldo have great chemistry together, although--like the rest of the cast--she has none at all with King. H.B. Warner, whose career stretched back to the silent era, lends a shred of dignity to the low-rent proceedings, even though he blows his lines several times and, PRC being PRC, they weren't cut out. There's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big-budget silent movie with a similar Arab theme--although I have no idea which one it is--and, PRC being PRC, no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous: I've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious.<br /><br />\"A Yank in Libya\" isn't very good, of course--well, OK, it stinks--but it would be worth a look just to see Parkyakarkus in his prime. I had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor/director Albert Brooks and Super Dave Osborne, but had never actually seen him in anything before.

{"value":"This could have been a rather entertaining film, but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek, it could have been a very entertaining film, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive, meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is.<br /><br />STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult film).<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won't be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts, that many horror film watchers enjoy, is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. Kim Terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The \"teenagers\" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man, this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /><br />NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom.

{"value":"*MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW* This movie was horrible. I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I'd watch it, and I was very disappointed. It started out okay.. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son, I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyways, at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist. He was the only one that believed in Bobby, and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo, when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death... Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song \"I WANT TO **** YOU!!!!\" at random unfitting moments.<br /><br />Later, when DeNiro saves Bobby's son from drowning, I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself.. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie, because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder, and does so by stealing Bobby's son, car, and dog and holding them hostage- Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a \"true fan\" while displaying a picture of him biting a knife.<br /><br />Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home, proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field. There are seemingly no officers on the field (but the police are on their way), so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death. But don't worry, this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending, because Bobby find his son.<br /><br />This is NOT a sports movie. It is NOT about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten, rob, and throw knives at their admirees. This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life. The plot was shallow, the soundtrack sucked, the movie had no purpose whatsoever. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film.","finished_norm":["mani","mani","spoiler","in","thi","review","thi","movi","be","horribl","i","be","a","huge","basebal","fan","so","i","think","i","have","watch","it","and","i","be","veri","disappoint","it","start","out","okai","when","i","see","the","bad","influenc","deniro","have","on","hi","young","son","i","be","hope","that","he","would","becom","a","well","father","throughout","the","movi","or","someth","anywai","at","the","begin","it","seem","a","if","deniro","be","suppos","to","be","the","protagonist","he","be","the","onli","on","that","believ","in","bobbi","and","he","have","hi","ador","son","that","he","be","lose","custodi","of","which","give","me","a","reason","to","feel","bad","for","him","he","want","to","help","bobbi","by","talk","to","primo","when","out","of","absolut","nowher","he","brutal","stab","primo","to","death","not","to","mention","that","sketchi","reoccur","song","i","want","to","you","at","random","unfit","momentsbr","br","late","when","deniro","save","bobbi","son","from","drown","i","be","hope","that","the","movi","can","redeem","itself","he","can","forgiv","himself","for","kill","primo","if","he","save","bobbi","son","but","of","cours","thi","be","far","beyond","the","depth","of","the","movi","becaus","all","he","care","about","be","get","credit","for","the","murder","and","doe","so","by","steal","bobbi","son","car","and","dog","and","hold","them","hostag","bobbi","just","have","to","hit","a","home","run","and","announc","that","deniro","be","a","true","fan","while","displai","a","pictur","of","him","bite","a","knifebr","br","now","we","get","to","the","complet","unrealist","scene","at","the","end","it","be","pour","like","hell","and","we","be","expect","to","believ","that","the","game","have","not","be","call","then","deniro","somehow","magic","appear","on","the","field","in","a","umpir","suit","and","call","bobbi","out","at","home","proce","to","pull","out","hi","knife","and","start","stab","everyon","that","run","onto","the","field","there","be","seemingli","no","offic","on","the","field","but","the","polic","be","on","their","wai","so","deniro","step","on","the","mound","and","prepar","to","pitch","a","knife","to","bobbi","when","he","get","shoot","to","death","but","do","not","worri","thi","cheer","and","pleasant","movi","have","a","happi","end","becaus","bobbi","find","hi","sonbr","br","thi","be","not","a","sport","movi","it","be","not","about","a","fan","a","far","a","i","know","fan","be","not","rabid","psychopath","that","threaten","rob","and","throw","knife","at","their","admire","thi","be","like","to","be","the","sick","movi","i","will","ever","see","in","my","life","the","plot","be","shallow","the","soundtrack","suck","the","movi","have","no","purpos","whatsoev","i","warn","you","not","to","wast","your","time","on","thi","disgust","excus","for","a","film"],"filtered":["mani","mani","spoiler","thi","review","thi","movi","horribl","huge","basebal","fan","think","watch","veri","disappoint","start","okai","see","bad","influenc","deniro","hi","young","son","hope","becom","well","father","throughout","movi","someth","anywai","begin","seem","deniro","suppos","protagonist","onli","believ","bobbi","hi","ador","son","lose","custodi","give","reason","feel","bad","want","help","bobbi","talk","primo","absolut","nowher","brutal","stab","primo","death","mention","sketchi","reoccur","song","want","random","unfit","momentsbr","br","late","deniro","save","bobbi","son","drown","hope","movi","redeem","forgiv","kill","primo","save","bobbi","son","cours","thi","far","beyond","depth","movi","becaus","care","get","credit","murder","doe","steal","bobbi","son","car","dog","hold","hostag","bobbi","hit","home","run","announc","deniro","true","fan","displai","pictur","bite","knifebr","br","get","complet","unrealist","scene","end","pour","like","hell","expect","believ","game","call","deniro","somehow","magic","appear","field","umpir","suit","call","bobbi","home","proce","pull","hi","knife","start","stab","everyon","run","onto","field","seemingli","offic","field","polic","wai","deniro","step","mound","prepar","pitch","knife","bobbi","get","shoot","death","worri","thi","cheer","pleasant","movi","happi","end","becaus","bobbi","find","hi","sonbr","br","thi","sport","movi","fan","far","know","fan","rabid","psychopath","threaten","rob","throw","knife","admire","thi","like","sick","movi","ever","see","life","plot","shallow","soundtrack","suck","movi","purpos","whatsoev","warn","wast","time","thi","disgust","excus","film"],"filtered2":["mani","mani","spoiler","review","horribl","huge","basebal","fan","think","watch","veri","disappoint","start","okai","see","bad","influenc","deniro","young","son","hope","becom","well","father","throughout","someth","anywai","begin","seem","deniro","suppos","protagonist","onli","believ","bobbi","ador","son","lose","custodi","give","reason","feel","bad","want","help","bobbi","talk","primo","absolut","nowher","brutal","stab","primo","death","mention","sketchi","reoccur","

{"value":"Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that...<br /><br />I would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10. Where to begin, we'll start from the top...<br /><br />THE STORY: Don't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are. It's a draub, basic, go to cabin movie with no intensity or \"effort\".<br /><br />THE SCREENPLAY: I usually give credit to indie screenwriters, it's hard work when you are starting out...but this is crap. The story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of \"Woah, you totally freaked me out\" and \"I was wondering if you'd uh...if you'd like to..uh, would you come to the cabin with me?\". It makes me want to rip out all my hair, one strand at a time and feed it to myself.<br /><br />THE CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP!!!! Some have described the characters as flat, I want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch.. They actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...<br /><br />THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting. The \"Woah you totally freaked me out\" was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down. I could complain for hours on the actors alone.<br /><br />TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie. Too shadowy in areas, too bleached in others. The director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly. Baby Steps! SOUND: How many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie? 9. With that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured. There is one scene in particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle....WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm running out of complaining space.....rent it - I dare you...Rent it and learn from it...give it a 1 rating..it deserves it.<br /><br />Signing off...

{"value":"Twist endings can be really cool in a movie. It's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. Those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think. Then we've got twists like this film has. Twists that, whether or not you pay attention, you have no clue what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. This film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist.<br /><br />Three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods, and hit a tree trunk. They end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.<br /><br />This film is too caught up in it's dialogue, and it's always between only a few characters. We have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing).<br /><br />Plot holes are abundant here. The house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! A two hour or less walk will kill them. Why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? Did he have a one seater? How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? Why did this have to have so many dumb twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script.<br /><br />Having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea.

{"value":"One of the five worst movies I have ever watched. And I'm not exaggerating. In fact, I recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching Showgirls.<br /><br />Out of 400 votes, the movie gets a user rating of 5.3/10. But there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10/10, probably due to the message of the movie - nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind. Chuck Murdock is an all-star little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons. Soon \"Amazing Grace\" Smith is an all-star Boston Celtic who is inspired by Chuck's story and gives up basketball. Soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a world-wide protest. Later all the children of the world go on a silence strike. This inspires the President of the United States to meet with the Soviet Premier, who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next Little League season. The movie ends with Chuck about to throw out the first pitch, with the President telling his new best friend Chuck not to worry about striking out every batter, as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills Amazing Grace. When the President finds out he is told that the FBI can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it. So the President calls the underworld boss (\"But it's one a.m.\" \"I don't care, get him on the line\") and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has. And to not get out of line again.<br /><br />Honestly, this movie was so crappy that I couldn't turn it off. It was on television from 2:30 am to 4:00 am, and I watched it all. I wasn't turned off by the anti-nuclear weapons propaganda. I was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports. I don't even understand why \"Amazing Grace\" Smith was killed. And with all these famous athletes becoming Chuck's friends, why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand. And there was the cliché moment near the end when dad tells Chuck, \"I never told you this, but I'm proud of you.\" Cue

{"value":"In 1914, Charlie Chaplin began making pictures. These were made for Mack Sennett (also known as \"Keystone Studios\") and were literally churned out in very rapid succession. The short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed. As a result, the films, though popular in their day, were just awful by today's standards. Many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera. Many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing. And, regardless of the outcome, Keystone sent them straight to theaters. My assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad, as the Keystone films with Chaplin were very successful.<br /><br />The Charlie Chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in Chaplin's career with Keystone. By 1915, he signed a new lucrative contract with Essenay Studios and the films improved dramatically with Chaplin as director. However, at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable. No, Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving. In 1916, when he switched to Mutual Studios, his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy--in many of the previous films he was just a jerk (either getting drunk a lot, beating up women, provoking fights with innocent people, etc.). The final evolution of his Little Tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full-length films.<br /><br />It's interesting that this film is called TWENTY MINUTES OF LOVE since the film only lasts about 10 minutes! Oh well. The plot, what little there is, involves the Little Tramp in the park. A couple wants to neck but inexplicably, Charlie insists on practically sitting on the couple's lap and really annoying them. I can't understand why and the short consists of Charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film. Perhaps he was looking for a threesome, I don't know. But the film lacks coherence and just isn't particularly funny--even when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake. A typical poor effort before Chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality.","finished_norm":["in","charli","chaplin","begin","make","pictur","thi","be","make","for","mack","sennett","conjur","know","a","keyston","studio","and","be","liter","churn","out","in","veri","rapid","success","the","short","comedi","have","veri","littl","structur","and","be","complet","ad","lib","a","a","result","the","film","though","popular","in","their","dai","be","just","aw","by","todai","standard","mani","of","them","bear","a","strong","similar","to","home","movi","featur","obnoxi","rel","mug","for","the","camera","mani","other","show","the","charact","wander","in","front","of","the","camera","and","do","pretti","much","noth","and","regardless","of","the","outcom","keyston","send","them","straight","to","theater","my","assumpt","be","that","all","movi","at","thi","time","must","have","be","pretti","bad","a","the","keyston","film","with","chaplin","be","veri","successfulbr","br","the","charli","chaplin","we","know","and","love","todai","onli","begin","to","evolv","late","in","chaplin","career","with","keyston","by","he","sign","a","new","lucr","contract","with","essenai","studio","and","the","film","improv","dramat","with","chaplin","a","director","howev","at","time","thi","film","be","still","veri","rough","and","not","especi","memor","no","chaplin","a","the","cute","littl","tramp","be","still","evolv","in","when","he","switch","to","mutual","studio","hi","film","onc","again","improv","and","he","becom","the","much","recogniz","nice","guyin","mani","of","the","previou","film","he","be","just","a","jerk","either","get","drink","a","lot","beat","up","woman","provok","fight","with","innoc","peopl","etc","the","final","evolut","of","hi","littl","tramp","to","classic","statu","occur","in","the","a","a","result","of","hi","fulllength","filmsbr","br","it","interest","that","thi","film","be","call","twenti","minut","of","love","sinc","the","film","onli","last","about","minut","oh","good","the","plot","what","littl","there","be","involv","the","littl","tramp","in","the","park","a","coupl","want","to","neck","but","inexplic","charli","insist","on","practic","sit","on","the","coupl","lap","and","realli","annoi","them","i","ca","not","understand","why","and","the","short","consist","of","charli","wander","about","the","park","annoi","thi","peopl","and","some","other","late","in","the","film","perhap","he","be","look","for","a","threesom","i","do","not","know","but","the","film","lack","coher","and","just","be","not","particularli","funnyeven","when","peopl","start","slap","each","other","and","push","each","other","in","the","lake","a","typic","poor","effort","befor","chaplin","begin","to","give","hi","charact","a","plot","and","person"],"filtered":["charli","chaplin","begin","make","pictur","thi","make","mack","sennett","conjur","know","keyston","studio","liter","churn","veri","rapid","success","short","comedi","veri","littl","structur","complet","ad","lib","result","film","though","popular","dai","aw","todai","standard","mani","bear","strong","similar","home","movi","featur","obnoxi","rel","mug","camera","mani","show","charact","wander","front","camera","pretti","much","noth","regardless","outcom","keyston","send","straight","theater","assumpt","movi","thi","time","must","pretti","bad","keyston","film","chaplin","veri","successfulbr","br","charli","chaplin","know","love","todai","onli","begin","evolv","late","chaplin","career","keyston","sign","new","lucr","contract","essenai","studio","film","improv","dramat","chaplin","director","howev","time","thi","film","still","veri","rough","especi","memor","chaplin","cute","littl","tramp","still","evolv","switch","mutual","studio","hi","film","onc","improv","becom","much","recogniz","nice","guyin","mani","previou","film","jerk","either","get","drink","lot","beat","woman","provok","fight","innoc","peopl","etc","final","evolut","hi","littl","tramp","classic","statu","occur","result","hi","fulllength","filmsbr","br","interest","thi","film","call","twenti","minut","love","sinc","film","onli","last","minut","oh","good","plot","littl","involv","littl","tramp","park","coupl","want","neck","inexplic","charli","insist","practic","sit","coupl","lap","realli","annoi","ca","understand","short","consist","charli","wander","park","annoi","thi","peopl","late","film","perhap","look","threesom","know","film","lack","coher","particularli","funnyeven","peopl","start","slap","push","lake","typic","poor","effort","befor","chaplin","begin","give","hi","charact","plot","person"],"filtered2":["charli","chaplin","begin","make","pictur","make","mack","sennett","conjur","know","keyston","studio","liter","churn","veri","rapid","success","short","comedi","veri","littl","structur","complet","ad","lib","result","though","popular","dai","aw","todai","standard","mani","bear","strong","similar","home","featur","obnoxi","rel","mug","camera","mani","show","charact","wander","front","camera","pretti","noth","regardless","outcom","keyston","send","straight","theater","assumpt","time","must","pre

{"value":"I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement . On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel . Unfortunately the more I watched it the more I realised how well made Danny Boyle's original was and how much this movie influenced 28 WEEKS LATER <br /><br />One can't help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of Italian horror movie . I was totally convinced ZOMBI 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest - In which case I would have called my summary 28 YEARS LATER ( Geddit ? ) - but wasn't until I came to this page to find it was released in 1988 . All the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade . I might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 as would have my peers but not now <br /><br />Much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity . For example some of the zombies shuffle about with the pace of a snail while others can run very fast and posses self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a DJ . Likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they've had their head chopped off , wait till you see the fridge scene , you might just die laughing . Even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career <br /><br />Obviously you're reminded of the earlier film THE CRAZIES which also reminded me of the later 28 films . Bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you'll have worked out that basically everyone dies . The problem with this is you'll instantly be reminded of how the British franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget . Not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie . ZOMBI 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter

{"value":"This movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end.

His performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as Bob Denver did. Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. It was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice. John Ritter, whom Knotts worked with in \"Three's Company,\" was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like \"The Dreamer of Oz,\" but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in \"Pleasantville.\" Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in \"Airplane!\" and \"Police Squad.\"<br /><br />There's also no way the then-43 year-old Knotts could pass for a 35 year-old, as his character insisted he was. It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at 38 playing the college-age Forrest Gump.<br /><br />The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastily-filmed TV episode. It's especially evident in the \"exterior\" scenes of the \"town\" where Roy goes after he's fired. It's unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the Mayberry-like soundstage artificiality.<br /><br />Even viewing this strictly as a children's movie, it's very disappointing. It's not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. The pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus? A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). Movies, even kid's movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. Disney's \"The Love Bug,\" for instance, at least had some interesting race

{"value":"French director Jean Rollin isn't exactly known for great films, and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why. One of the most confusing things about this production is the title. For a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires; you would expect a film with the word 'nude' in the title to be a particularly bare-breasted one; but in fact, there's not a lot of nudity here at all. Instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on; we've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality, a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult, who don't get to do much. The film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young French man, who also happens to be the son of a man of importance. Through his investigation, he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady, and as he delves deeper into the cult; he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets, drinks blood and can't go out in daylight...sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me.<br /><br />Jean Rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film, but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed. It is possible to keep up with what's going on, but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one. The director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too, as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience. There is a twist thrown in at the end also; but the film would have been better without it. I guess this was Jean Rollin's attempt to be a little original, but it comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at such, rather than a logical continuation of the story. The cinematography is fairly neat, with lots of the plot taking place in suitably Gothic locations. The girls on board complete what is a pretty picture, and what Rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency, it somewhat makes up for in style. In the film's defence, it was made in 1969; which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but I can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of.","finished_norm":["french","director","jean","rollin","be","not","exactli","know","for","great","film","and","thi","confus","mess","be","on","of","the","reason","why","on","of","the","much","confus","thing","about","thi","product","be","the","titl","for","a","director","who","be","good","know","for","direct","erot","film","about","lesbian","vampir","you","would","expect","a","film","with","the","word","nude","in","the","titl","to","be","a","particularli","barebreast","on","but","in","fact","there","not","a","lot","of","nuditi","here","at","all","instead","of","erot","lesbian","vampir","with","no","cloth","on","we","have","get","a","cumbersom","plot","about","a","man","who","want","to","unlock","the","secret","to","immort","a","young","woman","whose","afflict","mai","hold","the","kei","and","a","suicid","cult","who","do","not","get","to","do","much","the","film","start","off","promisingli","with","a","sequenc","that","see","a","young","girl","carri","off","by","a","mysteri","bunch","of","peopl","in","mask","under","the","watch","ey","of","a","young","french","man","who","conjur","happen","to","be","the","son","of","a","man","of","import","through","hi","investig","he","soon","discov","that","thi","woman","be","not","just","a","normal","ladi","and","a","he","delv","deep","into","the","cult","he","discov","that","cannot","be","kill","by","bullet","drink","blood","and","ca","not","go","out","in","daylightsound","like","a","clear","cut","case","of","vampir","to","mebr","br","jean","rollin","keep","the","fantasi","atmospher","go","throughout","the","film","but","it","fail","to","be","interest","becaus","the","plot","be","so","badli","execut","it","be","possibl","to","keep","up","with","what","go","on","but","onli","becaus","there","so","mani","other","film","that","follow","similar","plot","to","thi","on","the","director","seem","to","know","that","he","mess","up","the","plot","too","a","the","climax","be","basic","a","excus","to","explain","the","film","to","the","audienc","there","be","a","twist","throw","in","at","the","end","conjur","but","the","film","would","have","be","well","without","it","i","guess","thi","be","jean","rollin","attempt","to","be","a","littl","origin","but","it","come","off","a","a","hamfist","attempt","at","such","rather","than","a","logic","continu","of","the","stori","the","cinematographi","be","fairli","neat","with","lot","of","the","plot","take","place","in","suitabl","gothic","locat","the","girl","on","board","complet","what","be","a","pretti","pictur","and","what","rollin","film","lack","in","logic","and","consist","it","somewhat","make","up","for","in","styl","in","the","film","defenc","it","be","make","in","which","somewhat","explain","the","lack","of","shock","but","i","ca","not","recommend","thi","movi","a","it","doe","not","have","much","about","it","that","be","worth","take","note","of"],"filtered":["french","director","jean","rollin","exactli","know","great","film","thi","confus","mess","reason","much","confus","thing","thi","product","titl","director","good","know","direct","erot","film","lesbian","vampir","expect","film","word","nude","titl","particularli","barebreast","fact","lot","nuditi","instead","erot","lesbian","vampir","cloth","get","cumbersom","plot","man","want","unlock","secret","immort","young","woman","whose","afflict","mai","hold","kei","suicid","cult","get","much","film","start","promisingli","sequenc","see","young","girl","carri","mysteri","bunch","peopl","mask","watch","ey","young","french","man","conjur","happen","son","man","import","hi","investig","soon","discov","thi","woman","normal","ladi","delv","deep","cult","discov","kill","bullet","drink","blood","ca","go","daylightsound","like","clear","cut","case","vampir","mebr","br","jean","rollin","keep","fantasi","atmospher","go","throughout","film","fail","interest","becaus","plot","badli","execut","possibl","keep","go","onli","becaus","mani","film","follow","similar","plot","thi","director","seem","know","mess","plot","climax","basic","excus","explain","film","audienc","twist","throw","end","conjur","film","well","without","guess","thi","jean","rollin","attempt","littl","origin","come","hamfist","attempt","rather","logic","continu","stori","cinematographi","fairli","neat","lot","plot","take","place","suitabl","gothic","locat","girl","board","complet","pretti","pictur","rollin","film","lack","logic","consist","somewhat","make","styl","film","defenc","make","somewhat","explain","lack","shock","ca","recommend","thi","movi","doe","much","worth","take","note"],"filtered2":["french","director","jean","rollin","exactli","know","great","confus","mess","reason","confus","thing","product","titl","director","good","know","direct","erot","lesbian","vampir","expect","word","nude","titl","particularli","barebreast","fact","lot","nuditi","instead","erot","lesbian","vampir","cloth","get","cumbersom","plot","man","want","unlock","secret","immort","young","woman","whose","afflict","mai","hold","kei","suicid","cult","get"

{"value":"I get the feeling that those involved in making \"Surviving Christmas\" didn't put much thought into the movie. The characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the one-liner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend Christmas with them.<br /><br />Ben Affleck portrays Drew Latham, the typical Hollywood image of a wealthy, egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life. His girlfriend, Missy, leaves him shortly before Christmas because she's disgusted that Drew wanted to take her to Fiji for Christmas, which she calls \"the family holiday,\" and the fact that Drew has never introduced her to his family. We later find out that Drew's father left when he was 4 years old, and his mother is dead, so it's a mystery why he doesn't just say that he has no family, rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn't care about his family.<br /><br />Out of fear of being alone on Christmas, Drew tracks down Missy's shrink (why? I have no idea), who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home. When he meets the family living in his childhood home, the Valcos, Drew offers them $250,000 to pretend to be his family, so he can relive his fond childhood memories. He gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter, Alicia (Christina Applegate), because he \"doesn't have a sister,\" and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his \"real\" family. None of this makes any sense once Drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother.<br /><br />Also inexplicable is the character of Alicia, who is annoyed that her family accepted Drew's money, and refuses to play along with his fantasy. But for no good reason, she suddenly starts to like Drew, and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend. Drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely Christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy; I almost wish he had finished with, \"Just kidding! The real reason I don't see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me!\"

{"value":"I didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was messing around on the Trinity board when I saw some user mention how the Wes Craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's Blade, So I did my quick research: Checked the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores I was seeing.<br /><br />Now let's take a quick personal recap here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking it at all, and then seeing the scores of Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion.<br /><br />A couple of things I went in knowing when I started watching this movie was that it's low budget, so because of that, I'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v/fx and just figure it's going to compensated by story & acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee)<br /><br />Oh geez This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it pretty fricken laughable, the bad audio synch from the re-recording of dialogue in a FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book on it, but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get 'infected'? Nope, this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on.<br /><br />I also must've blinked at some point, because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' got clothes on his body, especially since he's big wild and angry & I figure if I was in that situation, I wouldn't want to be the one dressing him.<br /><br />So the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy it doesn't, instead it's a 'Cliff Hangar' where I now get to wait for the 3rd installment 'Legacy'. Oh the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","even","know","thi","movi","exist","until","shortli","after","see","blade","triniti","i","be","mess","around","on","the","triniti","board","when","i","see","some","user","mention","how","the","we","craven","seri","be","a","lot","well","then","the","crap","that","blade","so","i","do","my","quick","research","check","the","score","on","imdb","rottentomato","for","dracula","ascens","and","somewher","along","the","search","i","find","out","that","thi","be","a","sequel","to","dracula","i","conjur","notic","that","within","the","we","craven","dracula","board","there","be","a","real","strong","follow","for","thi","movi","which","be","a","big","contradict","to","the","score","i","be","seeingbr","br","now","let","take","a","quick","person","recap","here","i","rememb","see","dracula","and","i","rememb","not","like","it","at","all","and","then","see","the","score","of","dracula","ascens","just","lower","my","expect","even","much","but","then","again","i","be","the","typ","of","person","that","truli","ne","to","watch","the","movi","myself","ani","movi","so","that","i","can","form","my","own","opinionbr","br","a","coupl","of","thing","i","go","in","know","when","i","start","watch","thi","movi","be","that","it","low","budget","so","becaus","of","that","i","be","go","to","have","to","ignor","a","lot","of","the","vfx","and","just","figur","it","go","to","compens","by","stori","act","i","be","conjur","slightli","impress","by","some","of","the","cast","in","thi","movi","jason","london","roi","schieder","jason","scott","leebr","br","oh","geez","thi","movi","be","cheesi","but","cheesi","can","be","entertain","at","littl","i","find","it","pretti","fricken","laughabl","the","bad","audio","synch","from","the","rerecord","of","dialogu","in","a","few","scene","the","stupid","of","the","charact","in","thi","movi","sure","thei","all","know","about","vampir","and","some","of","the","basic","thing","luke","even","have","a","book","on","it","but","do","it","prevent","them","from","want","to","purpos","get","infect","no","thi","be","wrong","then","slasher","flick","where","the","girl","have","to","get","out","of","the","shower","and","check","out","the","nois","she","hear","with","noth","much","than","a","towel","onbr","br","i","conjur","must","have","blink","at","some","point","becaus","i","be","not","sure","how","dracula","get","cloth","on","hi","bodi","especi","sinc","he","big","wild","and","angri","i","figur","if","i","be","in","that","situat","i","would","not","want","to","be","the","on","dress","himbr","br","so","the","movi","end","like","ani","middl","movi","of","a","trilogi","it","doe","not","instead","it","a","cliff","hangar","where","i","now","get","to","wait","for","the","rd","instal","legaci","oh","the","entertain","valu","of","cheesi","movi"],"filtered":["even","know","thi","movi","exist","shortli","see","blade","triniti","mess","around","triniti","board","see","user","mention","craven","seri","lot","well","crap","blade","quick","research","check","score","imdb","rottentomato","dracula","ascens","somewher","along","search","find","thi","sequel","dracula","conjur","notic","within","craven","dracula","board","real","strong","follow","thi","movi","big","contradict","score","seeingbr","br","let","take","quick","person","recap","rememb","see","dracula","rememb","like","see","score","dracula","ascens","lower","expect","even","much","typ","person","truli","ne","watch","movi","ani","movi","form","opinionbr","br","coupl","thing","go","know","start","watch","thi","movi","low","budget","becaus","go","ignor","lot","vfx","figur","go","compens","stori","act","conjur","slightli","impress","cast","thi","movi","jason","london","roi","schieder","jason","scott","leebr","br","oh","geez","thi","movi","cheesi","cheesi","entertain","littl","find","pretti","fricken","laughabl","bad","audio","synch","rerecord","dialogu","scene","stupid","charact","thi","movi","sure","thei","know","vampir","basic","thing","luke","even","book","prevent","want","purpos","get","infect","thi","wrong","slasher","flick","girl","get","shower","check","nois","hear","noth","much","towel","onbr","br","conjur","must","blink","point","becaus","sure","dracula","get","cloth","hi","bodi","especi","sinc","big","wild","angri","figur","situat","want","dress","himbr","br","movi","end","like","ani","middl","movi","trilogi","doe","instead","cliff","hangar","get","wait","rd","instal","legaci","oh","entertain","valu","cheesi","movi"],"filtered2":["even","know","exist","shortli","see","blade","triniti","mess","around","triniti","board","see","user","mention","craven","lot","well","crap","blade","quick","research","check","score","imdb","rottentomato","dracula","ascens","somewher","along","search","find","sequel","dracula","conjur","notic","within","craven","dracula","board","real","strong","follow","big","contradict","score","seeingbr","let","take","quick","person","recap","rememb","see","dracula","rememb","like","see","score","dracula","ascens","low

{"value":"Seriously what were they thinking? Over the course of years the Columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it. This movie is basically very different from any other Columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie.<br /><br />Main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other Columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed. The entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the Columbo character in a totally different environment and situation. Also the overall is just totally different and more 'modernized'.<br /><br />Director Alan J. Levi did some other Columbo movies in the past, which all very much sticked to the usual formula. It also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie.<br /><br />The Columbo character himself also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding. The absence of some good relieving and trademark Columbo humor also doesn't exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch.<br /><br />In all honesty, the movie doesn't begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses. It's such a stupid written kidnap-thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely. It also makes the movie more and more unwatchable. This is a very little interesting Columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way.<br /><br />It also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented ones around. Despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie. Can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him? It would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie I can tell you.<br /><br />An odd Columbo entry, which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula.<br /><br

{"value":"Singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with. I get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart; however, this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous. In addition, there are a bunch of \"might-makes-right\" messages like when our local Nazi jerks get beat up. I mean, who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks? However, he way Singleton portrays the \"fight\" is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else. There is another \"bad guy\" (in reality a drunken frat boy) who rapes one of the movie's protagonists. In this instance, I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one. In any event, he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape. Well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country.<br /><br />Having established the rape, how does Singleton deal with it? When the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone, at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a \"black bitch.\" The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube, et al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged \"apologies\" to roommate for his racist remarks; however the (apparently in Singleton's mind) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned. Again, no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however, Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.<br /><br />What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude.","finished_norm":["singleton","have","some","seriou","issu","he","have","to","come","to","grip","with","i","get","the","feel","that","he","think","he","be","pretti","smart","howev","thi","movi","be","almost","comic","transpar","and","self","righteou","in","addit","there","be","a","bunch","of","mightmakesright","messag","like","when","our","local","nazi","jerk","get","beat","up","i","mean","who","in","their","right","mind","be","go","to","root","for","a","bunch","of","nazi","jerk","howev","he","wai","singleton","portrai","the","fight","be","downright","silli","and","seem","to","be","design","to","show","u","much","the","superior","fight","qualiti","of","the","black","protagonist","than","anyth","els","there","be","anoth","bad","gui","in","realiti","a","drunken","frat","boi","who","rape","on","of","the","movi","protagonist","in","thi","instanc","i","think","that","singleton","actual","doe","a","nice","job","portrai","what","be","probabl","a","all","too","common","situat","when","the","woman","involv","ask","the","frat","boi","to","us","a","condom","and","he","either","doe","not","have","on","or","doe","not","want","to","us","on","in","ani","event","he","doe","not","acced","to","her","demand","that","he","stop","and","he","proce","to","have","intercours","despit","her","plea","i","think","that","thi","typ","of","rape","be","all","too","common","and","in","fact","mani","uniform","peopl","refus","to","accept","the","fact","that","it","be","even","a","rape","good","no","mean","no","thi","be","a","rape","which","probabl","occur","a","lot","in","univers","across","the","countrybr","br","have","establish","the","rape","how","doe","singleton","deal","with","it","when","the","frat","boi","try","to","call","the","woman","her","roommat","refus","to","put","the","victim","on","the","phone","at","which","point","the","frat","boi","call","the","roommat","a","black","bitch","the","aggriev","roommat","appear","to","appeal","to","a","counsel","of","ic","cube","et","al","who","then","proce","to","physic","humili","and","abus","the","frat","boi","into","repeat","and","prolong","apologi","to","roommat","for","hi","racist","remark","howev","the","appar","in","singleton","mind","lesser","crime","of","rape","be","not","mention","again","no","on","realli","should","feel","sorri","for","the","frat","boi","howev","singleton","seem","to","be","send","a","dual","messag","that","a","racist","comment","be","a","great","offens","then","rape","and","in","ani","event","violenc","be","justifi","against","jerksbr","br","what","be","so","ultim","so","disappoint","be","that","thi","movi","can","have","truli","be","about","someth","import","but","singleton","while","no","doubt","a","talent","director","doe","not","appear","to","have","the","matur","or","depth","to","pull","of","someth","of","thi","magnitud"],"filtered":["singleton","seriou","issu","come","grip","get","feel","think","pretti","smart","howev","thi","movi","almost","comic","transpar","self","righteou","addit","bunch","mightmakesright","messag","like","local","nazi","jerk","get","beat","mean","right","mind","go","root","bunch","nazi","jerk","howev","wai","singleton","portrai","fight","downright","silli","seem","design","show","u","much","superior","fight","qualiti","black","protagonist","anyth","els","anoth","bad","gui","realiti","drunken","frat","boi","rape","movi","protagonist","thi","instanc","think","singleton","actual","doe","nice","job","portrai","probabl","common","situat","woman","involv","ask","frat","boi","us","condom","either","doe","doe","want","us","ani","event","doe","acced","demand","stop","proce","intercours","despit","plea","think","thi","typ","rape","common","fact","mani","uniform","peopl","refus","accept","fact","even","rape","good","mean","thi","rape","probabl","occur","lot","univers","across","countrybr","br","establish","rape","doe","singleton","deal","frat","boi","try","call","woman","roommat","refus","put","victim","phone","point","frat","boi","call","roommat","black","bitch","aggriev","roommat","appear","appeal","counsel","ic","cube","et","al","proce","physic","humili","abus","frat","boi","repeat","prolong","apologi","roommat","hi","racist","remark","howev","appar","singleton","mind","lesser","crime","rape","mention","realli","feel","sorri","frat","boi","howev","singleton","seem","send","dual","messag","racist","comment","great","offens","rape","ani","event","violenc","justifi","jerksbr","br","ultim","disappoint","thi","movi","truli","someth","import","singleton","doubt","talent","director","doe","appear","matur","depth","pull","someth","thi","magnitud"],"filtered2":["singleton","seriou","issu","come","grip","get","feel","think","pretti","smart","howev","almost","comic","transpar","self","righteou","addit","bunch","mightmakesright","messag","like","local","nazi","jerk","get","beat","mean","right","mind","go","root","bunch","nazi","jerk","howev","wai","singleton","portrai","fight","downright","silli","seem","design","show","u","superior","fight","qua

{"value":"A novel by Remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the wars. A Gestapo officer undercover.<br /><br />It's a pity there's no synergy here. The bits and pieces never coalesce.<br /><br />Stories about left-wing refugees in France don't have to be this dull. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir \"Scum of the Earth\" (if you can find it). Or his chilling \"Dialogue With Death\" (ditto).<br /><br />To me, the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details.<br /><br />The leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself. It certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly. But, according to the film, it's only sold in cheap, low-class saloons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. References to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists.<br /><br />I enjoy films set in France because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background. I wasn't disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals.<br /><br />The film's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera \"The Emperor Jones\", based on the O'Neill play. It premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. It should surface again soon though; they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.<br /><br />Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer's character operates under his \"Czech\" aliases. Two of them are \"Wozzeck\" and \"Gunther\", both prominent roles in German opera. Is that just coincidence?<br /><br />Name-dropping just seems to be part of this film. Notice that they call up \"Himmelstoss\" on the phone. Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier \"All Quiet on the Western Front\".<br /><br />Well, the in-jokes are all in place; guess there wasn't time to develop any drama.","finished_norm":["a","novel","by","remarqu","a","cast","that","look","great","on","paper","a","leftw","refuge","struggl","to","remain","in","pari","between","the","war","a","gestapo","offic","undercoverbr","br","it","a","piti","there","no","synergi","here","the","bit","and","piec","never","coalescebr","br","stori","about","leftw","refuge","in","franc","do","not","have","to","be","thi","dull","read","arthur","koestler","memoir","scum","of","the","earth","if","you","can","find","it","or","hi","chill","dialogu","with","death","dittobr","br","to","me","the","onli","interest","in","thi","film","lie","in","some","of","the","incident","detailsbr","br","the","lead","spend","a","lot","of","time","drink","calvado","the","norman","appl","brandi","i","welcom","ani","prompt","to","have","a","nip","of","calvado","myself","it","certainli","make","thi","film","appear","to","pass","much","quickli","but","accord","to","the","film","it","onli","sell","in","cheap","lowclass","saloon","vive","le","tabac","parisien","that","what","i","sai","refer","to","intox","liquor","do","abound","here","that","would","seem","to","be","a","preoccup","of","the","scenaristsbr","br","i","enjoi","film","set","in","franc","becaus","it","can","be","amus","wait","for","the","inevit","fullsiz","alcohol","ad","to","pop","up","on","a","wall","in","the","background","i","be","not","disappoint","thi","time","it","be","for","byrrh","a","veri","unusu","choic","thi","film","would","rate","a","if","onli","we","be","judg","it","on","the","refin","of","it","booz","muralsbr","br","the","film","indiffer","score","be","by","loui","gruenberg","gruenberg","be","well","know","if","you","can","call","it","that","for","hi","opu","the","emperor","jone","base","on","the","o","neill","plai","it","premièr","at","roughli","the","same","time","a","the","film","version","star","paul","robeson","the","opu","surviv","todai","in","a","record","or","two","by","lawrenc","tibbett","it","should","surfac","again","soon","though","thei","re","run","out","of","potenti","market","opera","to","revivebr","br","opu","seem","a","appropri","subject","to","mention","here","sinc","charl","boyer","charact","oper","under","hi","czech","alia","two","of","them","be","wozzeck","and","gunther","both","promin","role","in","german","opu","be","that","just","coincidencebr","br","namedrop","just","seem","to","be","part","of","thi","film","notic","that","thei","call","up","himmelstoss","on","the","phone","himmelstoss","happen","to","be","on","of","the","main","charact","in","remarqu","earli","all","quiet","on","the","western","frontbr","br","good","the","injok","be","all","in","place","guess","there","be","not","time","to","develop","ani","drama"],"filtered":["novel","remarqu","cast","look","great","paper","leftw","refuge","struggl","remain","pari","war","gestapo","offic","undercoverbr","br","piti","synergi","bit","piec","never","coalescebr","br","stori","leftw","refuge","franc","thi","dull","read","arthur","koestler","memoir","scum","earth","find","hi","chill","dialogu","death","dittobr","br","onli","interest","thi","film","lie","incident","detailsbr","br","lead","spend","lot","time","drink","calvado","norman","appl","brandi","welcom","ani","prompt","nip","calvado","certainli","make","thi","film","appear","pass","much","quickli","accord","film","onli","sell","cheap","lowclass","saloon","vive","le","tabac","parisien","sai","refer","intox","liquor","abound","seem","preoccup","scenaristsbr","br","enjoi","film","set","franc","becaus","amus","wait","inevit","fullsiz","alcohol","ad","pop","wall","background","disappoint","thi","time","byrrh","veri","unusu","choic","thi","film","rate","onli","judg","refin","booz","muralsbr","br","film","indiffer","score","loui","gruenberg","gruenberg","well","know","call","hi","opu","emperor","jone","base","o","neill","plai","premièr","roughli","time","film","version","star","paul","robeson","opu","surviv","todai","record","two","lawrenc","tibbett","surfac","soon","though","thei","re","run","potenti","market","opera","revivebr","br","opu","seem","appropri","subject","mention","sinc","charl","boyer","charact","oper","hi","czech","alia","two","wozzeck","gunther","promin","role","german","opu","coincidencebr","br","namedrop","seem","part","thi","film","notic","thei","call","himmelstoss","phone","himmelstoss","happen","main","charact","remarqu","earli","quiet","western","frontbr","br","good","injok","place","guess","time","develop","ani","drama"],"filtered2":["novel","remarqu","cast","look","great","paper","leftw","refuge","struggl","remain","pari","war","gestapo","offic","undercoverbr","piti","synergi","bit","piec","never","coalescebr","stori","leftw","refuge","franc","dull","read","arthur","koestler","memoir","scum","earth","find","chill","dialogu","death","dittobr","onli","interest","lie","incident","detailsbr","lead","spend","lot","time","drink","calvado","norman","appl","brandi","welcom","ani","prompt","nip","calvado","certainli","make","appear","pass","quickli","acc

{"value":"I'm a big fan of Lucio Fulci; many of his Giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time, but this made for TV movie is extremely sub par and not what I've come to expect from the great Italian director. The film is neither interesting, like some of Fulci's more tame Giallo's, or gory like the majority of his cult classics; thus leaving it lacking in both major areas, and ultimately ensuring that the film isn't very good. The film works from a plot that has been used many times previously, but still it's an idea that always has the chance of springing an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the afterlife, which is the ultimate unknown. This film focuses on Giorgio Mainardi; a man that isn't exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach hemorrhage, there aren't many people that are sad to see him go. This means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the afterlife, and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death, and his only ally in this endeavour is his daughter.<br /><br />The video that I saw this film on is proudly proclaimed that the film is \"in the style of HP Lovecraft\", and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film I've ever seen. There is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale, and the reason for that tagline would appear to be because of title similarity to the Stuart Gordon/Lovecraft film, 'From Beyond' - which is a lot better. The film does benefit from a distinctly Italian style, and the score is rather good. Unfortunately, however, Fulci has seen fit to positively roast every scene in it - and so the theme quickly becomes annoying. The plot plays out in a really boring way, and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost 'desperately' trying to find things out, or the daughter placing her suspicions over her family members. This movie was made for Italian TV, and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame. There's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies; but this isn't the Fulci we all know and love. Overall, this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of Fulci's talents. Not worth bothering with, unless you're a Fulci

Even more troubling is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in opening narration we're told WURB takes place shortly after the original.) At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown since the start of the film and embraced having a hybrid co-anchorwoman/lover. In this film, he's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to Veronica (quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman spliced in to WURB.) <br /><br />The part that makes this a movie, a continually evolving story, involves a bank-robbing clan without a cause called the Alarm Clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit through. This part was scrapped from the original scripts for Anchorman.<br /><br />The majority of other scenes involving our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternate/deleted takes on scenes from Anchorman. They go to the same party as in the original, the same original \"group bitching about having a woman on the team\" scene, and the same cat fashion show segment that Veronica had objections to reporting.<br /><br />Burgundy re-creates their first date with the drive-in spot overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club, Tinos. Neither character make mention that they've been to the drive-in spot before and when Burgundy walks into Tinos with Veronica, he introduces it to her as though they've never been before. Oh, and they're wearing the same clothes as on their original date.<br /><br />Still, I have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even if WURB is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration. Between the two Ron Burgundy stories - this is the weaker one. Looking back on it, it's quite a feat for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB. You stay classy, IMDb.

{"value":"I would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn't any. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but \"hinglish\" is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill. I would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action, but I don't like cartoons much. <br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - I promise it'll push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More power to them. If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. Afterthought: The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own. ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)<br /><br />Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Screenplay writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - \"Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health\" ?<br /><br />Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. The English sub-titles - \"Mera Dil Kho Gaya\" becomes - \"My heart is in a void\" , \"Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya\" turns into \"Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond\" ..priceless.<br /><br />In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours!

{"value":"Just once I'd like to see a version of Beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem. Yet again, after watching this Sci Fi presentation, I'm disappointed. <br /><br />I'm not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in Old English, but I wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern English and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires. The story is exciting enough; why add plot elements that are non-existent and ruin the story? What's wrong with being faithful to the text? <br /><br />Grendel is immune to weapons of any kind; why introduce some super-crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period (as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer)? The fight with Grendel was Beowulf vs. Grendel. That's it. No one else took part in the battle. The only way Beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons, the mistake made by all previous challengers. Yet, in this version, Danes and Geats fight the beast and Beowulf hacks off Grendel's arm with a sword! Again, why couldn't they portray what really happened? Personally, I think a one-on-one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting. <br /><br />Overall, this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale. Why add in a pact with Hrothgar and Grendel's mother that includes sacrificial offering? Why create extra characters, like Finn, that add nothing to the story? There was no love story in the poem. They couldn't even set the scenes in the appropriate locations (a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake). They fail to notice the metaphor that Grendel's lair signifies  it's supposed to be underground to represent hell. Why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem? Even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on Beowulf, since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story. If Hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot, then that would be a truly great movie.","finished_norm":["just","onc","i","have","like","to","see","a","version","of","beowulf","where","it","appear","the","screenwrit","have","at","littl","a","pass","familiar","with","the","origin","poem","yet","again","after","watch","thi","sci","fi","present","i","be","disappoint","br","br","i","be","not","suggest","the","writer","ne","to","understand","and","analyz","the","poem","in","old","english","but","i","wish","thei","can","at","littl","try","to","read","a","translat","in","modern","english","and","attempt","to","construct","a","stori","base","on","what","actual","transpir","the","stori","be","excit","enough","why","add","plot","elem","that","be","nonexist","and","ruin","the","stori","what","wrong","with","be","faith","to","the","text","br","br","grendel","be","immun","to","weapon","of","ani","kind","why","introduc","some","supercrossbow","that","be","unbeliev","and","can","not","have","possibli","exist","in","thi","time","period","a","correctli","point","out","by","the","previou","review","the","fight","with","grendel","be","beowulf","v","grendel","that","it","no","on","els","take","part","in","the","battl","the","onli","wai","beowulf","can","have","defeat","him","be","by","choos","specif","to","engag","the","monster","without","ani","weapon","the","mistak","make","by","all","previou","challeng","yet","in","thi","version","dane","and","geat","fight","the","beast","and","beowulf","hack","off","grendel","arm","with","a","sword","again","why","can","not","thei","portrai","what","realli","happen","person","i","think","a","oneonon","grappl","match","between","the","two","would","be","much","much","excit","br","br","overal","thi","be","a","pathet","and","abysm","depict","that","be","faithless","to","the","true","tale","why","add","in","a","pact","with","hrothgar","and","grendel","mother","that","includ","sacrifici","offer","why","creat","extra","charact","like","finn","that","add","noth","to","the","stori","there","be","no","love","stori","in","the","poem","thei","can","not","even","set","the","scene","in","the","appropri","locat","a","forest","instead","of","the","swamp","and","no","lair","under","the","lake","thei","fail","to","notic","the","metaphor","that","grendel","lair","signifi","it","suppos","to","be","underground","to","repres","hell","why","not","instead","center","on","the","symbol","inher","in","the","epic","poem","even","my","high","school","student","last","year","be","abl","to","do","immens","well","when","thei","creat","a","short","film","base","on","beowulf","sinc","thei","focu","on","the","theme","and","symbol","underli","the","stori","if","hollywood","can","creat","a","film","that","center","on","thi","elem","and","be","faith","to","the","plot","then","that","would","be","a","truli","great","movi"],"filtered":["onc","like","see","version","beowulf","appear","screenwrit","littl","pass","familiar","origin","poem","yet","watch","thi","sci","fi","present","disappoint","br","br","suggest","writer","ne","understand","analyz","poem","old","english","wish","thei","littl","try","read","translat","modern","english","attempt","construct","stori","base","actual","transpir","stori","excit","enough","add","plot","elem","nonexist","ruin","stori","wrong","faith","text","br","br","grendel","immun","weapon","ani","kind","introduc","supercrossbow","unbeliev","possibli","exist","thi","time","period","correctli","point","previou","review","fight","grendel","beowulf","v","grendel","els","take","part","battl","onli","wai","beowulf","defeat","choos","specif","engag","monster","without","ani","weapon","mistak","make","previou","challeng","yet","thi","version","dane","geat","fight","beast","beowulf","hack","grendel","arm","sword","thei","portrai","realli","happen","person","think","oneonon","grappl","match","two","much","much","excit","br","br","overal","thi","pathet","abysm","depict","faithless","true","tale","add","pact","hrothgar","grendel","mother","includ","sacrifici","offer","creat","extra","charact","like","finn","add","noth","stori","love","stori","poem","thei","even","set","scene","appropri","locat","forest","instead","swamp","lair","lake","thei","fail","notic","metaphor","grendel","lair","signifi","suppos","underground","repres","hell","instead","center","symbol","inher","epic","poem","even","high","school","student","last","year","abl","immens","well","thei","creat","short","film","base","beowulf","sinc","thei","focu","theme","symbol","underli","stori","hollywood","creat","film","center","thi","elem","faith","plot","truli","great","movi"],"filtered2":["onc","like","see","version","beowulf","appear","screenwrit","littl","pass","familiar","origin","poem","yet","watch","sci","fi","present","disappoint","suggest","writer","ne","understand","analyz","poem","old","english","wish","littl","try","read","translat","modern","english","attempt","construct","stori","base","actual","transpir","stori","excit","enough","add","plot","elem","nonexist","ruin","stori","wrong","faith","text","grendel","immun","weap

{"value":"When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical \"mysterious\" vampire and Sookie presented herself as an independent woman. However, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box.<br /><br />As the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities. By episode 5, Bill's furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show. The way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more. As soon as Sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz, only thinking of Bill's libido and the size of his appendage. Bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just gets plain silly. His actions are never really explained except he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other is never delved into, if there is any love. So far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, vampires usually equal sex but come on. Every five seconds I see some sort of humping going on. It wasn't that much of a surprise, since HBO always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent TV show. Bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with Sookie with no reason what's so ever? I laughed so hard I almost peed myself.<br /><br />The plot is just a stream of consciousness. The characters never go into detail about anything. All the events that happen are usually left unexplained. The only thing that is constant is the sex.<br /><br />The only thing I can say that I do like are the minor characters. Tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters. The only reason why I continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters. <br /><br />Minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile.","finished_norm":["when","i","watch","the","show","the","few","episod","seem","promis","bill","compton","introduc","himself","a","the","stereotyp","mysteri","vampir","and","sooki","present","herself","a","a","independ","woman","howev","the","show","go","downhil","from","here","and","the","onc","interest","charact","be","a","entertain","a","a","cardboard","boxbr","br","a","the","stori","progress","the","main","charact","lose","their","origin","person","along","with","their","act","abil","by","episod","bill","furrow","eyebrow","be","so","low","that","hi","face","just","consist","of","a","forehead","sooki","or","rather","the","actress","be","even","much","dead","than","her","vampir","lover","all","thi","tragic","event","be","surround","her","and","she","onli","react","to","how","enjoy","it","be","lose","her","virgin","person","i","think","thei","make","the","main","charact","sleep","with","each","other","too","earli","in","the","show","the","wai","thei","teas","each","other","be","someth","that","have","me","hook","and","can","easili","be","toi","with","a","bite","much","a","soon","a","sooki","lose","it","she","strut","around","like","a","total","ditz","onli","think","of","bill","libido","and","the","size","of","hi","appendag","bill","conjur","lose","hi","debonair","attitud","and","good","he","just","get","plain","silli","hi","action","be","never","realli","explain","except","he","doe","it","for","sooki","why","their","love","for","each","other","be","never","delv","into","if","there","be","ani","love","so","far","it","just","seem","to","be","sex","that","be","the","core","of","their","relationshipbr","br","ye","ye","vampir","usual","equal","sex","but","come","on","everi","five","second","i","see","some","sort","of","hump","go","on","it","be","not","that","much","of","a","surpris","sinc","hbo","alwai","try","to","pass","of","a","soft","core","porno","a","a","decent","tv","show","bill","pop","out","of","the","dirt","and","just","get","it","on","with","sooki","with","no","reason","what","so","ever","i","laugh","so","hard","i","almost","pee","myselfbr","br","the","plot","be","just","a","stream","of","conscious","the","charact","never","go","into","detail","about","anyth","all","the","event","that","happen","be","usual","leav","unexplain","the","onli","thing","that","be","constant","be","the","sexbr","br","the","onli","thing","i","can","sai","that","i","do","like","be","the","minor","charact","tara","and","her","drink","mother","be","far","much","interest","than","the","major","charact","the","onli","reason","why","i","continu","to","watch","the","show","be","for","the","develop","of","the","minor","charact","br","br","minu","the","sex","and","the","main","charact","the","show","would","be","much","much","worthwhil"],"filtered":["watch","show","episod","seem","promis","bill","compton","introduc","stereotyp","mysteri","vampir","sooki","present","independ","woman","howev","show","go","downhil","onc","interest","charact","entertain","cardboard","boxbr","br","stori","progress","main","charact","lose","origin","person","along","act","abil","episod","bill","furrow","eyebrow","low","hi","face","consist","forehead","sooki","rather","actress","even","much","dead","vampir","lover","thi","tragic","event","surround","onli","react","enjoy","lose","virgin","person","think","thei","make","main","charact","sleep","earli","show","wai","thei","teas","someth","hook","easili","toi","bite","much","soon","sooki","lose","strut","around","like","total","ditz","onli","think","bill","libido","size","hi","appendag","bill","conjur","lose","hi","debonair","attitud","good","get","plain","silli","hi","action","never","realli","explain","except","doe","sooki","love","never","delv","ani","love","far","seem","sex","core","relationshipbr","br","ye","ye","vampir","usual","equal","sex","come","everi","five","second","see","sort","hump","go","much","surpris","sinc","hbo","alwai","try","pass","soft","core","porno","decent","tv","show","bill","pop","dirt","get","sooki","reason","ever","laugh","hard","almost","pee","myselfbr","br","plot","stream","conscious","charact","never","go","detail","anyth","event","happen","usual","leav","unexplain","onli","thing","constant","sexbr","br","onli","thing","sai","like","minor","charact","tara","drink","mother","far","much","interest","major","charact","onli","reason","continu","watch","show","develop","minor","charact","br","br","minu","sex","main","charact","show","much","much","worthwhil"],"filtered2":["watch","show","seem","promis","bill","compton","introduc","stereotyp","mysteri","vampir","sooki","present","independ","woman","howev","show","go","downhil","onc","interest","charact","entertain","cardboard","boxbr","stori","progress","main","charact","lose","origin","person","along","act","abil","bill","furrow","eyebrow","low","face","consist","forehead","sooki","rather","actress","even","dead","vampir","lover","tragic","event","surround","onli","react","enjoy","lose","virgin","person","think","make","ma

{"value":"Scary Movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments. It all begins when roving reporter Cindy Campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps. She soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe-threatening developments including alien invaders, killer videotapes, freaky crop circles and much more. Faced with conspiracies of massive proportions, and a crew of very strange people following her around, Cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again. The plot is a non-issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less. This time around they focus on Signs, The Ring, Matrix Reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones. The first one was {imo} one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special. Let's just say that I didn't mind seeing it once but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. The jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve Charlie Sheen. The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos. Their in the opening sequence spoofing The Ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film. Denise Richards, Queen Latifah, Camryn Manheim and many others also have cameos. David Zucker directs and while this isn't another Airplane, it's also not another My Boss's Daughter either. Its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not. Like I said before if you do like it, you probably won't really like it that much. In the end, I found it a bit disappointing as the PG-13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed.

{"value":"Not only does the film's author, Steven Greenstreet, obviously idolize Michael Moore, but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of Moore's Propaganda film-making tactics. Moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though, while Greenstreet is obviously less skilled here.<br /><br />Having been privy to all of the issues surrounding Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community -- that Moore was being paid $40,000 of the State of Utah 's educational funds to basically promote John Kerry's campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie -- were pushed to the background by Greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalized.<br /><br />The marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable... promoting the film by claiming that \"Mormon's tried to kill Moore\". Not only is this preposterous, but it defames a major religion that Greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all of the major news agencies noted that Moore's visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in Utah.<br /><br />Greenstreet has banked on this film to jump-start his film-making career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this. This seems to have been a severe miscalculation though, since Moore's visits to roughly 60 other colleges and Universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest for this rather common event. Greenstreet's assumption that American audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesn't seem to be well founded.<br /><br />Even the name of the film, This Divided State, is somewhat of a misnomer since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bush's re-election and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other State. The division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in Greenstreet's ideological differences with his religion and State. If anything, I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and Woody Allen's hilarious contention in Sleeper (1973) that, \"I was beaten up by Quakers\".","finished_norm":["not","onli","doe","the","film","author","steven","greenstreet","obvious","idol","michael","moor","but","he","conjur","follow","in","hi","footstep","by","us","sever","of","moor","propaganda","filmmak","tactic","moor","have","expertis","in","distract","the","viewer","from","thi","focu","though","while","greenstreet","be","obvious","littl","skill","herebr","br","have","be","privi","to","all","of","the","issu","surround","moor","speech","at","uvsc","i","be","disappoint","to","see","that","the","major","complaint","of","the","commun","that","moor","be","be","pai","of","the","state","of","utah","educ","fund","to","basic","promot","john","kerri","campaign","and","to","advertis","hi","own","liber","movi","be","push","to","the","background","by","greenstreet","while","lesser","issu","be","sensationalizedbr","br","the","market","method","for","thi","video","have","be","equal","bia","and","objection","promot","the","film","by","claim","that","mormon","try","to","kill","moor","not","onli","be","thi","preposter","but","it","defam","a","major","religion","that","greenstreet","obvious","have","some","person","issu","with","i","follow","moor","visit","veri","close","and","all","of","the","major","new","agenc","note","that","moor","visit","come","and","go","without","ani","credibl","secur","problem","or","incid","in","utahbr","br","greenstreet","have","bank","on","thi","film","to","jumpstart","hi","filmmak","career","to","the","point","that","he","have","even","drop","out","of","film","school","to","help","acceler","thi","thi","seem","to","have","be","a","sever","miscalcul","though","sinc","moor","visit","to","roughli","other","colleg","and","univers","across","the","countri","in","dilut","interest","for","thi","rather","common","event","greenstreet","assumpt","that","american","audienc","would","be","interest","in","thi","film","due","to","the","promot","religi","and","conserv","angl","doe","not","seem","to","be","good","foundedbr","br","even","the","name","of","the","film","thi","divid","state","be","somewhat","of","a","misnom","sinc","utah","vote","overwhelmingli","for","bush","reelect","and","thu","appear","to","be","much","polit","unifi","than","ani","other","state","the","divis","in","the","movi","titl","seem","much","indic","of","the","gulf","that","exist","in","greenstreet","ideolog","differ","with","hi","religion","and","state","if","anyth","i","find","a","humor","correl","between","the","religi","angl","of","thi","suppos","documentari","and","woodi","allen","hilari","content","in","sleeper","that","i","be","beat","up","by","quaker"],"filtered":["onli","doe","film","author","steven","greenstreet","obvious","idol","michael","moor","conjur","follow","hi","footstep","us","sever","moor","propaganda","filmmak","tactic","moor","expertis","distract","viewer","thi","focu","though","greenstreet","obvious","littl","skill","herebr","br","privi","issu","surround","moor","speech","uvsc","disappoint","see","major","complaint","commun","moor","pai","state","utah","educ","fund","basic","promot","john","kerri","campaign","advertis","hi","liber","movi","push","background","greenstreet","lesser","issu","sensationalizedbr","br","market","method","thi","video","equal","bia","objection","promot","film","claim","mormon","try","kill","moor","onli","thi","preposter","defam","major","religion","greenstreet","obvious","person","issu","follow","moor","visit","veri","close","major","new","agenc","note","moor","visit","come","go","without","ani","credibl","secur","problem","incid","utahbr","br","greenstreet","bank","thi","film","jumpstart","hi","filmmak","career","point","even","drop","film","school","help","acceler","thi","thi","seem","sever","miscalcul","though","sinc","moor","visit","roughli","colleg","univers","across","countri","dilut","interest","thi","rather","common","event","greenstreet","assumpt","american","audienc","interest","thi","film","due","promot","religi","conserv","angl","doe","seem","good","foundedbr","br","even","name","film","thi","divid","state","somewhat","misnom","sinc","utah","vote","overwhelmingli","bush","reelect","thu","appear","much","polit","unifi","ani","state","divis","movi","titl","seem","much","indic","gulf","exist","greenstreet","ideolog","differ","hi","religion","state","anyth","find","humor","correl","religi","angl","thi","suppos","documentari","woodi","allen","hilari","content","sleeper","beat","quaker"],"filtered2":["onli","doe","author","steven","greenstreet","obvious","idol","michael","moor","conjur","follow","footstep","us","sever","moor","propaganda","filmmak","tactic","moor","expertis","distract","viewer","focu","though","greenstreet","obvious","littl","skill","herebr","privi","issu","surround","moor","speech","uvsc","disappoint","see","major","complaint","commun","moor","pai","state","utah","educ","fund","basic","promot","john","kerri","campaign","advertis","liber","push","background","greenstreet","lesser","issu","sensationalizedbr","market","method","video","equal","

{"value":"Since the 70s, writer/producer/director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science-fiction, fantasy and horror B-movies. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems.<br /><br />A Terminator style tale of time-travel and action, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth, a future cop given the task of tracking down bad-guy Whistler, who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor. Whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers, converting them into obedient zombies (the 'trancers' of the title), and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack follows him to 1985, determined to stop him.<br /><br />In this 1991 sequel, Jack is still living in 1985. Having destroyed Whistler, he has settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie. But, for Jack, things don't stay calm for long, and trouble appears in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build a trancer army.<br /><br />Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was. The story is difficult to pick up if you haven't seen the first film (or at least not for a long while), and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects. Gone is the inventiveness and wit that made Trancers so much fun; instead we get some cheesy one-liners and a script that feels like it was written on-the-fly.<br /><br />About the only reason I can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast, which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci-fi and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to be having an 'off day' whilst filming Trancers II, and performances are mediocre at best.<br /><br />The Trancers series obviously has its fans; four further sequels have since been churned out. Unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing, I can't imagine them being any

He makes a very human, even sympathetic psycho, and really disappears into the character--no small feat for such a recognizable performer. <br /><br />Too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste. The supporting performances (and performers) wouldn't look out of place in a soft-core porno (it doesn't help that every character but Sy is made of 100% cardboard). At times, the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense: we know from the very first moments a) that Sy is a complete whack-job, b) that he survives, and c) that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end. So all we're left to ponder is the hows and the whys, and the answers provided aren't all that interesting.<br /><br />The plot is plodding and contrived, and features some nonsensical moments (for instance, the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes, even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore). About two thirds of the way through, Sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme. And the final clichéd explanation of his psychosis, right out of `Peeping Tom,' is a terrible copout.<br /><br />The dialogue is of the absolute worst sort. It's not overwritten, or awkward, or unbelievable, or bad in any other way that could be considered fun, even for bad-movie lovers. Instead, every line is purely, hideously functional--it's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said, `Hey, I need a workable script on this--in an hour.' It made me want to scream, honestly.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware-the-help thrillers of the eighties and nineties (`The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,' e.g.), and while it's certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary. Sy's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable, but on its own that's not enough to make the film work. In the end, lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved, except Robin Williams, sinks this one. 3 out of
