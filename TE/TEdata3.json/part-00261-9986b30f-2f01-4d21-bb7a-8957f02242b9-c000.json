{"value":"The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.","finished_norm":["the","stori","be","veri","trustworthi","and","power","the","technic","side","of","the","movi","be","quit","fine","even","the","direct","of","it","the","main","problem","be","with","the","cast","that","turn","that","movi","into","almost","anoth","local","and","regular","cliché","with","a","great","lack","of","impact","and","even","great","lack","of","impress","besid","the","small","role","of","the","father","rafael","plai","impress","by","asi","dayan","all","other","actor","be","unfortun","not","in","their","well","the","role","of","the","old","blind","girl","plai","by","tali","sharon","be","fresh","but","without","ani","intens","a","the","lead","role","therefor","the","figur","she","act","have","becom","mild","and","low","profil","there","be","moment","and","episod","that","look","much","like","a","rehears","then","a","real","movi","but","after","all","it","a","good","point","to","begin","from","and","to","make","big","improv","in","the","futur"],"filtered":["stori","veri","trustworthi","power","technic","side","movi","quit","fine","even","direct","main","problem","cast","turn","movi","almost","anoth","local","regular","cliché","great","lack","impact","even","great","lack","impress","besid","small","role","father","rafael","plai","impress","asi","dayan","actor","unfortun","well","role","old","blind","girl","plai","tali","sharon","fresh","without","ani","intens","lead","role","therefor","figur","act","becom","mild","low","profil","moment","episod","look","much","like","rehears","real","movi","good","point","begin","make","big","improv","futur"],"filtered2":["stori","veri","trustworthi","power","technic","side","quit","fine","even","direct","main","problem","cast","turn","almost","anoth","local","regular","cliché","great","lack","impact","even","great","lack","impress","besid","small","role","father","rafael","plai","impress","asi","dayan","actor","unfortun","well","role","old","blind","girl","plai","tali","sharon","fresh","without","ani","intens","lead","role","therefor","figur","act","becom","mild","low","profil","moment","look","like","rehears","real","good","point","begin","make","big","improv","futur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,15,16,17,20,21,27,40,41,51,66,67,73,80,82,84,92,96,102,115,120,125,128,131,147,157,167,179,183,188,217,227,342,363,366,415,418,425,464,475,523,844,944,972,1116,1228,1350,1493,1658,1759,1796,2500,4593,4864,5834],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,15,16,17,20,21,27,40,41,51,66,67,73,80,82,84,92,96,102,115,120,125,128,131,147,157,167,179,183,188,217,227,342,363,366,415,418,425,464,475,523,844,944,972,1116,1228,1350,1493,1658,1759,1796,2500,4593,4864,5834],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,3.2569937516641474,1.5687599167621034,3.4279798616619646,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,1.8950689206770979,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.2212694515902225,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.087553710177271,2.201553588425805,2.2044500422972613,2.2242236634876535,7.0229706123476525,2.2512118082053005,2.2844323215331563,2.3360150694757706,2.4609576687888097,2.507968722980095,4.977025712729459,2.5378812223426954,2.6113665294700725,2.6005321873043625,3.112795625839981,3.0349689855553557,3.185521045582134,3.1588018988486244,6.328935272768604,3.226987993365636,3.2872346624216657,3.3721070011625462,3.4986697244709752,3.8690435127678695,3.969732115064953,3.9911462095687695,4.181290492043933,4.3095999406873045,4.470719289830655,4.605250182788262,4.637773374493822,4.751432692966343,4.77960356993304,5.156897801074508,6.600350576034347,6.101359409915359,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.993433528859764E-5,6.946275171643368E-5,7.000275837488143E-5,6.9598281691227E-5,6.95994219807136E-5,6.950213589740661E-5,6.970884498771594E-5,6.947275389879764E-5,6.962895397538472E-5,0.11796217263451833,0.8765804219797223,6.936060955695463E-5,7.065519093861187E-5,7.166310276284222E-5,6.941118658988065E-5,6.921936401825334E-5,7.094595446736878E-5,6.971537618030685E-5,6.949908449728751E-5,6.955668688160896E-5,7.02296886230056E-5,6.978444647679883E-5,6.986390665586178E-5,6.993917717940964E-5,7.047592443322644E-5,7.010735518893181E-5,7.305453521667517E-5,6.938122983021101E-5,6.938308594059131E-5,6.955886759645936E-5,7.103732504331495E-5,6.971133676957514E-5,7.48292146548259E-5,6.990742447284364E-5,6.945674817872535E-5,6.977733685792997E-5,6.938715078133882E-5,6.942815348231266E-5,6.92190162545719E-5,6.923697486086311E-5,6.939281887669746E-5,7.012476607670975E-5,6.976843267162901E-5,6.949258779184522E-5,7.03369956009

{"value":"I was eager to see \"Mr. Fix It\" because I'm a huge David Boreanaz fan. What I got, though, was a 1-1/2 hour nap. The premise seemed enjoyable: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, proprietor of a business called \"Mr. Fix It\", where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back.<br /><br />Among the problems with this movie are the editing, script, and acting. Although I've found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that \"Crow\" movie he did), this was disappointing. At times, his character was interesting and others, flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players.

{"value":"If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch \"Waking Life,\" which is brilliant. \"What the #$*! Do We Know\" is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. It wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. The inclusion of that rambling freak \"Ramtha\" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. Isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something? What a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was.

{"value":"I figured that any horror film with Orson Welles in it would be weird. Necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good. The film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists/witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. The director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. By the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters. It seems odd that Welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do. Maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie.

{"value":"Although Robert \"Knox\" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are asinine and amateurish, and and just not very funny, unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /><br />He's certainly not famous, as him immature fans would like you to believe, by harassing people at Wikipedia, or stuffing the ratings votes here at the IMDb. He's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets, which speaks volumes about his and his creation's \"fame\".<br /><br />Benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation, but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer.

{"value":"Sure, if you ask any mom who's the most beautiful baby in the world, she'd tell you her son is the most amazing kid in the whole world. She's right, at least in her own world.<br /><br />The producers of the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, well, do I need to say more? I'll break it down for those who doesn't want to do a simple deduction.<br /><br />The whole movie was fake. You may just put a few biggie's MTV video together and call it a movie.<br /><br />The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real one in life looks like a dog.<br /><br />I just wonder why he called himself biggie small. Big body Small dick? Big mouth Small sound? Big fat Small eyes? Disclaimer: I'm a person of color.

{"value":"The clichéd Polynesian males drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and unfunny remarks. Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped, cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl didn't look or act Samoan at all, seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. With weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene, and only two or three 'jokes'. What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money, what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community.

{"value":"I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most aren't great, or even good, this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies.<br /><br />The plot: not sure really. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and bad guys? Hard to tell. Most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good Seagals character \"Mashall\" is.<br /><br />Acting: Blows.<br /><br />Voice Dubbing ,,,,,, What was with the horrible voice overdubbing?! Could they of found anyone who sounded any less like Seagal? May as well had Cheech or Chong doing the voice overs, might of at least been entertaining then.<br /><br />This movie is boring, and completely stupid.

{"value":"Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film, and be forced to play a part-Mexican or he would have been suspended. Believe me , he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of \"Dodge City\", Warners tried a follow-up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of buddies, like Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and the ever-present John Litel, but they made the huge mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she proved one thing, and that is she cannot sing. The story was not too bad, but with Bogie clearly miscast also, it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong, and on a low budget, but in fairness, color would not have

{"value":"I'll give writer/director William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived \"thriller.\" A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO, let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurbs. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing significant to their resumes, although the art direction is not half bad. The dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit; this is storytelling at its worst. No tension, no suspense, no dread, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. A few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom, but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer. I feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing. Good for late-night, zoned-out viewing only.

{"value":"someone needed to make a car payment... this is truly awful... makes jean Claude's cyborg look like gone with the wind... this is an hour I wish I could sue to get back... luckily it produced severe somnolence... from which I fell asleep. how can actors of this caliber create this dog? I would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $5.99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie... if you really have to have it, wait till they throw them out after they have carried them

{"value":"Except for the Brady Variety Hour, this was some of the hokiest television I've seen in a while. The video production qualities weren't too bad, but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks like she did battle with the Avon Lady.. and lost big time. WAY too much eyeliner.<br /><br />It was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid take part in this. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavillion in World Showcase that would be opening 'in about a year.'<br /><br />As of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasn't opened yet (Unless you count Disney's Animal Kingdom.)

{"value":"What horrible writing and acting. No personality. What, you can't make a good movie with a single character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with self dialog.<br /><br />So this kid goes on a trip to see his father. The kid, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid-flight. So the kid crashes in a lake and survives. Then he runs around, surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued.<br /><br />During that time he fights a bear twice. The first time he fights it off in the lake. The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear.

{"value":"Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.","finished_norm":["firstli","there","be","some","good","thing","about","thi","film","but","it","all","clich","slasher","stuff","combin","with","a","teen","movi","in","the","advertis","of","thi","movi","that","i","have","see","a","larg","emphasi","be","on","the","fact","that","denis","richard","be","in","it","but","she","a","poor","actress","and","not","a","good","look","a","peopl","try","to","make","her","out","to","be","not","that","that","have","anyth","to","do","with","the","movi","and","what","with","that","look","she","give","everyon","perhap","it","part","of","the","charact","but","like","i","sai","the","act","still","the","write","be","fine","you","know","who","it","be","all","throughout","the","movi","and","you","can","almost","predict","what","be","about","to","happen","but","not","in","a","irrit","wai","i","think","the","book","it","base","on","be","probabl","good","judg","by","the","plot","line","but","next","time","i","will","read","the","book","to","find","out","rather","than","watch","thi"],"filtered":["firstli","good","thing","thi","film","clich","slasher","stuff","combin","teen","movi","advertis","thi","movi","see","larg","emphasi","fact","denis","richard","poor","actress","good","look","peopl","try","make","anyth","movi","look","give","everyon","perhap","part","charact","like","sai","act","still","write","fine","know","throughout","movi","almost","predict","happen","irrit","wai","think","book","base","probabl","good","judg","plot","line","next","time","read","book","find","rather","watch","thi"],"filtered2":["firstli","good","thing","clich","slasher","stuff","combin","teen","advertis","see","larg","emphasi","fact","denis","richard","poor","actress","good","look","peopl","try","make","anyth","look","give","everyon","perhap","part","charact","like","act","still","write","fine","know","throughout","almost","predict","happen","irrit","wai","think","book","base","probabl","good","judg","plot","line","next","time","read","book","find","rather","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,10,12,16,21,23,26,29,30,32,33,36,38,61,64,65,94,97,104,107,131,145,146,148,151,160,246,297,318,334,337,354,361,438,464,564,641,731,881,959,968,1023,1530,1581,2956,3708,4325],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,10,12,16,21,23,26,29,30,32,33,36,38,61,64,65,94,97,104,107,131,145,146,148,151,160,246,297,318,334,337,354,361,438,464,564,641,731,881,959,968,1023,1530,1581,2956,3708,4325],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,2.393227744058217,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,2.08112281984698,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,2.1439533986393955,2.2512118082053005,2.34599021453259,2.326138445979858,2.3018654096236517,5.6004909736203725,2.3722295531801256,2.673149229007135,2.813490713560207,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,2.973659465713028,3.0316467233633775,3.0399731661399314,3.1797351085150902,3.2872346624216657,3.469984576472117,3.7034641371169887,4.096025840389245,4.086456389373095,3.969732115064953,3.9911462095687695,4.1302590120314875,4.573751515728891,4.671389985292807,5.373120909544144,5.695894301807195,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.114240790920158E-5,9.052781334531426E-5,9.123158077135503E-5,9.070444372573556E-5,9.07059298159242E-5,9.057914105254978E-5,9.084853610935222E-5,9.054084875890953E-5,9.074441759297364E-5,1.0067597777682706E-4,0.7225988084655529,9.039469586696046E-5,9.20818680388521E-5,9.339543612013031E-5,9.046061073619825E-5,9.021061663820189E-5,9.246080762601941E-5,9.085704793143215E-5,9.057516429416349E-5,9.065023500137335E-5,9.152732919244344E-5,9.0947064274782E-5,9.10506213047131E-5,9.114871813701195E-5,9.184823772134254E-5,9.136789729531771E-5,9.520883012411996E-5,9.042156938121602E-5,9.042398836995322E-5,9.065307703313942E-5,9.257988696336377E-5,9.085178354135676E-5,0.13568059232390456,9.110733620177061E-5,9.051998919312272E-5,9.093779861464023E-5,9.042928590187322E-5,9.048272295653479E-5,9.021016341277007E-5,9.023356809107752E-5,9.043667288649407E-5,9.13905881556708E-5,9.09261941720357E-5,9.056669741769937E-5,9.166717775630618E-5,9.06014574110677E-5,9.361169393155143E-5,9.223510668604447E-5,9.025599606563187E-5,9.045546733646988E-5,9.042409397247244E-5,0.13469801244287957,9.045681314137818E-5,9.022555741216703E-5,9.121591202748603E-5,9.048011241513693E-5,9.730141688091474E-5,9.040554504575031E-5,9.025495230681559E-5,9.068589321425265E-5,9.15854210589214E-5,9.067989382658662E-5,9.02382

Sound familiar? Then it changes. In \"Darkness Falls\", the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would've been fine without them. It seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill. Although, it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble-head for a change. Okay to rent, but I wouldn't suggest buying it.","finished_norm":["where","to","begin","thi","movi","start","out","a","someth","that","seem","like","a","ripoff","of","dark","fall","a","old","disfigur","woman","live","in","the","wood","give","kid","present","for","their","tooth","sound","familiar","then","it","chang","in","dark","fall","the","tooth","fairi","onli","kill","you","if","you","see","her","the","tooth","fairi","in","thi","movi","kill","you","no","matt","what","why","do","thei","ne","the","rocker","hi","hippi","girlfriend","or","the","bubba","and","their","sister","i","think","the","movi","would","have","be","fine","without","them","it","seem","like","the","produc","sit","around","and","decid","that","thei","ne","to","put","extra","peopl","in","the","movi","just","so","the","tooth","fairi","would","have","peopl","to","kill","although","it","nice","to","see","a","pretti","blond","girl","not","be","portrai","a","a","bubblehead","for","a","chang","okai","to","rend","but","i","would","not","suggest","bui","it"],"filtered":["begin","thi","movi","start","someth","seem","like","ripoff","dark","fall","old","disfigur","woman","live","wood","give","kid","present","tooth","sound","familiar","chang","dark","fall","tooth","fairi","onli","kill","see","tooth","fairi","thi","movi","kill","matt","thei","ne","rocker","hi","hippi","girlfriend","bubba","sister","think","movi","fine","without","seem","like","produc","sit","around","decid","thei","ne","put","extra","peopl","movi","tooth","fairi","peopl","kill","although","nice","see","pretti","blond","girl","portrai","bubblehead","chang","okai","rend","suggest","bui"],"filtered2":["begin","start","someth","seem","like","ripoff","dark","fall","old","disfigur","woman","live","wood","give","kid","present","tooth","sound","familiar","chang","dark","fall","tooth","fairi","onli","kill","see","tooth","fairi","kill","matt","ne","rocker","hippi","girlfriend","bubba","sister","think","fine","without","seem","like","produc","sit","around","decid","ne","put","extra","peopl","tooth","fairi","peopl","kill","although","nice","see","pretti","blond","girl","portrai","bubblehead","chang","okai","rend","suggest","bui"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,11,12,23,30,35,53,67,70,71,76,78,84,98,110,114,116,125,147,159,170,178,191,237,244,249,261,262,278,347,368,408,411,464,469,531,585,646,655,730,985,1001,1095,1212,1413,2288,2461,6332,7353],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,11,12,23,30,35,53,67,70,71,76,78,84,98,110,114,116,125,147,159,170,178,191,237,244,249,261,262,278,347,368,408,411,464,469,531,585,646,655,730,985,1001,1095,1212,1413,2288,2461,6332,7353],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.729695454751562,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,1.7003182735607676,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,6.401299659997208,2.0064197866819473,2.2212694515902225,2.0881990796736947,4.2580959472608155,2.4433074195966826,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,4.814274222781855,2.532833256045391,2.5460113484259455,2.640097787510554,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,2.726701583487816,5.667386841755453,3.0151989841543516,6.269229346469241,3.130944944345658,3.229006157521873,3.2872346624216657,3.328770687675578,3.424750734647968,3.7165362186843414,3.5900195030592035,3.7297814454343623,3.767137231978131,4.170873731185678,4.035401218572811,4.1554492608600455,18.20304799001677,4.484804029712395,16.687088727548016,5.390512652256013,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.543448179141598E-5,6.49932417833634E-5,6.549850226397889E-5,6.512005122011871E-5,6.512111813884096E-5,6.503009182936881E-5,6.522350043402843E-5,6.500260038550163E-5,6.51487499274266E-5,7.227898171434759E-5,0.6582720281916462,6.489767185698908E-5,6.61089547196342E-5,6.705201348522895E-5,6.494499456230119E-5,6.47655146184577E-5,6.638100936560371E-5,6.522961138369147E-5,6.502723676847909E-5,6.508113278611432E-5,6.571083091667182E-5,6.529423742238163E-5,6.536858481724254E-5,6.54390121357006E-5,6.594122293475277E-5,0.05423726359213714,6.835391563656265E-5,6.491696533978776E-5,6.491870202063819E-5,6.508317318509119E-5,6.646650079500456E-5,6.522583188472458E-5,7.00144051357773E-5,6.540930252466267E-5,6.498762453716753E-5,6.528758526468973E-5,6.492250531335243E-5,6.496086973733959E-5,6.476518923127574E-5,6.478199230935624E-5,6.492780870089456E-5,6.561265950463547E-5,6.527925400917735E-5,6.502115808692425E-5,6.58112333365283E-5,6.504611356270447E-5,6.720727290999402E-5,6.621897037205628E-5,6.47980941759435E-5,6.494130192674775E-5,6.491877783656492E-5,6.674583627731126E-5,6.494226812951534E-5,6.477624114877875E-5,6.548725309732957E-5,6.495899553379941E-5,6.985626051833115E-5,6.490546088087226E

{"value":"For the big thinkers among us, \"The Intruder\" is a maddeningly incoherent movie from France that gives so-called \"art films\" a bad name. The story is something about a bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant, but beyond that, I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing. With no coherent storyline to boast of, the movie loses us early on, though I'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film. <br /><br />This muddled, snail-paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits.","finished_norm":["for","the","big","thinker","among","u","the","intrud","be","a","maddeningli","incoher","movi","from","franc","that","give","socal","art","film","a","bad","name","the","stori","be","someth","about","a","bitter","old","coot","loui","trebor","michel","subor","who","go","search","in","tahiti","for","a","heart","transplant","but","beyond","that","i","have","no","idea","who","ani","of","the","peopl","in","the","movi","be","or","why","thei","be","do","what","thei","be","do","with","no","coher","storylin","to","boast","of","the","movi","lose","u","earli","on","though","i","be","perfectli","will","to","admit","that","there","mai","be","somebodi","out","there","who","actual","get","some","deep","messag","out","of","thi","film","br","br","thi","muddl","snailpac","drama","run","a","full","two","hour","and","five","minut","though","i","serious","doubt","anyon","with","ani","kind","of","a","life","will","still","be","hang","around","by","the","close","credit"],"filtered":["big","thinker","among","u","intrud","maddeningli","incoher","movi","franc","give","socal","art","film","bad","name","stori","someth","bitter","old","coot","loui","trebor","michel","subor","go","search","tahiti","heart","transplant","beyond","idea","ani","peopl","movi","thei","thei","coher","storylin","boast","movi","lose","u","earli","though","perfectli","admit","mai","somebodi","actual","get","deep","messag","thi","film","br","br","thi","muddl","snailpac","drama","run","full","two","hour","five","minut","though","serious","doubt","anyon","ani","kind","life","still","hang","around","close","credit"],"filtered2":["big","thinker","among","u","intrud","maddeningli","incoher","franc","give","socal","art","bad","name","stori","someth","bitter","old","coot","loui","trebor","michel","subor","go","search","tahiti","heart","transplant","beyond","idea","ani","peopl","coher","storylin","boast","lose","u","earli","though","perfectli","admit","mai","somebodi","actual","get","deep","messag","muddl","snailpac","drama","run","full","two","hour","five","minut","though","serious","doubt","anyon","ani","kind","life","still","hang","around","close","credit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,9,17,23,27,30,46,47,52,53,59,64,67,75,82,86,98,112,122,123,137,143,158,174,221,266,295,336,356,371,382,463,502,505,515,567,569,614,691,826,834,848,1082,1089,1475,1537,1785,1850,2056,2302,2530,2788,2886,3302,3614,5610],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,9,17,23,27,30,46,47,52,53,59,64,67,75,82,86,98,112,122,123,137,143,158,174,221,266,295,336,356,371,382,463,502,505,515,567,569,614,691,826,834,848,1082,1089,1475,1537,1785,1850,2056,2302,2530,2788,2886,3302,3614,5610],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,2.600540117735859,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,2.020196584395323,4.062224798544638,2.0881990796736947,4.493325799357863,2.2489347673732487,2.2619070973220485,2.2939035841256437,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.456282578459816,2.6423424573643777,2.747702973022204,2.7910771187233068,2.9233055795674137,3.028335462059722,3.0466846007279185,3.235085203598255,3.3467891931782563,3.3132665011396125,3.3956930001684253,3.3956930001684253,3.454678155189441,3.6436037491933098,3.553030933689863,3.5929222627171646,3.8204358137024927,3.8240921249056035,3.827761853794566,4.165705761027235,4.2078172463773615,4.4919214974812585,4.550761997504193,4.770124825978496,4.789173020949191,5.039114765418124,5.259176650194926,5.156897801074508,5.604922523601468,5.390512652256013,5.541743621979936,5.907203395474402,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.770120474607415E-5,6.724467969522173E-5,6.776744295874524E-5,6.737588195137886E-5,6.737698582934786E-5,6.728280626765287E-5,6.748291476068646E-5,6.725436248970795E-5,6.740557481370782E-5,0.18966708836267676,0.5935441528887027,6.71457991207005E-5,6.839904216388306E-5,6.937476953008473E-5,6.719476113696107E-5,6.700906380898809E-5,6.868052108424211E-5,6.748923740041713E-5,6.727985230429035E-5,6.733561533969656E-5,6.798712691124056E-5,6.755610215669713E-5,6.763302502769747E-5,6.770589202650468E-5,6.822549996411625E-5,6.78686998062521E-5,7.072177101452777E-5,6.716576095112168E-5,6.716755779252112E-5,6.733772642035487E-5,6.876897403148714E-5,6.748532697541812E-5,7.243978170991902E-5,6.767515324162033E-5,6.72388678613934E-5,6.754921956089177E-5,6.717149283550924E-5,6.721118624565345E-5,6.70087271500336E-5,6.702611230535765E-5,6.717697993827233E-5,6.788555473271135E-5,6.75405997014569E-5,6.72735630504709E-5,6.80910073821729E-5,6.729938301158434E-5,0

{"value":"Err...this movie sucked. A LOT.<br /><br />I have been reading some of the other reviews. Apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good...<br /><br />I have watched several of his films, in the vain hope that I'm missing something. But no, they just suck. Poorly written trash. The characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention rather stupid). The plot is...I think it is supposed to be mysterious. Not sure on that. Mr. Allen's character is...Woody Allen, on any other film you have seen of his.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Woody Allen, go see this film. If you are under 50, don't bother.

{"value":"Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow. In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. It seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The Toy is about the lamest he ever chose,aside from I guess Another You.<br /><br />A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing. It's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor get even with this brat,instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff. This is a waste of any movie watcher's time!","finished_norm":["richard","pryor","earli","run","down","the","street","on","fire","incid","must","have","affect","him","somehow","in","hi","stand","uph","joke","about","it","get","great","laugh","it","seem","to","have","do","someth","involv","the","project","he","choos","the","toi","be","about","the","lame","he","ever","choseasid","from","i","guess","anoth","youbr","br","a","movi","where","a","white","man","bui","hi","son","a","black","man","nice","littl","bite","of","underli","polit","incorrect","befor","you","be","such","a","thing","it","see","richard","get","all","sentiment","that","make","me","final","walk","out","befor","the","end","i","want","to","see","pryor","get","even","with","thi","bratinstead","it","becom","the","misunderstand","kid","nauseum","at","littl","gleason","have","hi","moment","ignor","thi","and","watch","pryor","with","gene","wild","or","ani","of","hi","stuff","thi","be","a","wast","of","ani","movi","watcher","time"],"filtered":["richard","pryor","earli","run","street","fire","incid","must","affect","somehow","hi","stand","uph","joke","get","great","laugh","seem","someth","involv","project","choos","toi","lame","ever","choseasid","guess","anoth","youbr","br","movi","white","man","bui","hi","son","black","man","nice","littl","bite","underli","polit","incorrect","befor","thing","see","richard","get","sentiment","make","final","walk","befor","end","want","see","pryor","get","even","thi","bratinstead","becom","misunderstand","kid","nauseum","littl","gleason","hi","moment","ignor","thi","watch","pryor","gene","wild","ani","hi","stuff","thi","wast","ani","movi","watcher","time"],"filtered2":["richard","pryor","earli","run","street","fire","incid","must","affect","somehow","stand","uph","joke","get","great","laugh","seem","someth","involv","project","choos","toi","lame","ever","choseasid","guess","anoth","youbr","white","man","bui","son","black","man","nice","littl","bite","underli","polit","incorrect","befor","thing","see","richard","get","sentiment","make","final","walk","befor","end","want","see","pryor","get","even","bratinstead","becom","misunderstand","kid","nauseum","littl","gleason","moment","ignor","watch","pryor","gene","wild","ani","stuff","wast","ani","watcher","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,8,14,24,27,29,35,37,44,45,51,53,73,79,89,114,115,133,137,141,154,156,188,214,229,241,243,262,266,294,347,359,361,372,377,434,549,551,575,584,641,660,664,763,1106,1412,1849,2193,2445,2585,2633,3453,3643,3959,4806,6611,6956],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,8,14,24,27,29,35,37,44,45,51,53,73,79,89,114,115,133,137,141,154,156,188,214,229,241,243,262,266,294,347,359,361,372,377,434,549,551,575,584,641,660,664,763,1106,1412,1849,2193,2445,2585,2633,3453,3643,3959,4806,6611,6956],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,2.389902141215977,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.2350163994518417,1.3210361566119257,2.600540117735859,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,3.632592212924433,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.8950689206770979,3.893901213901217,1.9940046109572438,2.4433074195966826,2.201553588425805,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.348499626138016,2.3451551414151686,2.5378812223426954,2.7303758068497004,2.8432628718938773,2.6627744961815836,2.627841366673578,2.726701583487816,2.747702973022204,2.886778509330039,3.0151989841543516,3.2189558216683714,3.0399731661399314,3.070535816550098,3.0602441305135506,3.4101163271295305,3.4471119148061256,3.528202072035993,3.6314455447135003,3.5146700658174166,7.4069282742339775,3.6405503117064195,3.6905607322810807,3.7465885637507435,4.268777946167049,4.605250182788262,4.798834931860927,5.129498826886393,5.259176650194926,5.1994574154933035,5.3064295350454715,5.649374286172302,5.878215858601149,5.822646007446338,6.101359409915359,6.868614562629026,20.845971810907688]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.881572236880171E-5,5.841911420287545E-5,5.887326711030639E-5,5.853309674574512E-5,5.8534055744634385E-5,5.8452236832042755E-5,5.862608197429755E-5,5.842752617359874E-5,5.855889255179651E-5,0.38048612197447235,0.46270699728142284,5.8333211264507934E-5,5.942197172549119E-5,6.02696392093034E-5,5.83757472336358E-5,5.82144218550454E-5,5.966650778795274E-5,5.8631574795650314E-5,5.844967056324932E-5,5.849811494797178E-5,5.906411851992765E-5,5.86896638496985E-5,5.875649093559065E-5,5.8819794464497804E-5,5.927120616852602E-5,5.896123444638617E-5,6.143985273263009E-5,5.8350553193361774E-5,0.15227548107618338,5.8499948958671636E-5,5.974335167880193E-5,5.862817759656135E-5,6.293238215608357E-5,5.879309000858017E-5,5.841406514641946E-5,5.8683684564018394E-5,

You need animators and 3D animators, not data-entries whom know 3D programs. Note the junctions, like the elbows, how they lost volume and get deformed. The person who made the charachter design (a very good one) sufered for sure when he/she watched them move, ´cos you can´t say they come to life.","finished_norm":["thi","thing","be","realli","awful","there","no","characht","with","weight","theyr","all","float","around","in","the","bg","the","motion","captur","be","a","fine","toi","but","thi","movi","demostr","that","you","realli","ne","peopl","who","know","anim","to","do","a","anim","film","the","machin","cant","do","anyth","good","by","itself","if","you","see","it","a","a","bizarr","film","youll","have","fun","find","mistak","of","continu","in","a","have","movi","it","funni","to","watch","the","princess","dress","move","around","like","a","thing","with","difer","phisic","you","ne","anim","and","have","anim","not","dataentri","whom","know","have","program","note","the","junction","like","the","elbow","how","thei","lose","volum","and","get","deform","the","person","who","make","the","characht","design","a","veri","good","on","sufer","for","sure","when","hesh","watch","them","move","co","you","cant","sai","thei","come","to","life"],"filtered":["thi","thing","realli","awful","characht","weight","theyr","float","around","bg","motion","captur","fine","toi","thi","movi","demostr","realli","ne","peopl","know","anim","anim","film","machin","cant","anyth","good","see","bizarr","film","youll","fun","find","mistak","continu","movi","funni","watch","princess","dress","move","around","like","thing","difer","phisic","ne","anim","anim","dataentri","know","program","note","junction","like","elbow","thei","lose","volum","get","deform","person","make","characht","design","veri","good","sufer","sure","hesh","watch","move","co","cant","sai","thei","come","life"],"filtered2":["thing","realli","awful","characht","weight","theyr","float","around","bg","motion","captur","fine","toi","demostr","realli","ne","peopl","know","anim","anim","machin","cant","anyth","good","see","bizarr","youll","fun","find","mistak","continu","funni","watch","princess","dress","move","around","like","thing","difer","phisic","ne","anim","anim","dataentri","know","program","note","junction","like","elbow","lose","volum","get","deform","person","make","characht","design","veri","good","sufer","sure","hesh","watch","move","co","cant","come","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,13,15,23,26,29,34,38,62,75,98,104,110,119,153,221,259,275,277,433,464,560,593,681,825,873,924,1021,1071,1412,1422,1454,2514,2603,2645,2969,3501,5798,6108],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,13,15,23,26,29,34,38,62,75,98,104,110,119,153,221,259,275,277,433,464,560,593,681,825,873,924,1021,1071,1412,1422,1454,2514,2603,2645,2969,3501,5798,6108],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,2.6649848339420377,2.6390769554676132,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,2.0226120445069267,1.9742250248702675,4.176398159347389,2.0728240170322856,4.2580959472608155,2.1653408989309972,2.3409902041158843,2.6423424573643777,2.7464553122240485,5.566569743006283,12.465596933373117,3.164467636384302,3.2872346624216657,3.4623020803001006,3.5227672760500357,3.706716172503366,3.850067611308864,3.892300374932137,3.969732115064953,4.076977645418551,4.30366520516749,4.605250182788262,4.671389985292807,9.275546748987644,5.1994574154933035,5.214056214914456,5.274680836730892,5.521540914662417,5.719991853386255,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.773377709034018E-5,7.720960005874644E-5,0.03324533821841789,7.736024504316171E-5,7.736151250367883E-5,7.725337656898281E-5,7.748313893509873E-5,7.722071773665227E-5,7.739433806041466E-5,8.58647932875803E-5,0.409985004849934,7.709606647293762E-5,7.853502632194123E-5,7.96553457293985E-5,7.715228412035125E-5,7.693906849511883E-5,7.88582173158517E-5,7.749039852034969E-5,7.724998486080838E-5,7.731401136344457E-5,7.806206976896526E-5,7.756717189653056E-5,7.765549388917333E-5,7.773915897406758E-5,7.833576708094195E-5,7.792609307231481E-5,0.05316190506720822,7.711898642660899E-5,7.712104954009912E-5,7.731643528298822E-5,0.4198111371028139,7.748590861346632E-5,8.317455893188191E-5,7.770386504006462E-5,7.720292697520246E-5,7.755926937588646E-5,7.712556771308626E-5,7.717114324911518E-5,7.693868194701793E-5,7.695864339074272E-5,7.713186794400029E-5,7.79454457131012E-5,7.754937214829098E-5,7.724276360889271E-5,7.818134418072471E-5,7.727240980365693E-5,7.983978826161469E-5,7.866572090326436E-5,7.697777182079619E-5,7.714789740403398E-5,7.712113960665406E-5,0.07796196945726597,7.714904521767143E-5,7.695181122179903E-5,7.779646747648446E-5,7.716891676368691E-5,8.298668889602248E-5,7.710531954914012E-5,7.697688161702583E-5,7.73444236340328E-5,7.811161531316525E-5,7.733930686046705E-5,7.696264072183529E-5,7.714183644336524E-5,7.693961253399547E-5,7.871983569596451E-5

{"value":"This movie is more deceiving than ever, using a suspenseful looking actor like Walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one! And the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets, or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there.

{"value":"Sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me. It was just so frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all that, fell by the wayside. The children! The father! The premonition! Had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I have heard it all before. Scary! No! I can scare myself alone, here where I sit, than they could in the movie. Are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying? Huh? This movie was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been, had the director/writer bothered to work it. We could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too, if someone had made the effort. What I really want to know is why do they get the money?

{"value":"Quite unimpressive. The 'twists' are all pretty predictable, if you've seen any movies within the last ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much punch, since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained.<br /><br />(spoilers, sorta)<br /><br />The acting is decent enough. The story simply isn't very interesting. The whole 'still awake' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff(not kidding). <br /><br />The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit discomforting, but then becomes utterly banal.<br /><br />Not horrible, but not memorable. Terrence Howard's least interesting role to date, so far as I've seen. <br /><br />Kind of boring,

{"value":"It really impresses me that it got made. The director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can think of no other way itd pass script stage. What I want you to consider is this...while watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors. It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying. Id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor. I want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to me'. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you'd have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard.

{"value":"I, also having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past, consider this to be one of the worst I have ever seen.<br /><br />1) I resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that Russia is not \"the bad guys\". Also, that mocking Russian names like \"Poopchev\" is inappropriate.<br /><br />2) The grandfather fly's birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also needlessly use the word \"crap\" twice.<br /><br />3) The whole movie largely smacks of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda that I thought we, as a nation, were proud to have risen above.<br /><br />In all it's just crude, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to

Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck, I fear that viewers may actually begin following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws.<br /><br

{"value":"This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd, but we all know you can't. The writing is so obvious and facile, it's sad watching them try to sell it. The humor and pacing are so labored, it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this.<br /><br />That said, it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen. We just have to know where this trainwreck goes. But that's only because we caught it on TV. If we had actually PAID for this, we'd be disgusted. <br /><br />So it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly/fascinatingly bad. And the incidental music (as opposed to the trying-too-hard indie soundtrack) is laughably reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo... but not as good.","finished_norm":["thi","be","so","incredibli","bad","poor","actor","you","can","tell","thei","re","try","realli","hard","to","polish","a","turd","but","we","all","know","you","ca","not","the","write","be","so","obviou","and","facil","it","sad","watch","them","try","to","sell","it","the","humor","and","pace","be","so","labor","it","hard","to","believ","ani","of","thi","good","actor","sign","on","for","thisbr","br","that","sai","it","so","aw","that","we","re","have","a","hard","time","look","awai","from","the","screen","we","just","have","to","know","where","thi","trainwreck","go","but","that","onli","becaus","we","catch","it","on","tv","if","we","have","actual","pai","for","thi","we","have","be","disgust","br","br","so","it","get","star","for","be","at","littl","amusinglyfascinatingli","bad","and","the","incident","music","a","oppos","to","the","tryingtoohard","indi","soundtrack","be","laughabl","reminisc","of","a","episod","of","scoobydoo","but","not","a","good"],"filtered":["thi","incredibli","bad","poor","actor","tell","thei","re","try","realli","hard","polish","turd","know","ca","write","obviou","facil","sad","watch","try","sell","humor","pace","labor","hard","believ","ani","thi","good","actor","sign","thisbr","br","sai","aw","re","hard","time","look","awai","screen","know","thi","trainwreck","go","onli","becaus","catch","tv","actual","pai","thi","disgust","br","br","get","star","littl","amusinglyfascinatingli","bad","incident","music","oppos","tryingtoohard","indi","soundtrack","laughabl","reminisc","episod","scoobydoo","good"],"filtered2":["incredibli","bad","poor","actor","tell","re","try","realli","hard","polish","turd","know","ca","write","obviou","facil","sad","watch","try","sell","humor","pace","labor","hard","believ","ani","good","actor","sign","thisbr","aw","re","hard","time","look","awai","screen","know","trainwreck","go","onli","becaus","catch","tv","actual","pai","disgust","get","star","littl","amusinglyfascinatingli","bad","incident","music","oppos","tryingtoohard","indi","soundtrack","laughabl","reminisc","scoobydoo","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,16,22,26,27,36,41,52,65,68,81,90,91,100,118,138,146,155,171,172,192,322,369,383,455,512,546,552,687,796,861,876,963,1269,2072,2355,2436,3110,3140,3187,3757,4151,4444,7428],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,16,22,26,27,36,41,52,65,68,81,90,91,100,118,138,146,155,171,172,192,322,369,383,455,512,546,552,687,796,861,876,963,1269,2072,2355,2436,3110,3140,3187,3757,4151,4444,7428],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,2.9360366939211433,3.1375198335242067,1.7122153074726136,1.9073850067444174,4.012839573363895,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.1405462403177813,2.354379525480895,2.2907365189289424,2.326138445979858,2.3074766467914385,7.119262662272286,2.5001408943598484,2.5318267134339894,2.885344817328191,3.121829110937649,3.0433232530252132,3.2787058260741455,3.369778711402955,3.4572130107926293,3.424750734647968,3.604618302480356,3.850067611308864,3.892300374932137,3.8844878351953436,4.035401218572811,4.3215761317340196,5.064116067623542,5.129498826886393,5.102830579804232,5.463272006538442,5.482320201509136,5.501738287366237,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.948657270302562,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.51376377506109E-5,7.463096709351278E-5,7.521115169836995E-5,7.477658086260554E-5,7.477780599269395E-5,7.467328156337707E-5,7.489537036544154E-5,7.46417134651209E-5,7.480953524712233E-5,8.299709566505847E-5,0.9940535518935885,7.452122528290815E-5,7.591212699795607E-5,7.699503017021121E-5,7.45755653829865E-5,7.436947069659469E-5,7.622452411454649E-5,7.490238749631083E-5,7.467000313088986E-5,7.473189128738488E-5,7.545496616672583E-5,7.497659680845664E-5,7.506196903835475E-5,7.514283989110967E-5,7.571952258287321E-5,7.532353079644179E-5,7.848998893744769E-5,7.454337975990235E-5,7.454537396988239E-5,7.473423425327983E-5,7.632269290685969E-5,7.48980475425666E-5,8.039670929443615E-5,7.51087246978543E-5,7.462451687646719E-5,7.496895821484008E-5,7.454974124570392E-5,7.459379465780623E-5,7.436909705836089E-5,7.438839183321572E-5,7.455583106258766E-5,7.534223710105422E-5,7.49593915331524E-5,7.466302305310573E-5,7.557025707216174E-5,7.469167912934771E-5,7.717331272240677E-5,7.603845666409352E-5,7.440688141524677E-5,7.457132517346755E-5,7.454546102840999E-5,7.664345052128321E-5,7.457243465262222E-5,7.438178784387727E-5,7.519823441400318E-5,7.4591642532156E-5,8.021511371522443E-5,7.453016932646

{"value":"About 15 minutes in, my wife was already wanting to leave. Not so much because of the material, but the lack thereof. They decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. When this would let up (very rare), we'd sit back and watch (not laughing, mind you) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark(s). After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything we'd read said how great this was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it \"intelligent\" and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever walked out on...and I have no regrets.

{"value":"For a made-for-TV \"horror\" movie the movie started off very interesting. I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film. But the ending was a total dissappointment. The movie was going along fast-paced and was building up to, it seemed like anyway, to a very climatic end. But guess what there is no end. The movie is just over and after almost one-and-a-half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened. Why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered. There was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot. This film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it. Very dissappointed. This film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film.

{"value":"I saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this one was so revolting that it wasn't even entertaining. Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie, the hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate), and the disgusting acting. The acting, in fact, is what I feel steals the show. I didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie, and I hope that I never have to see any of them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it; I can't imagine a video store carrying this garbage) just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash.","finished_norm":["i","see","the","movi","late","on","night","on","cabl","and","can","not","believ","how","bad","it","be","i","usual","enjoi","bad","movi","but","thi","on","be","so","revolt","that","it","be","not","even","entertain","some","of","the","highlight","of","thi","film","includ","the","absurd","music","which","be","constantli","plai","throughout","the","movi","the","hideou","special","effect","when","someon","be","shoot","with","a","laser","gun","thei","turn","neon","green","and","promptli","disintegr","and","the","disgust","act","the","act","in","fact","be","what","i","feel","steal","the","show","i","do","not","recogn","ani","of","the","actor","in","the","movi","and","i","hope","that","i","never","have","to","see","ani","of","them","again","overal","i","recommend","rent","thi","movi","if","you","can","find","it","i","ca","not","imagin","a","video","store","carri","thi","garbag","just","so","that","you","can","learn","to","appreci","qualiti","film","after","see","thi","trash"],"filtered":["see","movi","late","night","cabl","believ","bad","usual","enjoi","bad","movi","thi","revolt","even","entertain","highlight","thi","film","includ","absurd","music","constantli","plai","throughout","movi","hideou","special","effect","someon","shoot","laser","gun","thei","turn","neon","green","promptli","disintegr","disgust","act","act","fact","feel","steal","show","recogn","ani","actor","movi","hope","never","see","ani","overal","recommend","rent","thi","movi","find","ca","imagin","video","store","carri","thi","garbag","learn","appreci","qualiti","film","see","thi","trash"],"filtered2":["see","late","night","cabl","believ","bad","usual","enjoi","bad","revolt","even","entertain","highlight","includ","absurd","music","constantli","plai","throughout","hideou","special","effect","someon","shoot","laser","gun","turn","neon","green","promptli","disintegr","disgust","act","act","fact","feel","steal","show","recogn","ani","actor","hope","never","see","ani","overal","recommend","rent","find","ca","imagin","video","store","carri","garbag","learn","appreci","qualiti","see","trash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,9,21,27,28,38,40,41,42,43,81,91,96,97,106,117,118,139,150,181,195,200,203,210,240,265,298,301,319,340,412,430,438,501,578,621,661,671,702,793,928,961,963,1157,1172,1385,1535,1568,2298,2483,3401,5307,7935],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,9,21,27,28,38,40,41,42,43,81,91,96,97,106,117,118,139,150,181,195,200,203,210,240,265,298,301,319,340,412,430,438,501,578,621,661,671,702,793,928,961,963,1157,1172,1385,1535,1568,2298,2483,3401,5307,7935],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,2.324031090670098,2.600540117735859,1.5452294193519092,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0390708128715254,2.0545557924622586,2.159084361316692,2.2797301185117202,2.354379525480895,2.2939035841256437,2.332712011146513,2.4442286541160034,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,2.687151791517189,2.7666071276613566,2.73529586597515,2.7819920465008363,2.8309760279012264,2.9056060024680126,2.948928684455311,3.107414446935464,3.2189558216683714,3.1797351085150902,3.5119855004467477,3.575630765607104,3.5446859617576822,3.5727776966246974,3.6466665387238555,3.6466665387238555,3.770603439954617,4.017463517886143,3.9954846111673676,4.035401218572811,4.224077767249142,4.327618446189983,4.403125998698128,4.558366596889411,4.597282013139085,5.064116067623542,5.322690055917252,5.5623629091826725,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.3633154090675E-5,7.31366285186154E-5,7.370519606597801E-5,7.327932665790105E-5,7.328052725716501E-5,7.317809572430695E-5,7.339573763419111E-5,7.314715971523303E-5,7.331162119557525E-5,8.133524179277324E-5,0.766900501543304,7.30290840722853E-5,7.43921357115854E-5,7.545335587414363E-5,7.308233611855873E-5,7.288036807358603E-5,7.469827768932143E-5,7.340261426079318E-5,7.317488293599296E-5,7.323553190367425E-5,7.394412862834537E-5,7.347533767717647E-5,0.07399736804782514,7.363825206852491E-5,7.420338782172744E-5,7.38153249932722E-5,7.691838102748276E-5,7.305079494937897E-5,7.305274922921988E-5,7.323782795627767E-5,7.479448084432726E-5,7.339836120610099E-5,0.15342709417323522,7.36048199650278E-5,7.313030745450085E-5,7.346785203139839E-5,7.305702905891841E-5,7.310020038794417E-5,7.28800019167242E-5,7.289891035159869E-5,7.306299693917669E-5,7.383365674086541E-5,7.34584769037269E-5,7.316804262056077E-5,7.405711105977864E-5,7.319612491514345E-5,7.5628068668297E-5,7.451593587421225E-5,7.291702971605468E-5,7.307818081090956E-5,7.30528345445714E-5,7.510881591734347E-5,7.307926807492268E-5,7.289243859

{"value":"As with many other pop-culture franchise series, this line just didn't know when to quit. Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended, they went on to generate this; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark.<br /><br />This movie should never have happened. It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line, and it sure shows. The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same.<br /><br />After the wonderful experience which was The Omen, this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting. It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects, and left a terrible, lingering stench long after it was over. <br /><br />It rates a 1.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend

{"value":"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I hadn't. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. It disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors. Unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes (which would be impossible) I would in no way recommend this. Its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don't think, as many people say that it is, that \"The Bell Jar\" is necessarily unfilmable, but this particular rendition could have been done without. I'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it
