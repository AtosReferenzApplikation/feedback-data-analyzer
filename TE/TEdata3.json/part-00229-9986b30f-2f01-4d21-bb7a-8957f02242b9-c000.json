{"value":"A major disappointment. This was one of the best UK crime drama / detective shows from the 90's which developed the fascinating title character played by Scotland's Robbie Coltrane. However this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. Coltrane isn't really given much to do, much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer, and in what he has to act in, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The ex-soldier's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on Coltrane's family life seems lightweight. Perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth. As is, skip this and watch the old Cracker from the 90's which is far far superior.","finished_norm":["a","major","disappoint","thi","be","on","of","the","well","uk","crime","drama","detect","show","from","the","which","develop","the","fascin","titl","charact","plai","by","scotland","robbi","coltran","howev","thi","oneoff","have","littl","to","add","and","perhap","suffer","from","a","inevit","let","down","due","to","rais","expect","when","a","favor","show","return","after","a","long","hiatu","coltran","be","not","realli","give","much","to","do","much","much","attent","be","spend","on","the","uninterest","killer","and","in","what","he","have","to","act","in","he","seem","uninvolv","almost","bore","the","exsoldi","stori","be","write","by","the","book","and","the","attempt","to","updat","u","on","coltran","famili","life","seem","lightweight","perhap","if","the","writer","have","a","whole","seri","in","front","of","them","instead","of","just","thi","on","twohour","show","thei","would","have","write","thi","with","much","much","depth","a","be","skip","thi","and","watch","the","old","cracker","from","the","which","be","far","far","superior"],"filtered":["major","disappoint","thi","well","uk","crime","drama","detect","show","develop","fascin","titl","charact","plai","scotland","robbi","coltran","howev","thi","oneoff","littl","add","perhap","suffer","inevit","let","due","rais","expect","favor","show","return","long","hiatu","coltran","realli","give","much","much","much","attent","spend","uninterest","killer","act","seem","uninvolv","almost","bore","exsoldi","stori","write","book","attempt","updat","u","coltran","famili","life","seem","lightweight","perhap","writer","whole","seri","front","instead","thi","twohour","show","thei","write","thi","much","much","depth","skip","thi","watch","old","cracker","far","far","superior"],"filtered2":["major","disappoint","well","uk","crime","drama","detect","show","develop","fascin","titl","charact","plai","scotland","robbi","coltran","howev","oneoff","littl","add","perhap","suffer","inevit","let","due","rais","expect","favor","show","return","long","hiatu","coltran","realli","give","attent","spend","uninterest","killer","act","seem","uninvolv","almost","bore","exsoldi","stori","write","book","attempt","updat","u","coltran","famili","life","seem","lightweight","perhap","writer","whole","front","instead","twohour","show","write","depth","skip","watch","old","cracker","far","far","superior"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,10,13,14,17,20,21,28,30,35,40,65,67,75,99,101,108,111,112,113,124,130,131,151,152,177,182,187,252,264,283,287,299,318,320,404,463,488,568,633,636,753,773,914,931,1045,1063,1115,1248,1258,1642,1838,2248,2559,4542,4673,4956,5845,6523],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,10,13,14,17,20,21,28,30,35,40,65,67,75,99,101,108,111,112,113,124,130,131,151,152,177,182,187,252,264,283,287,299,318,320,404,463,488,568,633,636,753,773,914,931,1045,1063,1115,1248,1258,1642,1838,2248,2559,4542,4673,4956,5845,6523],"values":[0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,4.635688258055728,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,1.6284968758320737,3.8147700134888347,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,2.056430207256609,4.197164082437498,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.8002454868101863,2.3131195476980753,2.458149992634611,2.7365296724240786,2.4732161909892554,3.0433232530252132,2.757740698455715,2.7678802023081546,2.841890188081905,2.7949961309240425,5.805372584729356,2.938298364153555,3.1419947805322432,3.3467891931782563,3.3933092088131493,3.4471119148061256,3.550241531602284,3.530930586689197,3.8690435127678695,3.7364704335851586,3.9612932464190886,3.9241755834625858,4.1554492608600455,4.327618446189983,4.1554492608600455,4.327618446189983,4.34596758485818,4.6295428753573065,4.911775343041523,5.014723312293965,5.243909178064138,6.032366538428407,6.600350576034347,6.389041482367141,6.342521466732247,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.385091681780128E-5,6.342035515857304E-5,6.39133879455055E-5,6.354409570906424E-5,6.354513680752977E-5,6.345631340501754E-5,6.364504137213638E-5,6.342948727531487E-5,6.357209988550039E-5,0.03116817852661655,0.6330962705520441,6.332709809819528E-5,0.09553670411966299,0.18437867679370362,6.337327555750655E-5,6.31981391668594E-5,6.477453769399111E-5,6.365100443210002E-5,6.34535274388054E-5,6.350611913120711E-5,6.412057808088929E-5,6.371406647076373E-5,6.378661460127413E-5,6.385533752425687E-5,6.434539443427411E-5,6.400888613599772E-5,6.669969811014411E-5,6.334592466381601E-5,6.334761931564917E-5,6.350811015095357E-5,6.48579601648026E-5,6.36473163999258

{"value":"Normally I'm quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films, but Darkman III is so appallingly unengaging that I feel nothing but contempt for it.<br /><br />It looks and feels like a TV show, and a particularly shoddy one at that. The sets are sparse, the lighting flat, the score and effects disjointed, and the camerawork is film school 101. There's no plot to speak of, the characters are one dimensional, and the actors are sleepwalking. Most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn..... In fact, the only reward that I got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without her Klingon bumpy head makeup on. Her skin tone is about two shades lighter than it is in Voyager; either she's been bleached down for this role, or blacked up for Voyager.

{"value":"Despite pretty bad reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Surely that's worth checking out? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits, it is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else.<br /><br />If Shu Qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be better off

{"value":"I don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said. Honestly I have only myself to be angry with. I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. The list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it. To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me.

{"value":"This is one very dire production. The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the production's weakest point, the actress failed to get that across. It also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a hairdresser - from the outset, the hair on the Princess Margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was farcical.<br /><br />The production was a flaw ridden, cliché ridden, embarrassing load of rubbish.

{"value":"I thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part. Since I am a filmmaker, I give it a 2 for consistency.<br /><br />The problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. The computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with, but did not find that information.<br /><br />It seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged.

{"value":"Film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar. OK. They're talking about their imaginary lives, lying all the time, with no reason. Still OK.From time to time, they even make you laugh. Interesting. First 30 minutes you actually enjoy it! But then...things become worse...Nothing's happening...for a long time...and then, when something happen, all you can see are naked old \"ladies\" touching each other! Not OK. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but it's everything except that! Movie has no point,it's boring, and sick! <br /><br />The strangest thing is that here(Belgrade, Serbia) on FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to researches, of course, before people watched it! I even thought(before watching): \"Hay, this might be interesting, although it's a Russian movie\"!

{"value":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in. I understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable.<br /><br />With all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. Even the coin being a bug on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug, was not realistic.<br /><br />Looks like this movie was slapped together fast. Poor job. Get a better writer.<br /><br />The count down to the end was not in sync with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that each time Billy was going to blast Sean, he'd be out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. <br /><br />Actually, Billy's character was goofy.

{"value":"I actually paid to see this movie in the theater.<br /><br />It would get a 1-rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are okay, and there's a surprise.<br /><br />I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. I don't have a problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons. But, one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap. I mean, couldn't they even make it \"look\" good?<br /><br />The other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor, but at the time, I was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.<br /><br />Thankfully, the experience was over in only 85

{"value":"They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I found it pretty funny (comedy?, don't think so), I laughed the whole movie I think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot. I don't blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good \"bad guy\" I loved his acting in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams.. whoa! she's a beauty, and a good actress as well, but let's try to be a little objective here, the story mm mm... the direction mm mm... it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie, but there's one good thing tho, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME IT WAS

{"value":"What an insult to the SA film industry! I have seen better SA films. The comments I read about Hijack Stories,by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary. A movie's rating should not depend on.., \"OH, A MOVIE FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. LETS BOOST THEIR INDUSTRY BY SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT THEIR WORK, EVEN THOUGH IT IS BAD.\" We have the expertise to make good movies. Don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think Hijack Stories is. We can tell great stories such as Cry the beloved Country and Shaka Zulu. Cry the beloved Country I'll give 9 out of 10. Great directing by Darryl, great acting by two great elderly actors, irrespective from where they are. Hijack Stories.., I'll give 1 out of 10. It could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores.

{"value":"I was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2:00 a.m. so I flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon H.B.O. where this \"classic\" was playing. Initially I was happy to have caught something at the beginning, but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie. The whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females, four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's diner, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner. There are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep medication works much better.

{"value":"I have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time. The movie was boring, long long and awful plot. The special effects sucks like hell - It's like watching a movie back in 1999. It's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was quite bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he wasn't THAT bad. In fact not bad at all. But in this film, his acting wasn't convincing enough, it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either. Plus, his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it. It surprised me, really, because he was good in Band of Brothers.<br /><br />Anyway, don't even bother to watch this movie. It's a big big BIG waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watching this movie.

{"value":"This film seems to be completely pointless. There is no reason why anything that happens in it happens, as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought \"how can I wrap this up?\". And what were Jared Harris and Christopher Walken thinking? Did they do it for a bet? I couldn't tell you the plot, I'm not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank, but if there is it didn't register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up, as you do. They go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it, meet Christopher Walken who has dug up some ancient woman preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing him. From then on it all gets a bit silly.

{"value":"The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and Segals voice not even his!!!! Pathetic! When the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot, lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be.<br /><br />While Segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it.<br /><br />If Segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show, because he has no talent what so ever in this.<br /><br />This film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes.<br /><br />I will be asking for my money back at Block Buster!

{"value":"I wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off. Character's don't seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger is walking a night (through a cemetery I believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. Once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all. When asked what happen he says blandly \"attacked by demons, nothing serious.\", as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire.<br /><br />I shut it off when they go to ask something-a demon or something, I stopped caring-a ques ion. The answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death, and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing, dying

{"value":"The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it.<br /><br />In every other way, this film is a very lame rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a little bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in.<br /><br />As is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie, the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once. The female lead doesn't, since she obviously has a better agent. <br /><br />The whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area. People get eaten.

{"value":"Not that I was really surprised....movies are never as good as the books that they originated from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they strayed from the book's storyline too much, and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was. Ending was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was unremarkable at best. Perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in Lifetime's \"made for TV movie\" box, it would be a better flick. If you saw this movie I highly encourage you to track down the book and read it.

{"value":"The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment for me. I had received an E-Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie. It was neither great nor inspirational. The cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie. A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched. The relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear. Also the whole movie has most him one way, and then all of a sudden BAM, he is cured and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way that he is living it, but when he changes, he doesn't leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumbs

{"value":"It is enjoyable and fast-paced. <br /><br />There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced, and worked very well.<br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and vibrant, and the backdrops are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich.

{"value":"i wont go and give them my 10 bucks i went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can watch it without me worrying about what they are seeing. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather watch the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy in fact she thinks she looks more like a slut than daisy duke. Those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything at all. And since when is American Pie have anything to do with the Dukes SHAME ON them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car. That in itself should have gotten the movie a R rating. The only good thing that might come out of this is a reunion movie with the originals. Lets all hope.

{"value":"I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5. I did used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, I still only watched it when there was nothing on. Now I am other 5 and I would rather do my homework than watch it. The cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing. Now I am older I am interested in show witch are not rated Us. I have started to watch Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in things to do with Doctor Who so I am not interested in 5 year old cartoons. This cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons, it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.","finished_norm":["i","think","thi","cartoon","be","on","of","the","wrong","cartoon","i","have","ever","watch","i","would","recommend","thi","cartoon","to","peopl","who","be","under","i","do","us","to","like","thi","show","when","i","be","and","i","still","onli","watch","it","when","there","be","noth","on","now","i","be","other","and","i","would","rather","do","my","homework","than","watch","it","the","cartoon","us","to","be","a","bite","funni","but","thei","be","not","enough","to","make","me","burst","out","laugh","now","i","be","old","i","be","interest","in","show","witch","be","not","rate","u","i","have","start","to","watch","doctor","who","a","torchwood","and","sarah","jane","adventur","pg","i","be","interest","in","thing","to","do","with","doctor","who","so","i","be","not","interest","in","year","old","cartoon","thi","cartoon","do","not","last","veri","long","it","onli","have","season","it","get","cancel","becaus","of","it","be","low","on","viewer","but","some","peopl","sai","it","be","becaus","the","writer","run","out","of","idea","but","for","much","other","show","thei","have","at","littl","season"],"filtered":["think","thi","cartoon","wrong","cartoon","ever","watch","recommend","thi","cartoon","peopl","us","like","thi","show","still","onli","watch","noth","rather","homework","watch","cartoon","us","bite","funni","thei","enough","make","burst","laugh","old","interest","show","witch","rate","u","start","watch","doctor","torchwood","sarah","jane","adventur","pg","interest","thing","doctor","interest","year","old","cartoon","thi","cartoon","last","veri","long","onli","season","get","cancel","becaus","low","viewer","peopl","sai","becaus","writer","run","idea","much","show","thei","littl","season"],"filtered2":["think","cartoon","wrong","cartoon","ever","watch","recommend","cartoon","peopl","us","like","show","still","onli","watch","noth","rather","homework","watch","cartoon","us","bite","funni","enough","make","burst","laugh","old","interest","show","witch","rate","u","start","watch","doctor","torchwood","sarah","jane","adventur","pg","interest","thing","doctor","interest","year","old","cartoon","cartoon","last","veri","long","onli","season","get","cancel","becaus","low","viewer","peopl","becaus","writer","run","idea","show","littl","season"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,11,12,14,15,22,23,25,28,29,44,49,56,57,60,62,64,67,71,93,99,112,123,133,137,144,154,160,202,217,279,287,298,653,693,817,1067,1076,1135,2020,2242,2592,2828,7269],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,11,12,14,15,22,23,25,28,29,44,49,56,57,60,62,64,67,71,93,99,112,123,133,137,144,154,160,202,217,279,287,298,653,693,817,1067,1076,1135,2020,2242,2592,2828,7269],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,3.8437990882891726,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.5958480334723544,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,4.635688258055728,1.3195384777338066,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,3.7221218701403576,1.834162586674748,5.514529923709773,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,3.9141830778533158,1.9214926742550966,2.035389827120098,2.056430207256609,2.2466628996789315,2.2619070973220485,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.348499626138016,2.3722295531801256,2.597304642813496,2.6113665294700725,2.7910771187233068,2.841890188081905,2.7819920465008363,23.946877257412616,7.692630523380627,8.394243914521228,4.74221603786142,4.202455303235976,4.4919214974812585,5.0768550934009715,5.444579873526289,5.1994574154933035,5.3064295350454715,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.532636319032973E-5,7.481841991347118E-5,7.540006178525807E-5,7.496439942499908E-5,7.496562763228317E-5,7.486084066584808E-5,7.508348729496278E-5,7.482919327706053E-5,7.49974365820237E-5,0.09019217057421403,0.4636993403160765,7.470840246109657E-5,7.610279774535476E-5,7.718842087771878E-5,7.476287904882065E-5,7.45562667082747E-5,7.641597951907522E-5,7.509052205096837E-5,0.028552527307458445,7.491959760164304E-5,0.08138849547834627,7.516491775685088E-5,7.525050441871823E-5,7.533157839719953E-5,7.59097095600335E-5,7.551272314925325E-5,7.86871345773587E-5,7.473061258414962E-5,7.473261180304619E-5,7.492194645243511E-5,7.651439488486413E-5,7.508617119643324E-5,8.059864410058351E-5,7.52973775157985E-5,7.481195349522357E-5,7.515725997715153E-5,7.47369900482843E-5,7.478115411065217E-5,7.455589213156263E-5,7.457523536967739E-5,7.474309516114226E-5,7.55314764390474E-5,7.514766926654488E-5,7.485055638897136E-5,7.576006913469884E-5,7.48792844415324E-5,7.736715122750372E-5,0.25584725779687867,7.459377139254161E-5,7.475862818904132E-5,7.473269908024128E-5,7.683595815572877E-5,7.475974045490779E-5,7.456861479290248E-5,0.04363701999409591,7.47789965

{"value":"I understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters.","finished_norm":["i","understand","thi","movi","be","make","on","a","veri","low","budget","but","that","be","no","excus","for","the","monstros","that","be","grendel","deathstalk","the","throne","of","fire","barbarian","queen","conquest","the","invinc","barbarian","be","all","do","on","shoestr","budget","and","poor","special","effect","yet","thei","still","manag","to","creat","cult","classic","by","add","some","scantili","cloth","woman","warrior","and","a","good","sens","of","humor","the","primit","costum","dark","castl","and","beauti","bulgarian","landscap","give","grendel","the","potenti","to","be","a","veri","good","low","budget","sword","and","sorceri","film","but","the","maker","complet","ruin","thi","opportun","by","us","extrem","poor","cgi","effect","and","colorless","charact","compar","thi","film","to","beowulf","it","mai","not","be","citizen","kane","but","it","be","a","good","exampl","of","how","a","entertain","low","budget","scifi","adventur","movi","can","be","make","by","us","credibl","special","effect","and","appeal","charact"],"filtered":["understand","thi","movi","make","veri","low","budget","excus","monstros","grendel","deathstalk","throne","fire","barbarian","queen","conquest","invinc","barbarian","shoestr","budget","poor","special","effect","yet","thei","still","manag","creat","cult","classic","add","scantili","cloth","woman","warrior","good","sens","humor","primit","costum","dark","castl","beauti","bulgarian","landscap","give","grendel","potenti","veri","good","low","budget","sword","sorceri","film","maker","complet","ruin","thi","opportun","us","extrem","poor","cgi","effect","colorless","charact","compar","thi","film","beowulf","mai","citizen","kane","good","exampl","entertain","low","budget","scifi","adventur","movi","make","us","credibl","special","effect","appeal","charact"],"filtered2":["understand","make","veri","low","budget","excus","monstros","grendel","deathstalk","throne","fire","barbarian","queen","conquest","invinc","barbarian","shoestr","budget","poor","special","effect","yet","still","manag","creat","cult","classic","add","scantili","cloth","woman","warrior","good","sens","humor","primit","costum","dark","castl","beauti","bulgarian","landscap","give","grendel","potenti","veri","good","low","budget","sword","sorceri","maker","complet","ruin","opportun","us","extrem","poor","cgi","effect","colorless","charact","compar","beowulf","mai","citizen","kane","good","exampl","entertain","low","budget","scifi","adventur","make","us","credibl","special","effect","appeal","charact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,10,15,30,46,56,64,70,103,106,146,173,194,195,203,212,217,256,299,307,325,329,332,345,362,368,369,482,547,551,617,689,710,762,776,781,879,933,993,1012,1076,1208,1469,1775,1941,1960,2369,2613,2834,2864,3452,4126,4688,5847,6287,6367,6797,7212,7343],"values":[2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,10,15,30,46,56,64,70,103,106,146,173,194,195,203,212,217,256,299,307,325,329,332,345,362,368,369,482,547,551,617,689,710,762,776,781,879,933,993,1012,1076,1208,1469,1775,1941,1960,2369,2613,2834,2864,3452,4126,4688,5847,6287,6367,6797,7212,7343],"values":[1.2399534312410465,2.0358433949768115,2.247774048205673,2.4001215597131385,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,3.7221218701403576,1.883428577602134,2.094675786251684,2.098582041218749,6.477253083950076,4.652276891959716,2.4368824319140248,2.5378812223426954,2.51289241584188,5.139521057275218,2.5983793339432615,7.834099588410218,10.995808769690544,2.7949961309240425,2.8767855639325206,2.973659465713028,2.951986790814132,2.9705344631698933,3.0022328381570844,3.058539100262467,3.1346146732346205,3.121829110937649,3.3154667220492153,3.432149042129413,3.528202072035993,3.5119855004467477,3.634471265630037,3.6528204042982337,3.749984152751882,3.770603439954617,3.9363956947973615,3.8962296530720266,4.091229668125752,4.026392148630444,4.297765483040301,4.202455303235976,4.297765483040301,4.654440426979034,5.089758498236879,5.0768550934009715,5.2288713006995975,5.089758498236879,5.322690055917252,5.373120909544144,6.389041482367141,13.200701152068694,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,13.737229125258052,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.6546071361142775E-5,4.623220032037141E-5,4.6591611593187195E-5,4.63224047650447E-5,4.632316370549357E-5,4.625841317977017E-5,4.63959921819703E-5,4.62388574551273E-5,4.63428192627492E-5,0.3233917764381083,0.21012956151743353,4.6164217744652726E-5,4.702584997615616E-5,4.769668405933955E-5,4.619788021065163E-5,4.607020920225788E-5,4.7219372941705014E-5,4.640033913622612E-5,4.625638226481104E-5,4.629472058146384E-5,4.674264915548904E-5,4.6

{"value":"I've had a thing for this Kari chick for a while, and as far as how she looked in this movie, no complaints. But after catching it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I am certain: that's the only thing in the movie that isn't substandard. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were...what? Not at all. When a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn, but instead I get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease. They should have just gone cinemax so that the movie wasn't a complete waste of time, but no.

{"value":"The most horrible retelling of a great series. It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica, because it's only the same in name alone. Too many changes to just have changes. You have characters turned from male to female, black to asian to cylon all in a way to \"attract female audiences,\" when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger. Gone are the egyptian feeling. Gone are the quest for earth. The lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film, especially when one is made a fembot. Granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it, but it had a large following. They tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it \"their own story.\" Changes are good, when they make something better,

{"value":"The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too\"real\" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show.

{"value":"The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too\"real\" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show.

{"value":"Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to Succo. I don't find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies, like Bret Favre. That blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The little acting there is comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm. The interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in.

{"value":"I have only recently been able to catch up with the films of Marilyn Miller since they are not shown on TCM in the UK.I have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s.What was she really like.To some stars of this era like Jolson some of the magic still shines through,but alas not for Miller.Her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed,her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler seem like Hepburn.Even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted.So we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal.She was being paid $500000 for this!So i have only two conclusion.Either she was poorly served by the

{"value":"The cast although nothing special, all do an OK job, the story seems like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist; so what's wrong with it?<br /><br />For a start the special effects are really bad (if this was made in the 60's) it might look OK but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims very proudly 'from the special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers'.<br /><br />Secondly the direction is weak, this film just does not capture the essence of the story, A doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the Devil (or demon type creature) should be tense or frightening; it simply isn't.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty poor film, and
