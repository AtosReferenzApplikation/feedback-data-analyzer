{"value":"There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie. One reason are some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) work, who tried to play at their usually good level of acting. However at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting.<br /><br />The other reason is the cool idea and looking of the Cyborg, which is quite different to most other such roles I've seen so far.<br /><br />Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogs, bad script work. And it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors. It could have been an interesting story though, but they failed completely.","finished_norm":["there","be","two","reason","why","i","do","not","give","a","to","thi","movi","on","reason","be","some","of","the","actor","like","malcolm","mcdowel","and","gwynyth","walsh","work","who","try","to","plai","at","their","usual","good","level","of","act","howev","at","mani","scene","thei","be","somehow","block","by","the","bad","scriptingbr","br","the","other","reason","be","the","cool","idea","and","look","of","the","cyborg","which","be","quit","differ","to","much","other","such","role","i","have","see","so","farbr","br","everyth","els","in","thi","movi","be","a","bad","a","it","can","be","bore","scene","useless","and","bore","dialog","bad","script","work","and","it","seem","a","it","be","the","movi","ever","for","mani","actor","it","can","have","be","a","interest","stori","though","but","thei","fail","complet"],"filtered":["two","reason","give","thi","movi","reason","actor","like","malcolm","mcdowel","gwynyth","walsh","work","try","plai","usual","good","level","act","howev","mani","scene","thei","somehow","block","bad","scriptingbr","br","reason","cool","idea","look","cyborg","quit","differ","much","role","see","farbr","br","everyth","els","thi","movi","bad","bore","scene","useless","bore","dialog","bad","script","work","seem","movi","ever","mani","actor","interest","stori","though","thei","fail","complet"],"filtered2":["two","reason","give","reason","actor","like","malcolm","mcdowel","gwynyth","walsh","work","try","plai","usual","good","level","act","howev","mani","scene","somehow","block","bad","scriptingbr","reason","cool","idea","look","cyborg","quit","differ","role","see","farbr","everyth","els","bad","bore","scene","useless","bore","dialog","bad","script","work","seem","ever","mani","actor","interest","stori","though","fail","complet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,9,16,17,19,21,30,35,36,40,41,44,47,48,50,60,77,86,95,103,108,113,120,123,128,193,196,204,215,265,432,445,481,549,1959,2204,2897,4272,5306],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,9,16,17,19,21,30,35,36,40,41,44,47,48,50,60,77,86,95,103,108,113,120,123,128,193,196,204,215,265,432,445,481,549,1959,2204,2897,4272,5306],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,3.205071257016622,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,3.3910232448024944,3.43598877114071,1.838176641236591,1.9463902258768238,2.031112399272319,6.096997967032646,2.098582041218749,4.277015007255866,2.1521782565202803,2.2044500422972613,2.2619070973220485,2.3409902041158843,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.624524614047584,2.605934685587711,2.73529586597515,3.235085203598255,3.241201430615691,3.353630724994973,3.4471119148061256,4.900964426937307,5.039114765418124,6.255510089742618,6.0662680901040895,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006053E-4,2.407566716068779E-4,2.4081611628889914E-4,2.4076770454650978E-4,2.407904903538245E-4,2.4075534414722268E-4,2.4083022240173406E-4,2.407195236787003E-4,2.407567224883392E-4,2.410055184725417E-4,2.4291782711448472E-4,2.4075712015618678E-4,2.409851323632678E-4,2.4101023885640473E-4,2.4090075419782637E-4,2.4076865289565048E-4,2.408514866239231E-4,2.4096483215235807E-4,2.4078108274307956E-4,2.4078020242355156E-4,2.4099682081796432E-4,2.4080432614165297E-4,2.4080469057813182E-4,2.409589526411715E-4,2.4078116959887902E-4,2.4101311952363013E-4,2.4084142415433312E-4,2.4075613202122084E-4,2.4086528056278358E-4,2.4093879611840677E-4,2.4080550732584602E-4,2.4093447751165516E-4,2.410527703252275E-4,2.4127650467341188E-4,2.408410079735812E-4,2.4076850686564574E-4,2.4085531750952694E-4,2.4079295915591936E-4,2.4071978060217046E-4,2.4078100817709653E-4,2.4102231189432837E-4,2.408900959845992E-4,2.4093502655981734E-4,2.4073176119878152E-4,2.407810694016073E-4,2.4076841632749438E-4,2.4084991425345269E-4,2.4089167792962167E-4,2.4084269396814186E-4,2.408045199756392E-4,2.4076901172928714E-4,2.4126230833403895E-4,2.408295961481613E-4,2.4078101421489185E-4,2.408283064164757E-4,2.4075637834747272E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305129E-4,2.4076934973816323E-4,2.4075624091759223E-4,2.409488516856195E-4,2.4085212877650346E-4,2.40756140275162E-4,2.4073166311921844E-4,2.407074548913272E-4,2.4092509253415903E-4,2.407679347444837E-4,2.4087737889248628E-4,2.4094807029668782E-4,2.4083875684592323E-4,2.407813331213689E-4,2.4073197870238725E-4,2.4079356239037087E-4,2.40731849041162E-4,2.407444822592771E-4,2.4073198551570224E-4,2.4088825421425354E-4,2.4081655816085928E-4,2.4075646162263932E-4,2.4077978339942212E-4]}}
{"value":"Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station. And he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many) but has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism, and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas.","finished_norm":["within","the","few","minut","of","thi","dutch","thriller","we","learn","that","krabb","be","a","gai","alcohol","writer","who","sleep","san","underwear","fantas","about","murder","hi","roommat","try","to","steal","a","magazin","from","a","new","stand","and","lust","after","a","studli","young","man","he","meet","at","the","train","station","and","he","the","hero","of","thi","nonsens","movi","that","be","all","dress","up","except","for","krabb","in","at","littl","on","scene","too","mani","but","have","nowher","to","go","the","basic","plot","be","veri","simpl","but","be","drag","out","to","nearli","two","hour","befor","reach","a","pointless","conclus","verhoeven","have","a","nice","visual","flair","but","resort","to","scene","of","wild","hallucin","overt","symbol","and","gratuit","gore","when","he","run","out","of","idea"],"filtered":["within","minut","thi","dutch","thriller","learn","krabb","gai","alcohol","writer","sleep","san","underwear","fantas","murder","hi","roommat","try","steal","magazin","new","stand","lust","studli","young","man","meet","train","station","hero","thi","nonsens","movi","dress","except","krabb","littl","scene","mani","nowher","go","basic","plot","veri","simpl","drag","nearli","two","hour","befor","reach","pointless","conclus","verhoeven","nice","visual","flair","resort","scene","wild","hallucin","overt","symbol","gratuit","gore","run","idea"],"filtered2":["within","minut","dutch","thriller","learn","krabb","gai","alcohol","writer","sleep","san","underwear","fantas","murder","roommat","try","steal","magazin","new","stand","lust","studli","young","man","meet","train","station","hero","nonsens","dress","except","krabb","littl","scene","mani","nowher","go","basic","plot","veri","simpl","drag","nearli","two","hour","befor","reach","pointless","conclus","verhoeven","nice","visual","flair","resort","scene","wild","hallucin","overt","symbol","gratuit","gore","run","idea"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,14,15,19,32,36,45,47,50,59,79,87,123,135,137,174,232,262,273,286,287,350,358,375,377,431,531,578,611,635,640,672,713,714,732,736,764,799,873,905,934,956,1107,1258,1321,1737,1917,2196,2248,2369,3092,3421,3466,3639,3953,4295,4771,8329],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,14,15,19,32,36,45,47,50,59,79,87,123,135,137,174,232,262,273,286,287,350,358,375,377,431,531,578,611,635,640,672,713,714,732,736,764,799,873,905,934,956,1107,1258,1321,1737,1917,2196,2248,2369,3092,3421,3466,3639,3953,4295,4771,8329],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.8693254449200722,1.9469506069506084,2.115024371522662,2.2619070973220485,2.366244071437088,2.2939035841256437,2.456282578459816,2.6102777977348763,2.726701583487816,2.9674191958529437,2.780700890737216,2.841890188081905,3.0135689919434205,3.2030824725120812,3.2597778161886266,3.0602441305135506,3.2189558216683714,3.4272107604888307,3.575630765607104,3.520060914452293,3.587125145032839,3.9998419165363233,3.616452760127359,3.865219416329466,3.7297814454343623,3.7099788181381825,3.6841709341823097,3.7465885637507435,3.7636829971100436,3.892300374932137,3.9121030022283168,3.9405024767500145,3.969732115064953,4.268777946167049,4.390138803171316,4.370968887063596,4.9676558014359795,5.00274712124725,5.129498826886393,5.243909178064138,5.185068678041204,5.482320201509136,5.967828017290836,5.850044981634453,5.719991853386255,6.489124940924123,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374516E-4,2.0463497070976423E-4,2.046854966648004E-4,2.0464434833267014E-4,2.0466371549280457E-4,2.0463384241427047E-4,2.0469748638025684E-4,2.0460339623606922E-4,2.0463501395727332E-4,2.048464820698709E-4,2.0647187928241845E-4,2.0463535196139923E-4,2.048291545713376E-4,2.0485049423537853E-4,2.0475743600462703E-4,2.0464515439713903E-4,2.0471556024485955E-4,2.0481190008348816E-4,2.04655719344094E-4,2.046549711024788E-4,2.0483908935972167E-4,2.0467547544121277E-4,2.046757851998071E-4,2.0480690269923535E-4,2.0465579316856524E-4,2.048529427044048E-4,2.047070074884351E-4,2.0463451208033398E-4,2.0472728462307032E-4,2.0478977034141512E-4,2.0467647940754582E-4,2.047860996727677E-4,2.048866445352589E-4,2.0507681111083876E-4,2.0470665374897106E-4,2.0464503027660877E-4,2.0471881636714308E-4,2.0466581389049797E-4,2.0460361461226804E-4,2.046556559655481E-4,2.0486075590640676E-4,2.04748376886402E-4,2.0478656634500503E-4,2.0461379771132915E-4,2.0465570800429694E-4,2.0464495332226385E-4,2.047142237835145E-4,2.0474972148579014E-4,2.0470808678692273E-4,2.0467564019349913E-4,2.0464545939350833E-4,2.0506474470589813E-

fetishes.","finished_norm":["virgin","be","select","to","marri","rich","gui","rich","gui","urin","woman","on","boat","like","sailor","sailor","urin","virgin","attend","grossout","commun","dinner","man","urin","on","dinner","tabl","boatwoman","doe","strip","teas","for","littl","boi","man","pretend","to","be","babi","urin","there","be","a","underli","theme","here","makavejev","be","try","to","sai","that","he","be","pi","off","at","the","world","to","sai","that","thi","be","a","bizarr","movi","be","a","understat","to","justifi","the","titl","there","be","a","scene","where","laur","who","hardli","speak","ten","line","the","whole","movi","bath","in","chocol","syrup","it","be","a","sweet","scene","ind","but","the","rest","of","the","movi","leav","a","bad","tast","in","on","mouth","unless","on","happen","to","share","the","director","fetish"],"filtered":["virgin","select","marri","rich","gui","rich","gui","urin","woman","boat","like","sailor","sailor","urin","virgin","attend","grossout","commun","dinner","man","urin","dinner","tabl","boatwoman","doe","strip","teas","littl","boi","man","pretend","babi","urin","underli","theme","makavejev","try","sai","pi","world","sai","thi","bizarr","movi","understat","justifi","titl","scene","laur","hardli","speak","ten","line","whole","movi","bath","chocol","syrup","sweet","scene","ind","rest","movi","leav","bad","tast","mouth","unless","happen","share","director","fetish"],"filtered2":["virgin","select","marri","rich","gui","rich","gui","urin","woman","boat","like","sailor","sailor","urin","virgin","attend","grossout","commun","dinner","man","urin","dinner","tabl","boatwoman","doe","strip","teas","littl","boi","man","pretend","babi","urin","underli","theme","makavejev","try","pi","world","bizarr","understat","justifi","titl","scene","laur","hardli","speak","ten","line","whole","bath","chocol","syrup","sweet","scene","ind","rest","leav","bad","tast","mouth","unless","happen","share","director","fetish"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,9,14,18,19,36,45,55,58,70,74,94,107,111,165,226,264,282,344,460,534,545,665,698,733,823,829,872,937,941,1061,1124,1371,1388,1449,1724,1760,1871,1881,2005,2087,2424,2520,3733,3920,4856,5081,5299,5727,5901,6025,6408,6723],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,9,14,18,19,36,45,55,58,70,74,94,107,111,165,226,264,282,344,460,534,545,665,698,733,823,829,872,937,941,1061,1124,1371,1388,1449,1724,1760,1871,1881,2005,2087,2424,2520,3733,3920,4856,5081,5299,5727,5901,6025,6408,6723],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,2.62476135602347,1.4680183469605717,3.632592212924433,3.9073995778510735,1.865701314626681,2.094675786251684,1.9486336368009016,2.08112281984698,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,2.448847599972298,2.5940874818617203,2.757740698455715,2.918851229218033,2.983093497946387,3.216957819005698,3.4933926673701317,3.442099372982581,3.5929222627171646,3.90413483257914,3.7636829971100436,3.850067611308864,3.8240921249056035,3.857614816944247,8.061773076436568,3.9612932464190886,4.218628162481577,4.181290492043933,4.436351646326448,4.443131333311827,4.679973728984199,4.6973654716960676,9.912454211224713,4.890269137820559,4.890269137820559,4.9227044135737135,4.9676558014359795,10.518353300389853,5.2288713006995975,5.719991853386255,5.878215858601149,6.101359409915359,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,12.978249881848246,26.401402304137388,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378608E-4,1.9184256248006734E-4,1.918899298906926E-4,1.918513538767773E-4,1.918695103317335E-4,1.9184150471805332E-4,1.9190117008941615E-4,1.9181296183106E-4,1.9184260302403173E-4,1.9204085156612028E-4,1.9356463982783112E-4,1.918429198984028E-4,1.9202460726677853E-4,1.9204461291790392E-4,1.9195737206466508E-4,1.9185210955149264E-4,1.9191811409701793E-4,1.9200843141398155E-4,1.9186201404870185E-4,1.9186131258214258E-4,1.920339209987115E-4,1.9188053512690626E-4,1.9188082552146728E-4,1.9200374643273208E-4,1.9186208325816143E-4,1.9204690832504045E-4,1.9191009600165993E-4,1.9184213252107832E-4,1.9192910554560388E-4,1.919876850752126E-4,1.9188147633198625E-4,1.9198424387219197E-4,1.9207850334308112E-4,1.9225678197762124E-4,1.9190976437561872E-4,1.9185199319014687E-4,1.9192116666833778E-4,1.91871477551653E-4,1.9181316655584102E-4,1.9186195463215833E-4,1.9205423309796678E-4,1.919488792618559E-4,1.9198468137120563E-4,1.9182271307573002E-4,1.91862003417793E-4,1.9185192104647234E-4,1.919168611822879E-4,1.9195013980589308E-4,1.919111078296326E-4,1.9188068957998278E-4,1.9185239548153105E-4,1.9224546988352658E-4,1.9190067107067925E-4,1.918619594432654E-4,1.918996433715097E-4,1.9184232880165925E-4,0.9848373691081564,1.91872259408659

Some movies just shouldn't be made. This is one of them. Because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. Sort of at least.

{"value":"What a let down! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail, but I was nevertheless gripped and kept watching.<br /><br />David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones were good leads. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalised with possible terrorist connections.<br /><br />But then Morrissey's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was dull, dull, dull. The whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the dénouement was unbelievably feeble.<br /><br />Five hours of my life for that?

{"value":"Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter. In the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well. But this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the acting career of dutch actress Nada van Nie who went on being a football-wife a TV presenter and program-maker. I actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I so regret spending money on it.

{"value":"Bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then slapped silly for this attempt. The animation was poor, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelmingly blaring, and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this movie, regardless of the source of the story, is just plain pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.","finished_norm":["bashki","should","be","congratul","for","attempt","to","convert","on","of","the","great","work","of","english","fiction","into","a","movi","and","then","slap","silli","for","thi","attempt","the","anim","be","poor","the","charact","look","ridicul","the","music","be","overwhelmingli","blare","and","the","film","be","a","ramshackl","blitz","through","the","book","and","a","half","of","tolkien","masterpiec","i","can","still","rememb","my","sheer","disappoint","and","loath","for","the","movi","when","i","see","it","now","i","realiz","that","ani","attempt","to","convert","a","book","into","a","movi","be","bind","to","fail","in","mani","wai","simpli","becaus","of","the","medium","but","thi","movi","regardless","of","the","sourc","of","the","stori","be","just","plain","pathet","bashki","be","capabl","of","much","much"],"filtered":["bashki","congratul","attempt","convert","great","work","english","fiction","movi","slap","silli","thi","attempt","anim","poor","charact","look","ridicul","music","overwhelmingli","blare","film","ramshackl","blitz","book","half","tolkien","masterpiec","still","rememb","sheer","disappoint","loath","movi","see","realiz","ani","attempt","convert","book","movi","bind","fail","mani","wai","simpli","becaus","medium","thi","movi","regardless","sourc","stori","plain","pathet","bashki","capabl","much","much"],"filtered2":["bashki","congratul","attempt","convert","great","work","english","fiction","slap","silli","attempt","anim","poor","charact","look","ridicul","music","overwhelmingli","blare","ramshackl","blitz","book","half","tolkien","masterpiec","still","rememb","sheer","disappoint","loath","see","realiz","ani","attempt","convert","book","bind","fail","mani","wai","simpli","becaus","medium","regardless","sourc","stori","plain","pathet","bashki","capabl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,16,17,22,27,33,48,50,51,64,118,146,151,177,187,201,206,215,274,277,290,385,405,586,588,602,916,1174,1245,1490,1536,1588,1626,2899,2970,4456,4635,4818,7134,7488],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,16,17,22,27,33,48,50,51,64,118,146,151,177,187,201,206,215,274,277,290,385,405,586,588,602,916,1174,1245,1490,1536,1588,1626,2899,2970,4456,4635,4818,7134,7488],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.883428577602134,2.354379525480895,2.326138445979858,5.6004909736203725,7.374449977903833,2.4732161909892554,2.561435818751577,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,2.748952192422636,3.1163992333432793,2.8612813773965557,3.09496984188738,3.109204957709252,3.4572130107926293,3.6375061693251913,3.506637894120152,4.100845126825194,4.235066888824737,4.409683399244287,4.558366596889411,4.5432147918688095,4.654440426979034,4.613282354485526,5.3560264761848435,5.444579873526289,11.999153431210834,6.0662680901040895,6.0662680901040895,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.671703793782348E-4,2.66933626198184E-4,2.6699953417250606E-4,2.669458587255898E-4,2.669711219846795E-4,2.669321544066983E-4,2.670151740126212E-4,2.668924392557495E-4,2.669336826118771E-4,2.67209529647822E-4,2.693297594914937E-4,2.669341235172936E-4,2.671869270007749E-4,2.6721476326886016E-4,2.670933745790584E-4,2.6694691018669094E-4,2.670387502479102E-4,2.6716441959163625E-4,2.669606915046714E-4,2.669597154698963E-4,2.671998863159871E-4,2.669864621079322E-4,2.669868661688048E-4,2.6715790081385603E-4,2.6696078780411497E-4,2.672179571448313E-4,2.670275937076647E-4,2.6693302794454014E-4,2.6705404397204673E-4,2.67135552715765E-4,2.6698777171973965E-4,2.671307645561986E-4,2.672619190927242E-4,2.6750997959492067E-4,2.670271322764756E-4,2.6694674827915815E-4,2.6704299765745843E-4,2.669738592143112E-4,2.6689272411395545E-4,2.669606088312896E-4,2.672281489822058E-4,2.670815575212526E-4,2.6713137330118547E-4,2.669060073350436E-4,2.6696067671260957E-4,2.669466478969885E-4,2.670370069169836E-4,2.6708331146775165E-4,2.670290015855951E-4,2.669866770170705E-4,2.669473080355364E-4,2.674942397181303E-4,2.670144796678457E-4,2.669606155255614E-4,2.670130497064105E-4,2.6693330105331505E-4,0.8765493882267573,2.6697494710598214E-4,2.669476827953899E-4,2.6693314868097954E-4,2.671467016031527E-4,2.670394622203582E-4,2.669330370959145E-4,2.669058985915008E-4,2.668790582551076E-4,2.6712035917030377E-4,2.669461139524938E-4,2.6706745772709213E-4,2.6714583525548467E-4,2.670246363885537E-4,2.669609691060531E-4,2.669062484873482E-4,2.669745280371459E-4,2.6690610472833703E-4,2.669201115290604E-4,2.6690625604146025E-4,2.670795154991823E-4,2.6700002408825313E-4,2.6693339338281126E-4,0.10261997936177325]}}
{"value":"Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I do not see where all this 'its not that bad' rubbish is coming from. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there. Its terrible! The name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones don't even deserve a watch. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to watch this, and not to waste your money. The 1.6/10 should tell it all. This movie should not have even be made.","finished_norm":["it","on","of","that","stereotyp","mtv","gener","danc","movi","and","i","do","not","see","where","all","thi","it","not","that","bad","rubbish","be","come","from","the","act","be","terribl","it","follow","exactli","the","same","storylin","a","all","the","other","danc","movi","out","there","it","terribl","the","name","should","scream","do","not","watch","how","she","move","sinc","when","can","movi","titl","ignor","grammar","at","littl","some","danc","movi","have","half","decent","danc","scene","thi","on","do","not","even","deserv","a","watch","i","give","it","a","out","of","just","becaus","there","be","no","zero","i","serious","implor","anyon","with","a","iq","of","over","not","to","watch","thi","and","not","to","wast","your","monei","the","should","tell","it","all","thi","movi","should","not","have","even","be","make"],"filtered":["stereotyp","mtv","gener","danc","movi","see","thi","bad","rubbish","come","act","terribl","follow","exactli","storylin","danc","movi","terribl","name","scream","watch","move","sinc","movi","titl","ignor","grammar","littl","danc","movi","half","decent","danc","scene","thi","even","deserv","watch","give","becaus","zero","serious","implor","anyon","iq","watch","thi","wast","monei","tell","thi","movi","even","make"],"filtered2":["stereotyp","mtv","gener","danc","see","bad","rubbish","come","act","terribl","follow","exactli","storylin","danc","terribl","name","scream","watch","move","sinc","titl","ignor","grammar","littl","danc","half","decent","danc","scene","even","deserv","watch","give","becaus","zero","serious","implor","anyon","iq","watch","wast","monei","tell","even","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,14,19,21,22,30,34,89,90,126,143,158,162,166,206,225,260,264,275,309,371,423,462,492,515,526,604,762,964,1098,3213,3334,7518,8612],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,14,19,21,22,30,34,89,90,126,143,158,162,166,206,225,260,264,275,309,371,423,462,492,515,526,604,762,964,1098,3213,3334,7518,8612],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,2.8828493162168796,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,4.884774065938707,2.597304642813496,2.641219492619754,2.6754694156628323,2.757740698455715,2.7832848715031413,2.848772527704847,3.0466846007279185,3.164467636384302,3.2639531875991072,14.406725771228185,3.3956930001684253,3.5119855004467477,3.5727776966246974,3.7465885637507435,4.062925891962901,4.186539847930077,5.5623629091826725,5.649374286172302,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.671703793782349E-4,2.6693362619818414E-4,2.669995341725062E-4,2.669458587255899E-4,2.669711219846796E-4,2.669321544066984E-4,2.670151740126213E-4,2.6689243925574963E-4,2.669336826118772E-4,2.672095296478221E-4,2.6932975949149385E-4,2.669341235172937E-4,2.67186927000775E-4,2.6721476326886027E-4,2.670933745790585E-4,2.6694691018669105E-4,2.6703875024791033E-4,2.6716441959163636E-4,2.6696069150467156E-4,2.669597154698965E-4,2.6719988631598727E-4,2.669864621079323E-4,2.6698686616880496E-4,2.671579008138562E-4,2.669607878041151E-4,2.672179571448315E-4,2.670275937076648E-4,2.6693302794454025E-4,2.670540439720469E-4,2.6713555271576513E-4,2.669877717197398E-4,2.6713076455619876E-4,2.672619190927244E-4,2.675099795949208E-4,2.670271322764757E-4,2.6694674827915826E-4,2.670429976574586E-4,2.669738592143113E-4,2.6689272411395556E-4,2.669606088312897E-4,2.6722814898220596E-4,2.670815575212527E-4,2.671313733011856E-4,2.669060073350438E-4,2.669606767126097E-4,2.6694664789698867E-4,2.670370069169838E-4,2.6708331146775175E-4,2.6702900158559527E-4,2.6698667701707064E-4,2.669473080355365E-4,2.674942397181304E-4,2.6701447966784585E-4,2.669606155255615E-4,2.6701304970641067E-4,2.6693330105331516E-4,0.9789024083376444,2.669749471059823E-4,2.6694768279539E-4,2.6693314868097965E-4,2.671467016031528E-4,2.670394622203583E-4,2.669330370959146E-4,2.669058985915009E-4,2.668790582551077E-4,2.671203591703039E-4,2.66946113952494E-4,2.670674577270923E-4,2.6714583525548483E-4,2.670246363885538E-4,2.669609691060532E-4,2.669062484873483E-4,2.66974528037146E-4,2.6690610472833714E-4,2.6692011152906054E-4,2.6690625604146035E-4,2.670795154991824E-4,2.670000240882533E-4,2.6693339338281137E-4,2.669592508861755E-4]}}
{"value":"Though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of Ray Milland.<br /><br />That said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present, popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish disguises.<br /><br />Anyway it's another endless night for BD as he and his cohorts chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them

{"value":"The first point that calls the attention in \"For Ever Mozart\" is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple since there is no story, screenplay, plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films. I believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about; but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie, and it is funny to read their reviews. <br

film.","finished_norm":["the","leap","year","star","some","heavi","hitter","in","the","local","and","region","film","and","televis","scene","and","yet","thei","cannot","save","thi","movi","it","have","so","mani","thing","go","against","it","over","act","overli","melodramat","poor","script","inconsist","direct","and","too","few","thing","go","for","it","decent","music","good","cinematographi","thi","comment","be","mainli","for","anyon","who","throw","all","local","movi","into","on","basket","after","watch","thi","film","and","sai","all","local","movi","be","bad","pleas","do","not","judg","the","rest","base","on","thi","on","film","thi","be","a","televis","soap","opu","masquerad","a","a","romant","featur","film","my","hope","be","high","when","i","bui","my","ticket","and","my","hope","be","dash","five","minut","into","the","film"],"filtered":["leap","year","star","heavi","hitter","local","region","film","televis","scene","yet","thei","save","thi","movi","mani","thing","go","act","overli","melodramat","poor","script","inconsist","direct","thing","go","decent","music","good","cinematographi","thi","comment","mainli","anyon","throw","local","movi","basket","watch","thi","film","sai","local","movi","bad","pleas","judg","rest","base","thi","film","thi","televis","soap","opu","masquerad","romant","featur","film","hope","high","bui","ticket","hope","dash","five","minut","film"],"filtered2":["leap","year","star","heavi","hitter","local","region","televis","scene","yet","save","mani","thing","go","act","overli","melodramat","poor","script","inconsist","direct","thing","go","decent","music","good","cinematographi","comment","mainli","anyon","throw","local","basket","watch","local","bad","pleas","judg","rest","base","televis","soap","opu","masquerad","romant","featur","hope","high","bui","ticket","hope","dash","five","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,7,9,19,21,29,50,57,59,77,100,102,118,146,158,181,189,194,211,226,280,305,309,310,334,346,347,475,504,629,663,864,1023,1177,1200,1210,1343,1716,2157,2218,2769,2803,3225,3408,3871,4738],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,7,9,19,21,29,50,57,59,77,100,102,118,146,158,181,189,194,211,226,280,305,309,310,334,346,347,475,504,629,663,864,1023,1177,1200,1210,1343,1716,2157,2218,2769,2803,3225,3408,3871,4738],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,2.6390769554676132,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.9463902258768238,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,2.354379525480895,2.326138445979858,2.3106972614914807,4.888457308232007,2.498193474075453,2.5378812223426954,2.5687161421197025,2.5940874818617203,2.8028805344481915,2.8612813773965557,2.848772527704847,2.854312708080462,2.942840385588056,3.023389038124396,3.0151989841543516,10.116321003487638,3.3956930001684253,3.488143311483988,7.459562890868725,3.9782428047328615,4.1302590120314875,4.263079925052412,4.499089986959872,4.274508620876034,4.520909034354511,4.715065048795469,5.014723312293965,5.014723312293965,5.426230734858092,5.3560264761848435,5.541743621979936,6.389041482367141,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255705E-4,2.2737792632708265E-4,2.2743406769354596E-4,2.2738834617097752E-4,2.2740986578072427E-4,2.2737667263379277E-4,2.2744738993572323E-4,2.2734284269338733E-4,2.2737797438108294E-4,2.2761294487884276E-4,2.2941898734736617E-4,2.2737834995069828E-4,2.2759369161694292E-4,2.276174029529932E-4,2.275140023100701E-4,2.2738924182076205E-4,2.27467472514179E-4,2.2757451948007191E-4,2.2740098094688521E-4,2.274001495463369E-4,2.2760473054921063E-4,2.2742293271974009E-4,2.2742327690463966E-4,2.2756896669080758E-4,2.2740106297614504E-4,2.2762012354277285E-4,2.2745796921172086E-4,2.2737741672596983E-4,2.274804999297561E-4,2.2754993025739278E-4,2.274240482660327E-4,2.2754585163377146E-4,2.276575709662824E-4,2.2786887249241986E-4,2.2745757615795533E-4,2.273891039055822E-4,2.2747109051910816E-4,2.2741219739254252E-4,2.273430853397301E-4,2.2740091052450196E-4,2.2762880509736257E-4,2.2750393636919395E-4,2.275463701715621E-4,2.2735440017971107E-4,2.2740096834679283E-4,2.273890183985972E-4,2.274659875196632E-4,2.27505430406208E-4,2.2745916846251928E-4,2.2742311578245462E-4,2.2738958071416695E-4,2.2785546503755472E-4,2.2744679848279366E-4,2.2740091622677958E-4,2.2744558042094628E-4,2.273776493639772E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441373E-4,2.2738989994003437E-4,2.273775195710164E-4,2.2755942704103584E-4,2.274680789826151E-4,2.27377424521243E-4,2.2735430755038737E-4,2.273314445633672E-4,2.2753698817546124E-4,2.2738856357694845E-4,2.2749192596045116E-4,2.2755868907355293E-4,2.274554501244986E-4,2.2740121741176008E-4,2.2735460559673444E-4,2.274127671

{"value":"Although i had heard this film was a little dry, I watch whatever Scott Bakula is in. At the start of this film I had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable Scott-gets-girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great. The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever. I kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding, right up until when the credits rolled and I realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending. Unfortunately i was left regretting that i'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great

{"value":"This is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a teleporter device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself. Simple plot done before in the fly and others. Not only does he get disfigured, but he also can electrocute people with a touch. What is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him.

{"value":"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find \"more data\" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something happens in this one.","finished_norm":["good","thei","sai","nymphomania","leav","you","unsatisfi","i","do","not","know","if","stella","jame","sean","young","qualifi","a","a","clinic","nymphomaniac","but","she","certainli","be","in","to","sexual","relat","with","man","she","still","explor","try","to","find","much","datum","so","she","can","see","what","she","want","from","life","and","the","man","in","it","though","it","seem","like","at","her","ag","she","should","have","a","pretti","good","idea","by","now","i","ca","not","agre","howev","with","anyon","who","sai","young","be","too","old","for","the","role","if","she","be","we","should","all","ag","so","nice","for","the","much","part","thi","film","leav","me","cold","though","it","by","no","mean","the","wrong","of","it","typ","you","will","ever","see","and","unlik","the","recent","ey","wide","shut","at","littl","someth","happen","in","thi","on"],"filtered":["good","thei","sai","nymphomania","leav","unsatisfi","know","stella","jame","sean","young","qualifi","clinic","nymphomaniac","certainli","sexual","relat","man","still","explor","try","find","much","datum","see","want","life","man","though","seem","like","ag","pretti","good","idea","ca","agre","howev","anyon","sai","young","old","role","ag","nice","much","part","thi","film","leav","cold","though","mean","wrong","typ","ever","see","unlik","recent","ey","wide","shut","littl","someth","happen","thi"],"filtered2":["good","nymphomania","leav","unsatisfi","know","stella","jame","sean","young","qualifi","clinic","nymphomaniac","certainli","sexual","relat","man","still","explor","try","find","datum","see","want","life","man","though","seem","like","ag","pretti","good","idea","ca","agre","howev","anyon","young","old","role","ag","nice","part","leav","cold","though","mean","wrong","typ","ever","see","unlik","recent","ey","wide","shut","littl","someth","happen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,14,25,26,35,36,37,38,44,45,53,61,64,67,74,75,78,81,86,88,94,113,123,128,135,158,262,281,384,389,442,519,562,615,620,622,903,1106,1291,1459,1582,1699,2465,3130,3571,4549,6227,8518],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,14,25,26,35,36,37,38,44,45,53,61,64,67,74,75,78,81,86,88,94,113,123,128,135,158,262,281,384,389,442,519,562,615,620,622,903,1106,1291,1459,1582,1699,2465,3130,3571,4549,6227,8518],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,3.632592212924433,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,3.8972672736018033,1.9742250248702675,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,4.062224798544638,2.0317223413467334,2.08112281984698,2.1521782565202803,2.2619070973220485,2.3409902041158843,4.732488142874176,2.3106972614914807,2.726701583487816,2.832333801361687,3.109204957709252,3.0914425013694116,6.515393299969604,3.5614461306151473,3.432149042129413,3.5013187326425523,3.7568101178222815,3.4933926673701317,3.948766986599908,4.213208095012239,4.449957298382227,4.933754249760298,4.621379564718146,4.724033718778229,5.129498826886393,5.463272006538442,5.850044981634453,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613006E-4,2.1169300653874456E-4,2.1174527517734898E-4,2.1170270760391565E-4,2.117227427540308E-4,2.1169183932737053E-4,2.1175767842838525E-4,2.116603430343436E-4,2.116930512778974E-4,2.1191181310725425E-4,2.1359327166514612E-4,2.1169340094007578E-4,2.1189388796842E-4,2.1191596365579486E-4,2.118196957667697E-4,2.1170354147024013E-4,2.117763756760954E-4,2.1187603835847083E-4,2.117144708112861E-4,2.117136967621752E-4,2.1190416541618496E-4,2.117349083131561E-4,2.117352287555903E-4,2.1187086861014463E-4,2.117145471820267E-4,2.1191849657461998E-4,2.1176752792775893E-4,2.1169253209079152E-4,2.1178850443817664E-4,2.118531453425942E-4,2.1173594690714992E-4,2.118493480694337E-4,2.1195336081055493E-4,2.121500863945939E-4,2.1176716198751706E-4,2.117034130686862E-4,2.1177974410483205E-4,2.117249135272622E-4,2.11660568942525E-4,2.1171440524675976E-4,2.1192657926066702E-4,2.1181032419177937E-4,2.1184983083759714E-4,2.116711032654154E-4,2.1171445908036972E-4,2.1170333346011986E-4,2.1177499311905116E-4,2.118117151675548E-4,2.1176864445217805E-4,2.1173507874789024E-4,2.1170385698619608E-4,2.1213760380898728E-4,2.1175712777489437E-4,2.1171441055568447E-4,2.1175599373704474E-4,2.1169274868102972E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502678E-4,2.11704154191315E-4,2.1169262784141021E-4,2.1186198702179466E-4,2.117769403092974E-4,2.1169253934833336E-4,2.1167101702582148E-4,2.1164973116690397E-4,2.1184109602769715E-4,2.1170291001284942E-4,2.117991422816547E-4,2.1186129996057

{"value":"Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat, uninspiring drivel. If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter, wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance, were instead awkward and painful to watch. Obviously, revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting, and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her

Apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash-pile that it is.<br /><br />Let's see, apalling effects, cliched script, bad acting and about 90 minutes too long.

{"value":"i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was I wrong. The plot was abysmal , the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful. Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess.

{"value":"I thought Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh from the Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, the music by Ennio Morricone. I expected an old-school, edgy, Italian cop thriller that was made in America. Istead, I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: WTF!!! Too many unanswered questions, and not enough action. The result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better script.

{"value":"This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie, set in Japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors.<br /><br />Overall, i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider. A film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash...

{"value":"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a less talented \"actor\" How this person has ever been in a film or on television, I cannot imagine. In my opinion she would be better as a greater at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... \"Who does she know\"? I would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent. I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it.","finished_norm":["although","in","mani","wai","i","agre","with","the","other","review","comment","i","find","that","the","plot","and","idea","be","veri","good","mani","of","the","support","actor","be","veri","good","the","fatal","problem","with","thi","film","be","ellen","pompeo","i","be","sure","i","have","never","see","a","littl","talent","actor","how","thi","person","have","ever","be","in","a","film","or","on","televis","i","cannot","imagin","in","my","opinion","she","would","be","well","a","a","great","at","a","walmart","to","see","a","person","with","thi","low","level","of","talent","involv","in","pai","role","doe","beg","the","question","who","doe","she","know","i","would","veri","much","like","to","see","thi","film","remak","with","some","talent","i","do","not","fault","the","writer","for","the","failur","of","thi","film","to","be","worth","the","time","to","view","it"],"filtered":["although","mani","wai","agre","review","comment","find","plot","idea","veri","good","mani","support","actor","veri","good","fatal","problem","thi","film","ellen","pompeo","sure","never","see","littl","talent","actor","thi","person","ever","film","televis","imagin","opinion","well","great","walmart","see","person","thi","low","level","talent","involv","pai","role","doe","beg","question","doe","know","veri","much","like","see","thi","film","remak","talent","fault","writer","failur","thi","film","worth","time","view"],"filtered2":["although","mani","wai","agre","review","comment","find","plot","idea","veri","good","mani","support","actor","veri","good","fatal","problem","ellen","pompeo","sure","never","see","littl","talent","actor","person","ever","televis","imagin","opinion","well","great","walmart","see","person","low","level","talent","involv","pai","role","doe","beg","question","doe","know","veri","like","see","remak","talent","fault","writer","failur","worth","time","view"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,14,15,18,20,26,32,33,38,41,42,44,50,51,119,123,128,153,167,176,217,219,237,241,276,280,287,312,322,340,378,445,459,483,538,622,663,1269,1298,1966,2028,3324,4396],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,14,15,18,20,26,32,33,38,41,42,44,50,51,119,123,128,153,167,176,217,219,237,241,276,280,287,312,322,340,378,445,459,483,538,622,663,1269,1298,1966,2028,3324,4396],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,3.1375198335242067,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,3.43598877114071,1.7139899308309823,2.1653408989309972,2.2619070973220485,2.3409902041158843,4.681980408231769,2.4609576687888097,2.5040471493269134,2.6113665294700725,2.5792094178355414,2.640097787510554,2.6627744961815836,8.365418851754757,2.8028805344481915,2.841890188081905,2.8824835850471584,2.885344817328191,2.948928684455311,3.130944944345658,3.241201430615691,3.2850956241729166,3.613480989738201,3.43462735814388,3.4933926673701317,3.7297814454343623,4.327618446189983,4.3521595551061,4.85885294158718,4.9909126636002465,5.999576715605417,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613003E-4,2.1169300653874453E-4,2.1174527517734895E-4,2.1170270760391562E-4,2.1172274275403077E-4,2.116918393273705E-4,2.1175767842838522E-4,2.1166034303434357E-4,2.1169305127789737E-4,2.1191181310725423E-4,2.135932716651461E-4,2.1169340094007576E-4,2.1189388796841998E-4,2.1191596365579486E-4,2.1181969576676966E-4,2.117035414702401E-4,2.1177637567609538E-4,2.118760383584708E-4,2.1171447081128606E-4,2.1171369676217518E-4,2.1190416541618494E-4,2.1173490831315607E-4,2.1173522875559027E-4,2.118708686101446E-4,2.1171454718202668E-4,2.1191849657461995E-4,2.117675279277589E-4,2.1169253209079152E-4,2.117885044381766E-4,2.1185314534259418E-4,2.117359469071499E-4,2.1184934806943367E-4,2.119533608105549E-4,2.1215008639459388E-4,2.1176716198751704E-4,2.1170341306868618E-4,2.1177974410483202E-4,2.1172491352726219E-4,2.1166056894252497E-4,2.1171440524675973E-4,2.11926579260667E-4,2.1181032419177934E-4,2.118498308375971E-4,2.1167110326541537E-4,2.117144590803697E-4,2.1170333346011983E-4,2.1177499311905113E-4,2.1181171516755477E-4,2.1176864445217802E-4,2.117350787478902E-4,2.1170385698619605E-4,2.1213760380898726E-4,2.1175712777489434E-4,2.1171441055568445E-4,2.1175599373704471E-4,2.116927486810297E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502675E-4,2.1170415419131497E-4,2.116926278414102E-4,2.1186198702179463E-4,2.1177694030929739E-4,2.1169253934833333E-4,2.1167101702582145E-4,2.1164973116690394E-4,2.1184109602769713E-4,2.117029100128494E-4,2.1179914228165468E-4,2.1186129996057587E-4,2.1176518261149875E-4,2.1171469096440781E-4,2.1167129451241974E-4,2.11725443

{"value":"OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes. Supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit I did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending. This movie has the following elements: A battered and abused next door neighbor, a boring legal trial, racisim, talk of lynchings, and death and arson. Hilarious, huh?

{"value":"If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo, I suggest you pick up a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book.<br /><br />I loved the book when I read it as a kid (In \"Campfire Chillers\" by E.M. Freeman)and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film. When the book was written PC didn't even exist.<br /><br />My suggestion is don't waste your time or money!! If you see it on the video store shelf LEAVE IT

{"value":"I don't really post comments, but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film. It's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever. On a technical level, it's completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes, dubbing wildly off, etc. The plot is completely clichéd, the structure is laughable, and the acting is embarrassing. I don't want to be too harsh: I've made my share of student films, and they were all awful, but there's no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it.<br /><br

{"value":"To quote the film, \"It's better not to know. Better still to forget. Best of all to be abandoned.\" Oh, the irony.<br /><br />A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror film, but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film, and you feel like you're being preached to from the start.<br /><br />It's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop TV and a Jerry Springer show. Fitting, maybe, for a film like The Hitcher, not a Russia-set horror film. The result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly, not scary or meaningful.","finished_norm":["to","quot","the","film","it","well","not","to","know","well","still","to","forget","well","of","all","to","be","abandon","oh","the","ironybr","br","a","ghost","stori","with","all","the","technic","refin","of","a","hollywood","horror","film","but","horrifyingli","bad","dialogu","after","the","quarter","of","the","film","and","you","feel","like","you","re","be","preach","to","from","the","startbr","br","it","a","if","the","writer","cumul","charact","dialogu","can","be","sum","up","by","bad","cop","tv","and","a","jerri","springer","show","fit","mayb","for","a","film","like","the","hitcher","not","a","russiaset","horror","film","the","result","be","that","a","potenti","great","set","and","some","potenti","great","gore","scene","go","to","wast","and","becom","just","silli","not","scari","or","meaning"],"filtered":["quot","film","well","know","well","still","forget","well","abandon","oh","ironybr","br","ghost","stori","technic","refin","hollywood","horror","film","horrifyingli","bad","dialogu","quarter","film","feel","like","re","preach","startbr","br","writer","cumul","charact","dialogu","sum","bad","cop","tv","jerri","springer","show","fit","mayb","film","like","hitcher","russiaset","horror","film","result","potenti","great","set","potenti","great","gore","scene","go","wast","becom","silli","scari","meaning"],"filtered2":["quot","well","know","well","still","forget","well","abandon","oh","ironybr","ghost","stori","technic","refin","hollywood","horror","horrifyingli","bad","dialogu","quarter","feel","like","re","preach","startbr","writer","cumul","charact","dialogu","sum","bad","cop","tv","jerri","springer","show","fit","mayb","like","hitcher","russiaset","horror","result","potenti","great","set","potenti","great","gore","scene","go","wast","becom","silli","scari","meaning"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,9,10,17,19,20,26,28,43,51,64,68,83,89,109,115,163,172,234,248,287,300,358,372,385,396,447,476,547,676,727,944,1148,1431,1486,1605,2523,2760,3216,3320,6483,8030],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,9,10,17,19,20,26,28,43,51,64,68,83,89,109,115,163,172,234,248,287,300,358,372,385,396,447,476,547,676,727,944,1148,1431,1486,1605,2523,2760,3216,3320,6483,8030],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,3.4960351200691706,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.6608112036218214,3.4279798616619646,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,4.584637595480144,1.9940046109572438,2.125691139326857,2.201553588425805,2.4000574358028657,2.5001408943598484,2.673149229007135,5.379009467558432,2.841890188081905,2.932274249550174,3.2030824725120812,3.0316467233633775,3.09496984188738,3.291526514503207,3.2070272508030975,3.6105180246075443,6.864298084258826,3.6105180246075443,4.096025840389245,3.969732115064953,4.176068548062782,4.890269137820559,4.558366596889411,4.637773374493822,5.2288713006995975,6.101359409915359,5.583416318380505,5.583416318380505,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918343E-4,2.3612552253122058E-4,2.3618382374676028E-4,2.361363432433456E-4,2.361586907472489E-4,2.3612422060632424E-4,2.3619765851711906E-4,2.3608908917345178E-4,2.361255724339359E-4,2.3636958262639033E-4,2.38245106466731E-4,2.3612596245232116E-4,2.3634958866039737E-4,2.3637421220985635E-4,2.3626683357713384E-4,2.3613727335022446E-4,2.3621851370481583E-4,2.3632967894044422E-4,2.3614946409949669E-4,2.3614860071362597E-4,2.3636105227822522E-4,2.3617226039252115E-4,2.361726178187699E-4,2.3632391252640514E-4,2.3614954928455467E-4,2.363770374651205E-4,2.3620864479495746E-4,2.3612499332492957E-4,2.3623204230611877E-4,2.3630414373063938E-4,2.3617341885568202E-4,2.3629990819577746E-4,2.364159255515169E-4,2.366353561887683E-4,2.3620823661977853E-4,2.361371301292248E-4,2.3622227090024024E-4,2.3616111205994103E-4,2.360893411547914E-4,2.3614939096785055E-4,2.363860530131422E-4,2.3625638038324843E-4,2.3630044668255468E-4,2.3610109129494804E-4,2.3614945101465838E-4,2.3613704133264795E-4,2.3621697158016165E-4,2.3625793189828038E-4,2.3620989018287175E-4,2.361724504979541E-4,2.3613762528140622E-4,0.030980331692687466,2.361970443100397E-4,2.3614939688950401E-4,2.36195779387385E-4,2.3612523491289698E-4,0.9505936733948365,2.361620743927611E-4,2.3613795678840852E-4,2.3612510012659127E-4,2.363140058708933E-4,2.362191435050725E-4,2.3612500142009948E-4,2.3610099510202456E-4,2.3607725253895363E-4,2.362907037459052E-4,2.361365690132755E-4,2.362439079146759E-4,2.3631323951260898E-4,2.3620602879437962E-4,2.3614970966155733E-4,2.361013046146962E-4,2.3616170369069055E-4,2.3610117744760935E-4,2.3611356765556815E-4,2.3610131129695158E-4,2.3625457404084327E-4,2.361842571189563E-4,2.3612531658619848E-4,2.361481

{"value":"Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap. Billed as a horror flick, there wasn't one scene, not one, that was even remotely scarey. NOT ONE!! Sure there was some nudity, but all the lesbian action got a little old. I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie's saving grace? And Dan, what an annoying ass bag!! Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol' Dan first spoke. And he was suppose to be intimidating? What a laugh!! All in all, this movie is dreadfully awful! How in the hell do movies like this get made? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it, don't rent this one. This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies.","finished_norm":["onc","again","i","take","a","chanc","and","rent","thi","bag","of","crap","bill","a","a","horror","flick","there","be","not","on","scene","not","on","that","be","even","remot","scarei","not","on","sure","there","be","some","nuditi","but","all","the","lesbian","action","get","a","littl","old","i","guess","mayb","that","be","suppos","to","be","thi","movi","save","grace","and","dan","what","a","annoi","ass","bag","right","from","the","begin","i","know","i","be","in","for","it","when","good","ol","dan","speak","and","he","be","suppos","to","be","intimid","what","a","laugh","all","in","all","thi","movi","be","dreadfulli","aw","how","in","the","hell","do","movi","like","thi","get","make","if","you","want","a","movi","with","a","few","thrill","in","it","do","not","rend","thi","on","thi","movi","be","about","a","thrill","a","the","teletubbi"],"filtered":["onc","take","chanc","rent","thi","bag","crap","bill","horror","flick","scene","even","remot","scarei","sure","nuditi","lesbian","action","get","littl","old","guess","mayb","suppos","thi","movi","save","grace","dan","annoi","ass","bag","right","begin","know","good","ol","dan","speak","suppos","intimid","laugh","thi","movi","dreadfulli","aw","hell","movi","like","thi","get","make","want","movi","thrill","rend","thi","thi","movi","thrill","teletubbi"],"filtered2":["onc","take","chanc","rent","bag","crap","bill","horror","flick","scene","even","remot","scarei","sure","nuditi","lesbian","action","get","littl","old","guess","mayb","suppos","save","grace","dan","annoi","ass","bag","right","begin","know","good","ol","dan","speak","suppos","intimid","laugh","dreadfulli","aw","hell","like","get","make","want","thrill","rend","thrill","teletubbi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,14,19,26,31,37,67,83,119,121,129,133,138,147,149,163,189,236,243,257,271,313,344,394,486,533,612,661,722,883,1149,1218,1239,1660,1745,1896,3875,4640,6682],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,14,19,26,31,37,67,83,119,121,129,133,138,147,149,163,189,236,243,257,271,313,344,394,486,533,612,661,722,883,1149,1218,1239,1660,1745,1896,3875,4640,6682],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.9570915389266579,2.292318797740072,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.4106958340079214,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,4.650639560718045,2.4000574358028657,2.498193474075453,2.617923930016232,2.627841366673578,2.7602659523229094,2.757740698455715,2.907069060519773,2.983093497946387,3.0967381889441223,3.3066947359763783,3.424750734647968,3.5929222627171646,3.5727776966246974,3.850067611308864,3.8614098879127985,4.297765483040301,8.595530966080602,4.573751515728891,4.688631791727313,10.179516996473758,9.71770588317436,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727829E-4,2.5058620691581317E-4,2.506480785860336E-4,2.505976903047263E-4,2.506214064035924E-4,2.5058482525906566E-4,2.506627606186686E-4,2.5054754232407134E-4,2.505862598746463E-4,2.508452136206052E-4,2.5283559737960355E-4,2.505866737783478E-4,2.5082399519387317E-4,2.508501267267697E-4,2.5073617206405766E-4,2.5059867737275813E-4,2.50684893009625E-4,2.50802866172536E-4,2.5061161470196693E-4,2.5061069844103874E-4,2.508361608610074E-4,2.5063580707447927E-4,2.5063618639005247E-4,2.5079674661457346E-4,2.506117051038868E-4,2.508531250049423E-4,2.5067441971278996E-4,2.505856453001279E-4,2.506992501229478E-4,2.507757671478342E-4,2.506370364836775E-4,2.5077127222240673E-4,2.508943946566082E-4,2.5112726355820133E-4,2.5067398654034527E-4,2.5059852538068773E-4,2.5068888030138387E-4,2.506239760011385E-4,2.505478097371296E-4,2.5061153709162815E-4,2.5086269267877027E-4,2.5072507870075743E-4,2.507718436869292E-4,2.5056027947365373E-4,2.5061160081579336E-4,2.5059843114607407E-4,2.506832564429229E-4,2.5072672523291826E-4,2.50675741370145E-4,2.5063600882225666E-4,2.5059905085673815E-4,2.511124876152885E-4,2.5066210879661806E-4,2.506115433759326E-4,2.506607664081855E-4,2.505859016833081E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867705E-4,2.50599402665731E-4,2.5058575864248504E-4,2.5078623326048403E-4,2.506855613798026E-4,2.5058565389105827E-4,2.5056017738973E-4,2.5053498079616137E-4,2.50761504078093E-4,2.505979299011484E-4,2.5071184239933196E-4,2.5078541996925843E-4,2.506716435043773E-4,2.5061187530261986E-4,2.505605058574261E-4,2.506246038642506E-4,2.505603709024344E-4,2.5057351990548165E-4,2.5056051294891293E-4,2.5072316173520943E-4,2.506485384985988E-4,2.505859883584062E-4,2.5061026230912805E-4]}}
{"value":"There may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer.

If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, barfing kids, sick kids, lots of long, long meaningful glances, a deadpan wife and a concerned husband: it's all here for you. Boring, overlong, it stands out as one of those examples that scream out: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes, there is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with some pretty good singing.

{"value":"Sorry. Someone has to say it. This really is/was a dull movie. Worthy perhaps, but dull nonetheless. I nearly cried with boredom when watching it. The acting is pretty dire, the story drawn out and predictable, the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting. It's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate (becase it is about disabled people) but hate it I suspect nearly everyone does. It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie. I suppose they too are not allowed to be objective. This was made to win awards - which I remember it duly did. But it was neither interesting nor entertaining. I haven't seen the play so cannot compare.","finished_norm":["sorri","someon","have","to","sai","it","thi","realli","iswa","a","dull","movi","worthi","perhap","but","dull","nonetheless","i","nearli","cry","with","boredom","when","watch","it","the","act","be","pretti","dire","the","stori","draw","out","and","predict","the","score","and","camerawork","total","standard","and","unexcit","it","on","of","that","movi","you","be","not","allow","to","hate","becas","it","be","about","disabl","peopl","but","hate","it","i","suspect","nearli","everyon","doe","it","be","interest","that","critic","have","be","so","kind","to","thi","movi","i","suppos","thei","too","be","not","allow","to","be","object","thi","be","make","to","win","award","which","i","rememb","it","duli","do","but","it","be","neither","interest","nor","entertain","i","have","not","see","the","plai","so","cannot","compar"],"filtered":["sorri","someon","sai","thi","realli","iswa","dull","movi","worthi","perhap","dull","nonetheless","nearli","cry","boredom","watch","act","pretti","dire","stori","draw","predict","score","camerawork","total","standard","unexcit","movi","allow","hate","becas","disabl","peopl","hate","suspect","nearli","everyon","doe","interest","critic","kind","thi","movi","suppos","thei","allow","object","thi","make","win","award","rememb","duli","neither","interest","entertain","see","plai","compar"],"filtered2":["sorri","someon","realli","iswa","dull","worthi","perhap","dull","nonetheless","nearli","cry","boredom","watch","act","pretti","dire","stori","draw","predict","score","camerawork","total","standard","unexcit","allow","hate","becas","disabl","peopl","hate","suspect","nearli","everyon","doe","interest","critic","kind","suppos","allow","object","make","win","award","rememb","duli","neither","interest","entertain","see","plai","compar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,13,17,18,21,23,40,60,78,122,139,149,184,195,246,290,318,337,339,367,437,482,489,518,521,576,579,611,616,718,856,977,1004,1261,1337,1766,1909,2386,2880,3737,5981],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,13,17,18,21,23,40,60,78,122,139,149,184,195,246,290,318,337,339,367,437,482,489,518,521,576,579,611,616,718,856,977,1004,1261,1337,1766,1909,2386,2880,3737,5981],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.6284968758320737,3.676353282473182,2.0064197866819473,2.2489347673732487,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.496249838866882,2.51289241584188,2.673149229007135,2.8612813773965557,2.902686292364678,2.973659465713028,6.007688884102852,6.158387758586425,3.1952392950510555,3.3154667220492153,3.3956930001684253,3.4101163271295305,6.815395892530497,3.587125145032839,3.5642670069567886,7.040121828904586,3.5173618574831282,3.634471265630037,3.900174431363043,4.035401218572811,4.176068548062782,4.383707912841026,4.396611317676934,4.715065048795469,4.8796870284900224,5.143104478942172,5.3560264761848435,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727827E-4,2.50586206915813E-4,2.506480785860334E-4,2.505976903047261E-4,2.506214064035923E-4,2.505848252590655E-4,2.5066276061866844E-4,2.5054754232407123E-4,2.505862598746462E-4,2.50845213620605E-4,2.528355973796034E-4,2.5058667377834764E-4,2.5082399519387306E-4,2.5085012672676954E-4,2.5073617206405755E-4,2.5059867737275797E-4,2.5068489300962484E-4,2.508028661725358E-4,2.506116147019668E-4,2.5061069844103863E-4,2.508361608610073E-4,2.506358070744791E-4,2.5063618639005236E-4,2.5079674661457335E-4,2.5061170510388666E-4,2.508531250049422E-4,2.506744197127898E-4,2.505856453001278E-4,2.5069925012294764E-4,2.507757671478341E-4,2.5063703648367736E-4,2.5077127222240656E-4,2.5089439465660805E-4,2.511272635582012E-4,2.506739865403451E-4,2.5059852538068757E-4,2.506888803013837E-4,2.506239760011384E-4,2.5054780973712945E-4,2.50611537091628E-4,2.5086269267877016E-4,2.507250787007573E-4,2.507718436869291E-4,2.5056027947365357E-4,2.506116008157932E-4,2.505984311460739E-4,2.506832564429228E-4,2.507267252329181E-4,2.506757413701449E-4,2.506360088222565E-4,2.50599050856738E-4,2.511124876152884E-4,2.506621087966179E-4,2.506115433759325E-4,2.5066076640818533E-4,2.50585901683308E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686769E-4,2.5059940266573084E-4,2.505857586424849E-4,2.5078623326048387E-4,2.506855613798025E-4,2.5058565389105816E-4,2.5056017738972984E-4,2.505349807961612E-4,2.5076150407809286E-4,2.5059792990114824E-4,2.5071184239933186E-4,2.507854199692583E-4,2.5067164350437717E-4,2.506118753026197E-4,2.50560505857426E-4,2.5062460386425045E-4,2.5056037090243424E-4,2.505735199054815E-4,2.5056051294891277E-4,2.5072316173520927E-4,2.5064853849859865E-4,2.505859883584061E-4,2.506102623091279E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie fails miserably on every level. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. Maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? My god, I can't think of anything I've ever seen that was this bad.

{"value":"This film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute, and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in Miami. The convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time. The movie was mildly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening. In a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to \"stretch\" the developing process to save the images. Somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera. Amazing that this film was even released!","finished_norm":["thi","film","describ","the","experi","of","a","coupl","of","hit","man","on","of","them","burt","reynold","a","prostitut","and","two","drag","queen","over","the","interv","of","a","few","hour","on","on","night","in","miami","the","converg","storylin","eventu","bring","all","the","peopl","togeth","at","on","place","and","time","the","movi","be","mildli","entertain","but","the","big","problem","be","that","everyth","happen","at","night","and","mani","scene","be","liter","underexpos","to","the","point","that","it","be","imposs","to","see","what","be","happen","in","a","few","scene","you","can","actual","see","where","thei","try","to","stretch","the","develop","process","to","save","the","imag","somebodi","do","not","know","how","to","oper","a","movi","camera","amaz","that","thi","film","be","even","releas"],"filtered":["thi","film","describ","experi","coupl","hit","man","burt","reynold","prostitut","two","drag","queen","interv","hour","night","miami","converg","storylin","eventu","bring","peopl","togeth","place","time","movi","mildli","entertain","big","problem","everyth","happen","night","mani","scene","liter","underexpos","point","imposs","see","happen","scene","actual","see","thei","try","stretch","develop","process","save","imag","somebodi","know","oper","movi","camera","amaz","thi","film","even","releas"],"filtered2":["describ","experi","coupl","hit","man","burt","reynold","prostitut","two","drag","queen","interv","hour","night","miami","converg","storylin","eventu","bring","peopl","togeth","place","time","mildli","entertain","big","problem","everyth","happen","night","mani","scene","liter","underexpos","point","imposs","see","happen","scene","actual","see","try","stretch","develop","process","save","imag","somebodi","know","oper","camera","amaz","even","releas"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,19,23,26,36,45,47,50,52,66,82,94,164,167,174,189,193,195,210,231,250,253,270,320,327,333,388,515,668,685,716,742,764,897,901,1082,1220,1420,1469,1492,1560,2225,2375,3305,4345,7265],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,19,23,26,36,45,47,50,52,66,82,94,164,167,174,189,193,195,210,231,250,253,270,320,327,333,388,515,668,685,716,742,764,897,901,1082,1220,1420,1469,1492,1560,2225,2375,3305,4345,7265],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,2.62476135602347,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.4680183469605717,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.929723173391612,2.020196584395323,4.16224563969396,2.3930275298746078,2.4609576687888097,2.456282578459816,2.498193474075453,2.517840471459249,2.51289241584188,5.374303583034378,2.7049353070058615,2.6812935439488212,2.7073305177318163,2.731603554088023,2.938298364153555,2.9674191958529437,2.948928684455311,3.0914425013694116,3.3956930001684253,3.5813614403160887,3.607563812710113,3.6746621462132825,3.7740817043309423,3.7465885637507435,3.8844878351953436,3.8962296530720266,4.165705761027235,4.30366520516749,4.573751515728891,4.654440426979034,4.499089986959872,4.573751515728891,5.089758498236879,5.339219357868463,5.7959777603641776,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651687E-4,2.3166917872259948E-4,2.317263796324284E-4,2.3167979521786152E-4,2.3170172096235658E-4,2.3166790136863852E-4,2.3173995330228196E-4,2.3163343296338666E-4,2.316692276835121E-4,2.3190863272655818E-4,2.3374876022784903E-4,2.3166961034116822E-4,2.3188901610218254E-4,2.3191317493693805E-4,2.3180782283696805E-4,2.3168070777104273E-4,2.3176041489471813E-4,2.3186948213389016E-4,2.3169266844704942E-4,2.3169182135566581E-4,2.3190026336973284E-4,2.317150345107696E-4,2.3171538519139328E-4,2.3186382454808458E-4,2.31692752024429E-4,2.319159468717959E-4,2.3175073223857294E-4,2.3166865950389963E-4,2.3177368817377548E-4,2.3184442884434915E-4,2.3171617111051617E-4,2.318402732457828E-4,2.3195410103209576E-4,2.3216939040434856E-4,2.317503317667922E-4,2.3168056725302076E-4,2.3176410118143947E-4,2.3170409657815956E-4,2.3163368018913922E-4,2.316925966956004E-4,2.319247922714102E-4,2.3179756692385669E-4,2.3184080156982034E-4,2.3164520857154694E-4,2.3169265560915833E-4,2.3168048013228167E-4,2.3175890187423524E-4,2.3179908915749484E-4,2.317519541225616E-4,2.3171522102838555E-4,2.3168105306030655E-4,2.3215572991360726E-4,2.3173935068699446E-4,2.3169260250549583E-4,2.3173810963694015E-4,2.3166889653243174E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908904E-4,2.3168137831085185E-4,2.3166876428991763E-4,2.3185410485865112E-4,2.3176103280889642E-4,2.3166866744629122E-4,2.3164511419405086E-4,2.3162181971902565E-4,2.3183124250942004E-4,2.3168001672688637E-4,2.3178532984537457E-4,2.3185335296367412E-4,2.3174816560918486E-4,2.3169290937467263E-4,2.3164541786535952E-4,2.

{"value":"I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: \"The Longest Day,\" \"To Hell and Back,\" \"Bridge on the River Kwai,\" (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. I've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. The plot, however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident, though, I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. \"Twelve Angry Men\" and \"Lifeboat\" to be good... so budget is no excuse.
