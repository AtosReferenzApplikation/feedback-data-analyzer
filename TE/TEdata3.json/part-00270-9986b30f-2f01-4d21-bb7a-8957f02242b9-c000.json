{"value":"What a bad, bad movie! I tried watching without fast forwarding...That failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one!! The one funny thing is that I watched \"The Killer Cut\" version of the movie. The box boldly states \"More Blood!\" \"More Sex!\" \"More Terror than the theatrical release!\" Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all those claims I wonder just how lame the \"UN-Killer Cut\" was??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of The Night of the Living Dead series!!","finished_norm":["what","a","bad","bad","movi","i","try","watch","without","fast","forwardingthat","fail","after","about","minut","i","stop","the","movi","go","onlin","to","see","how","mani","minut","thi","disast","be","onli","minut","whew","it","be","a","confus","bore","movi","i","do","not","think","anyon","can","get","knock","down","by","get","hit","with","a","fluoresc","bulb","much","littl","gut","by","on","the","on","funni","thing","be","that","i","watch","the","killer","cut","version","of","the","movi","the","box","boldli","state","much","blood","much","sex","much","terror","than","the","theatric","releas","yike","if","thi","movi","be","horribl","with","all","that","claim","i","wonder","just","how","lame","the","unkil","cut","be","if","you","want","to","see","a","great","movi","about","the","world","of","the","live","the","world","of","the","dead","watch","ani","of","the","night","of","the","live","dead","seri"],"filtered":["bad","bad","movi","try","watch","without","fast","forwardingthat","fail","minut","stop","movi","go","onlin","see","mani","minut","thi","disast","onli","minut","whew","confus","bore","movi","think","anyon","get","knock","get","hit","fluoresc","bulb","much","littl","gut","funni","thing","watch","killer","cut","version","movi","box","boldli","state","much","blood","much","sex","much","terror","theatric","releas","yike","thi","movi","horribl","claim","wonder","lame","unkil","cut","want","see","great","movi","world","live","world","dead","watch","ani","night","live","dead","seri"],"filtered2":["bad","bad","try","watch","without","fast","forwardingthat","fail","minut","stop","go","onlin","see","mani","minut","disast","onli","minut","whew","confus","bore","think","anyon","get","knock","get","hit","fluoresc","bulb","littl","gut","funni","thing","watch","killer","cut","version","box","boldli","state","blood","sex","terror","theatric","releas","yike","horribl","claim","wonder","lame","unkil","cut","want","see","great","world","live","world","dead","watch","ani","night","live","dead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,9,11,12,14,27,29,36,37,50,51,59,62,108,116,125,158,165,175,210,215,220,228,230,252,254,303,315,327,355,372,388,427,498,542,654,751,1034,1410,1449,1846,1912,3518,6644,8105],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,9,11,12,14,27,29,36,37,50,51,59,62,108,116,125,158,165,175,210,215,220,228,230,252,254,303,315,327,355,372,388,427,498,542,654,751,1034,1410,1449,1846,1912,3518,6644,8105],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,2.8828493162168796,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,5.607976334760217,2.0226120445069267,2.138507503627933,4.493325799357863,2.2242236634876535,2.3106972614914807,4.897695199944596,2.3791142619576227,2.687151791517189,2.605934685587711,2.8336934208777267,5.548540000813851,2.7121382192999195,3.0433232530252132,2.889652074525771,5.736597900110404,2.854312708080462,2.9674191958529437,3.185521045582134,3.070535816550098,3.0914425013694116,3.233054746047873,3.386191741044285,3.4471119148061256,3.634471265630037,3.8023521382691974,4.125296222689358,4.443131333311827,4.566029469634981,4.798834931860927,4.933754249760298,5.626901430320244,6.543192162194399,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.192760122716409E-5,8.13751442589797E-5,8.2007758410394E-5,8.153391670864083E-5,8.153525255006917E-5,8.142128256086092E-5,8.166344086337437E-5,8.138686174803187E-5,8.156984908227147E-5,9.049729483416472E-5,0.8128063693918617,8.125548540934958E-5,8.277207875015763E-5,8.395284064153648E-5,8.131473606166099E-5,8.109001721519169E-5,8.311270625933598E-5,8.167109211136175E-5,8.141770786624046E-5,8.148518867023961E-5,8.227360566264822E-5,8.17520074969772E-5,8.184509455981755E-5,8.19332734695325E-5,8.256206925044627E-5,8.213029287126774E-5,8.558289435895199E-5,8.127964192013317E-5,8.12818163409015E-5,8.148774336295122E-5,8.321974627164357E-5,8.166635996898484E-5,0.12359044043502385,8.189607538835125E-5,8.136811115512175E-5,8.174367862651377E-5,8.128657827437009E-5,0.057288375877878016,8.10896098123888E-5,8.111064819830826E-5,8.129321840978204E-5,8.215068960864997E-5,8.173324743242996E-5,8.141009701971463E-5,8.239931506220405E-5,8.14413426598142E-5,8.414723405446913E-5,8.290982445018645E-5,8.113080862853798E-5,8.131011267709651E-5,8.128191126664772E-5,8.356948979182567E-5,8.131132241656231E-5,8.110344742621553E-5,8.199367382969355E-5,8.133226605469058E-5,8.746391349457457E-5,8.126523769935295E-5,8.112987039727945E-5,8.151724171680995E-5,8.232582424432196E-5,8.151184888759264E-5,8.111486118988005E-5,8.130372472082693E-5,8.109059060557365E-5,8.29668

{"value":"I liked Chiba in Street Fighter, and I figured hey, no matter how stupid this movie will be, I'll at least get to see him kick some ass, right? Wrong. This is a dull, dreary mess of pointless talking, half-assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming. There are few action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on. The dub is also atrocious, and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the Italian Mafia... EXCEPT THEY'RE ALL Japanese!

{"value":"I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before heading into work. If you've any interest in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that doesn't peak your interest, well, I'm afraid you'll wish that YOU were the one about to be enveloped in flames, because this movie is pretty bad. The acting, to begin with, is awful, awful, awful. The characters are all completely obnoxious, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-grade, Sci-Fi movie. Towards the end, the movie began to remind me of 'Hollow Man' (complete with escape via elevator shaft), except with a Dragon, not a naked, invisible man.

{"value":"I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed... but then again I was only 12 years old. I recently re-watched it and want that time back. This film is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (watch My Bodyguard (1980)if you would like to see a GOOD movie that he was in... of Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, this role does/did nothing for their careers.<br /><br />Anyway, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car (which he had in storage) across the country to California. One Problem: The government has outlawed all private transportation. I thought the concept was OK (not the worse I've heard of), but the execution failed

Be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone (in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing).

The plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix, with plenty of clichés: the lone wolf cop, good looking, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his gun... + nice hard worker and shy, but good looking she-scientist, you add a 2 cent plot and you have I, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx,Audi,converse etc. This movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec. I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy, if you have some spare time, watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book.","finished_norm":["thi","be","probabl","the","much","bore","wrong","and","useless","film","i","have","see","last","year","the","plot","that","be","mean","to","have","some","philosoph","aspect","emerg","to","me","a","a","veri","bad","hollow","copi","of","the","matrix","with","plenti","of","cliché","the","lone","wolf","cop","good","look","psycholog","disturb","sleep","with","hi","gun","+","nice","hard","worker","and","shy","but","good","look","shescientist","you","add","a","cent","plot","and","you","have","i","robot","i","be","terribli","disturb","by","the","obviou","advertis","of","brand","like","fedexaudiconvers","etc","thi","movi","stink","the","commerci","and","tend","to","be","much","a","poor","ad","spot","that","unfortun","will","not","end","after","sec","i","would","not","recommend","thi","to","my","wrong","enemi","if","you","have","some","spare","time","watch","a","good","tv","program","instead","or","well","read","a","nice","book"],"filtered":["thi","probabl","much","bore","wrong","useless","film","see","last","year","plot","mean","philosoph","aspect","emerg","veri","bad","hollow","copi","matrix","plenti","cliché","lone","wolf","cop","good","look","psycholog","disturb","sleep","hi","gun","+","nice","hard","worker","shy","good","look","shescientist","add","cent","plot","robot","terribli","disturb","obviou","advertis","brand","like","fedexaudiconvers","etc","thi","movi","stink","commerci","tend","much","poor","ad","spot","unfortun","end","sec","recommend","thi","wrong","enemi","spare","time","watch","good","tv","program","instead","well","read","nice","book"],"filtered2":["probabl","bore","wrong","useless","see","last","year","plot","mean","philosoph","aspect","emerg","veri","bad","hollow","copi","matrix","plenti","cliché","lone","wolf","cop","good","look","psycholog","disturb","sleep","gun","+","nice","hard","worker","shy","good","look","shescientist","add","cent","plot","robot","terribli","disturb","obviou","advertis","brand","like","fedexaudiconvers","etc","stink","commerci","tend","poor","ad","spot","unfortun","end","sec","recommend","wrong","enemi","spare","time","watch","good","tv","program","instead","well","read","nice","book"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,8,9,15,16,20,24,25,32,57,88,108,144,145,146,148,151,152,171,172,227,262,298,299,383,429,476,501,523,645,732,747,839,887,1006,1125,1152,1153,1408,1422,1530,1564,1622,1691,1709,1832,1848,1856,1857,1961,2009,2098,2285,2314,2551,2878,2939,4031],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,8,9,15,16,20,24,25,32,57,88,108,144,145,146,148,151,152,171,172,227,262,298,299,383,429,476,501,523,645,732,747,839,887,1006,1125,1152,1153,1408,1422,1530,1564,1622,1691,1709,1832,1848,1856,1857,1961,2009,2098,2285,2314,2551,2878,2939,4031],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,2.742262257014735,1.834162586674748,2.0317223413467334,2.138507503627933,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.326138445979858,2.3018654096236517,2.8002454868101863,2.3131195476980753,2.373087554090762,2.5001408943598484,2.6005321873043625,5.453403166975632,2.7819920465008363,2.7949961309240425,3.0433232530252132,3.2872346624216657,3.6105180246075443,3.5119855004467477,3.4986697244709752,3.558633189238533,3.7099788181381825,3.7465885637507435,7.931007557910864,3.9323057095458362,4.062925891962901,4.240607069200353,4.589376833631972,4.213208095012239,4.477736862489302,4.671389985292807,4.573751515728891,4.724033718778229,4.770124825978496,4.760735085628657,4.733083554298147,4.8085911068062925,4.900964426937307,5.170884043049248,5.143104478942172,4.900964426937307,4.9676558014359795,4.933754249760298,5.064116067623542,5.185068678041204,5.185068678041204,5.463272006538442,5.444579873526289,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.769883616638724E-5,5.730975942523054E-5,5.775528815708959E-5,5.742157748683024E-5,5.7422518274727876E-5,5.734225306939155E-5,5.7512796964413104E-5,5.731801165611459E-5,5.744688344121104E-5,6.373418127621722E-5,0.7293716702046612,5.722548774807594E-5,5.829357309894184E-5,0.03776325255448217,5.7267215976771283E-5,5.7108954100288646E-5,5.8533465522880285E-5,5.751818547936387E-5,5.733973553297938E-5,5.738725997890484E-5,5.7942515377505445E-5,5.757517144634001E-5,5.764072951355527E-5,5.7702830934673E-5,5.8145670517446355E-5,5.7841585029899115E-5,6.027313538169518E-5,5.7242500360885014E-5,5.7244031731824595E-5,5.738905916250127E-5,5.860885018007608E-5,5.751485279167825E-5,0.21280869659961021,5.7676633585310486E-5,5.7304806248264995E-5,5.756930570481795E-5,5.7247385400367594E-5,5.72812143

{"value":"There just isn't enough here. There a few funny spots, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I was expecting this to be a hidden gem. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden turd.<br /><br />The whole time I was watching it I was thinking, \"Geez, I could do better than that and I'm a moron\". Don't believe the few good reviews. I was suckered in by them. At no point did I laugh at loud. Maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man, it fell flat today. This movie had promise, it just didn't deliver on it. Maybe if they rewrote it a few more times. I cant fault the actors. They weren't the best, but they just didn't have much with which to work. This movie failed because of threadbare writing.

{"value":"This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be my last. I failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying \"I am going to take a shower\".<br /><br />The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. In between, the officials screwing up. The final scenes are utterly unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?<br /><br />There's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done MTV style.

{"value":"The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death \"poetry\". To be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie.","finished_norm":["the","subject","notwithstand","thi","be","a","amateur","exhibitionist","movieor","a","effort","at","onewhich","be","about","a","interest","and","dare","a","a","moodi","high","school","student","composit","book","full","of","death","poetri","to","be","sure","it","will","disturb","viewer","who","be","hellbent","on","be","disturb","but","the","success","will","be","attribut","to","themselv","not","to","the","director","to","genuin","get","under","somebodi","skin","requir","sensibl","disciplin","techniqu","and","talent","a","good","a","a","ey","and","a","ear","the","film","doe","contain","on","evoc","imag","show","a","a","still","and","conjur","us","on","the","video","case","but","with","no","develop","lead","up","to","or","awai","from","it","if","the","director","have","have","a","ey","he","would","have","see","it","a","a","possibl","start","point","for","a","interest","moviethat","be","a","movi"],"filtered":["subject","notwithstand","thi","amateur","exhibitionist","movieor","effort","onewhich","interest","dare","moodi","high","school","student","composit","book","full","death","poetri","sure","disturb","viewer","hellbent","disturb","success","attribut","themselv","director","genuin","get","somebodi","skin","requir","sensibl","disciplin","techniqu","talent","good","ey","ear","film","doe","contain","evoc","imag","show","still","conjur","us","video","case","develop","lead","awai","director","ey","see","possibl","start","point","interest","moviethat","movi"],"filtered2":["subject","notwithstand","amateur","exhibitionist","movieor","effort","onewhich","interest","dare","moodi","high","school","student","composit","book","full","death","poetri","sure","disturb","viewer","hellbent","disturb","success","attribut","themselv","director","genuin","get","somebodi","skin","requir","sensibl","disciplin","techniqu","talent","good","ey","ear","doe","contain","evoc","imag","show","still","conjur","us","video","case","develop","lead","awai","director","ey","see","possibl","start","point","interest","moviethat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,18,28,39,56,58,60,64,66,71,119,151,155,157,211,240,245,276,279,281,288,296,320,336,401,402,436,532,550,626,711,740,839,989,1082,1158,1166,1617,1741,1789,1797,2762,3506,3862,4863,5142,5455,6095],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,18,28,39,56,58,60,64,66,71,119,151,155,157,211,240,245,276,279,281,288,296,320,336,401,402,436,532,550,626,711,740,839,989,1082,1158,1166,1617,1741,1789,1797,2762,3506,3862,4863,5142,5455,6095],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.2153159934048174,1.5452294193519092,1.5538940054862738,1.8610609350701788,3.731402629253362,3.676353282473182,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,2.1653408989309972,2.8002454868101863,2.3074766467914385,2.3360150694757706,2.5687161421197025,2.7666071276613566,2.7502029743242886,2.7884729505849193,2.7910771187233068,5.664667602723374,2.8015621426949333,2.9504565686333644,2.938298364153555,2.9233055795674137,3.0879275592619675,3.084424928710765,3.2070272508030975,3.4446025032006995,3.4751392270607813,3.6528204042982337,3.6375061693251913,3.7740817043309423,7.931007557910864,4.044492190274062,4.165705761027235,4.2860694432771105,4.246178114249808,4.662879295624898,4.751432692966343,4.798834931860927,4.798834931860927,5.322690055917252,5.604922523601468,5.9370563586240825,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.255510089742618,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.025599261667788E-5,6.978224003395334E-5,7.032473040942199E-5,6.99183933679219E-5,6.991953890207792E-5,6.982180535928644E-5,7.002946519136524E-5,6.979228822054742E-5,6.994920672677387E-5,0.4985741246288742,0.4037165267907722,6.967962807985957E-5,7.098016378404648E-5,7.19927114173252E-5,6.973043773776452E-5,6.953773289370836E-5,7.127226465617524E-5,7.00360264236491E-5,6.98187399244989E-5,6.987660724633573E-5,7.055270440489818E-5,7.010541440339248E-5,7.018524005313275E-5,7.026085677737568E-5,7.0800072756845E-5,7.042980830807257E-5,0.09230023284285102,6.970034319439773E-5,6.970220784180786E-5,6.9878797991208E-5,7.136405548370746E-5,7.00319684339739E-5,7.517338558529784E-5,7.022895802679982E-5,6.977620888345809E-5,7.009827208440572E-5,6.970629137846216E-5,6.974748266804822E-5,6.953738353051595E-5,6.955542473596666E-5,6.971198554376771E-5,7.044729927582297E-5,7.008932694401887E-5,6.981221333798451E-5,7.06605049326172E-5,6.983900764695069E-5,7.215941106407622E-5,7.109828589111722E-5,6.957271306146567E-5,6.972647301199492E-5,6.97022892441976E-5,7.166397367737596E-5,6.972751040898574E-5,6.954924980366786E-5,7.031265235290772E-5,6.974547036464983E-5,7.500358815172022E-5,6.968799103451967E-5,6.957190849295171E-5,6.99040939366508E-5,7.059748379833301E-

{"value":"I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this? As for the writing, if thats what you want to call it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell!! I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $10,000 and they were way under. Did Wallmart get a good deal on this? Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster, or trade it to a friend, but then they might not be your friend

{"value":"The ENTIRE MOVIE is flashbacks from the first Boogeyman movie as well as, inexplicably, footage from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love film Brainwaves. It is framed with some more current (from the early 90's anyway) footage that is boring, poorly acted and cheaply shot. Not only is the film almost completely flashbacks, they REPEAT the same flashbacks throughout the film. So you see the recycled footage over and over again, as if you hadn't seen it already. As if the originals weren't bad enough. I've never seen a movie so padded.... Someone was milking the last dollar out of these films. Total ripoff. And talk about padding... why do I have to write 10 lines about this trash? If I can convey that it's garbage in 2 lines, that should be enough.","finished_norm":["the","entir","movi","be","flashback","from","the","boogeyman","movi","a","good","a","inexplic","footag","from","anoth","uli","lommel","suzanna","love","film","brainwav","it","be","frame","with","some","much","current","from","the","earli","anywai","footag","that","be","bore","poorli","act","and","cheapli","shoot","not","onli","be","the","film","almost","complet","flashback","thei","repeat","the","same","flashback","throughout","the","film","so","you","see","the","recycl","footag","over","and","over","again","a","if","you","have","not","see","it","alreadi","a","if","the","origin","be","not","bad","enough","i","have","never","see","a","movi","so","pad","someon","be","milk","the","last","dollar","out","of","thi","film","total","ripoff","and","talk","about","pad","why","do","i","have","to","write","line","about","thi","trash","if","i","can","convei","that","it","garbag","in","line","that","should","be","enough"],"filtered":["entir","movi","flashback","boogeyman","movi","good","inexplic","footag","anoth","uli","lommel","suzanna","love","film","brainwav","frame","much","current","earli","anywai","footag","bore","poorli","act","cheapli","shoot","onli","film","almost","complet","flashback","thei","repeat","flashback","throughout","film","see","recycl","footag","see","alreadi","origin","bad","enough","never","see","movi","pad","someon","milk","last","dollar","thi","film","total","ripoff","talk","pad","write","line","thi","trash","convei","garbag","line","enough"],"filtered2":["entir","flashback","boogeyman","good","inexplic","footag","anoth","uli","lommel","suzanna","love","brainwav","frame","current","earli","anywai","footag","bore","poorli","act","cheapli","shoot","onli","almost","complet","flashback","repeat","flashback","throughout","see","recycl","footag","see","alreadi","origin","bad","enough","never","see","pad","someon","milk","last","dollar","total","ripoff","talk","pad","write","line","trash","convei","garbag","line","enough"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,11,21,42,54,65,69,73,93,103,107,108,117,131,139,144,184,186,198,266,330,386,398,438,658,671,702,988,1039,1051,1359,1400,1413,1613,1872,1975,2578,3016,3935,4516,5085],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,11,21,42,54,65,69,73,93,103,107,108,117,131,139,144,184,186,198,266,330,386,398,438,658,671,702,988,1039,1051,1359,1400,1413,1613,1872,1975,2578,3016,3935,4516,5085],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.6219954307453837,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,4.070779654240196,2.098582041218749,4.287906797278791,2.138507503627933,2.2797301185117202,2.2512118082053005,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.496249838866882,2.571852579609833,2.5439726117360975,2.747702973022204,2.9292757465539174,3.0433232530252132,3.143848349181566,3.1797351085150902,11.43948916312024,3.6466665387238555,3.6466665387238555,4.039936373738201,4.145296889396028,12.575450715092762,4.403125998698128,4.470719289830655,4.484804029712395,4.6295428753573065,4.789173020949191,9.759374056980045,5.214056214914456,5.501738287366237,5.7959777603641776,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.592006481976424E-5,7.54081180740223E-5,7.599434428670128E-5,7.555524815581785E-5,7.555648604349318E-5,7.545087317507529E-5,7.567527464354363E-5,7.541897635029356E-5,7.558854570260678E-5,8.386136524091325E-5,0.3900981462667479,7.52972334944166E-5,7.670261901791211E-5,0.3391006205384635,7.535213945158753E-5,7.514389864953027E-5,7.701826920403817E-5,7.56823648455568E-5,7.544756060344825E-5,7.551009321684066E-5,7.62406976562737E-5,7.575734691788438E-5,7.58436081502269E-5,7.59253211314569E-5,7.650800896474281E-5,7.61078936165101E-5,0.18750006807801972,7.531961867153688E-5,7.532163364772567E-5,7.551246058062716E-5,7.711746025261005E-5,7.567797969878561E-5,8.123390039474203E-5,7.589085068813683E-5,7.540160068924866E-5,7.574962878167646E-5,7.53260464010858E-5,7.537055855241853E-5,7.514352112050783E-5,7.516301681669304E-5,7.53321996327603E-5,7.612679471456469E-5,7.57399624797327E-5,7.544050784036329E-5,7.635718911482707E-5,7.546946231951516E-5,7.797693778566283E-5,7.683026418655114E-5,7.518169893537965E-5,7.534785508770328E-5,7.532172161281556E-5,7.744155799653024E-5,7.534897612014268E-5,7.515634405835709E-5,7.598129249141226E-5,7.536838401614407E-5,8.105041380970753E-5,7.530627067453792E-5,7.518082950216183E-5,7.553979589746162E-5,7.62890871861279E-5,7.553479851028552E-5,7.516692088062785E-5,7.534193554353515E-5,7.51444299946974E-5,7.688311635356636E-5,7.579176398475842E-5,0.07752552959468846,7.556417430071333E-5,7.583961772764676E-5,7.514168860671596E-5,7.556575846822987E-5,7.679138490666354E-5,7.527634668651289E-5,7.71393970

{"value":"There is absolutely no plot in this movie ...no character development...no climax...nothing. But has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So there you go...as a movie overall is pretty bad, but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie. Do not expect nothing more that just that.Decent acting and a not so bad direction..A couple of cameos from Kimbo and Carano...I was looking to see Carano a little bit more in this movie..she is a good fighter and a really hot girl....

{"value":"A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific, but, instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death, despite the title itself. Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twist with it's sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go, never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to \"The

You would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama, there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. No Character study, no lessons learned, it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun, they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and want get an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of

{"value":"I picked this DVD up at the Dollar Store. The DVD was on the 2 for $1 rack, but since it had Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I bought it anyway.<br /><br />I must say that I didn't like the movie. The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that the director's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me. I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.<br /><br />I won't throw it away like one of the other commentators, but It may be quite awhile before I would consider watching this movie again.<br /><br />Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen's film debut, maybe it might have some archival value at some future date.","finished_norm":["i","pick","thi","dvd","up","at","the","dollar","store","the","dvd","be","on","the","for","rack","but","sinc","it","have","michael","madsen","in","it","i","think","that","sinc","i","have","never","see","the","movi","i","bui","it","anywaybr","br","i","must","sai","that","i","do","not","like","the","movi","the","movi","plai","much","like","a","documentari","or","a","advertis","for","religion","than","anyth","els","i","find","that","the","director","us","of","flashback","do","not","add","to","the","stori","line","for","me","i","would","have","prefer","to","view","the","stori","line","in","chronolog","orderbr","br","i","wo","not","throw","it","awai","like","on","of","the","other","comment","but","it","mai","be","quit","awhil","befor","i","would","consid","watch","thi","movi","againbr","br","who","know","sinc","it","be","michael","madsen","film","debut","mayb","it","mai","have","some","archiv","valu","at","some","futur","date"],"filtered":["pick","thi","dvd","dollar","store","dvd","rack","sinc","michael","madsen","think","sinc","never","see","movi","bui","anywaybr","br","must","sai","like","movi","movi","plai","much","like","documentari","advertis","religion","anyth","els","find","director","us","flashback","add","stori","line","prefer","view","stori","line","chronolog","orderbr","br","wo","throw","awai","like","comment","mai","quit","awhil","befor","consid","watch","thi","movi","againbr","br","know","sinc","michael","madsen","film","debut","mayb","mai","archiv","valu","futur","date"],"filtered2":["pick","dvd","dollar","store","dvd","rack","sinc","michael","madsen","think","sinc","never","see","bui","anywaybr","must","like","plai","like","documentari","advertis","religion","anyth","els","find","director","us","flashback","add","stori","line","prefer","view","stori","line","chronolog","orderbr","wo","throw","awai","like","comment","mai","quit","awhil","befor","consid","watch","againbr","know","sinc","michael","madsen","debut","mayb","mai","archiv","valu","futur","date"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,12,17,26,38,40,42,46,56,58,79,104,107,120,141,155,162,163,196,247,280,299,310,312,317,347,406,446,451,466,624,647,793,844,1039,1051,1268,1471,1530,2109,2255,3514,3693,4124,4312,4996,8413],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,12,17,26,38,40,42,46,56,58,79,104,107,120,141,155,162,163,196,247,280,299,310,312,317,347,406,446,451,466,624,647,793,844,1039,1051,1268,1471,1530,2109,2255,3514,3693,4124,4312,4996,8413],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,1.3324924169710188,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.6219954307453837,3.311542587503466,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.9469506069506084,2.0728240170322856,4.287906797278791,2.2044500422972613,2.2657547357741192,2.3074766467914385,7.07580216637356,2.4000574358028657,2.478925055209576,5.460751613699401,2.8028805344481915,2.7949961309240425,2.854312708080462,2.8824835850471584,2.8529247828056143,3.0151989841543516,3.121829110937649,3.233054746047873,3.216957819005698,6.889205006401399,3.9241755834625858,3.6746621462132825,3.770603439954617,3.8690435127678695,4.145296889396028,4.191816905030921,4.30366520516749,4.9227044135737135,4.573751515728891,4.933754249760298,5.051537285416681,12.202718819830718,5.672363804397,5.822646007446338,5.907203395474402,6.2980697041614135,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.952464984497135E-5,6.905582887753041E-5,6.959267209892661E-5,6.919056489814345E-5,6.919169850764942E-5,6.909498234027907E-5,6.9300480498862E-5,6.906577246566448E-5,6.922105749962754E-5,0.07020652505685852,0.6599768174191913,6.895428508158405E-5,7.02412826184036E-5,7.124328994949562E-5,6.900456582694135E-5,6.881386697966247E-5,7.053034281238543E-5,6.930697343078277E-5,6.909194881570288E-5,6.914921375693178E-5,6.981827295685937E-5,6.937563910349527E-5,6.9454633793345E-5,6.952946337128717E-5,7.006306628211585E-5,6.969665616972305E-5,7.262657119091235E-5,6.897478455829947E-5,6.897662979531689E-5,6.91513816968394E-5,7.062117812629206E-5,6.930295768350293E-5,7.439085430042258E-5,6.949789667666542E-5,6.904986050941365E-5,6.93685711338013E-5,6.898067082363982E-5,6.90214333248653E-5,6.881352125323092E-5,6.883137465541096E-5,6.898630571447666E-5,6.971396506200403E-5,6.935971910951058E-5,6.908549016890001E-5,6.992495131501253E-5,0.043959372193241794,7.140825430538878E-5,7.035817511151591E-5,6.884848301488262E-5,6.900064237271921E-5,6.897671035033338E-5,7.091797426595671E-5,6.900166897073384E-5,6.882526400221396E-5,0.1373059161650069,6.901944196891196E-5,7.422282440468873E-5,6.896256098051816E-5,6.884768682167367E-5,6.917641431945147E-5,6.986258621090182E-5,6.917183790616228E-5,6.883494984569411E-5,6.89952214838342E-5,6.881

{"value":"I give this movie a ONE, for it is truly an awful movie. Sound track of the DVD is so bad, it actually hurts my ear. But the vision, no matter how disjointed, does show something really fancy in the Italian society. I will not go into detail what actually was so shocking , but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So for the kink value, i give it one.Otherwise, the video, photography, acting of the adults actors /actresses are simply substandard, a practical jock to people who love foreign movies.Roberto, the main character, has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievable.however, the children in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old, and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the Italian life..","finished_norm":["i","give","thi","movi","a","on","for","it","be","truli","a","aw","movi","sound","track","of","the","dvd","be","so","bad","it","actual","hurt","my","ear","but","the","vision","no","matt","how","disjoint","doe","show","someth","realli","fanci","in","the","italian","societi","i","will","not","go","into","detail","what","actual","be","so","shock","but","the","variou","incid","be","absolut","abnorm","so","for","the","kink","valu","i","give","it","oneotherwis","the","video","photographi","act","of","the","adult","actor","actress","be","simpli","substandard","a","practic","jock","to","peopl","who","love","foreign","moviesroberto","the","main","charact","have","full","spectrum","of","emot","but","exagger","to","the","point","of","be","unbelievablehowev","the","child","in","the","movi","be","mostli","year","old","and","thei","be","genuin","and","the","movi","provid","glimps","of","the","italian","life"],"filtered":["give","thi","movi","truli","aw","movi","sound","track","dvd","bad","actual","hurt","ear","vision","matt","disjoint","doe","show","someth","realli","fanci","italian","societi","go","detail","actual","shock","variou","incid","absolut","abnorm","kink","valu","give","oneotherwis","video","photographi","act","adult","actor","actress","simpli","substandard","practic","jock","peopl","love","foreign","moviesroberto","main","charact","full","spectrum","emot","exagger","point","unbelievablehowev","child","movi","mostli","year","old","thei","genuin","movi","provid","glimps","italian","life"],"filtered2":["give","truli","aw","sound","track","dvd","bad","actual","hurt","ear","vision","matt","disjoint","doe","show","someth","realli","fanci","italian","societi","go","detail","actual","shock","variou","incid","absolut","abnorm","kink","valu","give","oneotherwis","video","photographi","act","adult","actor","actress","simpli","substandard","practic","jock","peopl","love","foreign","moviesroberto","main","charact","full","spectrum","emot","exagger","point","unbelievablehowev","child","mostli","year","old","genuin","provid","glimps","italian","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,9,10,13,18,21,23,28,30,41,52,53,54,57,66,67,75,138,178,179,180,201,222,240,247,336,343,354,408,451,506,508,510,694,734,741,863,867,917,942,1030,1049,1166,1371,1509,1770,1789,2063,2243,2405,2445,2462,4473,6414,8026],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,9,10,13,18,21,23,28,30,41,52,53,54,57,66,67,75,138,178,179,180,201,222,240,247,336,343,354,408,451,506,508,510,694,734,741,863,867,917,942,1030,1049,1166,1371,1509,1770,1789,2063,2243,2405,2445,2462,4473,6414,8026],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.5452294193519092,2.6728839783437044,1.5687599167621034,3.4244306149452273,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,2.2907365189289424,2.532833256045391,2.507968722980095,2.7097314792693545,2.561435818751577,2.5771019354959765,2.7666071276613566,2.7303758068497004,2.9233055795674137,2.9705344631698933,3.0316467233633775,3.130944944345658,3.216957819005698,3.449627639403373,3.4149707055943286,3.374440724508766,3.6715125373103863,3.79165684915245,3.7165362186843414,3.944626193933877,3.8844878351953436,3.9363956947973615,3.9739784059464043,8.595530966080602,4.176068548062782,4.246178114249808,4.403125998698128,4.597282013139085,4.789173020949191,4.798834931860927,4.900964426937307,5.064116067623542,5.0768550934009715,5.259176650194926,5.129498826886393,6.214688095222362,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.747790408818538E-5,6.702288480587254E-5,6.754392382562368E-5,6.71536543141897E-5,6.715475455120907E-5,6.706088562443064E-5,6.726033409437732E-5,6.703253566334394E-5,6.718324923977267E-5,0.11072297464371975,0.5797929089922721,6.692433037174165E-5,0.0949990130625268,6.914594890960903E-5,6.697313089530082E-5,6.678804605769135E-5,6.84539903216098E-5,6.726663587997967E-5,6.705794140420289E-5,6.7113520514928E-5,6.776288318878113E-5,6.733328009448167E-5,6.740994924876064E-5,6.748257590843603E-5,6.800047000956939E-5,6.764484669501673E-5,7.048850754375447E-5,6.694422636153442E-5,6.694601727636477E-5,6.711562463255366E-5,6.854215152218081E-5,6.726273835283792E-5,0.16358243817960771,6.745193851009145E-5,6.701709214136803E-5,6.732642019972243E-5,6.694993934029749E-5,6.698950182862675E-5,6.678771050914792E-5,6.680503832255854E-5,6.695540834480572E-5,6.766164602843032E-5,6.731782877139584E-5,0.045844376102753444,6.786642102803376E-5,6.707740769285316E-5,6.930605685707442E-5,6.828689108943442E-5,6.682164302667584E-5,6.696932294418873E-5,6.6946095459911E-5,6.883021023935081E-

Laughable \"script\", performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school Christmas pageant, inept \"action\" scenes, confused direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering T&A (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of Eve Meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence. Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much it.","finished_norm":["relentlessli","stupid","nobudget","war","pictur","make","mainli","to","show","off","the","attribut","of","the","spectacular","ev","meyernot","a","bad","idea","in","itselfbut","that","should","be","a","embarrass","to","everyon","connect","with","it","laughabl","script","perform","that","would","not","pass","muster","in","a","elementaryschool","christma","pageant","inept","action","scene","confus","direct","by","the","normal","compet","documentari","director","loui","clyd","stoumenwho","be","appar","not","quit","sure","if","he","make","a","comedi","a","philosoph","treatis","on","the","futil","of","war","or","a","leer","ta","by","earli","standard","anywai","travelogu","of","ev","meyer","magnific","bodyand","a","gener","air","of","shoddi","and","incompet","worth","see","in","order","to","watch","ev","meyer","strut","her","stuff","but","that","pretti","much","it"],"filtered":["relentlessli","stupid","nobudget","war","pictur","make","mainli","show","attribut","spectacular","ev","meyernot","bad","idea","itselfbut","embarrass","everyon","connect","laughabl","script","perform","pass","muster","elementaryschool","christma","pageant","inept","action","scene","confus","direct","normal","compet","documentari","director","loui","clyd","stoumenwho","appar","quit","sure","make","comedi","philosoph","treatis","futil","war","leer","ta","earli","standard","anywai","travelogu","ev","meyer","magnific","bodyand","gener","air","shoddi","incompet","worth","see","order","watch","ev","meyer","strut","stuff","pretti","much"],"filtered2":["relentlessli","stupid","nobudget","war","pictur","make","mainli","show","attribut","spectacular","ev","meyernot","bad","idea","itselfbut","embarrass","everyon","connect","laughabl","script","perform","pass","muster","elementaryschool","christma","pageant","inept","action","scene","confus","direct","normal","compet","documentari","director","loui","clyd","stoumenwho","appar","quit","sure","make","comedi","philosoph","treatis","futil","war","leer","ta","earli","standard","anywai","travelogu","ev","meyer","magnific","bodyand","gener","air","shoddi","incompet","worth","see","order","watch","ev","meyer","strut","stuff","pretti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,9,19,28,58,77,78,102,105,119,120,123,127,129,136,219,225,246,266,308,311,314,361,386,427,439,487,552,557,616,624,679,700,748,767,1211,1360,1414,1900,2560,2775,2788,2829,2835,2878,3120,3276,3506,4791,5284,5360,5372,5730,6087,6730],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,9,19,28,58,77,78,102,105,119,120,123,127,129,136,219,225,246,266,308,311,314,361,386,427,439,487,552,557,616,624,679,700,748,767,1211,1360,1414,1900,2560,2775,2788,2829,2835,2878,3120,3276,3506,4791,5284,5360,5372,5730,6087,6730],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.312380678011735,1.5452294193519092,1.865701314626681,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2619070973220485,2.4359679371086367,2.4106958340079214,2.346825985579986,2.5792094178355414,2.641219492619754,2.673149229007135,2.747702973022204,2.8753661172782943,2.9203338091782562,6.378794038853654,3.0399731661399314,3.0433232530252132,3.233054746047873,3.2872346624216657,3.3220965805878846,3.424750734647968,3.43462735814388,3.5173618574831282,3.9241755834625858,3.6715125373103863,3.616452760127359,4.246178114249808,3.79165684915245,4.274508620876034,4.396611317676934,4.449957298382227,4.828393734102471,5.1994574154933035,16.22463668806624,5.604922523601468,5.322690055917252,5.501738287366237,5.463272006538442,5.463272006538442,12.275454108172468,5.604922523601468,6.0662680901040895,6.489124940924123,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.395982887893415E-5,5.359596513802529E-5,5.401262266058669E-5,5.370053715143808E-5,5.370141697427925E-5,5.3626353124942825E-5,5.3785845412883824E-5,5.360368260679864E-5,0.03999174908808567,0.19766751951583258,0.31037591544551774,5.3517154444764685E-5,5.451602559347592E-5,0.020516261369914277,5.355617859550021E-5,5.340817242517755E-5,5.474037247818158E-5,0.03929843556296637,5.362399873024402E-5,5.3668443491006765E-5,5.4187717158957235E-5,0.05942160370307286,5.390548766077683E-5,5.396356477773961E-5,5.437770741379488E-5,5.4093327312516946E-5,5.636730803051732E-5,5.353306460408426E-5,5.35344967389303E-5,5.367012608367996E-5,5.481087204927608E-5,5.378776801817021E-5,0.020391155416195624,5.393906507232776E-5,5.359133293746067E-5,5.383869226673745E-5,5.353763308261972E-5,5.356926988475693E-5,5.3407904098201054E-5,5.342176057254058E-5,5.3542006463082406E-5,5.4106761179032606E-5,5.38318219881093

{"value":"You might be tempted to rent this film because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most pointless films ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. Even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it. Its a wonder that it was ever put on video.<br /><br />I wonder what sort of contract caused Sellers to be in this film. I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films. Surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it, and a waste of anyone's time watching it.

{"value":"i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging. the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary. then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on. zero special effects...and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet. the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie. the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a \"cult classic\"...however, i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made. the real horror in this film is how bad it is. i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film

{"value":"This movie has a very Broadway feel - the backdrop, the acting, the 'noise'- and yet that's all it has. Some 'sense' of a Broadway without the bang. <br /><br />The movie is slow-paced, the picture disjointed, the singing 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical. <br /><br />Disappointing: Sinatra <br /><br />Intolerable: Sinatra's fiancé---surely, the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary. <br /><br />Tolerable: Mr \"i remember the numbers on my dice\" <br /><br />Delight: Brando's understated singing (very biased!)<br /><br />Surprise: how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her Havana scenes.

{"value":"How unfortunate, to have so many of my \"a\" list, and good \"b\" list actors agree to do this movie, but they did, and that is what sucked me into watching it. I had never heard of this movie, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background how bad can it be? In a word Very! This movie starts o.k. has some twists and turns, then just lays an egg. The ending was so weak, it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending. How ironic a for a movie titled \"The end game\" to have such a poor one. These are the types of movies that can move \"a\" list actors to the \"b\" list in hurry. I hope Cuba Gooding JR, and James Woods don't make a habit of this.","finished_norm":["how","unfortun","to","have","so","mani","of","my","a","list","and","good","b","list","actor","agre","to","do","thi","movi","but","thei","do","and","that","be","what","suck","me","into","watch","it","i","have","never","hear","of","thi","movi","but","there","be","cuba","good","jr","right","on","the","dvd","cover","and","jame","wood","in","the","background","how","bad","can","it","be","in","a","word","veri","thi","movi","start","okai","have","some","twist","and","turn","then","just","lai","a","egg","the","end","be","so","weak","it","be","a","if","the","writer","get","call","awai","and","hi","year","old","son","sit","down","at","the","typ","writer","and","hack","out","the","end","how","iron","a","for","a","movi","titl","the","end","game","to","have","such","a","poor","on","thi","be","the","typ","of","movi","that","can","move","a","list","actor","to","the","b","list","in","hurri","i","hope","cuba","good","jr","and","jame","wood","do","not","make","a","habit","of","thi"],"filtered":["unfortun","mani","list","good","b","list","actor","agre","thi","movi","thei","suck","watch","never","hear","thi","movi","cuba","good","jr","right","dvd","cover","jame","wood","background","bad","word","veri","thi","movi","start","okai","twist","turn","lai","egg","end","weak","writer","get","call","awai","hi","year","old","son","sit","typ","writer","hack","end","iron","movi","titl","end","game","poor","thi","typ","movi","move","list","actor","b","list","hurri","hope","cuba","good","jr","jame","wood","make","habit","thi"],"filtered2":["unfortun","mani","list","good","b","list","actor","agre","suck","watch","never","hear","cuba","good","jr","right","dvd","cover","jame","wood","background","bad","word","veri","start","okai","twist","turn","lai","egg","end","weak","writer","get","call","awai","year","old","son","sit","typ","writer","hack","end","iron","titl","end","game","poor","typ","move","list","actor","b","list","hurri","hope","cuba","good","jr","jame","wood","make","habit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,9,15,24,41,42,50,57,67,71,96,121,142,146,155,181,191,216,227,244,247,258,264,275,287,374,379,384,421,434,435,491,602,620,622,642,655,801,1246,1706,1845,1902,3360,3578,3719,4913],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,9,15,24,41,42,50,57,67,71,96,121,142,146,155,181,191,216,227,244,247,258,264,275,287,374,379,384,421,434,435,491,602,620,622,642,655,801,1246,1706,1845,1902,3360,3578,3719,4913],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,3.9631084698357775,3.1375198335242067,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,1.9214926742550966,2.0390708128715254,2.2190595059394194,2.2844323215331563,2.326138445979858,2.3074766467914385,2.4442286541160034,2.5460113484259455,2.6070186965339692,2.6005321873043625,2.634508058031767,2.7303758068497004,2.7061321952397077,2.757740698455715,2.7832848715031413,5.68378037616381,3.4572130107926293,3.1272886331425473,6.218409915418504,3.2597778161886266,3.4101163271295305,3.2829611516442836,3.369778711402955,14.223312553243696,7.513620235644563,3.4933926673701317,7.244845854227726,7.459562890868725,3.7881170224473255,4.315570107673808,4.671389985292807,9.845408827147427,4.85885294158718,5.604922523601468,5.7446844659766265,12.202718819830718,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.585097034779139E-5,6.540692186003609E-5,6.591539830878344E-5,6.553453843513503E-5,6.553561214476363E-5,6.544400645550293E-5,6.563864610025549E-5,6.541634002940231E-5,6.556341980887275E-5,7.273903531187516E-5,0.9947885056058148,6.531074363388498E-5,6.652973627640478E-5,6.747879758336773E-5,6.535836754682768E-5,6.51777452184086E-5,6.680352254221221E-5,6.56447959459338E-5,6.544113322223443E-5,6.549537228644029E-5,6.61290784271198E-5,6.570983332746372E-5,6.578465394131114E-5,6.585552952758443E-5,6.63609368836348E-5,6.601388786576686E-5,6.878898630368931E-5,6.53301599191355E-5,6.533190765390856E-5,6.549742567249678E-5,6.688955812205239E-5,6.56409923905669E-5,7.046004476983808E-5,6.58256308157441E-5,6.540126886023303E-5,6.570313882898332E-5,6.533573515446932E-5,6.537434376688932E-5,6.517741776014679E-5,6.519432778932616E-5,6.534107229791753E-5,6.603028215692676E-5,6.569475454527409E-5,6.543501585004988E-5,6.623011990543228E-5,6.546013016670111E-5,6.763504522981521E-5,6.664045217522603E-5,6.521053214382173E-5,6.535465140775731E-5,6.533198395240145E-5,6.717067156650665E-5,6.535562376037716E-5,6.518854002278037E-5,6.59040775415185E-5,6.537245763409861E-5,7.030089356654275E-5,6.53185822346766E-5,6.520977802142758E-5,6.55211355724104E-5,6.617105017073115E-5,6.55168009766019E-5,6.519771406670905E-5,6.534951695840703E-5,6.517820609255206E-5,6.6686

{"value":"There is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie. Is it the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that we're supposed to be pulling for? Well, let's see -- we learn he's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities. He treats his coworkers like cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process, getting one of them killed), jeopardizes the safety of his kids, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, tries to strong-arm the police and school administrators -- and all this for what?

{"value":"This movie was terrible. at first i just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so i watched it. The acting was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were almost camera shy. everything seemed fake. i feel bad for Edward Furlong, terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago.. I've watched it at least 20 times....<br /><br />the plot was also crap. the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines.<br /><br />on the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was.<br /><br />i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL,

{"value":"Here's why the Jane Show won't work. Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. I guess these people don't watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it. The characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: Forklift races??? give me freaking break. Here's a little advice for the writers of the show, Don't write funny situations, find the funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.","finished_norm":["here","why","the","jane","show","wo","not","work","onc","again","canadian","bonehead","produc","and","writer","ca","not","creat","a","sitcom","without","putt","some","kind","of","differ","spin","on","it","i","guess","thi","peopl","do","not","watch","a","lot","of","tv","from","the","u","which","have","the","sitcom","model","down","pat","no","here","we","have","to","do","someth","differ","we","have","to","make","the","a","stori","absolut","absurd","and","then","have","a","meaning","b","stori","to","try","to","make","up","for","it","the","charact","be","two","dimension","and","the","stori","line","be","wai","over","the","top","forklift","race","give","me","freak","break","here","a","littl","advic","for","the","writer","of","the","show","do","not","write","funni","situat","find","the","funni","in","situat","and","rememb","you","have","to","be","bear","with","a","sens","of","humor","to","write","truli","funni","stuff","not","just","be","a","improv","monkei"],"filtered":["jane","show","wo","work","onc","canadian","bonehead","produc","writer","ca","creat","sitcom","without","putt","kind","differ","spin","guess","thi","peopl","watch","lot","tv","u","sitcom","model","pat","someth","differ","make","stori","absolut","absurd","meaning","b","stori","try","make","charact","two","dimension","stori","line","wai","top","forklift","race","give","freak","break","littl","advic","writer","show","write","funni","situat","find","funni","situat","rememb","bear","sens","humor","write","truli","funni","stuff","improv","monkei"],"filtered2":["jane","show","wo","work","onc","canadian","bonehead","produc","writer","ca","creat","sitcom","without","putt","kind","differ","spin","guess","peopl","watch","lot","tv","u","sitcom","model","pat","someth","differ","make","stori","absolut","absurd","meaning","b","stori","try","make","charact","two","dimension","stori","line","wai","top","forklift","race","give","freak","break","littl","advic","writer","show","write","funni","situat","find","funni","situat","rememb","bear","sens","humor","write","truli","funni","stuff","improv","monkei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,10,14,17,23,28,30,33,36,38,47,48,53,62,65,72,81,107,112,122,125,172,173,204,222,236,243,261,287,290,343,360,361,362,364,369,406,473,525,642,928,1067,1102,1116,1123,1213,1283,1314,1583,1808,1869,1884,2182,2524,2604],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,10,14,17,23,28,30,33,36,38,47,48,53,62,65,72,81,107,112,122,125,172,173,204,222,236,243,261,287,290,343,360,361,362,364,369,406,473,525,642,928,1067,1102,1116,1123,1213,1283,1314,1583,1808,1869,1884,2182,2524,2604],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,3.83116108203179,1.364847727375781,3.0904588387038183,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,6.06783613352078,3.8147700134888347,1.9209463754160525,1.949757232424728,2.1439533986393955,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.2242236634876535,2.5001408943598484,2.4368824319140248,5.249049228095168,2.5771019354959765,2.617923930016232,2.627841366673578,2.7085302779237206,5.68378037616381,2.8612813773965557,2.9705344631698933,3.028335462059722,3.0399731661399314,3.058539100262467,2.9878441007049847,3.121829110937649,3.121829110937649,6.670979275848646,3.4149707055943286,3.622422927113863,4.017463517886143,4.74221603786142,4.390138803171316,4.181290492043933,4.390138803171316,4.251780369798478,4.3773181147422555,4.409683399244287,4.933754249760298,4.770124825978496,10.0054942424945,5.156897801074508,5.426230734858092,5.2288713006995975,5.214056214914456]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.61078249283284E-5,6.566204441008884E-5,6.617250419339095E-5,6.579015875920224E-5,6.579123665688207E-5,6.569927365563696E-5,6.589467250080896E-5,6.567149931543525E-5,6.581915278599729E-5,7.302275709008166E-5,0.92836756935391,6.556549103657386E-5,6.678923841303634E-5,6.77420015750003E-5,6.561330070866509E-5,6.543197385498E-5,6.706409259410896E-5,6.590084633422844E-5,0.022302471433608216,6.575083984123714E-5,6.638701778034402E-5,6.596613739690025E-5,6.604124985181369E-5,6.611240189140098E-5,6.661978061087625E-5,6.627137791318493E-5,6.905730074354164E-5,6.558498305589142E-5,6.558673760778016E-5,6.575290123661544E-5,6.715046375947892E-5,6.589702794292802E-5,7.073487724608546E-5,6.608238655833171E-5,6.565636936051362E-5,6.595941678623668E-5,6.559058003767371E-5,6.562933924466955E-5,6.543164511945297E-5,6.544862110693833E-5,6.559593799888261E-5,6.628783615099219E-5,6.595099979926335E-5,6.56902479819354E-5,6.648845337534746E-5,6.571546025807356E-5,6.78988586722042E-5,6.690038616404748E-5,6.546488866722501E-5,6.560957007463228E-5,6.5

{"value":"There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion.

{"value":"Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry, I'll not recommend this one to anyone.","finished_norm":["baba","rajinikanth","will","never","forget","thi","name","in","hi","life","thi","be","the","movi","which","caus","hi","downfal","it","be","releas","with","much","hyp","but","crash","badli","and","lai","to","sever","financi","loss","for","it","produc","and","distributor","rajinikanth","have","to","person","repai","them","for","the","loss","incur","soon","after","it","releas","he","try","ventur","into","polit","but","fail","miser","it","a","veri","bad","movi","with","horribl","act","badqual","makeup","and","pathet","screenplai","throughout","the","movi","rajinikanth","look","like","a","person","suffer","from","some","diseas","i","be","on","of","the","unfortun","soul","who","see","baba","dai","show","in","theatr","the","audienc","be","so","bore","that","much","of","them","leav","the","theatr","befor","the","intermiss","sorri","i","will","not","recommend","thi","on","to","anyon"],"filtered":["baba","rajinikanth","never","forget","thi","name","hi","life","thi","movi","caus","hi","downfal","releas","much","hyp","crash","badli","lai","sever","financi","loss","produc","distributor","rajinikanth","person","repai","loss","incur","soon","releas","try","ventur","polit","fail","miser","veri","bad","movi","horribl","act","badqual","makeup","pathet","screenplai","throughout","movi","rajinikanth","look","like","person","suffer","diseas","unfortun","soul","see","baba","dai","show","theatr","audienc","bore","much","leav","theatr","befor","intermiss","sorri","recommend","thi","anyon"],"filtered2":["baba","rajinikanth","never","forget","name","life","caus","downfal","releas","hyp","crash","badli","lai","sever","financi","loss","produc","distributor","rajinikanth","person","repai","loss","incur","soon","releas","try","ventur","polit","fail","miser","veri","bad","horribl","act","badqual","makeup","pathet","screenplai","throughout","rajinikanth","look","like","person","suffer","diseas","unfortun","soul","see","baba","dai","show","theatr","audienc","bore","leav","theatr","befor","intermiss","sorri","recommend","anyon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,15,16,21,28,36,42,74,75,79,108,132,143,153,158,168,215,227,230,261,298,316,327,373,437,438,448,449,453,575,601,633,703,960,1007,1118,1183,1330,1598,1600,1706,2607,2909,3396,4693,5968],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,15,16,21,28,36,42,74,75,79,108,132,143,153,158,168,215,227,230,261,298,316,327,373,437,438,448,449,453,575,601,633,703,960,1007,1118,1183,1330,1598,1600,1706,2607,2909,3396,4693,5968],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.138507503627933,2.253494045787767,2.3409902041158843,4.681980408231769,2.3106972614914807,2.4894767118610357,2.605934685587711,2.6005321873043625,2.7121382192999195,2.7085302779237206,2.7819920465008363,2.878207028279898,5.934838391705887,3.0316467233633775,3.1952392950510555,3.1797351085150902,3.2681460658591432,3.2597778161886266,3.2872346624216657,3.6314455447135003,3.506637894120152,3.550241531602284,3.6746621462132825,4.058285512406398,4.181290492043933,8.69193516971636,4.315570107673808,4.370968887063596,9.325758591249796,4.662879295624898,4.671389985292807,5.3064295350454715,5.408212229355414,5.583416318380505,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.606155600799175E-5,7.554865515408966E-5,7.613597390855716E-5,7.569605944020981E-5,7.56972996349195E-5,7.559148993724072E-5,7.581630961966197E-5,7.555953366678215E-5,7.572941904318206E-5,0.342022861218339,0.44876195516925477,7.543756392040692E-5,7.684556864171409E-5,7.79417875641282E-5,7.549257220506057E-5,7.528394330746373E-5,7.716180710078229E-5,7.582341303558782E-5,7.558817119201917E-5,7.565082034658936E-5,7.638278640354084E-5,7.589853485097984E-5,7.59849568472033E-5,7.606682211580076E-5,7.66505958964458E-5,0.046890186807140875,7.945512885895579E-5,7.545999081647616E-5,7.546200954794856E-5,7.565319212239944E-5,7.726118301035708E-5,7.581901971627848E-5,8.138529490577801E-5,7.60322874303861E-5,7.5542125622955E-5,7.589080233058685E-5,7.546643052529688E-5,7.551102563331829E-5,7.52835650748456E-5,7.530309710489362E-5,7.547259522466524E-5,7.626867118247454E-5,7.588111801368812E-5,7.558110528479594E-5,7.649949496563501E-5,7.561011372601528E-5,7.812226233995332E-5,7.69734517009111E-5,7.532181404118974E-5,7.548827985646582E-5,7.546209767697778E-5,7.758588477081753E-5,7.54894029781581E-5,7.529641191062906E-5,7.612289778881546E-5,7.550884704439027E-5,0.15654689798381866,7.544661794299743E-5,7.53209429876211E-5,7.568057838369065E-5,7.643126611630116E-5,7.567557168295232E-5,7.530700844477906E-5,7.548234928012406E

{"value":"The complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps, like Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.","finished_norm":["the","complaint","be","valid","to","me","the","big","problem","be","that","thi","soap","opu","be","too","aim","for","woman","i","be","okai","with","thi","night","time","soap","like","grei","anatomi","or","ugli","betti","or","west","wing","becaus","there","be","stori","that","be","interest","even","with","the","give","that","thei","will","never","end","howev","when","the","idea","parallel","the","daytim","soap","aim","at","just","putt","hunki","man","taye","digg","tim","dali","and","chri","lowel","into","sexual","tension","and","romp","and","numer","ridicul","difficult","situat","in","a","socal","littl","hospit","it","seem","like","gener","hospitalor","a","femal","counterpart","to","baywatch","that","be","what","man","want","and","thei","have","it","so","if","thi","be","what","woman","want","so","be","it","but","the","idea","that","thi","be","a","high","brow","show","or","someth","man","will","watch","be","unrealist"],"filtered":["complaint","valid","big","problem","thi","soap","opu","aim","woman","okai","thi","night","time","soap","like","grei","anatomi","ugli","betti","west","wing","becaus","stori","interest","even","give","thei","never","end","howev","idea","parallel","daytim","soap","aim","putt","hunki","man","taye","digg","tim","dali","chri","lowel","sexual","tension","romp","numer","ridicul","difficult","situat","socal","littl","hospit","seem","like","gener","hospitalor","femal","counterpart","baywatch","man","want","thei","thi","woman","want","idea","thi","high","brow","show","someth","man","watch","unrealist"],"filtered2":["complaint","valid","big","problem","soap","opu","aim","woman","okai","night","time","soap","like","grei","anatomi","ugli","betti","west","wing","becaus","stori","interest","even","give","never","end","howev","idea","parallel","daytim","soap","aim","putt","hunki","man","taye","digg","tim","dali","chri","lowel","sexual","tension","romp","numer","ridicul","difficult","situat","socal","littl","hospit","seem","like","gener","hospitalor","femal","counterpart","baywatch","man","want","woman","want","idea","high","brow","show","someth","man","watch","unrealist"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,14,17,22,24,28,30,35,37,42,45,53,60,70,82,113,123,167,191,210,211,225,274,422,473,519,803,886,895,1090,1140,1143,1200,1205,1213,1264,1343,1445,1592,1785,2220,2497,2561,2934,3129,3846,4493,5129,5583,5587,6580,6729],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,14,17,22,24,28,30,35,37,42,45,53,60,70,82,113,123,167,191,210,211,225,274,422,473,519,803,886,895,1090,1140,1143,1200,1205,1213,1264,1343,1445,1592,1785,2220,2497,2561,2934,3129,3846,4493,5129,5583,5587,6580,6729],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,2.975308642954861,1.6219954307453837,5.44888831938665,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,4.189351572503368,2.020196584395323,2.1521782565202803,4.523814194644097,2.4609576687888097,2.5460113484259455,2.687151791517189,2.5687161421197025,2.641219492619754,2.748952192422636,3.2090054908152035,3.335489637924323,3.5614461306151473,3.7636829971100436,3.944626193933877,3.9954846111673676,4.339813719283801,4.558366596889411,4.436351646326448,4.499089986959872,8.679627438567602,4.251780369798478,4.327618446189983,13.562727103063533,4.798834931860927,4.589376833631972,4.770124825978496,5.185068678041204,5.878215858601149,5.290429193699031,5.695894301807195,5.482320201509136,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.814082267801302E-5,5.774876551848042E-5,5.8197707104100606E-5,5.786144013245217E-5,5.7862388127004036E-5,5.7781508071517015E-5,0.03490227364140205,0.07749305489079196,5.7886939936332266E-5,0.301336584933353,0.3710962278084036,5.766384830066869E-5,5.8740115433867024E-5,5.957805608785082E-5,5.7705896177306054E-5,5.754642197802183E-5,5.8981845489596104E-5,5.7958788164689414E-5,5.777897125019009E-5,5.7826859744430343E-5,5.8386368528592855E-5,5.80162106574333E-5,5.8082270914698875E-5,5.814484804715344E-5,5.8591079884180165E-5,5.8284665031037244E-5,6.073484162435286E-5,5.768099123405074E-5,5.768253433564807E-5,5.7828672710191794E-5,5.905780761080812E-5,5.7955429947840605E-5,6.2210244544793E-5,5.811845001999866E-5,5.7743774399026715E-5,5.801029998296622E-5,5.768591369407252E-5,5.772000182484265E-5,5.7546132860144985E-5,5.756106298194586E-5,5.769062593914941E-5,5.829913979990131E-5,5.800289737143527E-5,5.7773570129302144E-5,5.847557958566102E-5,5.779574394121997E-5,5.9716009509918585E-5,5.8837868183856965E-5,5

{"value":"This would have to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've ever nearly seen. (I couldn't watch it all the way through). Purely and simply it's gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming. Sick. And only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation. After murdering several hundred men, women and children, Seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts. He's sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives! Buried alive, he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch.

{"value":"I am a big movie fan. I like movies of all types. This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />I get that it follows the book closely, which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once.<br /><br />These characters are not quirky, they are mentally ill. The things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially considering they are supposed to be true.<br /><br />This movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated, only Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny.<br /><br />I will never get those hours back.

It was a very average movie, that had great potential, and was nicely directed but let down by a confusing story without strong points, beginning middle and end, with poor acting expect from the serial killer guy, who although he seemed overzealous at some points delivered the best performance of the cast overall. It was nice cinematography, with good colours, cool hi-tec stuff, beautiful scenics but leaves you lost about where it's going and where it has just been. And with a feeling of let's just quickly wrap it up in the end. OK to watch if there's nothing else on TV.","finished_norm":["be","it","a","thriller","a","i","think","when","i","see","the","cover","at","the","video","librari","no","be","it","a","food","fr","think","a","the","author","be","mayb","try","to","make","it","not","realli","so","what","be","it","it","be","a","veri","averag","movi","that","have","great","potenti","and","be","nice","direct","but","let","down","by","a","confus","stori","without","strong","point","begin","middl","and","end","with","poor","act","expect","from","the","serial","killer","gui","who","although","he","seem","overzeal","at","some","point","deliv","the","well","perform","of","the","cast","overal","it","be","nice","cinematographi","with","good","colour","cool","hitec","stuff","beauti","scenic","but","leav","you","lose","about","where","it","go","and","where","it","have","just","be","and","with","a","feel","of","let","just","quickli","wrap","it","up","in","the","end","okai","to","watch","if","there","noth","els","on","tv"],"filtered":["thriller","think","see","cover","video","librari","food","fr","think","author","mayb","try","make","realli","veri","averag","movi","great","potenti","nice","direct","let","confus","stori","without","strong","point","begin","middl","end","poor","act","expect","serial","killer","gui","although","seem","overzeal","point","deliv","well","perform","cast","overal","nice","cinematographi","good","colour","cool","hitec","stuff","beauti","scenic","leav","lose","go","feel","let","quickli","wrap","end","okai","watch","noth","els","tv"],"filtered2":["thriller","think","see","cover","video","librari","food","fr","think","author","mayb","try","make","realli","veri","averag","great","potenti","nice","direct","let","confus","stori","without","strong","point","begin","middl","end","poor","act","expect","serial","killer","gui","although","seem","overzeal","point","deliv","well","perform","cast","overal","nice","cinematographi","good","colour","cool","hitec","stuff","beauti","scenic","leav","lose","go","feel","let","quickli","wrap","end","okai","watch","noth","els","tv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,12,13,15,17,20,21,24,35,36,43,49,51,55,66,74,92,102,105,124,125,130,146,147,163,172,191,196,221,237,240,252,262,325,361,412,427,481,491,517,547,554,629,631,643,714,771,1112,1133,1390,1988,2321,2902,8609],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,12,13,15,17,20,21,24,35,36,43,49,51,55,66,74,92,102,105,124,125,130,146,147,163,172,191,196,221,237,240,252,262,325,361,412,427,481,491,517,547,554,629,631,643,714,771,1112,1133,1390,1988,2321,2902,8609],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.9536997889255368,3.859446346783224,1.9486336368009016,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,4.464786073617769,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,2.326138445979858,2.2844323215331563,2.4000574358028657,2.5001408943598484,2.5460113484259455,2.478925055209576,2.6423424573643777,2.640097787510554,2.7666071276613566,3.0433232530252132,5.453403166975632,2.973659465713028,3.0399731661399314,3.107414446935464,3.233054746047873,3.353630724994973,3.369778711402955,3.4198487640477615,3.432149042129413,3.439602492783994,3.488143311483988,3.607563812710113,3.5813614403160887,3.7297814454343623,3.7264536553416874,4.2574141875167335,4.403125998698128,4.456830177669989,4.911775343041523,5.214056214914456,5.390512652256013,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.68298831576788E-5,7.631180129418614E-5,7.690505278219554E-5,7.646069456792304E-5,7.646194729031841E-5,7.635506876802319E-5,7.658215944087448E-5,7.632278969493627E-5,7.649439114912729E-5,8.486635131567318E-5,0.8802334846854474,7.619958788505222E-5,7.762181540577405E-5,7.872910765884686E-5,7.625515182963154E-5,7.604441549097452E-5,7.79412483116381E-5,7.65893346111477E-5,7.635171649887457E-5,7.64149984967481E-5,7.715435842550186E-5,7.666521526100656E-5,7.675251023918716E-5,7.683520246047638E-5,7.742487316551379E-5,7.701996287562808E-5,8.025773579849571E-5,7.622224132385919E-5,7.622428044731775E-5,7.641739423078152E-5,7.804162805565118E-5,7.658489691322347E-5,8.220739919792299E-5,7.68003189268682E-5,7.6305205805736E-5,7.665740463143903E-5,7.62287460826655E-5,7.627379166309419E-5,7.604403343768264E-5,7.60637627683088E-5,7.623497305404278E-5,7.703909048252006E-5,7.664762248951554E-5,7.634457921619386E-5,7.727224590585071E-5,7.637388068288005E-5,7.891140548007595E-5,0.056122314520756125,7.608266877160631E-5,7.625081612236608E-5,7.622436946657233E-5,7.

{"value":"This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Bad everything. Why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns. It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner, or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worth messing with. For the most part the main action of Shiloh Falls was taking place in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s models. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene the Marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity.
