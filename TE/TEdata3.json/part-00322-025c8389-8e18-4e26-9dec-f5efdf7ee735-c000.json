{"value":"I actually went to see this film in a theater, but what a complete waste of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay.<br /><br />Some friends told me to go and see this film, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the screenplay. They had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect. Well maybe I had my hopes up a bit too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweetish to a point that I actually left I had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.","finished_norm":["i","actual","go","to","see","thi","film","in","a","theater","but","what","a","complet","wast","of","time","and","monei","bad","act","i","be","sorri","to","sai","do","not","help","to","enjoi","thi","rather","sticki","screenplaybr","br","some","friend","tell","me","to","go","and","see","thi","film","sinc","jame","redfield","the","author","of","the","book","be","veri","heavili","involv","in","the","screenplai","thei","have","realli","enjoi","the","book","so","the","movi","just","have","to","be","perfect","good","mayb","i","have","my","hope","up","a","bite","too","high","but","i","absolut","hate","thi","movi","it","be","predict","too","sweetish","to","a","point","that","i","actual","leav","i","have","to","vomit","and","wrong","of","all","there","be","go","to","be","a","sequel","do","the","world","a","favor","and","stop","thi","abomin","crusad"],"filtered":["actual","go","see","thi","film","theater","complet","wast","time","monei","bad","act","sorri","sai","help","enjoi","thi","rather","sticki","screenplaybr","br","friend","tell","go","see","thi","film","sinc","jame","redfield","author","book","veri","heavili","involv","screenplai","thei","realli","enjoi","book","movi","perfect","good","mayb","hope","bite","high","absolut","hate","thi","movi","predict","sweetish","point","actual","leav","vomit","wrong","go","sequel","world","favor","stop","thi","abomin","crusad"],"filtered2":["actual","go","see","theater","complet","wast","time","monei","bad","act","sorri","help","enjoi","rather","sticki","screenplaybr","friend","tell","go","see","sinc","jame","redfield","author","book","veri","heavili","involv","screenplai","realli","enjoi","book","perfect","good","mayb","hope","bite","high","absolut","hate","predict","sweetish","point","actual","leav","vomit","wrong","go","sequel","world","favor","stop","abomin","crusad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,9,13,15,21,25,52,66,74,89,90,103,126,151,154,160,161,162,163,165,181,185,200,211,222,241,315,337,339,387,424,437,620,677,703,1110,1111,2098,2616,2913,6147,8559],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,9,13,15,21,25,52,66,74,89,90,103,126,151,154,160,161,162,163,165,181,185,200,211,222,241,315,337,339,387,424,437,620,677,703,1110,1111,2098,2616,2913,6147,8559],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,2.912480743411154,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,3.4244306149452273,1.929723173391612,1.9486336368009016,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.098582041218749,2.2391270689902285,5.6004909736203725,2.348499626138016,2.3722295531801256,2.4323182980210873,2.3586007221245198,2.4000574358028657,2.448847599972298,2.4442286541160034,2.518833027372001,5.061642365863941,2.5687161421197025,2.5771019354959765,2.6627744961815836,2.854312708080462,2.973659465713028,3.003844442051426,3.360519385990158,3.212973749990824,3.1952392950510555,3.7568101178222815,3.6559115968679063,3.6746621462132825,4.1554492608600455,4.2574141875167335,4.944927550358424,5.2288713006995975,5.444579873526289,6.489124940924123,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4,2.3612500142009964E-4,2.3610099510202473E-4,2.360772525389538E-4,2.3629070374590536E-4,2.3613656901327567E-4,2.3624390791467605E-4,2.3631323951260914E-4,2.3620602879437978E-4,2.361497096615575E-4,2.3610130461469635E-4,2.361617036906907E-4,2.361011774476095E-4,2.361135676555683E-4,2

{"value":"DeNiro is a master...one of my favourites. And I love GOOD sports movies {not into baseball so much, but hey, its sports movies, right?. I was expecting MUCH more for this movie. It seems to start out well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {whom I don't really like} is very good as the spoiled star. Barkin's role, to me, was OK. She's a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. To me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, and then it drags a bit in places. It just seemed tio me to be so uneven! Considering the cast and the plot, it could have been so much better.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this film, but the story is ridicules.

{"value":"Columbo movies have been going downhill for years, this year it may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie. As is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady's man. (His faint, though, was a hoot!)The script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising. They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterisations.","finished_norm":["columbo","movi","have","be","go","downhil","for","year","thi","year","it","mai","have","reach","the","bottom","peter","falk","give","the","same","uninspir","perform","and","come","over","a","creepi","in","thi","movi","a","be","usual","in","thi","seri","crime","scene","protocol","be","unheard","of","so","plausibl","be","alwai","lack","brenda","vaccaro","chew","the","sceneri","and","pull","pantomim","face","and","andrew","stephen","be","a","pretti","unconvinc","ladi","man","hi","faint","though","be","a","hootth","script","be","by","the","number","and","it","deliveri","patronis","thei","should","never","have","bring","columbo","into","the","nineti","just","leav","u","all","with","on","or","two","happi","memori","of","clever","plot","well","script","and","sharp","characteris"],"filtered":["columbo","movi","go","downhil","year","thi","year","mai","reach","bottom","peter","falk","give","uninspir","perform","come","creepi","thi","movi","usual","thi","seri","crime","scene","protocol","unheard","plausibl","alwai","lack","brenda","vaccaro","chew","sceneri","pull","pantomim","face","andrew","stephen","pretti","unconvinc","ladi","man","hi","faint","though","hootth","script","number","deliveri","patronis","thei","never","bring","columbo","nineti","leav","u","two","happi","memori","clever","plot","well","script","sharp","characteris"],"filtered2":["columbo","go","downhil","year","year","mai","reach","bottom","peter","falk","give","uninspir","perform","come","creepi","usual","crime","scene","protocol","unheard","plausibl","alwai","lack","brenda","vaccaro","chew","sceneri","pull","pantomim","face","andrew","stephen","pretti","unconvinc","ladi","man","faint","though","hootth","script","number","deliveri","patronis","never","bring","columbo","nineti","leav","u","two","happi","memori","clever","plot","well","script","sharp","characteris"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,19,20,30,32,34,42,45,46,47,57,74,77,78,86,105,112,183,197,250,251,265,472,544,605,753,755,760,860,934,955,1068,1138,1347,1384,1399,1549,2113,2408,2526,2559,2624,2705,2815,3353,3640,3798,3982,4712,6736],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,19,20,30,32,34,42,45,46,47,57,74,77,78,86,105,112,183,197,250,251,265,472,544,605,753,755,760,860,934,955,1068,1138,1347,1384,1399,1549,2113,2408,2526,2559,2624,2705,2815,3353,3640,3798,3982,4712,6736],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,3.668325173349496,1.9486336368009016,3.8927804517536475,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,2.1765612129984904,2.2466628996789315,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.6812935439488212,2.6942272927333892,2.73529586597515,3.4222967456864013,3.4222967456864013,3.5474598886404074,3.8690435127678695,3.79165684915245,3.850067611308864,3.8538340941043407,3.9405024767500145,4.017463517886143,4.1554492608600455,4.224077767249142,4.566029469634981,4.520909034354511,4.436351646326448,4.528289141652134,5.00274712124725,5.102830579804232,5.143104478942172,5.259176650194926,5.463272006538442,5.259176650194926,12.685042933464494,5.583416318380505,6.1754673820690815,5.7446844659766265,5.999576715605417,6.101359409915359,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255696E-4,2.2737792632708255E-4,2.2743406769354586E-4,2.273883461709774E-4,2.274098657807242E-4,2.2737667263379269E-4,2.2744738993572312E-4,2.2734284269338722E-4,2.2737797438108283E-4,2.2761294487884268E-4,2.2941898734736606E-4,2.273783499506982E-4,2.2759369161694284E-4,2.2761740295299313E-4,2.2751400231007003E-4,2.2738924182076194E-4,2.2746747251417893E-4,2.2757451948007183E-4,2.274009809468851E-4,2.2740014954633682E-4,2.2760473054921055E-4,2.2742293271974E-4,2.2742327690463958E-4,2.275689666908075E-4,2.2740106297614496E-4,2.2762012354277277E-4,2.2745796921172078E-4,2.2737741672596972E-4,2.2748049992975602E-4,2.275499302573927E-4,2.274240482660326E-4,2.2754585163377137E-4,2.2765757096628232E-4,2.2786887249241978E-4,2.2745757615795525E-4,2.2738910390558212E-4,2.2747109051910806E-4,2.2741219739254244E-4,2.2734308533973002E-4,2.2740091052450185E-4,2.2762880509736249E-4,2.2750393636919385E-4,2.27546370171562E-4,2.27354400179711E-4,2.2740096834679272E-4,2.273890183985971E-4,2.2746598751966312E-4,2.2750543040620793E-4,2.274591684625192E-4,2.2742311578245454E-4,2.2738958071416687E-4,2.2785546503755464E-4,2.2744679848279357E-4,2.274009162267795E-4,2.274455804209462E-4,2.2737764936397713E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441365E-4,2.2738989994003426E-4,2.2737751957101633E-4,2.2755942704103573E-4,2.27468078982615E-4,2.2737742452124288E-4,2.2735430755038726E-4,2.273314445633671E-4,2.2753698817546116E

{"value":"This mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions. For all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work. a F- in my opinion. I have one question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad acting 5) bad directing and last but not least a bad script. I mean I am not like grumping about every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched it. This movie should be banned into a box, locked and sunk down into the sea.

{"value":"Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom Queen Mary Lou in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later for revenge.The best actor in this movie is Micheal Ironside and the movie stars other OK actors and actress like Justin Louis (I),Wendy Lyon,Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette(I).And there are some good gore scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students are on the computer and Mary Lou electrocutes him to death.Over all this is an OK/good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.","finished_norm":["prom","night","be","a","okai","horror","movi","but","prom","night","be","wai","well","and","thi","movi","about","how","the","prom","queen","mari","lou","in","get","kill","by","her","boyfriend","and","come","back","year","late","for","revengeth","well","actor","in","thi","movi","be","micheal","ironsid","and","the","movi","star","other","okai","actor","and","actress","like","justin","loui","iwendi","lyonlisa","schrage","and","richard","monetteiand","there","be","some","good","gore","scene","like","when","mari","lou","kill","the","girl","that","be","try","to","hide","in","her","locker","by","crush","the","locker","togeth","and","how","on","of","the","student","be","on","the","comput","and","mari","lou","electrocut","him","to","deathov","all","thi","be","a","okgood","horror","movi","and","my","rate","be","out","of"],"filtered":["prom","night","okai","horror","movi","prom","night","wai","well","thi","movi","prom","queen","mari","lou","get","kill","boyfriend","come","back","year","late","revengeth","well","actor","thi","movi","micheal","ironsid","movi","star","okai","actor","actress","like","justin","loui","iwendi","lyonlisa","schrage","richard","monetteiand","good","gore","scene","like","mari","lou","kill","girl","try","hide","locker","crush","locker","togeth","student","comput","mari","lou","electrocut","deathov","thi","okgood","horror","movi","rate"],"filtered2":["prom","night","okai","horror","prom","night","wai","well","prom","queen","mari","lou","get","kill","boyfriend","come","back","year","late","revengeth","well","actor","micheal","ironsid","star","okai","actor","actress","like","justin","loui","iwendi","lyonlisa","schrage","richard","monetteiand","good","gore","scene","like","mari","lou","kill","girl","try","hide","locker","crush","locker","togeth","student","comput","mari","lou","electrocut","deathov","okgood","horror","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,19,20,33,34,36,41,57,63,76,83,84,100,150,191,202,210,270,355,358,626,641,707,765,921,1050,1469,1893,2176,2425,2789,2862,4987,5278,6131,6601],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,19,20,33,34,36,41,57,63,76,83,84,100,150,191,202,210,270,355,358,626,641,707,765,921,1050,1469,1893,2176,2425,2789,2862,4987,5278,6131,6601],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,3.1375198335242067,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,4.267533106664805,4.584637595480144,2.2212694515902225,2.1405462403177813,2.332712011146513,5.092022696851891,2.597304642813496,5.374303583034378,2.731603554088023,3.0316467233633775,3.2030824725120812,3.6528204042982337,3.7034641371169887,3.6375061693251913,3.965503778955432,13.0564786653183,4.240607069200353,4.654440426979034,17.159975560158767,5.014723312293965,17.721610186423206,5.604922523601468,5.719991853386255,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347,13.451027437976705]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651695E-4,2.316691787225996E-4,2.317263796324285E-4,2.316797952178616E-4,2.3170172096235667E-4,2.316679013686386E-4,2.3173995330228204E-4,2.3163343296338674E-4,2.316692276835122E-4,2.3190863272655826E-4,2.3374876022784914E-4,2.316696103411683E-4,2.3188901610218262E-4,2.3191317493693816E-4,2.3180782283696816E-4,2.3168070777104281E-4,2.3176041489471824E-4,2.3186948213389024E-4,2.3169266844704953E-4,2.316918213556659E-4,2.3190026336973295E-4,2.3171503451076972E-4,2.317153851913934E-4,2.3186382454808466E-4,2.316927520244291E-4,2.3191594687179597E-4,2.3175073223857302E-4,2.316686595038997E-4,2.3177368817377557E-4,2.3184442884434926E-4,2.3171617111051625E-4,2.3184027324578288E-4,2.3195410103209587E-4,2.3216939040434864E-4,2.317503317667923E-4,2.3168056725302085E-4,2.3176410118143958E-4,2.3170409657815967E-4,2.316336801891393E-4,2.3169259669560049E-4,2.319247922714103E-4,2.3179756692385677E-4,2.3184080156982045E-4,2.3164520857154702E-4,2.3169265560915844E-4,2.3168048013228178E-4,2.3175890187423535E-4,2.3179908915749495E-4,2.3175195412256168E-4,2.3171522102838563E-4,2.3168105306030666E-4,2.3215572991360734E-4,2.3173935068699456E-4,2.316926025054959E-4,2.3173810963694026E-4,2.3166889653243185E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908913E-4,2.3168137831085196E-4,2.316687642899177E-4,2.3185410485865123E-4,2.3176103280889653E-4,2.3166866744629133E-4,2.3164511419405094E-4,2.3162181971902575E-4,2.3183124250942012E-4,2.3168001672688648E-4,2.3178532984537465E-4,2.318533529636742E-4,2.3174816560918494E-4,2.316929093746727E-4,2.316454178653596E-4,2.3170467704319527E-4,2.3164529309826855E-4,2.31657449468623E-4,2.316454244215023E-4,2.31795794672145E-4,2.3172680482568865E-4,2.316689766643315E-4,2.316914181478325E-4]}}

It's like a really bad TV movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote. I think at the bit where Michael Lerner is confronted by what I can only describe as a high school cast of Les Miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief.

{"value":"Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.","finished_norm":["stori","of","a","man","who","have","unnatur","feel","for","a","pig","start","out","with","a","open","scene","that","be","a","terrif","exampl","of","absurd","comedi","a","formal","orchestra","audienc","be","turn","into","a","insan","violent","mob","by","the","crazi","chant","of","it","singer","unfortun","it","stai","absurd","the","whole","time","with","no","gener","narr","eventu","make","it","just","too","off","putt","even","that","from","the","era","should","be","turn","off","the","cryptic","dialogu","would","make","shakespear","seem","easi","to","a","grader","on","a","technic","level","it","well","than","you","mai","think","with","some","good","cinematographi","by","futur","great","vilmo","zsigmond","futur","star","salli","kirkland","and","freder","forrest","can","be","see","briefli"],"filtered":["stori","man","unnatur","feel","pig","start","open","scene","terrif","exampl","absurd","comedi","formal","orchestra","audienc","turn","insan","violent","mob","crazi","chant","singer","unfortun","stai","absurd","whole","time","gener","narr","eventu","make","putt","even","era","turn","cryptic","dialogu","make","shakespear","seem","easi","grader","technic","level","well","mai","think","good","cinematographi","futur","great","vilmo","zsigmond","futur","star","salli","kirkland","freder","forrest","see","briefli"],"filtered2":["stori","man","unnatur","feel","pig","start","open","scene","terrif","exampl","absurd","comedi","formal","orchestra","audienc","turn","insan","violent","mob","crazi","chant","singer","unfortun","stai","absurd","whole","time","gener","narr","eventu","make","putt","even","era","turn","cryptic","dialogu","make","shakespear","seem","easi","grader","technic","level","well","mai","think","good","cinematographi","futur","great","vilmo","zsigmond","futur","star","salli","kirkland","freder","forrest","see","briefli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,12,17,19,20,35,43,45,46,51,71,96,100,111,127,168,225,227,242,248,307,366,445,629,712,716,744,844,928,944,966,1198,1204,1213,1285,1453,1845,2359,2585,2589,2728,2906,3450,5132,5201,5720,7421,7818],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,12,17,19,20,35,43,45,46,51,71,96,100,111,127,168,225,227,242,248,307,366,445,629,712,716,744,844,928,944,966,1198,1204,1213,1285,1453,1845,2359,2585,2589,2728,2906,3450,5132,5201,5720,7421,7818],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.9214926742550966,4.078141625743051,2.1405462403177813,2.1183455303375887,2.4359679371086367,2.4894767118610357,2.641219492619754,2.6005321873043625,2.689504733779216,2.689504733779216,2.8767855639325206,3.008694896185175,3.241201430615691,3.488143311483988,3.7165362186843414,3.6746621462132825,3.700222643192818,7.738087025535739,8.034927035772286,3.969732115064953,4.026392148630444,4.34596758485818,4.3215761317340196,4.251780369798478,4.449957298382227,4.74221603786142,5.064116067623542,5.129498826886393,5.463272006538442,5.482320201509136,5.290429193699031,5.719991853386255,5.695894301807195,6.342521466732247,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.155988596824739E-4,2.1540780663324016E-4,2.1546099248468406E-4,2.1541767793321683E-4,2.1543806466120768E-4,2.154066189395791E-4,2.1547361338862666E-4,2.153745699479334E-4,2.15407852157478E-4,2.1563045283100668E-4,2.1734141771275815E-4,2.1540820795554682E-4,2.1561221314088649E-4,2.15634676213593E-4,2.155367190105508E-4,2.1541852643227176E-4,2.1549263873663023E-4,2.1559405030503623E-4,2.1542964756197344E-4,2.1542885992980774E-4,2.1562267093784934E-4,2.1545044370220907E-4,2.1545076976778408E-4,2.155887898376925E-4,2.1542972527287187E-4,2.1563725358021184E-4,2.1548363572753716E-4,2.154073238596493E-4,2.1550498033487105E-4,2.155707555613041E-4,2.154515005215053E-4,2.1556689165339298E-4,2.1567272961560614E-4,2.1587290735061658E-4,2.1548326336575654E-4,2.1541839577752058E-4,2.154960662747328E-4,2.1544027352728278E-4,2.1537479982036353E-4,2.1542958084691733E-4,2.1564547810166187E-4,2.1552718298266605E-4,2.1556738289319773E-4,2.1538551900011015E-4,2.1542963562520232E-4,2.1541831477197887E-4,2.1549123191840172E-4,2.155285983673581E-4,2.1548477184478595E-4,2.1545061712774095E-4,2.1541884748491841E-4,2.1586020571993638E-4,2.1547305307223914E-4,2.1542958624900334E-4,2.1547189913423325E-4,2.1540754425062447E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476628E-4,2.154191499054085E-4,2.1540742129050493E-4,2.155797523947596E-4,2.1549321327804557E-4,2.1540733124454685E-4,2.1538543124717925E-4,2.15363

All I can say is this would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the medium of film is absent. Acting is god awful, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable.<br /><br />I can only agree that the 'glowing' reviews of this film are from friends and family.

{"value":"This may have been made for the hell of it, but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years, The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case!!! I'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too, I'm glad i only rented. I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter, I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future, that is, if he is still in work.<br /><br />Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing, DON'T BUY

All involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash. Not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful, but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop PC. The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing.

{"value":"Why bother seeing this movie, if you have great movies to see. It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to watching it.

{"value":"Unless somebody enlightens me, I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it. This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems. And, that´s basically all. When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is. To one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is \"Simone\") that deserves the title \"the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year\".

{"value":"This warning against anti-semitism is well-meant and may have had its purpose at the time, but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film. The director has no idea about mise-en-scene; the cast varies from bad till even worse.<br /><br />The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted. In his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy, that is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari; one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities.<br /><br />The restored copy I saw (Dutch Filmmuseum) gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place, but may be the original editing was bad as

If you must watch this film on a full mind, I highly recommend some kind of inebriation<br /><br />It is a total waste of what little production value it has.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","horribl","the","script","be","complet","unrealist","yet","it","be","write","to","take","place","in","the","realworld","the","edit","and","light","effect","be","wrong","than","much","project","in","film","schoolbr","br","i","do","not","recommend","thi","film","to","anyon","who","a","know","ani","detail","about","the","world","of","polic","or","covert","oper","b","know","ani","detail","about","film","make","or","appreciationbr","br","i","do","recommend","thi","film","to","the","averag","or","belowaverag","mind","i","think","it","would","be","enjoy","if","i","be","a","dumb","if","you","must","watch","thi","film","on","a","full","mind","i","highli","recommend","some","kind","of","inebriationbr","br","it","be","a","total","wast","of","what","littl","product","valu","it","have"],"filtered":["thi","film","horribl","script","complet","unrealist","yet","write","take","place","realworld","edit","light","effect","wrong","much","project","film","schoolbr","br","recommend","thi","film","anyon","know","ani","detail","world","polic","covert","oper","b","know","ani","detail","film","make","appreciationbr","br","recommend","thi","film","averag","belowaverag","mind","think","enjoy","dumb","must","watch","thi","film","full","mind","highli","recommend","kind","inebriationbr","br","total","wast","littl","product","valu"],"filtered2":["horribl","script","complet","unrealist","yet","write","take","place","realworld","edit","light","effect","wrong","project","schoolbr","recommend","anyon","know","ani","detail","world","polic","covert","oper","b","know","ani","detail","make","appreciationbr","recommend","averag","belowaverag","mind","think","enjoy","dumb","must","watch","full","mind","highli","recommend","kind","inebriationbr","total","wast","littl","product","valu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,12,14,25,26,27,31,65,77,89,103,106,122,141,158,164,165,184,190,194,230,238,298,336,348,353,420,451,471,642,643,659,737,740,896,1264,1420],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,12,14,25,26,27,31,65,77,89,103,106,122,141,158,164,165,184,190,194,230,238,298,336,348,353,420,451,471,642,643,659,737,740,896,1264,1420],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,2.600540117735859,1.4070669811451506,1.9073850067444174,1.9463902258768238,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.2489347673732487,2.2657547357741192,2.3106972614914807,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,2.496249838866882,2.558331832813986,2.5378812223426954,2.7121382192999195,5.194609285626992,8.34597613950251,2.9233055795674137,3.0103169565570433,3.0266839340212486,3.3023374306074227,3.216957819005698,3.496027715008137,3.622422927113863,3.5813614403160887,3.6405503117064195,3.68099128126493,7.433072437368683,3.8844878351953436,4.327618446189983,4.573751515728891]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.731092965484183E-4,2.7286728059361913E-4,2.729346536330479E-4,2.728797850372726E-4,2.7290560987210105E-4,2.728657760857532E-4,2.729506411303966E-4,2.7282517810867514E-4,2.728673382613294E-4,2.7314931708741485E-4,2.753166774155835E-4,2.728677889676107E-4,2.731262120072427E-4,2.7315466704635663E-4,2.730305800133635E-4,2.728808598712506E-4,2.7297474144065566E-4,2.7310320428201775E-4,2.7289494753346795E-4,2.7289394980246407E-4,2.7313945939443286E-4,2.7292129099019605E-4,2.7292170403291787E-4,2.7309654059864816E-4,2.728950459735471E-4,2.731579319188391E-4,2.7296333690222794E-4,2.7286666904142456E-4,2.729903751282308E-4,2.7307369572578827E-4,2.729226297132997E-4,2.730688011304593E-4,2.732028710947008E-4,2.7345644572155124E-4,2.729628652139077E-4,2.728806943646833E-4,2.72979083265661E-4,2.7290840794747505E-4,2.7282546929898E-4,2.728948630223436E-4,2.731683503100633E-4,2.730185002747633E-4,2.7306942340720835E-4,2.728390477921339E-4,2.728949324125941E-4,2.728805917511234E-4,2.72972959357312E-4,2.730202932096524E-4,2.7296477607580735E-4,2.72921510676539E-4,2.7288126656385843E-4,2.734403559638169E-4,2.7294993135106537E-4,2.728948698654221E-4,2.729484696030881E-4,2.7286694822112095E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.729095200218363E-4,2.728816496542302E-4,2.728667924617083E-4,2.730850924412431E-4,2.72975469239504E-4,2.728666783962244E-4,2.728389366313362E-4,2.7281149966243065E-4,2.730581644437552E-4,2.7288004593760287E-4,2.730040870569747E-4,2.7308420683557557E-4,2.729603138450164E-4,2.728952313056371E-4,2.7283929430500103E-4,2.7290909163753957E-4,2.72839147350378E-4,2.7285346550758293E-4,2.7283930202703314E-4,2.730164128606852E-4,2.729351544391079E-4,2.7286704260300493E-4,2.7289347489153453E-4]}}
{"value":"Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. His performance is one-note and irritating.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.","finished_norm":["despit","unfortun","think","itself","to","be","a","intellig","b","import","and","c","interest","fortun","thi","movi","be","over","mercifulli","quickli","the","script","make","littl","sens","the","whole","idea","of","the","sadomasochist","relationship","between","the","two","main","charact","be","strang","trite","and","john","lydon","show","u","all","in","the","space","of","on","movi","why","he","should","never","have","let","himself","out","of","music","hi","perform","be","onenot","and","irritatingbr","br","the","onli","posit","thing","to","be","sai","be","that","harvei","keitel","manag","to","deliv","a","good","turn","hi","late","bad","lieuten","would","show","just","how","badli","good","actor","can","act","but","mercifulli","hi","perform","here","be","restrain"],"filtered":["despit","unfortun","think","intellig","b","import","c","interest","fortun","thi","movi","mercifulli","quickli","script","make","littl","sens","whole","idea","sadomasochist","relationship","two","main","charact","strang","trite","john","lydon","show","u","space","movi","never","let","music","hi","perform","onenot","irritatingbr","br","onli","posit","thing","sai","harvei","keitel","manag","deliv","good","turn","hi","late","bad","lieuten","show","badli","good","actor","act","mercifulli","hi","perform","restrain"],"filtered2":["despit","unfortun","think","intellig","b","import","c","interest","fortun","mercifulli","quickli","script","make","littl","sens","whole","idea","sadomasochist","relationship","two","main","charact","strang","trite","john","lydon","show","u","space","never","let","music","perform","onenot","irritatingbr","onli","posit","thing","harvei","keitel","manag","deliv","good","turn","late","bad","lieuten","show","badli","good","actor","act","mercifulli","perform","restrain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,10,11,12,14,21,28,29,41,42,47,60,77,96,105,111,112,118,123,124,150,173,179,227,291,345,391,417,448,509,517,577,600,603,637,642,770,1115,1465,1752,3111,4198,4752,5279,5403,6039,8433],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,10,11,12,14,21,28,29,41,42,47,60,77,96,105,111,112,118,123,124,150,173,179,227,291,345,391,417,448,509,517,577,600,603,637,642,770,1115,1465,1752,3111,4198,4752,5279,5403,6039,8433],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,1.838176641236591,1.9463902258768238,2.0390708128715254,4.353122425996981,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.354379525480895,2.2619070973220485,2.2323930368088845,2.332712011146513,2.4368824319140248,2.507968722980095,2.6005321873043625,3.016831637578237,3.0022328381570844,3.109204957709252,3.1932880749197934,3.2681460658591432,3.360519385990158,3.4198487640477615,3.604618302480356,3.558633189238533,3.530930586689197,3.7432044657665027,3.622422927113863,3.7264536553416874,4.2078172463773615,4.506310234933358,4.715065048795469,5.521540914662417,11.756431717202299,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255718E-4,2.2737792632708276E-4,2.2743406769354607E-4,2.2738834617097762E-4,2.274098657807244E-4,2.273766726337929E-4,2.2744738993572334E-4,2.2734284269338743E-4,2.2737797438108305E-4,2.2761294487884287E-4,2.2941898734736628E-4,2.273783499506984E-4,2.2759369161694302E-4,2.2761740295299335E-4,2.2751400231007024E-4,2.2738924182076216E-4,2.2746747251417915E-4,2.2757451948007205E-4,2.2740098094688532E-4,2.27400149546337E-4,2.2760473054921074E-4,2.2742293271974022E-4,2.274232769046398E-4,2.2756896669080768E-4,2.2740106297614515E-4,2.2762012354277296E-4,2.2745796921172097E-4,2.2737741672596994E-4,2.274804999297562E-4,2.275499302573929E-4,2.2742404826603282E-4,2.275458516337716E-4,2.2765757096628253E-4,2.2786887249242E-4,2.2745757615795547E-4,2.273891039055823E-4,2.2747109051910827E-4,2.2741219739254263E-4,2.2734308533973023E-4,2.2740091052450207E-4,2.276288050973627E-4,2.2750393636919406E-4,2.275463701715622E-4,2.273544001797112E-4,2.2740096834679294E-4,2.2738901839859733E-4,2.274659875196633E-4,2.2750543040620815E-4,2.274591684625194E-4,2.2742311578245476E-4,2.273895807141671E-4,2.2785546503755486E-4,2.274467984827938E-4,2.274009162267797E-4,2.2744558042094641E-4,2.2737764936397735E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441387E-4,2.2738989994003448E-4,2.2737751957101654E-4,2.2755942704103595E-4,2.2746807898261522E-4,2.273774245212431E-4,2.2735430755038748E-4,2.2733144456336732E-4,2.2753698817546138E-4,2.2738856357694856E-4,2.2749192596045127E-4,2.2755868907355304E-4,2.274554501244987E-4,2.2740121741176019E-4,2.2735460

{"value":"Freeway Killer, Is a Madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone. The police believe he is a random killer, but Sunny, the blond heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel detects a pattern. So does the ex-cop, played by James Russo, and they join forces, and bodies, in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses. Also starring Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases, but its really not a good movie for the most part, check it out if you're really bored and have already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride, or Breakdown, otherwise stay away from the freeway.","finished_norm":["freewai","killer","be","a","madman","who","shoot","peopl","on","the","freewai","while","yell","a","bunch","of","mystic","chant","on","a","car","phone","the","polic","believ","he","be","a","random","killer","but","sunni","the","blond","heroin","plai","by","darlann","fluegel","detect","a","pattern","so","doe","the","excop","plai","by","jame","russo","and","thei","join","forc","and","bodi","in","the","search","for","the","villain","who","have","do","awai","with","their","spous","conjur","star","richard","belzer","thi","movi","have","it","moment","especi","if","you","like","car","chase","but","it","realli","not","a","good","movi","for","the","much","part","check","it","out","if","you","re","realli","bore","and","have","alreadi","see","the","hitcher","joi","ride","or","breakdown","otherwis","stai","awai","from","the","freewai"],"filtered":["freewai","killer","madman","shoot","peopl","freewai","yell","bunch","mystic","chant","car","phone","polic","believ","random","killer","sunni","blond","heroin","plai","darlann","fluegel","detect","pattern","doe","excop","plai","jame","russo","thei","join","forc","bodi","search","villain","awai","spous","conjur","star","richard","belzer","thi","movi","moment","especi","like","car","chase","realli","good","movi","much","part","check","re","realli","bore","alreadi","see","hitcher","joi","ride","breakdown","otherwis","stai","awai","freewai"],"filtered2":["freewai","killer","madman","shoot","peopl","freewai","yell","bunch","mystic","chant","car","phone","polic","believ","random","killer","sunni","blond","heroin","plai","darlann","fluegel","detect","pattern","doe","excop","plai","jame","russo","join","forc","bodi","search","villain","awai","spous","conjur","star","richard","belzer","moment","especi","like","car","chase","realli","good","part","check","re","realli","bore","alreadi","see","hitcher","joi","ride","breakdown","otherwis","stai","awai","freewai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,13,18,23,39,40,61,68,91,100,108,117,155,188,252,267,284,330,338,366,376,419,471,505,520,530,620,627,641,859,983,985,1002,1062,1089,1308,1319,1663,2180,3027,3508,3600,4523,5059,5201,5633],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,13,18,23,39,40,61,68,91,100,108,117,155,188,252,267,284,330,338,366,376,419,471,505,520,530,620,627,641,859,983,985,1002,1062,1089,1308,1319,1663,2180,3027,3508,3600,4523,5059,5201,5633],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.2635883139467947,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.5538940054862738,3.2569937516641474,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,2.0105926690411424,2.1405462403177813,2.138507503627933,2.2797301185117202,4.614953293582877,2.5378812223426954,6.0866465060504265,2.7085302779237206,6.221997360326558,2.9292757465539174,2.9720957437368454,3.008694896185175,3.1569204307489187,3.1758963322079246,3.496027715008137,3.41740676039221,3.5614461306151473,3.5784919978881358,3.7568101178222815,3.477726550625732,3.7034641371169887,3.9405024767500145,4.165705761027235,4.170873731185678,4.072271754381138,4.327618446189983,4.2078172463773615,4.506310234933358,4.403125998698128,4.77960356993304,5.0768550934009715,5.5623629091826725,5.604922523601468,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.255510089742618,6.2980697041614135,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125574E-4,2.27377926327083E-4,2.2743406769354632E-4,2.2738834617097787E-4,2.2740986578072462E-4,2.2737667263379315E-4,2.2744738993572358E-4,2.2734284269338768E-4,2.273779743810833E-4,2.276129448788431E-4,2.2941898734736652E-4,2.2737834995069863E-4,2.2759369161694327E-4,2.276174029529936E-4,2.275140023100705E-4,2.273892418207624E-4,2.2746747251417936E-4,2.275745194800723E-4,2.2740098094688557E-4,2.2740014954633725E-4,2.2760473054921098E-4,2.2742293271974046E-4,2.2742327690464E-4,2.2756896669080793E-4,2.274010629761454E-4,2.276201235427732E-4,2.2745796921172122E-4,2.2737741672597018E-4,2.2748049992975646E-4,2.2754993025739316E-4,2.2742404826603304E-4,2.2754585163377184E-4,2.2765757096628278E-4,2.2786887249242024E-4,2.274575761579557E-4,2.2738910390558256E-4,2.2747109051910852E-4,2.2741219739254287E-4,2.2734308533973045E-4,2.274009105245023E-4,2.2762880509736295E-4,2.275039363691943E-4,2.2754637017156245E-4,2.2735440017971145E-4,2.2740096834679318E-4,2.2738901839859757E-4,2.2746598751966355E-4,2.275054304062084E-4,2.2745916846251966E-4,2.27423115782455E-4,2.2738958071416733E-4,2.2785546503755507E-4,2.2744679848279403E-4,2.2740091622677994E-4,2.2744558042094663E-4,2.2737764936397756E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.274131240744141E-4,2.2738989994003473E-4,2.2737751957101676E-4,2.275594270410362E-4,2.2746807898261546E-4,2.2737742452124334E-4,2.2735430755038772E-4,2.2733144456336756E-4,2.275369881754616E-4,2.27388

{"value":"Well that's 90 minutes of my life I won't get back. This movie makes teen tv show \"California Dreams\" look like \"Almost Famous\". The acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic. Don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story, lame songs, look etc.. You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one. The guitarist is seen to be a heroin user, not that I blame him, if I was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting I'd be injecting the horse too.<br /><br />If you take music

{"value":"I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie, as I didn't think it was going to be well done. The kids, ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought, but was still a far cry from the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the \"silly\" or \"stupid\"

{"value":"I bought a DVD of this film for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this film, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was shot entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special about it. The special effects are phoney looking, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that got us to jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a Virgin Mary statue.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the \"plot\" scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you I have no clue what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $5.","finished_norm":["i","bui","a","dvd","of","thi","film","for","my","girlfriend","who","share","the","same","name","a","the","ghost","girl","in","thi","film","and","enjoi","movi","about","the","paranorm","the","movi","be","shoot","entir","on","video","so","it","have","the","look","of","a","pb","special","about","it","the","special","effect","be","phonei","look","but","there","be","actual","some","scari","moment","in","the","movi","that","get","u","to","jump","in","our","seat","there","be","a","particularli","effect","scare","involv","a","virgin","mari","statuebr","br","howev","the","act","be","bad","the","plot","scene","be","long","and","veri","bore","and","i","will","tell","you","i","have","no","clue","what","happen","at","the","end","if","you","get","the","movi","rend","it","if","you","bui","it","pleas","make","sure","you","pai","littl","than"],"filtered":["bui","dvd","thi","film","girlfriend","share","name","ghost","girl","thi","film","enjoi","movi","paranorm","movi","shoot","entir","video","look","pb","special","special","effect","phonei","look","actual","scari","moment","movi","get","u","jump","seat","particularli","effect","scare","involv","virgin","mari","statuebr","br","howev","act","bad","plot","scene","long","veri","bore","tell","clue","happen","end","get","movi","rend","bui","pleas","make","sure","pai","littl"],"filtered2":["bui","dvd","girlfriend","share","name","ghost","girl","enjoi","paranorm","shoot","entir","video","look","pb","special","special","effect","phonei","look","actual","scari","moment","get","u","jump","seat","particularli","effect","scare","involv","virgin","mari","statuebr","howev","act","bad","plot","scene","long","veri","bore","tell","clue","happen","end","get","rend","bui","pleas","make","sure","pai","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,9,14,15,16,19,21,24,32,52,84,90,94,99,106,108,112,113,117,119,143,188,198,200,203,240,241,247,322,346,347,396,497,533,623,674,727,730,921,1045,1124,1750,1760,7105,7380],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,9,14,15,16,19,21,24,32,52,84,90,94,99,106,108,112,113,117,119,143,188,198,200,203,240,241,247,322,346,347,396,497,533,623,674,727,730,921,1045,1124,1750,1760,7105,7380],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.5932680941439847,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.7122153074726136,2.2212694515902225,2.0477128419653545,2.08112281984698,2.056430207256609,4.318168722633384,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,2.2797301185117202,2.1653408989309972,2.3409902041158843,2.5378812223426954,2.5439726117360975,2.5308211829319704,5.139521057275218,2.7666071276613566,2.6627744961815836,2.7303758068497004,2.885344817328191,3.023389038124396,6.030397968308703,3.291526514503207,3.342254038012865,3.424750734647968,3.607563812710113,3.6405503117064195,4.096025840389245,3.767137231978131,4.3521595551061,4.165705761027235,4.181290492043933,4.751432692966343,4.956227105612356,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918357E-4,2.3612552253122072E-4,2.3618382374676042E-4,2.361363432433457E-4,2.3615869074724904E-4,2.3612422060632438E-4,2.361976585171192E-4,2.360890891734519E-4,2.3612557243393603E-4,2.3636958262639044E-4,2.382451064667311E-4,2.361259624523213E-4,2.363495886603975E-4,2.3637421220985646E-4,2.3626683357713397E-4,2.361372733502246E-4,2.3621851370481594E-4,2.3632967894044433E-4,2.3614946409949682E-4,2.361486007136261E-4,2.3636105227822535E-4,2.3617226039252128E-4,2.3617261781877004E-4,2.3632391252640525E-4,2.361495492845548E-4,2.3637703746512062E-4,2.362086447949576E-4,2.361249933249297E-4,2.362320423061189E-4,2.363041437306395E-4,2.3617341885568216E-4,2.362999081957776E-4,2.36415925551517E-4,2.366353561887684E-4,2.3620823661977863E-4,2.3613713012922495E-4,2.3622227090024038E-4,2.3616111205994116E-4,2.3608934115479155E-4,2.3614939096785068E-4,2.3638605301314235E-4,2.3625638038324856E-4,2.3630044668255482E-4,2.3610109129494817E-4,2.3614945101465851E-4,2.3613704133264808E-4,2.3621697158016179E-4,2.3625793189828052E-4,2.362098901828719E-4,2.3617245049795422E-4,2.3613762528140636E-4,2.3662143292745195E-4,2.3619704431003982E-4,2.3614939688950415E-4,2.3619577938738514E-4,2.361252349128971E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276123E-4,2.3613795678840865E-4,2.361251001265914E-4,2.3631400587089343E-4,2.3621914350507265E-4,2.361250014200996E-4,2.361009951020247E-4,2.3607725253895376E-4,2.3629070374590533E-4,2.3613656901327564E-4,2.3624390791467602E-4,2.363132395126091E-4,2.3620602879437976E-4,2.3614970966155747E-4,2.3610130461469632E-4,2.3616170369069066E-4,2.3610117744760948E-4,2.3611356765556828E-4,2.361013112969517E-4,2.3625457404084337E-4,2.3618425711895643E-4,2.361

{"value":"I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. This has to be one of the worst new shows. If they gave an award to shows that suck THIS one should sweep the category. The acting is poor and the story line is contrived. Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. This new show, based on an insurance companies commercials, is not funny and really has nothing going for it. Possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were, and still are, repeated is what is wrong with this show. It just came to TV and already we are tired of seeing the \"caveman\"

{"value":"Dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichés. Man and Woman fall in love and marry, husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune, woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears. The movie is reminiscent of Yash Chopra's Chandni and countless others. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances. Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain The music by Nadeem Shravan is superb, all the songs were brilliant.

{"value":"I personally found this movie to be terrible, first it was hardly objective, and provided one side of the debate. The only people who were presented as the side saying he did exist being a bunch of people coming from a Billy Grahm Revival. Secondly it deviated heavily from its supposed topic did Jesus (Yeshua) exist, to talking about how violent Christianity is, and showing scenes from Mel Gibsons \"The Passion\". In the end it has the director con his former Principal of a Conservative Private School into being interviewed, and attempts to trap him about teaching the kids there faith. Oh and also the Techno Music just made the film harder to watch.","finished_norm":["i","person","find","thi","movi","to","be","terribl","it","be","hardli","object","and","provid","on","side","of","the","debat","the","onli","peopl","who","be","present","a","the","side","sai","he","do","exist","be","a","bunch","of","peopl","come","from","a","billi","grahm","reviv","secondli","it","deviat","heavili","from","it","suppos","topic","do","jesu","yeshua","exist","to","talk","about","how","violent","christian","be","and","show","scene","from","mel","gibson","the","passion","in","the","end","it","have","the","director","con","hi","former","princip","of","a","conserv","privat","school","into","be","interview","and","attempt","to","trap","him","about","teach","the","kid","there","faith","oh","and","conjur","the","techno","music","just","make","the","film","hard","to","watch"],"filtered":["person","find","thi","movi","terribl","hardli","object","provid","side","debat","onli","peopl","present","side","sai","exist","bunch","peopl","come","billi","grahm","reviv","secondli","deviat","heavili","suppos","topic","jesu","yeshua","exist","talk","violent","christian","show","scene","mel","gibson","passion","end","director","con","hi","former","princip","conserv","privat","school","interview","attempt","trap","teach","kid","faith","oh","conjur","techno","music","make","film","hard","watch"],"filtered2":["person","find","terribl","hardli","object","provid","side","debat","onli","peopl","present","side","exist","bunch","peopl","come","billi","grahm","reviv","secondli","deviat","heavili","suppos","topic","jesu","yeshua","exist","talk","violent","christian","show","scene","mel","gibson","passion","end","director","con","former","princip","conserv","privat","school","interview","attempt","trap","teach","kid","faith","oh","conjur","techno","music","make","hard","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,11,19,23,24,28,34,38,39,58,114,118,149,153,166,171,177,186,234,296,411,419,425,528,665,684,695,966,1039,1072,1091,1112,1141,1155,1261,1284,1464,1689,1883,2098,2279,2478,2555,2656,2939,3342,3437,7039,7455,7532],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,11,19,23,24,28,34,38,39,58,114,118,149,153,166,171,177,186,234,296,411,419,425,528,665,684,695,966,1039,1072,1091,1112,1141,1155,1261,1284,1464,1689,1883,2098,2279,2478,2555,2656,2939,3342,3437,7039,7455,7532],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.312380678011735,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.865701314626681,2.4433074195966826,2.354379525480895,2.3253197803590226,2.3409902041158843,2.4423870329693536,2.373087554090762,2.458149992634611,2.571852579609833,2.673149229007135,2.9504565686333644,3.229006157521873,3.1758963322079246,6.453975986731272,6.839697528095523,3.5929222627171646,4.1302590120314875,3.6715125373103863,4.026392148630444,4.105687751300982,4.268777946167049,4.364659717870332,4.268777946167049,4.770124825978496,4.291900363587903,4.383707912841026,4.706176101378222,4.589376833631972,4.74221603786142,4.848596441419991,4.944927550358424,5.373120909544144,5.129498826886393,5.243909178064138,5.290429193699031,5.521540914662417,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164674E-4,2.2324275812784226E-4,2.2329787848933375E-4,2.2325298847310015E-4,2.232741167202933E-4,2.2324152723462233E-4,2.2331095844892412E-4,2.232083125364086E-4,2.2324280530791702E-4,2.234735025565282E-4,2.2524669975505134E-4,2.232431740473024E-4,2.2345459944065013E-4,2.2347787955470639E-4,2.2337635938917747E-4,2.2325386783430924E-4,2.233306757991402E-4,2.23435775974435E-4,2.2326539346890394E-4,2.2326457718847378E-4,2.2346543761534034E-4,2.2328694601974776E-4,2.232872839451899E-4,2.2343032416998458E-4,2.2326547400635324E-4,2.2348055066696406E-4,2.2332134532680124E-4,2.2324225779449939E-4,2.2334346629394186E-4,2.2341163393927889E-4,2.2328804127835617E-4,2.2340762949082035E-4,2.2351731705956906E-4,2.2372477578809882E-4,2.233209594212381E-4,2.2325373242729928E-4,2.2333422800586644E-4,2.232764059286681E-4,2.2320855076990686E-4,2.2326532432724483E-4,2.2348907433600597E-4,2.23366476510744E-4,2.234081385983157E-4,2.232196598345638E-4,2.232653810979609E-4,2.2325364847537187E-4,2.233292178112129E-4,2.2336794337671974E-4,2.233225227676384E-4,2.232871257532248E-4,2.2325420056448956E-4,2.2371161216552595E-4,2.2331037775234804E-4,2.23265329925819E-4,2.233091818425657E-4,2.2324248620167708E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760436E-4,2.2325451398481252E-4,2.2324235876917286E-4,2.23420958011356E-4,2.2333127123814596E-4,2.2324226544800523E-4,2.232195688898268E-4,2.2319712169645203E-4,2.2339892722621758E-4,2.2325320192525608E-4,2.2335468452716275

{"value":"Dumb is as dumb does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of \"The Three Amigos\", only without any laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which \"Play Dead\" is not. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which \"Play Dead\" is.

{"value":"I can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! The Gingerbread Man starts of on the right foot, and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending. But at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time on. It's just so unbelievably how the bewitched Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's character around by his nose. The movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer, which has been left out in the sun too long. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham-movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie.

{"value":"Words can't simply describe how awful this film is. I watched it on video last night, and I simply could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, \"Snakeeater\" is about an ex-military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by Deliverance-style Rednecks. The film's acting, writing, direction, photography, and editing are deplorable along with a song called \"Soldier\" that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time!<br /><br />However, there is one treat. \"Horshack\" (Ron Pallio) from \"Welcome Back Carter\" is in the film playing a laughable bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS.","finished_norm":["word","ca","not","simpli","describ","how","aw","thi","film","be","i","watch","it","on","video","last","night","and","i","simpli","can","not","believ","what","i","be","see","basic","snakeeat","be","about","a","exmilitari","man","lorenzo","lama","and","hi","search","for","hi","kidnap","sister","who","have","be","hold","captiv","by","deliverancestyl","redneck","the","film","act","write","direct","photographi","and","edit","be","deplor","along","with","a","song","call","soldier","that","have","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","theme","song","of","all","timebr","br","howev","there","be","on","treat","horshack","ron","pallio","from","welcom","back","carter","be","in","the","film","plai","a","laughabl","bad","gui","otherwis","pleas","avoid","thi","mess","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["word","ca","simpli","describ","aw","thi","film","watch","video","last","night","simpli","believ","see","basic","snakeeat","exmilitari","man","lorenzo","lama","hi","search","hi","kidnap","sister","hold","captiv","deliverancestyl","redneck","film","act","write","direct","photographi","edit","deplor","along","song","call","soldier","wrong","theme","song","timebr","br","howev","treat","horshack","ron","pallio","welcom","back","carter","film","plai","laughabl","bad","gui","otherwis","pleas","avoid","thi","mess","cost"],"filtered2":["word","ca","simpli","describ","aw","watch","video","last","night","simpli","believ","see","basic","snakeeat","exmilitari","man","lorenzo","lama","search","kidnap","sister","hold","captiv","deliverancestyl","redneck","act","write","direct","photographi","edit","deplor","along","song","call","soldier","wrong","theme","song","timebr","howev","treat","horshack","ron","pallio","welcom","back","carter","plai","laughabl","bad","gui","otherwis","pleas","avoid","mess","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,21,25,40,45,55,63,65,81,91,102,113,138,142,144,201,210,240,258,286,324,328,335,346,348,407,414,534,552,585,627,657,668,836,849,1089,1250,1370,1372,1857,2011,2680,3418,3691,4142,6004,7709],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,21,25,40,45,55,63,65,81,91,102,113,138,142,144,201,210,240,258,286,324,328,335,346,348,407,414,534,552,585,627,657,668,836,849,1089,1250,1370,1372,1857,2011,2680,3418,3691,4142,6004,7709],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,1.9536997889255368,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.087553710177271,2.1521782565202803,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.2931108769894046,5.122871637503154,2.687151791517189,2.7666071276613566,2.7061321952397077,2.780700890737216,2.8753661172782943,6.310084991849437,2.908534262247101,3.023389038124396,3.0103169565570433,3.120015873813468,3.1254654785810323,3.4933926673701317,3.424750734647968,3.7165362186843414,3.477726550625732,4.00861390260916,3.5813614403160887,3.7881170224473255,3.880604335168946,4.2078172463773615,4.280272325592784,4.520909034354511,4.403125998698128,5.051537285416681,4.8796870284900224,5.3064295350454715,5.7446844659766265,5.7446844659766265,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4,2.3612500142009964E-4,2.3610099510202473E-4,2.360772525389538E-4,2.3629070374590536E-4,2.3613656901327567E-4,2.3624390791467605E-4,2.3631323951260914E-4,2.3620602879437978E-4,2.3614970966
