{"value":"Need I say--its a stinker! (I gave it a rating of 2)<br /><br />Only watch it if you suffer from insomnia.<br /><br />There's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up, but not much else happens in this movie. There is no suspense, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the heroine's well being. A few disagreements, slight raising of voices--that's pretty much it. The secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody - the last \"secret\" revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very, very wealthy, older widowed woman, and a growing mother/daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her.<br /><br />It turns out the older woman's daughter, Cassandra, is dead. You can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together.<br /><br />Even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two. Why he's still hanging around years after Cassandra's death is a good question.<br /><br />There's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything--cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. Everything except apparently locking the door--since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where Faith is.<br /><br />There's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms, and leaning forward on the edge of your seat, because there IS no \"mounting\" tension in this film--just bland, pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time.<br /><br

{"value":"The Brain (or head) that Wouldn't Die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead, Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by machines, I-Vs and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes. Shades of the under-rated Boxing Helena.<br /><br />The genderisms are plentiful, and about as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialog is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is merely OK (but not consistent). Why have I given this film a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror (without the blood and guts today's audiences expect).<br /><br />Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film, and none of the characters are particularly likable.<br /><br />All considered, this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality, from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high quality, body onto her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably non-plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend.

{"value":"This, for lack of a better term, movie is lousy. Where do I start......<br /><br />Cinemaphotography - This was, perhaps, the worst I've seen this year. It looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man. Maybe they only had one camera. It gives you the sensation of being a volleyball.<br /><br />There are a bunch of scenes, haphazardly, thrown in with no continuity at all. When they did the 'split screen', it was absurd. Everything was squished flat, it looked ridiculous.<br /><br />The color tones were way off. These people need to learn how to balance a camera. This 'movie' is poorly made, and poorly done.<br /><br />The plot - You got to be kidding. If I was an SS agent, I'd sue the producers. looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and guns. Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less on, and a lot more showing. As an action bimbo she wasn't much.<br /><br />I couldn't see a real plot, other than Douglas boinking the Presidents wife. Never did say why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres. I just don't see the President of the United States running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e.<br /><br />Hollywood is dead. This movie is the proof. I like 'the big screen'. Have since I was a kid. Many more 'movies' like this and I'll quit going. Whats the matter Hollywood, made so many chick flicks, forget how to make a real movie? If I owned a theater, I'd start running the old movies. The one with real actors, good story lines - and good Cinemaphotography.<br /><br />This 'movie' is a dog. Don't waste your time or money on it. I rate this 'movie' a zero! Douglas isn't suited for this role. I can over look his age, but his just is to much of a wimp to carry this

{"value":"I am Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First off I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. However the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Nichole without any intent to harm her at all. He loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about. The movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while Sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing. The reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck. My father was a landscaper. The items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work. My recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt, it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie (at least the Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park portion) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is, that if the director would have interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what I have posted here.","finished_norm":["i","be","anthoni","park","glenn","park","be","my","father","off","i","want","to","sai","that","the","stori","behind","thi","movi","and","the","creation","of","the","amber","alert","system","be","a","good","on","howev","the","movi","itself","be","poorli","make","and","the","act","be","terribl","the","major","problem","i","have","with","the","movi","involv","the","half","with","nichol","timmon","and","father","glenn","park","the","event","surround","that","part","of","the","stori","be","not","entir","correct","my","father","be","suffer","from","psycholog","disord","at","the","time","and","pick","up","nichol","without","ani","intent","to","harm","her","at","all","he","love","her","like","a","daughter","and","be","under","the","mindset","that","he","be","rescu","her","from","some","sort","of","harm","or","neglect","that","he","like","believ","be","come","from","her","mother","who","pai","littl","attent","to","her","over","the","plu","year","that","my","father","take","care","of","her","and","summarili","rais","her","so","her","mother","can","frolic","about","the","movi","depict","my","father","in","a","manner","that","he","be","go","to","harm","her","in","some","wai","shape","or","form","the","funni","thing","be","that","nichol","have","spend","mani","night","sometim","consecut","at","my","father","place","while","sharon","would","be","work","or","do","whatev","she","be","do","the","reason","that","my","father","be","origin","think","to","be","violent","be","becaus","he","have","item","that","can","be","conceiv","to","be","weapon","on","hi","truck","my","father","be","a","landscap","the","item","thei","deem","to","be","weapon","be","landscap","tool","that","he","keep","in","hi","truck","all","the","time","for","work","my","recommend","be","take","thi","movi","with","a","grain","of","salt","it","be","a","good","stori","and","base","on","true","event","howev","the","detail","of","the","movi","at","littl","the","nichol","timmon","glenn","park","portion","be","larg","inaccur","and","depict","the","failur","of","the","director","to","discov","the","truth","in","tell","the","stori","the","funni","thing","be","that","if","the","director","would","have","interview","ani","of","sharon","friend","who","know","the","situat","thei","would","have","state","exactli","what","i","have","post","here"],"filtered":["anthoni","park","glenn","park","father","want","sai","stori","behind","thi","movi","creation","amber","alert","system","good","howev","movi","poorli","make","act","terribl","major","problem","movi","involv","half","nichol","timmon","father","glenn","park","event","surround","part","stori","entir","correct","father","suffer","psycholog","disord","time","pick","nichol","without","ani","intent","harm","love","like","daughter","mindset","rescu","sort","harm","neglect","like","believ","come","mother","pai","littl","attent","plu","year","father","take","care","summarili","rais","mother","frolic","movi","depict","father","manner","go","harm","wai","shape","form","funni","thing","nichol","spend","mani","night","sometim","consecut","father","place","sharon","work","whatev","reason","father","origin","think","violent","becaus","item","conceiv","weapon","hi","truck","father","landscap","item","thei","deem","weapon","landscap","tool","keep","hi","truck","time","work","recommend","take","thi","movi","grain","salt","good","stori","base","true","event","howev","detail","movi","littl","nichol","timmon","glenn","park","portion","larg","inaccur","depict","failur","director","discov","truth","tell","stori","funni","thing","director","interview","ani","sharon","friend","know","situat","thei","state","exactli","post"],"filtered2":["anthoni","park","glenn","park","father","want","stori","behind","creation","amber","alert","system","good","howev","poorli","make","act","terribl","major","problem","involv","half","nichol","timmon","father","glenn","park","event","surround","part","stori","entir","correct","father","suffer","psycholog","disord","time","pick","nichol","without","ani","intent","harm","love","like","daughter","mindset","rescu","sort","harm","neglect","like","believ","come","mother","pai","littl","attent","plu","year","father","take","care","summarili","rais","mother","frolic","depict","father","manner","go","harm","wai","shape","form","funni","thing","nichol","spend","mani","night","sometim","consecut","father","place","sharon","work","whatev","reason","father","origin","think","violent","becaus","item","conceiv","weapon","truck","father","landscap","item","deem","weapon","landscap","tool","keep","truck","time","work","recommend","take","grain","salt","good","stori","base","true","event","howev","detail","littl","nichol","timmon","glenn","park","portion","larg","inaccur","depict","failur","director","discov","truth","tell","stori","funni","thing","director","interview","ani","sharon","friend","know","situat","state","exactli","post"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,8,12,14,17,21,22,26,

{"value":"A very slick modern (keeping it sensually hip) revamp on the Dracula story (although staying with the traditional customs) with quite an interesting, if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. Again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. The messy script does get considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of \"Virgin\" advertising. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh that wasn't obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. Now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. He was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. The likes of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably okay. Christopher Plummer gives out a grizzled turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps has fun with his

{"value":"Let's face it; some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow. Das no gonna happen neva! OMFG This stupid loser kid who can't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom. Right as he dies, he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow. The drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it. We later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with \"Takes one to know one, loser!\" The scarecrow flips off the building, calls him \"daddy-o\", and then beheads the poor man. We can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that. He goes on to kill many people, afterward. He mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people, just for some laughs. No laughing here. He adds a punchline to every kill, too. Every time he killed someone, he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines. In the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say \"Here, have an EAR of corn!\" then shove it up their ass. OR we can actually take an example from the movie! He just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him. Her father, the sheriff, yelled to the madman to stop, and he said \"Hey, stay awhile!\" and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree. In the end of the movie, he killed two guys and threw in the punchline \"Gotta split!\" and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad.

{"value":"This juvenile, bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens' bodies, desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? By burning up gas and equating a fast, reckless car (or plane) with freedom.<br /><br />The plot borrows heavily from Mister Rogers' neighborhood (if it were run my an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style).<br /><br />Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world in which an all-powerful government doesn't want you to (*ahem*) drive your car and burn gas. Sort of the opposite of today's Enron-and-Bush, oil-grabbing, SUV-pushing government.<br /><br />This juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable. But wait...there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we're not shown any signs of future technology, beyond a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks... exactly like today. Same clothing, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternate energy.<br /><br />The acting is flat and flavorless. Even scenes which could have been gritty or moving, buddy-flick, honor, romance, horror... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase.<br /><br />Continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.<br /><br />The plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a Dukes of Hazzard episode.<br /><br />Even die-hard car-film and SF fans should avoid this film like month-old roadkill, unless you enjoy heckling Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank.","finished_norm":["thi","juvenil","bland","flick","be","strictli","for","teenag","in","old","men","bodi","desper","to","reliv","their","hormon","challeng","teenag","year","how","by","burn","up","ga","and","equat","a","fast","reckless","car","or","plane","with","freedombr","br","the","plot","borrow","heavili","from","mister","roger","neighborhood","if","it","be","run","my","a","oil","conglomer","and","logan","run","if","it","be","heavili","sedat","and","lack","a","clear","sens","of","stylebr","br","star","lee","major","and","burgess","meredith","thi","film","be","set","in","a","postgascrisi","world","in","which","a","allpow","govern","doe","not","want","you","to","ahem","drive","your","car","and","burn","ga","sort","of","the","opposit","of","todai","enronandbush","oilgrab","suvpush","governmentbr","br","thi","juxtaposit","alon","make","the","film","laughabl","but","waitther","much","although","the","film","be","set","in","the","futur","we","re","not","show","ani","sign","of","futur","technologi","beyond","a","return","to","bicycl","golf","cart","and","hors","you","will","believ","that","the","futur","look","exactli","like","todai","same","cloth","same","suburban","hous","same","green","lawn","a","todai","and","when","the","film","be","make","there","be","no","solar","panel","no","windmil","no","concess","to","altern","energybr","br","the","act","be","flat","and","flavorless","even","scene","which","can","have","be","gritti","or","move","buddyflick","honor","romanc","horror","all","fall","flat","than","a","paper","doll","under","a","briefcasebr","br","continu","be","lack","the","jet","fly","by","burgess","meredith","charact","chang","color","and","configur","from","moment","to","moment","a","the","filmmak","insult","our","intellig","with","unmatch","stock","footag","again","and","againbr","br","the","plot","be","a","moron","and","onli","half","a","excit","a","a","duke","of","hazzard","episodebr","br","even","diehard","carfilm","and","sf","fan","should","avoid","thi","film","like","monthold","roadkil","unless","you","enjoi","heckl","exxon","execut","try","to","make","a","movi","a","empti","a","the","hero","ga","tank"],"filtered":["thi","juvenil","bland","flick","strictli","teenag","old","men","bodi","desper","reliv","hormon","challeng","teenag","year","burn","ga","equat","fast","reckless","car","plane","freedombr","br","plot","borrow","heavili","mister","roger","neighborhood","run","oil","conglomer","logan","run","heavili","sedat","lack","clear","sens","stylebr","br","star","lee","major","burgess","meredith","thi","film","set","postgascrisi","world","allpow","govern","doe","want","ahem","drive","car","burn","ga","sort","opposit","todai","enronandbush","oilgrab","suvpush","governmentbr","br","thi","juxtaposit","alon","make","film","laughabl","waitther","much","although","film","set","futur","re","show","ani","sign","futur","technologi","beyond","return","bicycl","golf","cart","hors","believ","futur","look","exactli","like","todai","cloth","suburban","hous","green","lawn","todai","film","make","solar","panel","windmil","concess","altern","energybr","br","act","flat","flavorless","even","scene","gritti","move","buddyflick","honor","romanc","horror","fall","flat","paper","doll","briefcasebr","br","continu","lack","jet","fly","burgess","meredith","charact","chang","color","configur","moment","moment","filmmak","insult","intellig","unmatch","stock","footag","againbr","br","plot","moron","onli","half","excit","duke","hazzard","episodebr","br","even","diehard","carfilm","sf","fan","avoid","thi","film","like","monthold","roadkil","unless","enjoi","heckl","exxon","execut","try","make","movi","empti","hero","ga","tank"],"filtered2":["juvenil","bland","flick","strictli","teenag","old","men","bodi","desper","reliv","hormon","challeng","teenag","year","burn","ga","equat","fast","reckless","car","plane","freedombr","plot","borrow","heavili","mister","roger","neighborhood","run","oil","conglomer","logan","run","heavili","sedat","lack","clear","sens","stylebr","star","lee","major","burgess","meredith","set","postgascrisi","world","allpow","govern","doe","want","ahem","drive","car","burn","ga","sort","opposit","todai","enronandbush","oilgrab","suvpush","governmentbr","juxtaposit","alon","make","laughabl","waitther","although","set","futur","re","show","ani","sign","futur","technologi","beyond","return","bicycl","golf","cart","hors","believ","futur","look","exactli","like","todai","cloth","suburban","hous","green","lawn","todai","make","solar","panel","windmil","concess","altern","energybr","act","flat","flavorless","even","scene","gritti","move","buddyflick","honor","romanc","horror","fall","flat","paper","doll","briefcasebr","continu","lack","jet","fly","burgess","meredith","charact","chang","color","configur","moment","moment","filmmak","insult","intellig","unmatch","stock","footag","againbr","plot","moron","onli","half","excit","duke","hazzard","episodebr","even","diehard","carfilm","sf","fan","avoid","like","monthold"

{"value":"I'm Irish and I've been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission. And I will go on record as saying:<br /><br />THIS FILM IS AWFUL.<br /><br />It is not quite as bad a something like \"The Most Fertile Man in Ireland\" but it definitely does not stand up there with other Irish films such as The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film are actually quite funny, such as Colm Meaneys American-style garda. But the film itself is shot completely wrong. The bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom-in, zoom-out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama. But it isn't. This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like this. It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next. The film just looks sloppy and thrown together.<br /><br />The performances are okay, given the awful script. A friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He gives a decent display as a Dublin Dirtbag, but it no way compares to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman. I think she should leave her god-awful stand-up and focus more on her acting.<br /><br />All in all, its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the Irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best Irish films ever.<br /><br />I'm expecting a backlash from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great. But before you reply, ask yourself: Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America?","finished_norm":["i","be","irish","and","i","have","be","live","in","denmark","for","a","while","so","i","be","look","forward","to","go","home","last","week","so","i","can","see","intermiss","and","i","will","go","on","record","a","sayingbr","br","thi","film","be","awfulbr","br","it","be","not","quit","a","bad","a","someth","like","the","much","fertil","man","in","ireland","but","it","definit","doe","not","stand","up","there","with","other","irish","film","such","a","the","commit","i","go","down","or","michael","collinsbr","br","some","aspect","of","the","film","be","actual","quit","funni","such","a","colm","meanei","americanstyl","garda","but","the","film","itself","be","shoot","complet","wrong","the","bounc","around","of","the","camera","and","the","constant","zoomin","zoomout","try","to","give","the","film","a","edgi","look","a","if","it","be","a","gritti","drama","but","it","be","not","thi","be","a","irish","lock","stock","and","two","smoke","barrel","and","it","should","be","shoot","like","thi","it","should","have","smooth","movem","from","on","shoot","to","the","next","the","film","just","look","sloppi","and","throw","togetherbr","br","the","perform","be","okai","give","the","aw","script","a","friend","of","mine","sai","to","me","like","it","be","like","thei","just","follow","colin","farrel","around","dublin","for","a","week","he","give","a","decent","displai","a","a","dublin","dirtbag","but","it","no","wai","compar","to","hi","perform","in","minor","report","tigerland","or","phone","booth","the","well","perform","be","from","dierdr","o","kane","who","plai","a","sexual","frustrat","middleag","woman","who","have","just","be","dump","by","her","bank","manag","husband","for","a","young","woman","i","think","she","should","leav","her","godaw","standup","and","focu","much","on","her","actingbr","br","all","in","all","it","doe","in","no","wai","live","up","to","the","expect","put","on","it","by","the","irish","press","or","deserv","to","be","even","consid","a","on","of","the","well","irish","film","everbr","br","i","be","expect","a","backlash","from","thi","comment","becaus","much","peopl","i","have","speak","to","have","sai","it","be","great","but","befor","you","repli","ask","yourself","would","think","so","highli","of","thi","movi","if","it","be","set","in","england","or","america"],"filtered":["irish","live","denmark","look","forward","go","home","last","week","see","intermiss","go","record","sayingbr","br","thi","film","awfulbr","br","quit","bad","someth","like","much","fertil","man","ireland","definit","doe","stand","irish","film","commit","go","michael","collinsbr","br","aspect","film","actual","quit","funni","colm","meanei","americanstyl","garda","film","shoot","complet","wrong","bounc","around","camera","constant","zoomin","zoomout","try","give","film","edgi","look","gritti","drama","thi","irish","lock","stock","two","smoke","barrel","shoot","like","thi","smooth","movem","shoot","next","film","look","sloppi","throw","togetherbr","br","perform","okai","give","aw","script","friend","mine","sai","like","like","thei","follow","colin","farrel","around","dublin","week","give","decent","displai","dublin","dirtbag","wai","compar","hi","perform","minor","report","tigerland","phone","booth","well","perform","dierdr","o","kane","plai","sexual","frustrat","middleag","woman","dump","bank","manag","husband","young","woman","think","leav","godaw","standup","focu","much","actingbr","br","doe","wai","live","expect","put","irish","press","deserv","even","consid","well","irish","film","everbr","br","expect","backlash","thi","comment","becaus","much","peopl","speak","sai","great","befor","repli","ask","think","highli","thi","movi","set","england","america"],"filtered2":["irish","live","denmark","look","forward","go","home","last","week","see","intermiss","go","record","sayingbr","awfulbr","quit","bad","someth","like","fertil","man","ireland","definit","doe","stand","irish","commit","go","michael","collinsbr","aspect","actual","quit","funni","colm","meanei","americanstyl","garda","shoot","complet","wrong","bounc","around","camera","constant","zoomin","zoomout","try","give","edgi","look","gritti","drama","irish","lock","stock","two","smoke","barrel","shoot","like","smooth","movem","shoot","next","look","sloppi","throw","togetherbr","perform","okai","give","aw","script","friend","mine","like","like","follow","colin","farrel","around","dublin","week","give","decent","displai","dublin","dirtbag","wai","compar","perform","minor","report","tigerland","phone","booth","well","perform","dierdr","o","kane","plai","sexual","frustrat","middleag","woman","dump","bank","manag","husband","young","woman","think","leav","godaw","standup","focu","actingbr","doe","wai","live","expect","put","irish","press","deserv","even","consid","well","irish","everbr","expect","backlash","comment","becaus","peopl","speak","great","befor","repli","ask","think","highli","set","england","america"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2

{"value":"You can't imagine how I looked forward to King of the Ants. As a massive Gordon fan, I awaited the European premiere with wicked anticipation.especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon's last achievement - so much. King of the Ants premiered here in my country and it was Gordon himself who came to present it. Unfortunately, I couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards. King of the Ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. Really, the quality level never surpassed ordinary TV-thriller standards. The plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical Gordon-touch is never recognized. On top of that, the already weak script has more holes than a Swiss bowl of cheese! It involves a young wannabe-crook who's hired to commit a murder. So he does.and of course they're not paying him.and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife.and of course he avenges himself.. Only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a Stuart Gordon film. The acting performances are below average with McCenna as the heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson' Wendt as the chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the make-up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur-horror fans. I read a few other comments on King of the Ants, claiming it's Gordon's best since it finally is a thought-provoking and mature film.Well, if that's the case.I rather stay immature and give Re-Animator another viewing, thank you very much. Oh well, I guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually.too bad it also overcame Stuart

{"value":"When I heard the plot for this movie I simply had to see it, I mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! Sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.<br /><br />Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn who never takes his SCUBA outfit off and Lt. Finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind) 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' is a parody of B-Movies, in particular Japanese horror of the 1950's. The film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses! To be fair there are a couple of funny moments, for instance anytime the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an American accent, or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey, can somebody please pass the ketchup?'. Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. Unfortunately for 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy. For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. The singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre, even for this film. Ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult one; I can't see many people being indifferent to it.

{"value":"WOW! Why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be. HPD2 has no clue of what it wants to be. It just exists on screen for reasons I cant explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch(played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried. In the jail, a riot breaks out between rival inmates, one of them gets shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. During a conjugal visit, Twitch's fiancée and Burke's(played by Bill Goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by Cortez and are held in an execution room. Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that Cortez has their loved ones.<br /><br />Opinion: This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the acting is horrendous, the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do. Nobody in this \"movie\" believes in the characters they play. Nobody in this \"movie can be taken seriously as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed of himself. His character \"Twitch\" is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by Burke or the other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a PHD(pretty huge dump). The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when action is happening! Don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent. It stinks and is a prime reason why people despise

{"value":"I once used Wesley Snipes' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new, untried film in which he appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes-Method of film recommendation has failed. Utterly. I should first have come here to see these reviews.<br /><br />Snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in \"The Contractor\".<br /><br />One of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition. I feared that the shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, \"unconsidered\" directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass-directed \"Bloody Sunday\") might propagate to other films. Greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films. My fear had come to pass. In my opinion, these films are made really bad by these motion-sickness-inducing methods, which mistake blurry swipes for \"action-enhancement\". But the \"Bourne Franchise,\" as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast, big bucks.<br /><br />Read my lips, you Hollywood types. Action needs to be clearly photographed and presented, not merely hinted at by poor, lazy cinematographic techniques.<br /><br />And \"The Contractor\" goes so far as to emulate \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" in inanely-repeated sound bites, in hopes their juvenile (apparently-evaluated) audiences can't sense them. For example, if I hear a cop radio crackling \"Yankee-Romeo\" one more time, I'll just scream.

{"value":"This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level, so my brother and I watched it. Boy did it suck. Boy gets crush on girl--correction, his *dream*-girl (apparently there is a difference; and I'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl--he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away. I guess that just goes to show the power of dream-girls), boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream-girl (creative in the sense that it's a far-out plan, but un-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up), awkward situations ensue, a match is made (all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon--either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting, or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day-jobs to come to the set; I suspect the latter). Very clumsily done, very pathetic. It's almost never even amusing *accidentally*, so there really is nothing to redeem it. Unless you're interested in seeing Chad Lowe's early days, before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the HIV-positive gay guy on the series \"Life Goes On\", or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably got to stare at Dennis Franz's buttocks). But those are unlikely motives--I'd say \"systematic derangement of the senses\" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised I watched it all. I guess it's the kind of thing where, halfway through, you find yourself *still* watching due to some morbid, self-flagellistic inner-issue, and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie, on the off-chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health.

{"value":"I have watched anime but I'm not a die hard fan; and I don't read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background. I have seen \"St. John's Wort,\" and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, it made me pick up \"Shinobi,\" especially since everyone seems to love it.<br /><br />Well, I watched it this afternoon, and fought very hard to keep watching. Yes, it's very beautiful - the slow motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the CGI eye flicker - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall this was dull as dirt.<br /><br />It seemed as if someone took \"Romeo and Juliet\" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw in some \"X-Men\" for good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the grey-haired guy had his ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do they give these women such dumb powers? Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death. Man, that's some great power for you. And the other girl, can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands. The other woman, one of the star crossed lovers, has the power of a hypnotic stare. Wow.<br /><br />I sort of made it to the end of the film, by fast forwarding it, and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people are comparing this to \"House of Flying Daggers\" and \"Hero.\" Don't make that mistake. They may share similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. \"Shinobi\" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker.<br /><br />I would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old.","finished_norm":["i","have","watch","anim","but","i","be","not","a","die","hard","fan","and","i","do","not","read","manga","i","sai","thi","becaus","mani","of","the","review","who","be","wax","lyric","about","thi","film","seem","to","have","that","background","i","have","see","st","john","wort","and","although","it","be","not","a","masterpiec","by","ani","stretch","of","the","imagin","it","make","me","pick","up","shinobi","especi","sinc","everyon","seem","to","love","itbr","br","good","i","watch","it","thi","afternoon","and","fight","veri","hard","to","keep","watch","ye","it","veri","beauti","the","slow","motion","water","scene","the","autumn","leav","on","the","tree","even","the","cgi","ey","flicker","majest","i","like","the","hawk","the","costum","even","some","of","the","fight","scene","but","overal","thi","be","dull","a","dirtbr","br","it","seem","a","if","someon","take","romeo","and","juliet","the","translat","even","mention","that","thei","be","star","cross","lover","and","throw","in","some","xmen","for","good","measur","two","of","the","charact","split","wolverin","power","the","gui","dress","in","a","bear","costum","have","hi","claw","and","the","greyhair","gui","have","hi","abil","to","heal","himself","then","you","have","the","girl","who","have","a","poison","kiss","that","poison","ivi","from","batman","why","do","thei","give","thi","woman","such","dumb","power","poison","girl","show","her","leg","then","kiss","you","to","death","man","that","some","great","power","for","you","and","the","other","girl","can","creat","bug","from","thi","yellow","dust","that","she","rub","on","her","hand","the","other","woman","on","of","the","star","cross","lover","have","the","power","of","a","hypnot","stare","wowbr","br","i","sort","of","make","it","to","the","end","of","the","film","by","fast","forward","it","and","do","see","a","bite","much","tragedi","than","i","expect","some","peopl","be","compar","thi","to","hous","of","fly","dagger","and","hero","do","not","make","that","mistak","thei","mai","share","similar","end","but","that","where","the","similar","end","shinobi","be","make","by","a","amateur","the","other","film","be","make","by","a","experi","filmmakerbr","br","i","would","sai","avoid","thi","film","unless","you","re","to","year","old"],"filtered":["watch","anim","die","hard","fan","read","manga","sai","thi","becaus","mani","review","wax","lyric","thi","film","seem","background","see","st","john","wort","although","masterpiec","ani","stretch","imagin","make","pick","shinobi","especi","sinc","everyon","seem","love","itbr","br","good","watch","thi","afternoon","fight","veri","hard","keep","watch","ye","veri","beauti","slow","motion","water","scene","autumn","leav","tree","even","cgi","ey","flicker","majest","like","hawk","costum","even","fight","scene","overal","thi","dull","dirtbr","br","seem","someon","take","romeo","juliet","translat","even","mention","thei","star","cross","lover","throw","xmen","good","measur","two","charact","split","wolverin","power","gui","dress","bear","costum","hi","claw","greyhair","gui","hi","abil","heal","girl","poison","kiss","poison","ivi","batman","thei","give","thi","woman","dumb","power","poison","girl","show","leg","kiss","death","man","great","power","girl","creat","bug","thi","yellow","dust","rub","hand","woman","star","cross","lover","power","hypnot","stare","wowbr","br","sort","make","end","film","fast","forward","see","bite","much","tragedi","expect","peopl","compar","thi","hous","fly","dagger","hero","make","mistak","thei","mai","share","similar","end","similar","end","shinobi","make","amateur","film","make","experi","filmmakerbr","br","sai","avoid","thi","film","unless","re","year","old"],"filtered2":["watch","anim","die","hard","fan","read","manga","becaus","mani","review","wax","lyric","seem","background","see","st","john","wort","although","masterpiec","ani","stretch","imagin","make","pick","shinobi","especi","sinc","everyon","seem","love","itbr","good","watch","afternoon","fight","veri","hard","keep","watch","ye","veri","beauti","slow","motion","water","scene","autumn","leav","tree","even","cgi","ey","flicker","majest","like","hawk","costum","even","fight","scene","overal","dull","dirtbr","seem","someon","take","romeo","juliet","translat","even","mention","star","cross","lover","throw","xmen","good","measur","two","charact","split","wolverin","power","gui","dress","bear","costum","claw","greyhair","gui","abil","heal","girl","poison","kiss","poison","ivi","batman","give","woman","dumb","power","poison","girl","show","leg","kiss","death","man","great","power","girl","creat","bug","yellow","dust","rub","hand","woman","star","cross","lover","power","hypnot","stare","wowbr","sort","make","end","fast","forward","see","bite","tragedi","expect","peopl","compar","hous","fly","dagger","hero","make","mistak","mai","share","similar","end","similar","end","shinobi","make","amateur","make","experi","filmmakerbr","avoid","unless","re","year","old"],"features":{"type"

{"value":"Take \"Rambo,\" mix in some \"Miami Vice,\" slice the budget about 80%, and you've got something that a few ten-year-old boys could come up with if they have a big enough backyard & too much access to \"Penthouse.\" Cop and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as gritty as they come) is recruited to retrieve an American supertank that has been stolen & hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank were hardbitten Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBain's former love Devon (Fluegel), the officer in command & now meat for the depraved terrorists/spies/drug peddlers, who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For an action movie with depraved sex, there's a dearth of action and not much sex. The running joke is that McBain gets shot all the time & survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently the writers didn't see \"The Magnificent Seven\" (\"The man for us is the one who GAVE him that face\"), nor thought to give McBain even a pretense of intelligence. Even for a budget actioner, the production values are poor, with distant shots during dialog and very little movement. The main prop, the tank, is silly enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who might have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a far bigger role in \"Crime Story\" than Julia!) has to go from simpering to frightened to butt-kicking & back again on an instant's notice. Jones, who's been in an amazing array of films, pretty much hits bottom right here. Both he & Busey were probably just out for some easy money & a couple of laughs. Look for talented, future character actor Danny Trejo (\"Heat,\" \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\") in a stereotyped, menacing bit part. Much too dull even for a guilty pleasure, \"Bulletproof\" is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house but want people to think there's someone

{"value":"I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, over and over, is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic political scientist, trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe, because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I relate to Megan. Besides, she's cute. She's no super model, but more of a cute girl next door.<br /><br />OK, so she cried and screamed a lot. It's very dramatic, and seems overdone, but doesn't it fit her character? She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think she made her argument very well. Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face. I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Furthermore, I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in.<br /><br />As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. It had excellent gore scenes, by micro-budget standards. The plot maybe took a quick thought, hardly any contemplation. It's basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film, which the name implies. I love the sadism of the doctor. He kept ripping Megan's shirt off, not just for the cause of sleaze (though largely so), but also to torment her, before he kills her. The Chainsaw hick was hilarious. For slasher film lovers, he was probably the best character.<br /><br />I give this film 4 out of 10. It had a good setting, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro-budget horror.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","sever","good","review","that","have","defend","and","critis","the","variou","aspect","of","thi","film","on","thing","i","see","over","and","over","be","annoy","with","megan","the","idealist","polit","scientist","try","to","chang","the","world","i","love","her","charact","mayb","becaus","i","be","a","year","old","polit","scienc","student","and","i","think","i","be","go","to","chang","the","world","too","so","i","relat","to","megan","besid","she","cute","she","no","super","model","but","much","of","a","cute","girl","next","doorbr","br","okai","so","she","cry","and","scream","a","lot","it","veri","dramat","and","seem","overdo","but","doe","not","it","fit","her","charact","she","go","on","that","show","with","the","intent","of","sacrific","her","life","to","prove","a","point","she","think","peopl","who","enjoi","such","a","show","be","sick","i","think","she","make","her","argum","veri","good","of","cours","be","a","young","naiv","girl","she","be","terrifi","of","what","she","be","about","to","face","i","think","her","act","accur","portrai","a","young","girl","show","moral","courag","despit","her","overwhelm","fear","furthermor","i","think","she","maintain","a","certain","digniti","throughout","the","film","despit","the","desper","situat","she","be","inbr","br","a","for","the","movi","in","gener","other","than","megan","it","be","pretti","much","what","i","expect","it","have","excel","gore","scene","by","microbudget","standard","the","plot","mayb","take","a","quick","think","hardli","ani","contempl","it","basic","just","a","dark","humorist","senseless","slasher","film","which","the","name","impli","i","love","the","sadism","of","the","doctor","he","keep","rip","megan","shirt","off","not","just","for","the","caus","of","sleaz","though","larg","so","but","conjur","to","torment","her","befor","he","kill","her","the","chainsaw","hick","be","hilari","for","slasher","film","lover","he","be","probabl","the","well","characterbr","br","i","give","thi","film","out","of","it","have","a","good","set","almost","no","plot","and","a","mix","of","good","and","terribl","act","i","would","recommend","it","for","a","cheap","thrill","but","hardli","a","diamond","in","the","rough","that","be","microbudget","horror"],"filtered":["read","sever","good","review","defend","critis","variou","aspect","thi","film","thing","see","annoy","megan","idealist","polit","scientist","try","chang","world","love","charact","mayb","becaus","year","old","polit","scienc","student","think","go","chang","world","relat","megan","besid","cute","super","model","much","cute","girl","next","doorbr","br","okai","cry","scream","lot","veri","dramat","seem","overdo","doe","fit","charact","go","show","intent","sacrific","life","prove","point","think","peopl","enjoi","show","sick","think","make","argum","veri","good","cours","young","naiv","girl","terrifi","face","think","act","accur","portrai","young","girl","show","moral","courag","despit","overwhelm","fear","furthermor","think","maintain","certain","digniti","throughout","film","despit","desper","situat","inbr","br","movi","gener","megan","pretti","much","expect","excel","gore","scene","microbudget","standard","plot","mayb","take","quick","think","hardli","ani","contempl","basic","dark","humorist","senseless","slasher","film","name","impli","love","sadism","doctor","keep","rip","megan","shirt","caus","sleaz","though","larg","conjur","torment","befor","kill","chainsaw","hick","hilari","slasher","film","lover","probabl","well","characterbr","br","give","thi","film","good","set","almost","plot","mix","good","terribl","act","recommend","cheap","thrill","hardli","diamond","rough","microbudget","horror"],"filtered2":["read","sever","good","review","defend","critis","variou","aspect","thing","see","annoy","megan","idealist","polit","scientist","try","chang","world","love","charact","mayb","becaus","year","old","polit","scienc","student","think","go","chang","world","relat","megan","besid","cute","super","model","cute","girl","next","doorbr","okai","cry","scream","lot","veri","dramat","seem","overdo","doe","fit","charact","go","show","intent","sacrific","life","prove","point","think","peopl","enjoi","show","sick","think","make","argum","veri","good","cours","young","naiv","girl","terrifi","face","think","act","accur","portrai","young","girl","show","moral","courag","despit","overwhelm","fear","furthermor","think","maintain","certain","digniti","throughout","despit","desper","situat","inbr","gener","megan","pretti","expect","excel","gore","scene","microbudget","standard","plot","mayb","take","quick","think","hardli","ani","contempl","basic","dark","humorist","senseless","slasher","name","impli","love","sadism","doctor","keep","rip","megan","shirt","caus","sleaz","though","larg","conjur","torment","befor","kill","chainsaw","hick","hilari","slasher","lover","probabl","well","characterbr","give","good","set","almost","plot","mix","good","terribl","act","recommend","cheap","thrill",

{"value":"**1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce.<br /><br />Someone should tell Ms. Keaton, enough with your Annie Hall philosophy and hats.<br /><br />This flick is just too much as Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives.<br /><br />Keaton, who could not be reached by phone at first, as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug, grieves in a new way for grievers.<br /><br />She retreats to the summer locale where all of Sara's friends are staying. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed. It appears that sweet Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter. In addition, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We're all now put on this guilt trip.<br /><br />Her only hope is to find the elusive diary that Sara kept. She also hopes that boyfriend,Adam, who is a playwright, will not include all this in another play.<br /><br />When the diary is found, it has been written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D in this language. It's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a Japanese cook in a Japanese restaurant.<br /><br />Naturally, everything seems to tie up nicely in the end. <br /><br />The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time mom and Sara would speak, they would both utter Surrender Dorothy.<br /><br />As if this isn't enough, during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen in his film, Interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate Ingmar Bergman. Ms. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, folks, can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this? <br /><br />Fair to mediocre best sums up this

{"value":"Before I'd seen this, I had seen some pretty bad Christmas films. But once I saw this, \"Jingle All the Way\" looked better than \"The Godfather\". \"Santa Claus\" is a jolly film about Santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels demonic watching it. Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that I'm sure has turned many kids off of Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits along with all of the performances and dialog. Santa lives high above Earth in the North Pole where he, and kids from all around the world get ready for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty, and by creating diversions, like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot. When Pitch causes Santa to be attacked by a dog, it's up to Santa's helper Pedro and Merlin the wizard to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /><br />Everything about this film, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than Santa. Santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in Mexico. The reindeer are wind up toys, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes...it's frightening. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organ while kids sing to it. Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while Pitch dances around in pain. I think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from, than showing them this. The only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 85

{"value":"Put a DVD of this flick in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1-to-10-star scale.<br /><br />Bill Cosby and Ray Romano have been at the top - in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually - with their television series'. Yet each has had no success in big-screen offerings. This has also been true for other TV personalities - perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10-minute skit, or at most, the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half-hour program.<br /><br />This film, however, doesn't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on a screen or stage.<br /><br />Its origination date is listed as 2002, but release date - to DVD only - is shown as 2004. It also was filmed not long before Rodney Dangerfield's death, so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs.<br /><br />I'd never heard of it, but found it when turning-on my set, and frankly became fascinated by it. Some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse - so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is the best example - and the Bruce Jenner/Village People opus, \"Can't Stop the Music,\" is another.<br /><br />Unfortunately this flick falls short even there. Even if Rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his fellow cast-members') fell short of \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Casablanca,\" there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this presentation doesn't seem to possess even a minute or two's worth of such material.","finished_norm":["put","a","dvd","of","thi","flick","in","a","time","capsul","and","it","will","definit","illustr","for","futur","gener","a","perfect","exampl","of","on","which","warrant","the","minim","rate","on","a","tostar","scalebr","br","bill","cosbi","and","rai","romano","have","be","at","the","top","in","rate","and","with","ten","of","million","in","earn","annual","with","their","televis","seri","yet","each","have","have","no","success","in","bigscreen","offer","thi","have","conjur","be","true","for","other","tv","person","perhap","becaus","mani","of","the","stori","which","be","present","for","two","hour","or","so","seem","much","suit","to","either","a","minut","skit","or","at","much","the","or","minut","of","drama","dure","a","halfhour","programbr","br","thi","film","howev","doe","not","have","on","singl","elem","which","would","warrant","two","or","three","minut","of","time","on","mad","tv","snl","or","anywher","els","on","a","screen","or","stagebr","br","it","origin","date","be","list","a","but","releas","date","to","dvd","onli","be","show","a","it","conjur","be","film","not","long","befor","rodnei","dangerfield","death","so","it","on","redeem","valu","be","that","it","probabl","provid","at","leas","a","few","hundr","thousand","much","dollar","for","hi","heirsbr","br","i","have","never","hear","of","it","but","find","it","when","turningon","my","set","and","frankli","becom","fascin","by","it","some","movi","be","so","truli","aw","that","thei","rate","a","sort","of","top","rate","in","revers","so","bad","that","you","can","move","the","dial","backward","to","a","or","plan","from","outer","space","be","the","well","exampl","and","the","bruce","jennervillag","peopl","opu","ca","not","stop","the","music","be","anotherbr","br","unfortun","thi","flick","fall","short","even","there","even","if","rodnei","earli","work","a","good","a","some","of","hi","fellow","castmemb","fall","short","of","citizen","kane","or","casablanca","there","be","mani","moment","of","humor","and","a","stori","provid","at","littl","a","modicum","of","interestbr","br","unfortun","thi","present","doe","not","seem","to","possess","even","a","minut","or","two","worth","of","such","materi"],"filtered":["put","dvd","thi","flick","time","capsul","definit","illustr","futur","gener","perfect","exampl","warrant","minim","rate","tostar","scalebr","br","bill","cosbi","rai","romano","top","rate","ten","million","earn","annual","televis","seri","yet","success","bigscreen","offer","thi","conjur","true","tv","person","perhap","becaus","mani","stori","present","two","hour","seem","much","suit","either","minut","skit","much","minut","drama","dure","halfhour","programbr","br","thi","film","howev","doe","singl","elem","warrant","two","three","minut","time","mad","tv","snl","anywher","els","screen","stagebr","br","origin","date","list","releas","date","dvd","onli","show","conjur","film","long","befor","rodnei","dangerfield","death","redeem","valu","probabl","provid","leas","hundr","thousand","much","dollar","hi","heirsbr","br","never","hear","find","turningon","set","frankli","becom","fascin","movi","truli","aw","thei","rate","sort","top","rate","revers","bad","move","dial","backward","plan","outer","space","well","exampl","bruce","jennervillag","peopl","opu","ca","stop","music","anotherbr","br","unfortun","thi","flick","fall","short","even","even","rodnei","earli","work","good","hi","fellow","castmemb","fall","short","citizen","kane","casablanca","mani","moment","humor","stori","provid","littl","modicum","interestbr","br","unfortun","thi","present","doe","seem","possess","even","minut","two","worth","materi"],"filtered2":["put","dvd","flick","time","capsul","definit","illustr","futur","gener","perfect","exampl","warrant","minim","rate","tostar","scalebr","bill","cosbi","rai","romano","top","rate","ten","million","earn","annual","televis","yet","success","bigscreen","offer","conjur","true","tv","person","perhap","becaus","mani","stori","present","two","hour","seem","suit","either","minut","skit","minut","drama","dure","halfhour","programbr","howev","doe","singl","elem","warrant","two","three","minut","time","mad","tv","snl","anywher","els","screen","stagebr","origin","date","list","releas","date","dvd","onli","show","conjur","long","befor","rodnei","dangerfield","death","redeem","valu","probabl","provid","leas","hundr","thousand","dollar","heirsbr","never","hear","find","turningon","set","frankli","becom","fascin","truli","aw","rate","sort","top","rate","revers","bad","move","dial","backward","plan","outer","space","well","exampl","bruce","jennervillag","peopl","opu","ca","stop","music","anotherbr","unfortun","flick","fall","short","even","even","rodnei","earli","work","good","fellow","castmemb","fall","short","citizen","kane","casablanca","mani","moment","humor","stori","provid","littl","modicum","interestbr","unfortun","present","doe","seem","possess","even","minut","two","worth","materi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,8

{"value":"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home \"My Wrongs...\" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, \"a short film including scenes\"). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.<br /><br />The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend \"Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life\", by Peter Capaldi.","finished_norm":["be","a","filmmak","myself","and","possess","a","somewhat","dark","and","subvers","sens","of","humour","i","think","i","be","in","for","a","treat","when","i","take","home","my","wrong","not","that","the","dvd","cover","give","anyth","awai","instead","opt","for","the","ambigu","quot","from","controversialist","director","chri","morri","a","short","film","includ","scene","i","should","have","know","well","realli","and","avoid","thi","insipid","and","often","offens","piec","of","twoddlebr","br","the","scene","in","the","church","be","repuls","to","watch","especi","sinc","we","be","all","too","familiar","with","morri","warp","attitud","toward","paedophilia","from","hi","notori","tv","seri","brass","ey","and","serv","no","purpos","other","than","to","shock","how","thi","film","be","label","a","comedi","i","will","never","understandbr","br","the","runner","commentari","sound","like","a","novel","idea","in","principl","have","be","a","runner","myself","it","often","a","interest","and","uninhibit","perspect","on","the","filmmak","process","howev","thi","be","sadli","not","the","case","here","instead","we","be","treat","to","some","public","schoolboi","rant","about","dog","on","film","befor","conclud","that","there","be","no","realli","great","movi","star","dog","thi","be","all","veri","interest","but","not","worth","a","singl","frame","of","celluloidbr","br","to","sai","that","thi","film","go","nowher","would","be","a","understat","it","reli","far","too","heavili","upon","it","heighten","styl","at","the","expens","of","plot","charact","and","dialogu","leav","the","viewer","strang","perturb","and","unfulfil","it","oversimplifi","messag","that","man","should","take","respons","for","hi","action","be","both","glaringli","obviou","and","poorli","illustratedbr","br","the","film","doe","have","it","moment","of","pseudokafkaesqu","surreal","but","ultim","it","fail","to","convinc","to","entertain","to","enlighten","and","just","end","up","be","irrit","if","you","want","to","see","a","realli","great","piec","of","short","filmmak","i","strongli","recommend","franz","kafka","it","a","wonder","life","by","peter","capaldi"],"filtered":["filmmak","possess","somewhat","dark","subvers","sens","humour","think","treat","take","home","wrong","dvd","cover","give","anyth","awai","instead","opt","ambigu","quot","controversialist","director","chri","morri","short","film","includ","scene","know","well","realli","avoid","thi","insipid","often","offens","piec","twoddlebr","br","scene","church","repuls","watch","especi","sinc","familiar","morri","warp","attitud","toward","paedophilia","hi","notori","tv","seri","brass","ey","serv","purpos","shock","thi","film","label","comedi","never","understandbr","br","runner","commentari","sound","like","novel","idea","principl","runner","often","interest","uninhibit","perspect","filmmak","process","howev","thi","sadli","case","instead","treat","public","schoolboi","rant","dog","film","befor","conclud","realli","great","movi","star","dog","thi","veri","interest","worth","singl","frame","celluloidbr","br","sai","thi","film","go","nowher","understat","reli","far","heavili","upon","heighten","styl","expens","plot","charact","dialogu","leav","viewer","strang","perturb","unfulfil","oversimplifi","messag","man","take","respons","hi","action","glaringli","obviou","poorli","illustratedbr","br","film","doe","moment","pseudokafkaesqu","surreal","ultim","fail","convinc","entertain","enlighten","end","irrit","want","see","realli","great","piec","short","filmmak","strongli","recommend","franz","kafka","wonder","life","peter","capaldi"],"filtered2":["filmmak","possess","somewhat","dark","subvers","sens","humour","think","treat","take","home","wrong","dvd","cover","give","anyth","awai","instead","opt","ambigu","quot","controversialist","director","chri","morri","short","includ","scene","know","well","realli","avoid","insipid","often","offens","piec","twoddlebr","scene","church","repuls","watch","especi","sinc","familiar","morri","warp","attitud","toward","paedophilia","notori","tv","brass","ey","serv","purpos","shock","label","comedi","never","understandbr","runner","commentari","sound","like","novel","idea","principl","runner","often","interest","uninhibit","perspect","filmmak","process","howev","sadli","case","instead","treat","public","schoolboi","rant","dog","befor","conclud","realli","great","star","dog","veri","interest","worth","singl","frame","celluloidbr","go","nowher","understat","reli","far","heavili","upon","heighten","styl","expens","plot","charact","dialogu","leav","viewer","strang","perturb","unfulfil","oversimplifi","messag","man","take","respons","action","glaringli","obviou","poorli","illustratedbr","doe","moment","pseudokafkaesqu","surreal","ultim","fail","convinc","entertain","enlighten","end","irrit","want","see","realli","great","piec","short","filmmak","strongli","recommend","franz","kafka","wonder","life","peter","capaldi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,

{"value":"The screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life I'll never get back (where have I heard this before). The acting is so-so. Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen. Nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie, which didn't make a whole lot of sense in the end, cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story, except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoon-feed explanations for every detail that the first movie didn't answer. The comic thing is, the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird, and tries to explain them. But the scenes are just copied over, there is no coherence whatsoever. This script is sooo pointless. I can imagine it being written by some half-wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is in the end, they cripple the 'good' wunderkind guy, and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie, and you see him when they find him ('this room is green..') in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap clap, what a twist. First of all, what about if you haven't seen the first one, this doesn't make any sense you nitwit director. Oh, another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify x,y,z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except now permutations don't make much sense anymore..so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them..I want my money back.<br /><br />I guess I had to write this down since there are just so many bad, inconsistent, or just stupid ideas in this movie.

{"value":"(Avast, slight spoilers ahead) I got this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons.<br /><br />I once went to the town of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a little museum there I saw the schedule for the town theatre citra May 1954. Movies would change at the theatre each day. As there would be no TV for another decade or so in those parts, this was much of the available entertainment in the town. \"The Raid\" seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950's. Although it wasn't listed for that month, I am sure showed there some Monday or Tuesday night for an audience which probably wasn't too demanding. The historical raid - daring and remarkably successful - didn't seem to have been very well researched, so the movie is full of Hollywood embellishments, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance. And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than Washington D.C. had.<br /><br />What really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their Confederate uniforms. Only in tacky Civil War paintings do Rebel uniforms look so pristine. When Anne Bancroft's son catches Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween.<br /><br />And then there's Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie I actually looked on the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft.

{"value":"\"Piece is Cake\" is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />In the March 1989 \"Aeroplane Monthly\", Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV mini-series. A few of his comments are worth repeating:<br /><br />\"There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that I saw in action, and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'Piece of Cake'. It would not have been tolerated for a moment... ...The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club, though with more discipline. Nor was there any sense of 'death or glory'. RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we were required to do it - no more and no less.<br /><br />\"There was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice'. People either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did.

{"value":"It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally, Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic

{"value":"By the numbers story of the Kid (Prince), a singer, on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) and his own self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />I saw this in a theatre in 1984. I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this movie--\"Purple Rain\", \"Let's Get Crazy\", and \"When Doves Cry\". The concert scenes in this movie are great--full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately that's a VERY small portion of the movie.<br /><br />The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before--and much better too. The subplots are, to put in nicely, badly handled. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted. His wife beating father is needed for the story, but the scenes are so badly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible--lousy dialogue and some truly painful \"comedy\" routines. And there's tons of misogyny here--The Kid's mother getting beaten; The Kid hitting Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams' and Princes' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly.<br /><br />The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful--but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many. The \"dramatic\" scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through.

{"value":"This film was just painful to watch... not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations (yeah, I pretty much made that last sentence up as I went along), but in just an absolute dull way for OVER two hours. Now, you all may think I'm just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for Shakespeare or \"artistic film-making\"... well, you'd be wrong on both counts. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I've watched plenty of \"arthouse\" films such as the surreal and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2... but this was just over two hours of lost-in-translation Shakespeare, WAY too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in SOME scenes... but not in every other shot of a movie!!! IT WAS POINTLESS AND SERVED NOTHING FOR THE STORY!!!), and basically just overzealous film-making. I had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be \"very artistic\" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest... but this was just an extreme letdown. I gave this film a three ONLY because of Sir John Gielgud's acting presence (which far surpassed all of the no-names in this film) and the cinematography/set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion... however, a lot of this film would've been better off as JUST a painting with a scroll of text below it. A true disappointment... maybe if Zeffirelli had been given the director's chair, this would've been much better. But this is one audience member's opinion, many others may enjoy this far more than me. That being said, if you can't find this at any nearby video stores (it's currently not on DVD), don't try to go too far out of your way to find it... it's not really worth it.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","just","pain","to","watch","not","in","the","good","dramat","wai","that","make","you","cring","with","emot","for","good","develop","charact","in","dramat","situat","ye","i","pretti","much","make","that","last","sentenc","up","a","i","go","along","but","in","just","a","absolut","dull","wai","for","over","two","hour","now","you","all","mai","think","i","be","just","some","ignor","review","who","have","no","respect","for","shakespear","or","artist","filmmak","good","you","have","be","wrong","on","both","count","i","love","the","work","of","shakespear","especi","the","tragedi","of","romeo","and","juliet","juliu","caesar","macbeth","and","hamlet","and","i","have","watch","plenti","of","arthous","film","such","a","the","surreal","and","wellmad","eraserhead","and","fellini","but","thi","be","just","over","two","hour","of","lostintransl","shakespear","wai","too","much","nuditi","i","can","understand","artist","nuditi","in","some","scene","but","not","in","everi","other","shoot","of","a","movi","it","be","pointless","and","serv","noth","for","the","stori","and","basic","just","overzeal","filmmak","i","have","high","expect","for","thi","film","in","that","it","be","sai","to","be","veri","artist","and","be","a","adapt","of","shakespear","the","tempest","but","thi","be","just","a","extrem","letdown","i","give","thi","film","a","three","onli","becaus","of","sir","john","gielgud","act","presenc","which","far","surpass","all","of","the","nonam","in","thi","film","and","the","cinematographyset","design","combin","a","it","make","a","lot","of","scene","look","like","paint","in","motion","howev","a","lot","of","thi","film","would","have","be","well","off","a","just","a","paint","with","a","scroll","of","text","below","it","a","true","disappoint","mayb","if","zeffirelli","have","be","give","the","director","chair","thi","would","have","be","much","well","but","thi","be","on","audienc","member","opinion","mani","other","mai","enjoi","thi","far","much","than","me","that","be","sai","if","you","ca","not","find","thi","at","ani","nearbi","video","store","it","current","not","on","dvd","do","not","try","to","go","too","far","out","of","your","wai","to","find","it","it","not","realli","worth","it"],"filtered":["thi","film","pain","watch","good","dramat","wai","make","cring","emot","good","develop","charact","dramat","situat","ye","pretti","much","make","last","sentenc","go","along","absolut","dull","wai","two","hour","mai","think","ignor","review","respect","shakespear","artist","filmmak","good","wrong","count","love","work","shakespear","especi","tragedi","romeo","juliet","juliu","caesar","macbeth","hamlet","watch","plenti","arthous","film","surreal","wellmad","eraserhead","fellini","thi","two","hour","lostintransl","shakespear","wai","much","nuditi","understand","artist","nuditi","scene","everi","shoot","movi","pointless","serv","noth","stori","basic","overzeal","filmmak","high","expect","thi","film","sai","veri","artist","adapt","shakespear","tempest","thi","extrem","letdown","give","thi","film","three","onli","becaus","sir","john","gielgud","act","presenc","far","surpass","nonam","thi","film","cinematographyset","design","combin","make","lot","scene","look","like","paint","motion","howev","lot","thi","film","well","paint","scroll","text","true","disappoint","mayb","zeffirelli","give","director","chair","thi","much","well","thi","audienc","member","opinion","mani","mai","enjoi","thi","far","much","sai","ca","find","thi","ani","nearbi","video","store","current","dvd","try","go","far","wai","find","realli","worth"],"filtered2":["pain","watch","good","dramat","wai","make","cring","emot","good","develop","charact","dramat","situat","ye","pretti","make","last","sentenc","go","along","absolut","dull","wai","two","hour","mai","think","ignor","review","respect","shakespear","artist","filmmak","good","wrong","count","love","work","shakespear","especi","tragedi","romeo","juliet","juliu","caesar","macbeth","hamlet","watch","plenti","arthous","surreal","wellmad","eraserhead","fellini","two","hour","lostintransl","shakespear","wai","nuditi","understand","artist","nuditi","scene","everi","shoot","pointless","serv","noth","stori","basic","overzeal","filmmak","high","expect","veri","artist","adapt","shakespear","tempest","extrem","letdown","give","three","onli","becaus","sir","john","gielgud","act","presenc","far","surpass","nonam","cinematographyset","design","combin","make","lot","scene","look","like","paint","motion","howev","lot","well","paint","scroll","text","true","disappoint","mayb","zeffirelli","give","director","chair","well","audienc","member","opinion","mani","mai","enjoi","far","ca","find","ani","nearbi","video","store","current","dvd","try","go","far","wai","find","realli","worth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,7,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,20,21,22,25,27,30,33,36,38,46,47,48,49,50,54,58,72,78,81,85,101,113,117,130,144,163,168,174,176,187,200,209,211,212,219,222,224,240,247

{"value":"The teasers for Tree of Palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning, then immediately start raving about the animation. I should have known what that meant.<br /><br />The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole movie's problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of.<br /><br />Like all of the characters in the movie, Palme is poorly defined. You do not bond with the characters at all, although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls. It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters' motivations and personalities.<br /><br />New, useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needed to streamline his story. Perhaps he was trying to be epic, but it was simply too much information for a two-hour movie. However I can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a TV series or graphic novel.<br /><br />In the last five minutes of the movie, I simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters, the relationships, and the whole plot was. I touched my companion and he started cracking up too, as did a young man seated behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.<br /><br />On the bright side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs. The animation almost guides you; when you don't care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.","finished_norm":["the","teaser","for","tree","of","palm","try","to","pass","it","off","a","a","sort","of","allegori","for","a","fairi","tale","with","actual","mean","then","immedi","start","rave","about","the","anim","i","should","have","know","what","that","meantbr","br","the","main","charact","palm","be","a","good","exampl","of","the","whole","movi","problem","on","minut","palm","be","a","humbl","hero","in","search","of","himself","the","next","a","violent","psycho","with","a","unhealthi","fixat","on","a","girl","he","onc","take","care","ofbr","br","like","all","of","the","charact","in","the","movi","palm","be","poorli","defin","you","do","not","bond","with","the","charact","at","all","although","shatta","have","acquir","a","coupl","of","fan","girl","it","seem","that","the","writer","be","much","interest","in","cram","all","the","drama","and","complex","he","can","into","thi","movi","than","actual","explor","hi","charact","motiv","and","personalitiesbr","br","new","useless","stori","line","be","be","introduc","in","the","last","fifteen","minut","of","the","movi","the","writer","serious","ne","to","streamlin","hi","stori","perhap","he","be","try","to","be","epic","but","it","be","simpli","too","much","inform","for","a","twohour","movi","howev","i","ca","not","help","but","wonder","if","a","plot","with","so","mani","dimens","and","charact","would","have","be","well","suit","for","a","tv","seri","or","graphic","novelbr","br","in","the","last","five","minut","of","the","movi","i","simpli","can","not","endur","the","sheer","lack","of","qualiti","ani","long","and","begin","laugh","at","how","contriv","the","charact","the","relationship","and","the","whole","plot","be","i","touch","my","companion","and","he","start","crack","up","too","a","do","a","young","man","seat","behind","u","we","try","so","hard","to","control","ourselv","but","we","simpli","can","not","take","the","terribl","qualiti","of","thi","moviebr","br","on","the","bright","side","the","anim","be","incred","and","viewer","will","find","themselv","admir","the","lush","background","and","charm","charact","design","the","anim","almost","guid","you","when","you","do","not","care","about","the","charact","it","tell","you","how","to","feel"],"filtered":["teaser","tree","palm","try","pass","sort","allegori","fairi","tale","actual","mean","immedi","start","rave","anim","know","meantbr","br","main","charact","palm","good","exampl","whole","movi","problem","minut","palm","humbl","hero","search","next","violent","psycho","unhealthi","fixat","girl","onc","take","care","ofbr","br","like","charact","movi","palm","poorli","defin","bond","charact","although","shatta","acquir","coupl","fan","girl","seem","writer","much","interest","cram","drama","complex","thi","movi","actual","explor","hi","charact","motiv","personalitiesbr","br","new","useless","stori","line","introduc","last","fifteen","minut","movi","writer","serious","ne","streamlin","hi","stori","perhap","try","epic","simpli","much","inform","twohour","movi","howev","ca","help","wonder","plot","mani","dimens","charact","well","suit","tv","seri","graphic","novelbr","br","last","five","minut","movi","simpli","endur","sheer","lack","qualiti","ani","long","begin","laugh","contriv","charact","relationship","whole","plot","touch","companion","start","crack","young","man","seat","behind","u","try","hard","control","ourselv","simpli","take","terribl","qualiti","thi","moviebr","br","bright","side","anim","incred","viewer","find","themselv","admir","lush","background","charm","charact","design","anim","almost","guid","care","charact","tell","feel"],"filtered2":["teaser","tree","palm","try","pass","sort","allegori","fairi","tale","actual","mean","immedi","start","rave","anim","know","meantbr","main","charact","palm","good","exampl","whole","problem","minut","palm","humbl","hero","search","next","violent","psycho","unhealthi","fixat","girl","onc","take","care","ofbr","like","charact","palm","poorli","defin","bond","charact","although","shatta","acquir","coupl","fan","girl","seem","writer","interest","cram","drama","complex","actual","explor","charact","motiv","personalitiesbr","new","useless","stori","line","introduc","last","fifteen","minut","writer","serious","ne","streamlin","stori","perhap","try","epic","simpli","inform","twohour","howev","ca","help","wonder","plot","mani","dimens","charact","well","suit","tv","graphic","novelbr","last","five","minut","simpli","endur","sheer","lack","qualiti","ani","long","begin","laugh","contriv","charact","relationship","whole","plot","touch","companion","start","crack","young","man","seat","behind","u","try","hard","control","ourselv","simpli","take","terribl","qualiti","moviebr","bright","side","anim","incred","viewer","find","themselv","admir","lush","background","charm","charact","design","anim","almost","guid","care","charact","tell","feel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,10,17,20,26,27,31,32,35,36,38,43,45,50,52,59,60,71,81,84,87,88,90,99,107,110,111,1

{"value":"Oh man, it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science, well, I guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this issue sound complicated, even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda!<br /><br />How have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the sun spot activity. Has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past? According to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be. How come the temperature in the entire universe has risen (relatively) equal much as on earth? Does our SUVs cause temperature on Jupiter to rise?<br /><br />Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a HOAX. Please research it yourself. What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (banking family that arranged live earth event) to gain from this? Well, the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits, that is tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions, and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money, centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers. Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes into his own company? <br /><br />I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and

{"value":"The film had some likable aspects. Perhaps too many for my taste. It felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of ALL of its characters. Not once, a few times...but all of the time. <br /><br />This is the job of television, not cinema. <br /><br />The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as the pregnant friend. <br /><br />I felt as though Justine Clarke's performance was wan. Her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions. I also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence. <br /><br />I cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences. This is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest. <br /><br />That said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality. It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. Especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm. <br /><br />I am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked. \"Who knows if there's a god? Like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do\" or whatever the line was. <br /><br />Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife \"I'm giving up smoking.\" <br /><br />An anti-smoking commercial? A TAC ad with some tasteful animation?

{"value":"Loved the original story, had very high expectations for the film (especially since Barker was raving about it in interviews), finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The directing is all over the place, the acting was atrocious, the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense? It was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb MTV Marilyn Manson/Smashing Pumpkins/Placebo music video). Whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously laughable (the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi's death was just stupidly funny). It just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense, totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more. No explanations were given whatsoever, I mean I knew what was happening only as i'd read the story but for people who hadn't it's even more confusing as at times even i didn't know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole time.<br /><br />God, I really wanted to like this film as i'm a huge fan of Barker's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie, hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- I didn't care about anyone or anything, the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source, turning it into something else entirely. Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass, but everything else was all over the place, more than disappointing.

{"value":"This was disappointing. It started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's acting is dreadful, never seeming to mean what she says, or even knowing what she says until she says it. She showed no genuine emotion at all, not for her beloved goy, or her mother's story. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which isn't much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's \"mixed\" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as cliché as they come, and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish. The climax of the protest was uninspiring, and no matter what Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to care about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she dis him so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation whatever for that.) If every reference to him was removed it wouldn't be noticed. <br /><br />A simple story made confusing by poor character development (who was whose mother, again??) weak acting, and directing that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear \"quiet on the set!....\" I started thinking this was worthy of a 7, but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4, then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene. This was about as cold and sterile a movie as I have seen.

{"value":"There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost.<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in \"A Time to kill\" , and the \"The Newton Boys \" so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work.<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.<br /><br />The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com.<br /><br />So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, \"A Time to kill\" , \"The Newton Boys \" \"Frailty\", \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\", \"Edtv\" and \"Amistad\" and avoid too \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Angels in the Outfield\" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing
