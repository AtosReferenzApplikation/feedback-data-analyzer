{"value":"I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. Its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way.<br /><br />Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean he just cannot act, period. He should give up now, as acting is clearly not his thing.. His co-stars are about the same caliber, i'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous.. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy.<br /><br />I have never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so.<br /><br />If you get the chance to

{"value":"A grade-Z horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low-budget gory mayhem.His movies are full of inept gore,laughable acting,boring sub-plots and woeful dialogue.A mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion.Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless.You don't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters.The pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting.The acting is merely competent,but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed.A generous 4 out of 10.Just beware:do not mistake Monson's film with Andy Milligan's equally weak \"Legacy of

{"value":"Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past, like 'Greedy' and 'Clue'. This isn't one of them. More akin to a 'Police Academy' film than its inspiration, it stars Steve Martin in the old Phil Silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko in the act. Nothing much happens, really. It's all quite dull. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort, but they're all better than this and it's quite painful watching them work with such thin

{"value":"Any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can't promise much. As for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago, well I was there and it just wasn't like that. OK every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film (like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night) but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those - shall we say - naughty traits. Each kibbutz had its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called the Emek (valley). Yes, and the acting was good too, so you see it wasn't all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably on purpose too.","finished_norm":["ani","film","which","begin","with","a","cowhand","shag","a","femal","calf","ca","not","promis","much","a","for","the","stereotyp","of","the","kibbutz","a","it","be","yr","ago","good","i","be","there","and","it","just","be","not","like","that","okai","everi","kibbutz","have","just","a","small","piec","of","someth","show","in","the","film","like","youngster","raid","the","kitchen","at","night","but","you","ca","not","show","the","whole","kibbutz","a","be","full","of","all","that","shall","we","sai","naughti","trait","each","kibbutz","have","it","own","problem","but","hardli","ani","kibbutz","have","all","of","them","the","view","of","israel","be","great","i","still","rememb","my","youth","in","that","garden","of","eden","call","the","emek","vallei","ye","and","the","act","be","good","too","so","you","see","it","be","not","all","black","just","a","wrong","portray","probabl","on","purpos","too"],"filtered":["ani","film","begin","cowhand","shag","femal","calf","ca","promis","much","stereotyp","kibbutz","yr","ago","good","like","okai","everi","kibbutz","small","piec","someth","show","film","like","youngster","raid","kitchen","night","ca","show","whole","kibbutz","full","shall","sai","naughti","trait","kibbutz","problem","hardli","ani","kibbutz","view","israel","great","still","rememb","youth","garden","eden","call","emek","vallei","ye","act","good","see","black","wrong","portray","probabl","purpos"],"filtered2":["ani","begin","cowhand","shag","femal","calf","ca","promis","stereotyp","kibbutz","yr","ago","good","like","okai","everi","kibbutz","small","piec","someth","show","like","youngster","raid","kitchen","night","ca","show","whole","kibbutz","full","shall","naughti","trait","kibbutz","problem","hardli","ani","kibbutz","view","israel","great","still","rememb","youth","garden","eden","call","emek","vallei","ye","act","good","see","black","wrong","portray","probabl","purpos"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,21,25,27,28,51,53,64,81,85,111,142,147,148,167,191,209,210,218,229,290,312,336,363,422,604,610,665,683,794,1423,1640,2345,2717,3064,3109,3800,4361,4678,4991,5286,7452,7948],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,21,25,27,28,51,53,64,81,85,111,142,147,148,167,191,209,210,218,229,290,312,336,363,422,604,610,665,683,794,1423,1640,2345,2717,3064,3109,3800,4361,4678,4991,5286,7452,7948],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,2.600540117735859,3.0904588387038183,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.883428577602134,3.899514464849456,2.011190219103739,2.1183455303375887,2.2844323215331563,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.4609576687888097,2.5460113484259455,2.6026896854443837,2.687151791517189,2.5940874818617203,2.8432628718938773,2.8612813773965557,2.8824835850471584,2.9233055795674137,3.0349689855553557,3.2090054908152035,3.5727776966246974,3.477726550625732,3.5929222627171646,3.6105180246075443,3.7465885637507435,4.484804029712395,4.688631791727313,5.214056214914456,5.274680836730892,5.672363804397,5.463272006538442,5.770002273960917,6.032366538428407,6.0662680901040895,6.437831646536572,6.2980697041614135,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.901601096322278E-5,7.848318752886238E-5,7.90933194743229E-5,7.86363174317909E-5,7.863760579931742E-5,7.852768614120626E-5,7.876123848253727E-5,7.849448859504203E-5,7.867097282003864E-5,8.728114986463746E-5,0.4300154092549061,7.83677811843265E-5,0.08355306173730213,0.058663430104394065,7.842492615284127E-5,7.820819349412438E-5,8.015899905041233E-5,7.876861781606831E-5,7.852423848614142E-5,7.858932111847456E-5,7.934971889385939E-5,7.884665758412104E-5,7.893643646532534E-5,7.9021481622176E-5,7.962793089658532E-5,7.921149923497432E-5,8.254140018308171E-5,7.839107920712125E-5,7.839317635207236E-5,7.859178502104568E-5,8.0262235013132E-5,7.876405384729183E-5,8.45465395665111E-5,7.898560550782134E-5,7.84764043714988E-5,7.883862470985166E-5,7.839776905320755E-5,7.844409636662664E-5,7.820780056983687E-5,7.822809128148423E-5,7.840417320766404E-5,7.923117110135962E-5,7.882856422554917E-5,7.851689811826153E-5,0.19147120880697022,7.854703333281291E-5,8.115676120111102E-5,7.99633273718098E-5,7.824753523873666E-5,7.842046707677945E-5,7.839326790429275E-5,8.059954914672173E-5,7.842163382382758E-5,7.822114641457612E-5,7.907973543956087E-5,7.844183315488532E-5,0.2303681309561173,7.837718689183264E-5,7.824663035088081E-5,7.862023504542068E-5,7.940008170151166E-5,7.861503386967313E-5,7.823215454933582E-5,7.841430613937779E-5,7.820874650702881E-5,8.001833479861086E-5,7.888247814539027E-5,7.871444691752944E-5,7.864560757616308E-5,7.893228331720713E-5,7.820589332792116E-5,7.864725634448475E-5,7.992286263283554E-5,7.834604263278253E-5,8.0285066

Some of it is amusing, such as Pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot-line and its climax. The transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn't appear to be director Maurice Tourneur's best work. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'The Poor Little Rich Girl,' typecasting Pickford as a child character.","finished_norm":["mari","pickford","becom","the","chieftain","of","a","scottish","clan","after","the","death","of","her","father","and","then","have","a","romanc","a","fellow","comment","snow","leopard","sai","the","film","be","rather","episod","to","begin","some","of","it","be","amus","such","a","pickford","whip","her","clansman","to","church","while","some","of","it","be","just","there","all","in","all","the","stori","be","weak","especi","the","recycl","contriv","romanc","plotlin","and","it","climax","the","transfer","be","so","dark","it","difficult","to","appreci","the","sceneri","but","even","account","for","that","thi","doe","not","appear","to","be","director","mauric","tourneur","well","work","pickford","and","tourneur","collabor","onc","much","in","the","somewhat","much","access","the","poor","littl","rich","girl","typecast","pickford","a","a","child","charact"],"filtered":["mari","pickford","becom","chieftain","scottish","clan","death","father","romanc","fellow","comment","snow","leopard","sai","film","rather","episod","begin","amus","pickford","whip","clansman","church","stori","weak","especi","recycl","contriv","romanc","plotlin","climax","transfer","dark","difficult","appreci","sceneri","even","account","thi","doe","appear","director","mauric","tourneur","well","work","pickford","tourneur","collabor","onc","much","somewhat","much","access","poor","littl","rich","girl","typecast","pickford","child","charact"],"filtered2":["mari","pickford","becom","chieftain","scottish","clan","death","father","romanc","fellow","comment","snow","leopard","rather","begin","amus","pickford","whip","clansman","church","stori","weak","especi","recycl","contriv","romanc","plotlin","climax","transfer","dark","difficult","appreci","sceneri","even","account","doe","appear","director","mauric","tourneur","well","work","pickford","tourneur","collabor","onc","somewhat","access","poor","littl","rich","girl","typecast","pickford","child","charact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,14,17,18,20,48,58,84,115,146,147,160,169,180,236,245,267,280,342,368,379,596,708,803,892,923,937,961,1130,1137,1138,1181,1501,1517,2190,2343,2578,2744,3198,4116,4134,4607,5962,6592,6681],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,14,17,18,20,48,58,84,115,146,147,160,169,180,236,245,267,280,342,368,379,596,708,803,892,923,937,961,1130,1137,1138,1181,1501,1517,2190,2343,2578,2744,3198,4116,4134,4607,5962,6592,6681],"values":[0.926017105726131,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,2.2212694515902225,2.201553588425805,2.326138445979858,2.2844323215331563,2.3722295531801256,2.4214486257841834,2.7097314792693545,2.617923930016232,2.7502029743242886,2.7085302779237206,2.8028805344481915,3.112795625839981,3.1346146732346205,3.1272886331425473,3.485528930909917,3.6683728173057184,3.7636829971100436,7.965050933049725,4.3521595551061,4.030886538218284,3.9954846111673676,4.416284083275639,4.181290492043933,4.224077767249142,4.263079925052412,4.597282013139085,4.550761997504193,5.064116067623542,5.3560264761848435,5.214056214914456,5.3064295350454715,5.604922523601468,5.999576715605417,5.967828017290836,6.032366538428407,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.278969515378142E-5,7.229885722251788E-5,0.10613019884094303,7.243992077175583E-5,7.244110761829942E-5,7.233984942634839E-5,7.255499827429325E-5,7.230926778554305E-5,7.247184537937949E-5,8.04035563662596E-5,0.6152703684377306,7.21925446849046E-5,7.353998273137668E-5,7.458904674442352E-5,7.224518673538345E-5,7.20455322101099E-5,7.384261788952487E-5,7.256179612996345E-5,7.233667344013869E-5,7.239662768117902E-5,7.309710751547029E-5,7.263368650834604E-5,7.271639097943292E-5,7.279473473490732E-5,7.335339692592874E-5,7.296977931056778E-5,7.603729021057815E-5,7.22140068665086E-5,7.221593876030864E-5,7.239889743277562E-5,7.393771904894393E-5,7.255759179350198E-5,7.788442831184979E-5,7.276168559214063E-5,0.07341305001937924,7.262628660974133E-5,7.222016956507198E-5,7.226284637170854E-5,7.204517024753096E-5,7.206386208855482E-5,7.222606908397863E-5,7.298790107019392E-5,7.261701887303138E-5,7.232991147969825E-5,7.320879574672048E-5,7.235767209496913E-5,7.476175822450256E-5,7.366236477800882E-5,7.208177389786707E-5,7.224107902628437E-5,7.221602309838306E-5,7.424845345144985E-5,7.224215383581879E-5,7.205746446433965E-5,7.284839825901212E-5,7.226076149687481E-5,0.11487741784413355,7.220120924002112E-5,7.208094031350394E-5,7.242510564774534E-5,7.31435018268435E-5,7.242031431504592E-5,7.206760517840004E-5,7.223540355937757E-5,7.204604164661826E-5,7.371303772111534E-5,7.26666844755079E-5,7.251189379823619E-5,7.24484788699E-5,7.271256509172021E-5,7

Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke pot? He never did ! Now don't get me wrong,I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it had no place in this movie!

Mark Burnett's other show, \"Survivor\" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br

{"value":"Having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80% of that time in complete disbelief, I can give this garbage the turkey of the year award, no problem. To say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement. Frankly I am lost for words to describe this utter tripe. Not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality (this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of 'serial killer flicks')but the acting was dire. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who were paid to do this, I hope you GIVE your money back.

{"value":"Rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on - the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters.<br /><br />The marginalisation of Nubo, the minister, auntie, mother - and the dumbing down of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth. If you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why Sayuri loved the Chairman and why Mameha became her mentor at all.<br /><br />Visually the film was stunning - and the actors all did the best with the C rate script they were given, but that was all that was good about this movie.","finished_norm":["rather","then","long","danc","sequenc","and","close","up","of","the","charact","which","make","the","film","drag","on","the","movi","would","have","be","well","serv","explain","the","stori","and","motiv","of","the","charactersbr","br","the","marginalis","of","nubo","the","minist","aunti","mother","and","the","dumb","down","of","the","dynam","and","import","rivalri","between","hatsumo","and","mameha","and","hatsumo","and","sayuri","make","the","movi","lack","ani","real","depth","if","you","have","not","read","the","book","you","would","not","realli","understand","why","sayuri","love","the","chairman","and","why","mameha","becom","her","mentor","at","allbr","br","visual","the","film","be","stun","and","the","actor","all","do","the","well","with","the","c","rate","script","thei","be","give","but","that","be","all","that","be","good","about","thi","movi"],"filtered":["rather","long","danc","sequenc","close","charact","make","film","drag","movi","well","serv","explain","stori","motiv","charactersbr","br","marginalis","nubo","minist","aunti","mother","dumb","dynam","import","rivalri","hatsumo","mameha","hatsumo","sayuri","make","movi","lack","ani","real","depth","read","book","realli","understand","sayuri","love","chairman","mameha","becom","mentor","allbr","br","visual","film","stun","actor","well","c","rate","script","thei","give","good","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["rather","long","danc","sequenc","close","charact","make","drag","well","serv","explain","stori","motiv","charactersbr","marginalis","nubo","minist","aunti","mother","dumb","dynam","import","rivalri","hatsumo","mameha","hatsumo","sayuri","make","lack","ani","real","depth","read","book","realli","understand","sayuri","love","chairman","mameha","becom","mentor","allbr","visual","stun","actor","well","c","rate","script","give","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,10,13,17,20,27,30,41,54,77,80,99,115,145,151,160,183,202,212,295,349,395,397,420,492,600,635,764,815,902,914,1110,1425,1555,2947,3103,4850,5514],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,10,13,17,20,27,30,41,54,77,80,99,115,145,151,160,183,202,212,295,349,395,397,420,492,600,635,764,815,902,914,1110,1425,1555,2947,3103,4850,5514],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.5687599167621034,1.8113893252729412,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.056430207256609,2.201553588425805,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.3722295531801256,2.4885128563647294,2.597304642813496,2.5983793339432615,2.7910771187233068,3.0568369721919364,3.153168081130368,3.3176717946075294,3.3023374306074227,3.6016814428070463,3.558633189238533,3.587125145032839,3.7465885637507435,3.7881170224473255,3.9201351739255808,3.9612932464190886,4.2078172463773615,4.443131333311827,4.589376833631972,5.521540914662417,5.426230734858092,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0592303623298688E-4,1.0520877243688344E-4,1.0602667032084518E-4,1.0541404709019138E-4,1.0541577418066999E-4,1.0526842399446223E-4,1.0558150703689293E-4,1.0522392181265964E-4,1.0546050354756357E-4,1.1700267182396467E-4,0.9183838439523538,1.050540672035418E-4,1.0701484927189138E-4,1.0854143961177289E-4,1.0513067153343314E-4,1.0484013571692846E-4,1.0745524175813798E-4,1.0559139922713964E-4,1.0526380232237451E-4,1.053510472989144E-4,1.0637038047116296E-4,1.0569601358413254E-4,1.0581636453036275E-4,1.0593036979487458E-4,1.0674333096165162E-4,1.0618509339126964E-4,1.1064891299541041E-4,1.0508529881448448E-4,1.0508811009232468E-4,1.0535435022496866E-4,1.0759363227528005E-4,1.0558528110722716E-4,1.1333685495773037E-4,1.058822769221218E-4,1.0519967943643407E-4,1.056852453053759E-4,1.0509426672871799E-4,1.0515636970807684E-4,1.0483960899160995E-4,1.0486680922304173E-4,1.0510285166582461E-4,1.0621146404438791E-4,1.0567175896216136E-4,1.0525396236660571E-4,1.0653290837487954E-4,0.07333862314380257,1.0879276810440659E-4,1.0719293873815851E-4,1.048928743579866E-4,1.0512469402495726E-4,1.0508823282047863E-4,1.0804581072314869E-4,1.0512625807999304E-4,1.0485749944670435E-4,1.0600846056577468E-4,1.0515333581334642E-4,1.1308085601672556E-4,1.050666758012782E-4,1.0489166133206979E-4,1.053924882292284E-4,1.0643789313644075E-4,1.0538551591664965E-4,1.04872256140225E-4,1.0511643512669512E-4,1.0484087704523901E-4,1.0726667763728926E-4,1.0574403198651651E-4,1.0551878171609649E-4,1.0542650077251408E-4,1.0581079712632346E-4,1.0483705228377213E-4,1.0542871098971625E-4,1.0713869469368852E-4,1.0502492610473442E-4,1.0762423830436895E-4,1.0530260133936914E-4,1.0612675229946023E-4,1.0547815227615922E-4,1.04804182780187E-4,1.049340947627553E-4]}}
{"value":"Fiction film (it lists as based on a story though it does have a \"documented by\" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to try and find a Bigfoot.(They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). Its lots of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness. There are some attempts at creating tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds. This is a perfect definition of an exploitation film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it delivers very little.

The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /><br />Run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.","finished_norm":["a","veri","cheesi","and","dull","road","movi","with","the","intent","to","be","hip","and","modern","show","in","the","edit","styl","and","some","weird","camera","angl","result","onli","in","sleepi","br","br","the","cast","be","wast","the","write","be","stupid","and","pretenti","the","onli","thing","worthwhil","be","the","topnotch","lalo","schifrin","soundtrack","realli","cool","and","conjur","the","open","sequenc","veri","origin","and","interest","br","br","run","if","you","can","the","bad","opinion","and","comment","about","thi","flick","be","total","deserv","it","be","realli","pure","garbag","of","cours","that","thi","have","it","charm","of","watch","a","movi","which","everybodi","would","not","drop","the","beer","glass","on","if","it","be","on","fire","but","save","it","for","a","stormi","dai","where","you","have","absolut","noth","els","to","do"],"filtered":["veri","cheesi","dull","road","movi","intent","hip","modern","show","edit","styl","weird","camera","angl","result","onli","sleepi","br","br","cast","wast","write","stupid","pretenti","onli","thing","worthwhil","topnotch","lalo","schifrin","soundtrack","realli","cool","conjur","open","sequenc","veri","origin","interest","br","br","run","bad","opinion","comment","thi","flick","total","deserv","realli","pure","garbag","cours","thi","charm","watch","movi","everybodi","drop","beer","glass","fire","save","stormi","dai","absolut","noth","els"],"filtered2":["veri","cheesi","dull","road","intent","hip","modern","show","edit","styl","weird","camera","angl","result","onli","sleepi","cast","wast","write","stupid","pretenti","onli","thing","worthwhil","topnotch","lalo","schifrin","soundtrack","realli","cool","conjur","open","sequenc","veri","origin","interest","run","bad","opinion","comment","flick","total","deserv","realli","pure","garbag","cours","charm","watch","everybodi","drop","beer","glass","fire","save","stormi","dai","absolut","noth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,9,11,13,15,28,29,39,49,60,65,69,89,92,132,136,137,184,189,196,199,222,231,242,257,280,348,349,367,380,423,447,481,538,543,551,625,702,725,729,796,797,811,904,1047,1080,1215,1293,1776,2016,2036,2227,5466,8404],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,9,11,13,15,28,29,39,49,60,65,69,89,92,132,136,137,184,189,196,199,222,231,242,257,280,348,349,367,380,423,447,481,538,543,551,625,702,725,729,796,797,811,904,1047,1080,1215,1293,1776,2016,2036,2227,5466,8404],"values":[0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,2.2635883139467947,2.4001215597131385,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.5538940054862738,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.253494045787767,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.496249838866882,2.498193474075453,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.5771019354959765,2.7049353070058615,2.689504733779216,2.7602659523229094,2.8028805344481915,3.0103169565570433,3.0568369721919364,3.0791938792932125,3.102062070196872,3.164467636384302,3.2070272508030975,3.353630724994973,3.43462735814388,3.477726550625732,3.528202072035993,3.6194333882654965,3.6466665387238555,3.6466665387238555,3.7952092507568174,3.850067611308864,3.7987743169213135,3.8425769395797067,3.9121030022283168,4.140259095366071,4.229557233013768,4.291900363587903,4.409683399244287,4.770124825978496,4.900964426937307,4.979216623837056,5.129498826886393,6.2980697041614135,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.027106649640880685,7.269846744647241E-5,7.326362870930724E-5,7.284031068212129E-5,7.284150408860279E-5,7.273968622240077E-5,7.295602424099941E-5,7.27089355507587E-5,7.287241174342752E-5,8.084796288111465E-5,0.8043992973591704,7.259156729823018E-5,7.394645290390584E-5,7.500131530327994E-5,7.26445003118361E-5,7.244374225612483E-5,7.425076078701774E-5,7.296285966977562E-5,7.273649268188095E-5,7.279677830198604E-5,7.350112982822667E-5,7.303514740063804E-5,7.311830899585499E-5,7.31970857729133E-5,7.375883580144483E-5,7.33730978549047E-5,7.645756350032637E-5,7.261314810559851E-5,7.261509067736142E-5,7.279906059895304E-5,7.434638758953925E-5,7.295863209510681E-5,0.10080592226832878,7.316385396093372E-5,7.269218425181242E-5,0.06212019501759865,7.26193448666277E-5,7.266225755649828E-5,7.244337829290641E-5,7.24621734474689E-5,7.262527699335365E-5,7.33913197771157E-5,7.3018387639974E-5,7.272969334673461E-5,7.361343538263821E-5,7.275760740047065E-5,7.517498139420467E-5,7.40695113805528E-5,7.24801842589287E-5,7.26403698986084E-5,7.261517548158923E-5,7.465883948315008E-5,7.264145064882979E-5,7.24557404623069E-5,7.325104590603392E-5,7.266016115814493E-5,7.81380177673203E-5,7.260027974407338E-5,7.24793460671783E-5,7.282541367196141E-5,7.3547780570225

{"value":"Oh dear, this movie was bad for various reasons. I was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over-all score.Sorry, but to rate this highly as many have, is a joke! Once you get past the one shot/black and white movie gimmick, which was a nice idea, the movie drags on, even at a run time of only 66 minutes. The credits sequence at the start was so annoying too!In the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel, wow, that was needed in the story!

{"value":"This film is described as a action/comedy. The first 15 minutes and James Belushi's presence point to it being a humorous gangster film.<br /><br />However, the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to conceal the contrived ending. The film moves between comedy(description used loosely) and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in. The lead female (the Angel of the title) is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable, extremes of character to be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script. One to

{"value":"I like Goldie Hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when I saw Protocol for $5.50 at Walmart I purchased it. Although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. Some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as I'm concerned. I don't think this scene added to the movie at all. I don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!<br /><br />In the end, although I'm glad to possess another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!","finished_norm":["i","like","goldi","hawn","and","want","anoth","on","of","her","film","so","when","i","see","protocol","for","at","walmart","i","purchas","it","although","mildli","amus","the","film","never","realli","hit","it","a","stride","some","scene","such","a","a","parti","scene","in","a","bar","just","go","on","for","too","long","and","realli","have","no","purposebr","br","then","of","cours","there","be","the","preachi","scene","at","the","end","of","the","film","which","give","the","whole","film","a","bad","tast","a","far","a","i","be","concern","i","do","not","think","thi","scene","add","to","the","movi","at","all","i","do","not","like","stupid","comedi","try","to","teach","me","a","lesson","write","by","some","burn","out","especiallybr","br","in","the","end","although","i","be","glad","to","possess","anoth","hawn","movi","i","be","not","sure","it","be","realli","worth","the","monei","i","pai","for","it"],"filtered":["like","goldi","hawn","want","anoth","film","see","protocol","walmart","purchas","although","mildli","amus","film","never","realli","hit","stride","scene","parti","scene","bar","go","long","realli","purposebr","br","cours","preachi","scene","end","film","give","whole","film","bad","tast","far","concern","think","thi","scene","add","movi","like","stupid","comedi","try","teach","lesson","write","burn","especiallybr","br","end","although","glad","possess","anoth","hawn","movi","sure","realli","worth","monei","pai"],"filtered2":["like","goldi","hawn","want","anoth","see","protocol","walmart","purchas","although","mildli","amus","never","realli","hit","stride","scene","parti","scene","bar","go","long","realli","purposebr","cours","preachi","scene","end","give","whole","bad","tast","far","concern","think","scene","add","like","stupid","comedi","try","teach","lesson","write","burn","especiallybr","end","although","glad","possess","anoth","hawn","sure","realli","worth","monei","pai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,9,12,13,19,24,30,36,37,42,65,73,99,101,111,119,126,127,136,199,219,237,299,322,388,708,850,862,872,874,1070,1111,1227,1272,1304,1560,2363,3920,4063,4162,4428,6599,8603],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,9,12,13,19,24,30,36,37,42,65,73,99,101,111,119,126,127,136,199,219,237,299,322,388,708,850,862,872,874,1070,1111,1227,1272,1304,1560,2363,3920,4063,4162,4428,6599,8603],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,3.3953824709201923,5.24952271204694,2.6420723132238515,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.9073850067444174,3.7901378413541957,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.1183455303375887,2.1653408989309972,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.346825985579986,2.558331832813986,2.5792094178355414,5.280195575021108,2.7949961309240425,2.885344817328191,3.0914425013694116,3.6683728173057184,3.9241755834625858,3.944626193933877,3.857614816944247,3.872882289075035,4.176068548062782,4.268777946167049,4.246178114249808,4.416284083275639,4.4637506205145625,4.573751515728891,5.156897801074508,6.2980697041614135,5.9370563586240825,12.596139408322827,5.9370563586240825,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.78833163575369E-5,7.735813094770502E-5,7.795951665104378E-5,7.75090657333035E-5,7.751033563208008E-5,7.74019916723911E-5,7.763219604064745E-5,7.736927001308833E-5,7.754322433652188E-5,8.602997448353968E-5,0.533163663448534,7.724437895324736E-5,0.04812472278047603,7.980858158740694E-5,7.730070474857445E-5,7.708707895276309E-5,7.9009919709216E-5,7.763946959142408E-5,7.739859343946548E-5,7.74627431121912E-5,7.821224058461395E-5,7.771639065931432E-5,7.780488256015597E-5,7.788870859458788E-5,7.848646441796911E-5,7.807600230469386E-5,0.36907063356109643,7.726734299885925E-5,0.043714550758287535,7.74651716947162E-5,7.911167578429443E-5,7.76349710471451E-5,8.333456482710078E-5,7.78533467643727E-5,7.735144502690984E-5,7.770847293630658E-5,7.72739369459944E-5,7.731960015732374E-5,7.708669166104567E-5,7.710669150531883E-5,7.728024929688957E-5,7.809539217485248E-5,7.769855666905786E-5,7.739135829576737E-5,7.833174444885593E-5,7.74210615219844E-5,7.999337893836654E-5,7.881705298434547E-5,7.712585673342227E-5,7.729630959337298E-5,7.726950032105433E-5,7.944415451940121E-5,7.729745961510086E-5,7.709984619308564E-5,7.794612734343529E-5,7.731736938872525E-5,8.314633337888572E-5,7.725364982992587E-5,7.712496481713484E-5,7.749321388795991E-5,7.82618814413621E-5,7.748808727107253E-5,7.711069652622123E-5,7.729023697301586E-5,7.708762403822691E-5,7.88712718796217E-5,7.775169773279763E-5,7.758607523277644E-5,7.751822270344569E-5,7.780078894742069E-5,7.708481175944496E-5,7.751984783667162E-5,7.877716830744973E-5,7.722295202386412E-5,7.91341

{"value":"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into \"horizon blue\" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things

{"value":"I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.<br /><br />The beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. The only thing I can say in its favour is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not by much.","finished_norm":["i","think","thi","be","a","veri","clunki","uninvolv","version","of","a","famou","australian","stori","heath","ledger","and","orlando","bloom","be","veri","good","in","their","role","and","give","their","charact","some","person","but","the","whole","thing","feel","forc","and","mechanicalbr","br","the","begin","can","have","be","a","lot","much","involv","perhap","start","with","a","shootout","and","then","flash","back","for","a","recap","of","how","thei","get","there","or","that","sort","of","thing","and","i","feel","like","everi","scene","be","routin","predict","and","signpost","like","a","veri","bad","tv","soapbr","br","i","be","realli","look","forward","to","thi","movi","and","hope","for","someth","a","lot","well","the","onli","thing","i","can","sai","in","it","favour","be","that","it","beat","the","mick","jagger","version","but","not","by","much"],"filtered":["think","thi","veri","clunki","uninvolv","version","famou","australian","stori","heath","ledger","orlando","bloom","veri","good","role","give","charact","person","whole","thing","feel","forc","mechanicalbr","br","begin","lot","much","involv","perhap","start","shootout","flash","back","recap","thei","get","sort","thing","feel","like","everi","scene","routin","predict","signpost","like","veri","bad","tv","soapbr","br","realli","look","forward","thi","movi","hope","someth","lot","well","onli","thing","sai","favour","beat","mick","jagger","version","much"],"filtered2":["think","veri","clunki","uninvolv","version","famou","australian","stori","heath","ledger","orlando","bloom","veri","good","role","give","charact","person","whole","thing","feel","forc","mechanicalbr","begin","lot","involv","perhap","start","shootout","flash","back","recap","get","sort","thing","feel","like","everi","scene","routin","predict","signpost","like","veri","bad","tv","soapbr","realli","look","forward","hope","someth","lot","well","onli","thing","favour","beat","mick","jagger","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,20,29,30,43,53,63,71,72,85,111,128,147,153,172,181,220,241,269,318,337,338,678,699,865,1455,1573,2118,2406,3192,4036,4753,4965,5619,5689,5734,5845,6109,6424],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,20,29,30,43,53,63,71,72,85,111,128,147,153,172,181,220,241,269,318,337,338,678,699,865,1455,1573,2118,2406,3192,4036,4753,4965,5619,5689,5734,5845,6109,6424],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,3.6001823395697077,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,3.9586154332014196,1.3364419891718522,3.321622407243643,1.7003182735607676,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,3.841892750832105,2.011190219103739,2.1183455303375887,2.3409902041158843,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.5001408943598484,2.4442286541160034,5.667386841755453,2.6627744961815836,2.76533567167316,2.902686292364678,2.973659465713028,2.9720957437368454,3.6715125373103863,3.5813614403160887,3.9201351739255808,4.499089986959872,4.605250182788262,5.274680836730892,5.116075806554253,5.5623629091826725,5.822646007446338,6.2980697041614135,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,6.342521466732247,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.493966453669955E-5,7.443432885926519E-5,7.501298478935531E-5,7.457955896410233E-5,7.458078086620874E-5,7.447653183864555E-5,7.469803547946149E-5,7.444504691625245E-5,7.461242652015857E-5,8.277841429223363E-5,0.4704574341256626,7.432487619720976E-5,7.571211315394205E-5,0.05656528897950551,7.43790731215831E-5,7.417352145502339E-5,7.602368716425658E-5,7.47050341215415E-5,7.447326204419696E-5,0.2419816217780856,7.525615685351345E-5,7.47790479064327E-5,7.486419519693642E-5,7.494485297055934E-5,7.552001621442284E-5,7.512506779013305E-5,7.828318292337803E-5,7.43469723014211E-5,7.434896125704166E-5,7.453732392994182E-5,7.612159730069636E-5,7.470070560274008E-5,0.06546779261118867,7.491082766427212E-5,7.442789563730005E-5,7.477142943904013E-5,7.435331702593195E-5,7.439725436577223E-5,7.417314880125442E-5,7.419239273809112E-5,7.435939079732031E-5,7.514372480723319E-5,7.476188796371742E-5,7.446630035757434E-5,7.53711439896033E-5,7.449488093057078E-5,7.696997589674621E-5,7.583810996572361E-5,7.421083360363216E-5,7.437484408420014E-5,7.43490480861868E-5,7.644150978054132E-5,7.437595064009078E-5,7.418580614899353E-5,0.05961689326213618,7.439510791055887E-5,8.000376232396143E-5,7.433379667492875E-5,7.420997539791495E-5,7.456430624981262E-5,7.530392150101438E-5,7.455937339682541E-5,7.419624638656071E-5,7.436900098257447E-5,7.417404593861902E-5,7.589027962

{"value":"The script for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play like an undergrad drama-student so as to bring some life in his script-dead character. I do not know whether this was the purpose of the director, but Hopkins' Ciano reeked nothing but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano possibly was all that but then, why make a movie about him? Mussolini was a bit more convincing, and his long way down was as if closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was plain ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent script), while she had to be the central character of this alleged familial drama. Watch it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap

{"value":"This could have been a very good film, if I had been able to watch it. The hand held camera was very bouncy. From the opening credits I was worried. Several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end. But we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film, giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it. The acting seemed very authentic. Some of the dialog was a little hard to understand, but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of it funny. If you get motion sickness at all though, you may seriously consider skipping this film. It's quaint, but not worth the nausea.","finished_norm":["thi","can","have","be","a","veri","good","film","if","i","have","be","abl","to","watch","it","the","hand","hold","camera","be","veri","bounci","from","the","open","credit","i","be","worri","sever","of","u","watch","it","feel","veri","nauseou","by","the","end","but","we","do","stai","until","the","end","becaus","it","be","such","a","charm","and","interest","film","give","some","insight","to","the","young","pop","cultur","in","south","africa","the","black","and","white","film","do","enhanc","the","art","feel","of","it","the","act","seem","veri","authent","some","of","the","dialog","be","a","littl","hard","to","understand","but","a","theater","full","of","nonsouth","african","seem","to","find","much","of","it","funni","if","you","get","motion","sick","at","all","though","you","mai","serious","consid","skip","thi","film","it","quaint","but","not","worth","the","nausea"],"filtered":["thi","veri","good","film","abl","watch","hand","hold","camera","veri","bounci","open","credit","worri","sever","u","watch","feel","veri","nauseou","end","stai","end","becaus","charm","interest","film","give","insight","young","pop","cultur","south","africa","black","white","film","enhanc","art","feel","act","seem","veri","authent","dialog","littl","hard","understand","theater","full","nonsouth","african","seem","find","much","funni","get","motion","sick","though","mai","serious","consid","skip","thi","film","quaint","worth","nausea"],"filtered2":["veri","good","abl","watch","hand","hold","camera","veri","bounci","open","credit","worri","sever","u","watch","feel","veri","nauseou","end","stai","end","becaus","charm","interest","give","insight","young","pop","cultur","south","africa","black","white","enhanc","art","feel","act","seem","veri","authent","dialog","littl","hard","understand","theater","full","nonsouth","african","seem","find","funni","get","motion","sick","though","mai","serious","consid","skip","quaint","worth","nausea"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,14,15,21,22,24,30,35,38,43,46,60,62,86,112,135,171,212,219,229,231,235,242,316,317,336,356,359,365,371,382,414,424,432,454,778,797,880,931,952,1021,1299,1402,1577,2270,2389,2411,3090,5742,7624,8073],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,14,15,21,22,24,30,35,38,43,46,60,62,86,112,135,171,212,219,229,231,235,242,316,317,336,356,359,365,371,382,414,424,432,454,778,797,880,931,952,1021,1299,1402,1577,2270,2389,2411,3090,5742,7624,8073],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.1175081997259209,4.800243119426277,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,3.321622407243643,1.655771293751733,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,2.031112399272319,2.2466628996789315,2.366244071437088,2.373087554090762,2.5983793339432615,2.5792094178355414,2.8432628718938773,2.7049353070058615,2.6457189377809835,2.689504733779216,2.878207028279898,2.8529247828056143,2.9233055795674137,3.028335462059722,3.2189558216683714,3.008694896185175,3.0466846007279185,3.235085203598255,3.1254654785810323,3.212973749990824,3.235085203598255,3.2556198060399626,3.8059428063999263,3.7987743169213135,4.110553940952155,3.9241755834625858,3.9868265484242533,4.076977645418551,4.5432147918688095,4.436351646326448,4.613282354485526,5.3064295350454715,5.170884043049248,5.339219357868463,5.426230734858092,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.08141495260600863,7.187750424787051E-5,7.243628330466496E-5,7.201774568804104E-5,7.201892561772121E-5,7.19182575518389E-5,7.213215252647849E-5,7.188785413882053E-5,7.204948424115565E-5,0.07665091179249953,0.7940099022634121,7.177181129271934E-5,7.311139655906674E-5,7.415434669618975E-5,7.182414654879766E-5,7.16256555969381E-5,7.341226797946004E-5,7.213891076469389E-5,7.19151000750675E-5,7.197470490674266E-5,7.267110239072857E-5,7.221038217068959E-5,7.229260464557007E-5,0.04242184665793547,7.292589816339501E-5,7.254451624621199E-5,7.559414989487792E-5,7.179314839414354E-5,7.179506902899384E-5,7.197696143037654E-5,7.350681489559016E-5,7.21347309308282E-5,7.743052299704092E-5,7.233763528426029E-5,7.187129200754789E-5,7.220302539820622E-5,7.179927517690587E-5,7.18417032659262E-5,7.16252957438532E-5,7.164387865005956E-5,7.180514031380517E-5,7.256253239341744E-5,7.219381167325498E-5,7.190837752288683E-5,7.278213971032845E-5,7.193597635112162E-5,7.432605162514638E-5,7.323306537119736E-5,7.166168607052772E-5,7.182006277915645E-5,7.179515287555152E-5,7.381573835847889E-5,7.182113132477175E-5,7.163751831077666E-5,7.242384259542451E-5,7.183963054160557E-5,7.725562726787954E-5,7.178042535137972E-5,7.166085734423932E-5,7.200301690559683E-5,7.271722631911297E-5,7.19982

{"value":"I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The sci fi channel has run worse, but not by much. A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable. We get some gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it. Reminds me of all those low-budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.","finished_norm":["i","rememb","watch","attack","when","it","come","out","and","catch","it","again","recent","the","sci","fi","channel","have","run","wrong","but","not","by","much","a","shameless","ripoff","of","jurass","park","attack","substitut","sabertooth","cat","for","dinosaur","and","thei","be","on","the","loos","devour","a","mani","extra","a","possibl","the","cgi","be","pretti","bad","and","closeup","of","prosthet","cat","head","be","laughabl","we","get","some","gore","which","help","a","littl","wait","until","you","see","how","the","mad","scientist","who","start","thi","whole","mess","get","it","other","than","robert","carradin","who","have","veri","littl","to","do","the","cast","be","unknown","appar","thi","be","shoot","in","fiji","nice","work","if","you","can","get","it","remind","me","of","all","that","lowbudget","monster","stv","that","be","popular","in","the","and"],"filtered":["rememb","watch","attack","come","catch","recent","sci","fi","channel","run","wrong","much","shameless","ripoff","jurass","park","attack","substitut","sabertooth","cat","dinosaur","thei","loos","devour","mani","extra","possibl","cgi","pretti","bad","closeup","prosthet","cat","head","laughabl","get","gore","help","littl","wait","see","mad","scientist","start","thi","whole","mess","get","robert","carradin","veri","littl","cast","unknown","appar","thi","shoot","fiji","nice","work","get","remind","lowbudget","monster","stv","popular"],"filtered2":["rememb","watch","attack","come","catch","recent","sci","fi","channel","run","wrong","shameless","ripoff","jurass","park","attack","substitut","sabertooth","cat","dinosaur","loos","devour","mani","extra","possibl","cgi","pretti","bad","closeup","prosthet","cat","head","laughabl","get","gore","help","littl","wait","see","mad","scientist","start","whole","mess","get","robert","carradin","veri","littl","cast","unknown","appar","shoot","fiji","nice","work","get","remind","lowbudget","monster","stv","popular"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,9,14,15,25,34,48,50,71,78,92,111,117,137,185,208,262,290,308,331,358,402,407,413,495,512,539,552,562,644,728,792,805,831,935,940,951,1001,1012,1222,1361,1413,1511,1946,2658,3222,4083,4408,4682,5051,5863,6790],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,9,14,15,25,34,48,50,71,78,92,111,117,137,185,208,262,290,308,331,358,402,407,413,495,512,539,552,562,644,728,792,805,831,935,940,951,1001,1012,1222,1361,1413,1511,1946,2658,3222,4083,4408,4682,5051,5863,6790],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.389902141215977,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.1183455303375887,2.2797301185117202,2.2939035841256437,2.518833027372001,2.6289494000279396,2.726701583487816,2.8612813773965557,2.8753661172782943,2.932274249550174,3.2030824725120812,3.084424928710765,3.120015873813468,3.467417180966871,7.0347237149662565,3.369778711402955,3.6105180246075443,3.424750734647968,3.432149042129413,3.5670958631572662,3.7740817043309423,8.230887852492694,4.096025840389245,3.9282323841582003,4.135246553542527,3.952924996748572,4.004218291136122,4.035401218572811,4.297765483040301,4.3336974922663645,5.00274712124725,4.484804029712395,4.566029469634981,4.911775343041523,5.770002273960917,5.501738287366237,5.850044981634453,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618,6.342521466732247,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.34438645601323E-5,6.30160477494386E-5,6.3505937431792E-5,6.31389994487597E-5,6.314003391017909E-5,6.305177676056234E-5,6.323930157901973E-5,6.302512164855532E-5,6.316682509740313E-5,7.008014430445016E-5,0.507546778815563,6.29233852067101E-5,6.409781898807074E-5,6.501218846053574E-5,6.296926828279238E-5,6.279524839393983E-5,6.436159731471606E-5,6.324522662422742E-5,6.304900855500099E-5,6.310126497317025E-5,6.371180672142168E-5,6.330788663976459E-5,6.33799722729173E-5,6.344825708439988E-5,0.07487125146427381,6.360082681733701E-5,6.627448475292568E-5,6.294209175218982E-5,6.294377560054686E-5,6.310324330008281E-5,6.444448796379693E-5,6.324156210341217E-5,0.034021098898522034,6.341945128526734E-5,6.301060138848188E-5,6.330143685090581E-5,6.294746319126721E-5,6.298466051067332E-5,6.279493290553469E-5,6.281122480822494E-5,6.29526052416315E-5,6.361662183421245E-5,6.329335904495592E-5,0.04475466163720614,6.38091547457736E-5,6.306731108821249E-5,6.516272465562443E-5,6.420448779571883E-5,6.282683683135035E-5,6.29656879828724E-5,6.29438491100369E-5,6.471532563257832E-5,6.296662479227084E-5,6.280564860676734E-5,6.34950304820344E-5,6.298284332327753E-5,0.2103834914054032,6.293093727654808E-5,6.282611027502502E-5,6.312608651212

{"value":"I am from the Dallas/Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was way off as far as making it look like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of one scene! Texas doesn't have mountains. I guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The accents are also really bad. They should have gotten actors from Texas to play the parts. There a lot of aspiring actors from Texas out in Hollywood. The movie is really sad though, because it is a true story. I pray that the killer is found and convicted. The one good thing is that bc of her death, we now have the Amber Alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted.","finished_norm":["i","be","from","the","dallasfort","worth","area","and","live","in","arlington","for","a","few","year","thi","movi","be","wai","off","a","far","a","make","it","look","like","arlington","i","see","mountain","in","the","background","of","on","scene","texa","doe","not","have","mountain","i","guess","that","happen","when","a","movi","that","be","suppos","to","be","in","texa","be","film","in","canada","the","accent","be","conjur","realli","bad","thei","should","have","get","actor","from","texa","to","plai","the","part","there","a","lot","of","aspir","actor","from","texa","out","in","hollywood","the","movi","be","realli","sad","though","becaus","it","be","a","true","stori","i","prai","that","the","killer","be","find","and","convict","the","on","good","thing","be","that","bc","of","her","death","we","now","have","the","amber","alert","to","help","find","miss","child","quickli","after","thei","be","abduct"],"filtered":["dallasfort","worth","area","live","arlington","year","thi","movi","wai","far","make","look","like","arlington","see","mountain","background","scene","texa","doe","mountain","guess","happen","movi","suppos","texa","film","canada","accent","conjur","realli","bad","thei","get","actor","texa","plai","part","lot","aspir","actor","texa","hollywood","movi","realli","sad","though","becaus","true","stori","prai","killer","find","convict","good","thing","bc","death","amber","alert","help","find","miss","child","quickli","thei","abduct"],"filtered2":["dallasfort","worth","area","live","arlington","year","wai","far","make","look","like","arlington","see","mountain","background","scene","texa","doe","mountain","guess","happen","suppos","texa","canada","accent","conjur","realli","bad","get","actor","texa","plai","part","lot","aspir","actor","texa","hollywood","realli","sad","though","becaus","true","stori","prai","killer","find","convict","good","thing","bc","death","amber","alert","help","find","miss","child","quickli","abduct"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,13,16,17,18,19,22,29,33,38,39,40,41,57,61,72,86,94,101,116,149,180,185,219,243,245,252,255,300,304,455,559,771,801,1156,1667,1950,2358,2493,2615,2689,3151,4199,4746,7190],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,13,16,17,18,19,22,29,33,38,39,40,41,57,61,72,86,94,101,116,149,180,185,219,243,245,252,255,300,304,455,559,771,801,1156,1667,1950,2358,2493,2615,2689,3151,4199,4746,7190],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,2.2635883139467947,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,3.038623282696244,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.9209463754160525,2.031112399272319,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.3253197803590226,2.7097314792693545,2.518833027372001,2.5792094178355414,2.627841366673578,2.7502029743242886,3.0433232530252132,2.6754694156628323,2.932274249550174,2.871119826396843,3.2787058260741455,3.5727776966246974,3.7264536553416874,3.7881170224473255,4.2860694432771105,9.759374056980045,20.05889324917586,5.185068678041204,5.170884043049248,5.290429193699031,5.426230734858092,5.583416318380505,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.667831230406762E-5,7.616125251827523E-5,7.675333363310758E-5,7.630985205369484E-5,7.631110230470543E-5,7.620443463355551E-5,7.64310772993851E-5,7.617221924098534E-5,7.634348215790644E-5,8.46989260277109E-5,0.49016022084249433,7.604926048501109E-5,7.746868221935807E-5,7.857378999387778E-5,7.61047148124185E-5,7.58943942167696E-5,7.778748494440936E-5,7.64382383144021E-5,7.6201088977801E-5,7.626424613224067E-5,7.700214744344978E-5,7.65139692660654E-5,7.660109202773578E-5,7.66836211128851E-5,7.72721285089542E-5,7.686801703062138E-5,8.009940243881961E-5,7.607186923286037E-5,7.607390433351335E-5,7.626663713994319E-5,7.788766665813968E-5,7.643380937121799E-5,0.3110568038646425,7.664880639790254E-5,7.615467004147855E-5,7.650617404539533E-5,7.60783611590057E-5,7.612331787300903E-5,7.589401291719673E-5,7.591370332557855E-5,7.608457584574413E-5,7.688710690235634E-5,7.649641120179094E-5,7.619396577563146E-5,7.711980235405764E-5,7.622320943605614E-5,7.87557281759243E-5,7.759760223711945E-5,7.593257203090111E-5,7.610038765868488E-5,7.607399317714975E-5,0.07963749066567764,7.61015198873743E-5,7.590696392343463E-5,7.674015148372881E-5,7.612112161867277E-5,0.05941113547083029,7.605838792347331E-5,7.593169391426671E-5,7.629424546675559E-5,7.705102026107997E-5,7.628919816844911E-5,7.591764638113782E-5,7.609440899339397E-5,7.589493086871744E-5,7.76509822622545

{"value":"It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words, yet very naive on the corporate world. The Justice Department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, yet every bit as sinister. I seriously doubt ANY corp would actually kill someone directly; even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they do kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios didn't know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news.","finished_norm":["it","be","interest","to","see","how","accur","the","write","be","on","the","geek","buzz","word","yet","veri","naiv","on","the","corpor","world","the","justic","depart","would","catch","much","of","the","big","corp","giant","if","thei","do","such","naiv","thing","to","win","the","real","corpor","world","be","much","much","subtl","and","interest","yet","everi","bite","a","sinist","i","serious","doubt","ani","corp","would","actual","kill","someon","directli","even","the","mod","be","much","indirect","thi","dai","in","the","real","world","thei","do","kill","peopl","with","nicotin","pollut","addit","poison","etc","thi","movi","must","have","be","develop","by","some","garag","geek","i","think","and","the","studio","do","not","know","the","differ","thei","just","want","someth","to","capit","on","the","microsoft","antitrust","case","in","the","new"],"filtered":["interest","see","accur","write","geek","buzz","word","yet","veri","naiv","corpor","world","justic","depart","catch","much","big","corp","giant","thei","naiv","thing","win","real","corpor","world","much","much","subtl","interest","yet","everi","bite","sinist","serious","doubt","ani","corp","actual","kill","someon","directli","even","mod","much","indirect","thi","dai","real","world","thei","kill","peopl","nicotin","pollut","addit","poison","etc","thi","movi","must","develop","garag","geek","think","studio","know","differ","thei","want","someth","capit","microsoft","antitrust","case","new"],"filtered2":["interest","see","accur","write","geek","buzz","word","yet","veri","naiv","corpor","world","justic","depart","catch","big","corp","giant","naiv","thing","win","real","corpor","world","subtl","interest","yet","everi","bite","sinist","serious","doubt","ani","corp","actual","kill","someon","directli","even","mod","indirect","dai","real","world","kill","peopl","nicotin","pollut","addit","poison","etc","must","develop","garag","geek","think","studio","know","differ","want","someth","capit","microsoft","antitrust","case","new"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,12,15,23,26,27,29,37,52,53,60,65,76,80,82,85,87,132,139,141,154,165,194,204,258,288,320,371,429,489,512,567,907,932,1185,1426,1602,1739,1995,2006,2013,2125,2709,2826,2965,3715,3915,4858,4928],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,12,15,23,26,27,29,37,52,53,60,65,76,80,82,85,87,132,139,141,154,165,194,204,258,288,320,371,429,489,512,567,907,932,1185,1426,1602,1739,1995,2006,2013,2125,2709,2826,2965,3715,3915,4858,4928],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,3.676353282473182,1.9073850067444174,4.267533106664805,3.9903607800925114,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.348499626138016,7.346542799916893,5.075762444685391,2.624524614047584,2.7061321952397077,2.8015621426949333,2.938298364153555,3.0466846007279185,3.2872346624216657,3.3956930001684253,3.369778711402955,3.454678155189441,4.181290492043933,4.058285512406398,4.235066888824737,4.5432147918688095,4.613282354485526,4.733083554298147,4.890269137820559,4.911775343041523,9.867508499520596,5.00274712124725,10.852461469716184,5.339219357868463,5.521540914662417,11.591955520728355,5.822646007446338,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.616055473379794E-5,6.571441864615287E-5,6.622528558919899E-5,0.062121064037146054,6.584371394098994E-5,6.575167758698862E-5,6.594723228879493E-5,6.572388109304705E-5,6.587165233694059E-5,0.16425929774331618,0.5421127328144905,6.56177882584477E-5,6.684251173662242E-5,6.779603485425341E-5,6.566563606512756E-5,6.548416457909779E-5,6.711758515055463E-5,6.59534110466698E-5,6.574879084582263E-5,6.580328490349785E-5,6.643997027934177E-5,6.601875418767027E-5,0.17273987817827965,6.616513534760888E-5,6.66729187692689E-5,0.022867284516150044,6.911238314926905E-5,6.56372958252498E-5,6.563905177662764E-5,6.580534794311385E-5,6.720402520844605E-5,6.594958960969317E-5,7.079129774276858E-5,6.613509607330913E-5,6.570873906996888E-5,0.031001101410242076,6.564289727137139E-5,6.568168739400312E-5,6.548383558136033E-5,6.550082510945936E-5,6.56482595062688E-5,6.634070953941524E-5,6.600360451578075E-5,6.574264471410877E-5,6.654148678275806E-5,6.576787710039906E-5,6.795301706590829E-5,6.695374814278588E-5,6.551710564529456E-5,6.566190245541665E-5,6.563912843382172E-5,6.748646024820317E-5,6.566287937934633E-5,6.549501013295534E-5,6.621391159974516E-5,6.56797923939587E-5,7.06313983238085E-5,6.562566371076026E-5,6.551634797755374E-5,6.582916931009879E-5,6.648213934421365E-5,6.582481433610641E-5,6.5504227306707

{"value":"This movie is truly awful. After seeing the advertisement for it, i thought it could have its charms ... but it didn't.The girls cannot act, and they cannot sing either. The soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs, and its not a pretty sight, Terrible story line, unbelievable plot, its one of Disney's worst movies by FAR!. Ally is not a bad actress on \"Phil of the Future\", so i don't know what happened in \"Cow Belles\". And her sister, AJ, seems to be just hitching a ride on her sisters \"fame\", and she displays no talent what so ever.<br /><br />At the end of the movie the girls do finally learn some cliché morals,

{"value":"What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier I had watched Lillies and that was one of the best Gay films I have ever seen.

No you would be wasting your time and money. I don't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them. Spend your time Watching Noah's Arc on Logo instead.

{"value":"Way back when I was renting videos for free I picked this one up. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was gross and unecessary. 2: There is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way I felt for days after viewing this trash I figure they had something subliminal going on in the track. Either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. Many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent. And don't even ask about the acting.","finished_norm":["wai","back","when","i","be","rent","video","for","free","i","pick","thi","on","up","oop","the","thing","i","want","to","mention","outsid","the","summari","alreadi","give","be","thi","someon","who","have","a","lot","to","do","with","make","thi","movi","have","a","strang","and","sick","fascin","for","food","it","be","gross","and","unecessari","there","be","some","kind","of","a","soundtrack","in","the","background","of","the","film","that","seem","to","be","there","the","entir","time","and","by","the","wai","i","feel","for","dai","after","view","thi","trash","i","figur","thei","have","someth","sublimin","go","on","in","the","track","either","that","or","it","be","just","traumatisingli","bad","or","both","mani","time","throughout","the","movi","you","can","tell","the","writer","and","director","do","not","have","much","experi","or","talent","and","do","not","even","ask","about","the","act"],"filtered":["wai","back","rent","video","free","pick","thi","oop","thing","want","mention","outsid","summari","alreadi","give","thi","someon","lot","make","thi","movi","strang","sick","fascin","food","gross","unecessari","kind","soundtrack","background","film","seem","entir","time","wai","feel","dai","view","thi","trash","figur","thei","someth","sublimin","go","track","either","traumatisingli","bad","mani","time","throughout","movi","tell","writer","director","much","experi","talent","even","ask","act"],"filtered2":["wai","back","rent","video","free","pick","oop","thing","want","mention","outsid","summari","alreadi","give","someon","lot","make","strang","sick","fascin","food","gross","unecessari","kind","soundtrack","background","seem","entir","time","wai","feel","dai","view","trash","figur","someth","sublimin","go","track","either","traumatisingli","bad","mani","time","throughout","tell","writer","director","experi","talent","even","ask","act"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,9,21,29,30,33,35,37,43,50,53,58,63,72,90,122,132,139,198,207,240,276,285,287,306,312,330,333,415,417,438,446,661,671,686,778,791,796,801,867,1258,1390,1655,1839,6691],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,9,21,29,30,33,35,37,43,50,53,58,63,72,90,122,132,139,198,207,240,276,285,287,306,312,330,333,415,417,438,446,661,671,686,778,791,796,801,867,1258,1390,1655,1839,6691],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,1.8729627573220065,1.9209463754160525,2.0477128419653545,2.2489347673732487,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.5439726117360975,2.5531798379045583,2.7666071276613566,2.7884729505849193,2.808171552082607,2.841890188081905,2.8739486825973213,2.8824835850471584,2.9292757465539174,2.948928684455311,3.1588018988486244,3.1932880749197934,3.1797351085150902,3.233054746047873,3.5727776966246974,3.6466665387238555,3.6016814428070463,3.8059428063999263,3.8240921249056035,3.850067611308864,3.7881170224473255,3.8844878351953436,4.34596758485818,4.456830177669989,4.760735085628657,4.760735085628657,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.41483581732704E-5,9.351349378401866E-5,9.424047202847735E-5,9.369594957711943E-5,9.369748467976339E-5,9.356651432051621E-5,9.38447942439873E-5,9.35269591160881E-5,9.373724181480149E-5,1.0399635287910794E-4,0.8031072730482804,9.337598598365794E-5,9.511880245716469E-5,9.647569307524403E-5,9.34440747785483E-5,9.318583567318241E-5,9.551023977813387E-5,9.385358679283775E-5,9.356240640542474E-5,9.363995300522225E-5,9.454597447148445E-5,9.394657194793254E-5,9.40535443723941E-5,9.41548765174932E-5,9.487746682298944E-5,9.438128438155627E-5,0.18954010529461013,9.340374580812985E-5,9.340624457707035E-5,9.364288876949258E-5,9.563324644825061E-5,9.384814877892357E-5,1.0073803767597594E-4,9.41121297725873E-5,9.350541158496524E-5,9.393700069883181E-5,9.341171682587396E-5,9.346691627778019E-5,9.31853675000096E-5,9.32095440835207E-5,9.341934743921694E-5,9.440472360482004E-5,9.392501353233276E-5,9.355366028453286E-5,9.469043535399353E-5,9.358956669057167E-5,9.669908324404149E-5,9.5277095038772E-5,9.323271175079967E-5,9.343876174534056E-5,9.340635366244599E-5,9.60351595729323E-5,9.344015193598227E-5,9.32012692059464E-5,9.422428651677379E-5,9.346421963861747E-5,1.0051049623790119E-4,9.338719297713138E-5,9.323163356797418E-5,9.367678725477732E-5,9.460598225466226E-5,9.367059000245804E-5,9.32143855073332E-5,9.34314209275227E-5,9.318649459352484E-5,9.534263693157985E-5,9.3989252500788E-5,9.378904163172375E-5,9.370701887597633E-5,9.404859585535544E-5,9.318309500241305E-5,9.370898339973047E-5,9.52288809022711E-5,9.33500

{"value":"This is a well made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline. The problem is, Frontline already did this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story. More troubling is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson--a former think tank wonk, was a war supporter until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? <br /><br />The invasion of Poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky Nazis.And that is what this film feels like--an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself. <br /><br />Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better--as if any war can be better.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","good","make","inform","film","in","the","vein","of","pb","frontlin","the","problem","be","frontlin","alreadi","do","thi","piec","and","manag","to","bring","l","paul","bremer","in","to","tell","hi","side","of","the","stori","much","troubl","be","the","fact","that","the","director","of","the","film","charl","fergusona","former","think","tank","wonk","be","a","war","support","until","the","occup","go","south","what","do","he","think","would","happen","br","br","the","invas","of","poland","go","realli","good","too","until","it","be","mess","up","by","that","peski","nazisand","that","be","what","thi","film","feel","likean","apologi","for","occup","rather","than","a","deconstruct","of","the","act","of","war","itself","br","br","ferguson","seem","to","suggest","that","the","war","can","have","be","run","bettera","if","ani","war","can","be","well"],"filtered":["thi","good","make","inform","film","vein","pb","frontlin","problem","frontlin","alreadi","thi","piec","manag","bring","l","paul","bremer","tell","hi","side","stori","much","troubl","fact","director","film","charl","fergusona","former","think","tank","wonk","war","support","occup","go","south","think","happen","br","br","invas","poland","go","realli","good","mess","peski","nazisand","thi","film","feel","likean","apologi","occup","rather","deconstruct","act","war","br","br","ferguson","seem","suggest","war","run","bettera","ani","war","well"],"filtered2":["good","make","inform","vein","pb","frontlin","problem","frontlin","alreadi","piec","manag","bring","l","paul","bremer","tell","side","stori","troubl","fact","director","charl","fergusona","former","think","tank","wonk","war","support","occup","go","south","think","happen","invas","poland","go","realli","good","mess","peski","nazisand","feel","likean","apologi","occup","rather","deconstruct","act","war","ferguson","seem","suggest","war","run","bettera","ani","war","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,12,13,17,20,21,27,35,43,58,90,94,97,137,160,167,218,250,314,330,345,407,425,458,646,752,840,1040,1044,1223,1299,2140,2820,3266,3649,4812,5201,6977,7532],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,12,13,17,20,21,27,35,43,58,90,94,97,137,160,167,218,250,314,330,345,407,425,458,646,752,840,1040,1044,1223,1299,2140,2820,3266,3649,4812,5201,6977,7532],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,1.9416538289407692,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.865701314626681,2.0477128419653545,2.08112281984698,2.0545557924622586,2.2939035841256437,2.3722295531801256,2.4609576687888097,2.5940874818617203,2.6812935439488212,12.757588077707307,2.9292757465539174,3.0022328381570844,3.120015873813468,3.226987993365636,3.2850956241729166,3.5900195030592035,3.719831114581194,4.049068857301474,4.105687751300982,4.125296222689358,4.5432147918688095,4.5432147918688095,5.170884043049248,5.444579873526289,5.649374286172302,5.672363804397,6.0662680901040895,12.511020179485236,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.358672009313072E-5,8.302307529856278E-5,8.366850054242661E-5,8.318506305494208E-5,8.318642594854431E-5,8.307014794889249E-5,8.331721020809736E-5,8.303503007891675E-5,8.32217230963928E-5,0.2959922460935073,0.3778416104803637,8.290099323316742E-5,8.444829916150452E-5,0.042390655100523165,8.29614437726182E-5,8.27321741365233E-5,8.479582473090044E-5,0.06943123450190297,8.306650086299978E-5,8.313534822324284E-5,8.39397314771648E-5,8.3407570407855E-5,8.350254258022892E-5,8.359250720428796E-5,8.42340367516898E-5,8.379351645317465E-5,8.731603670058187E-5,8.292563893833945E-5,8.292785739338273E-5,8.313795465113053E-5,8.490503241443449E-5,8.332018842862292E-5,8.94371640815684E-5,8.355455582339647E-5,8.301589976705991E-5,8.339907286912945E-5,8.293271576094116E-5,8.298172289420723E-5,8.273175848339125E-5,8.275322291843782E-5,8.293949036597957E-5,8.381432624563586E-5,8.338843043255057E-5,8.305873588894101E-5,8.406798662239495E-5,8.309061428564754E-5,8.585130278646551E-5,8.458883435477129E-5,8.277379161828167E-5,8.295672675972285E-5,8.292795424147374E-5,0.06715093909028472,8.295796099766706E-5,8.274587632324457E-5,8.365413073436433E-5,8.297932876618143E-5,8.923514842390883E-5,8.291094301715437E-5,8.277283438686742E-5,8.316805037723828E-5,8.399300753925674E-5,8.316254833763813E-5,8.27575212274569E-5,8.295020944071588E-5,8.273275913865498E-5,8.464702370565112E-5,8.344546302217319E-5,8.326771196844503E-5,8.319489059100465E-5,8.349814919178739E-5,8.272974091639166E-5,8.319663473291364E-5,8.454602891864446E-5,8.287799720741282E-5,0.14100969900568386,8.30971182120558E-5,8.37474779266706E-5,8.323565018335695E-5,8.270380270603177E-5,8.28063197496312E-5]

{"value":"Prior to watching \"Dahmer,\" I thought no movie could be worse than \"Freddy Got Fingered.\" I was wrong. To sum \"Dahmer\" up, it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. There is no plot to be found, and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about \"Dahmer.\" All you'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men.

My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was terrible. Third, it was like completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad I asked myself to be excused. Basically, I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this.

{"value":"First, this film is not a \"thriller.\" Neither is it \"gripping, taut.\" It might have been so based on the script, but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into.<br /><br />The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over. That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer, and \"cunning vixen\" scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence.<br /><br />I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised.

{"value":"I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.","finished_norm":["i","onli","give","thi","ridicul","titl","comedi","horror","flick","a","becaus","sever","famou","porn","star","of","the","past","appear","in","it","a","group","of","tourist","supposedli","on","vacat","in","ireland","but","actual","in","canada","run","afoul","of","a","cannibalist","inbr","mutant","someth","or","other","and","the","plot","be","much","or","littl","right","out","of","the","hill","have","ey","and","wrong","turn","onli","problem","be","unless","i","miscount","there","onli","on","mutant","on","displai","and","he","be","not","all","that","impress","sort","of","like","the","potbelli","mummi","in","that","homemad","film","from","about","five","year","ago","some","gori","but","silli","death","help","but","the","film","be","strictli","amateur","night","and","bore","beyond","belief","the","end","be","predict","and","have","be","do","to","death","no","pun","intend"],"filtered":["onli","give","thi","ridicul","titl","comedi","horror","flick","becaus","sever","famou","porn","star","past","appear","group","tourist","supposedli","vacat","ireland","actual","canada","run","afoul","cannibalist","inbr","mutant","someth","plot","much","littl","right","hill","ey","wrong","turn","onli","problem","unless","miscount","onli","mutant","displai","impress","sort","like","potbelli","mummi","homemad","film","five","year","ago","gori","silli","death","help","film","strictli","amateur","night","bore","beyond","belief","end","predict","death","pun","intend"],"filtered2":["onli","give","ridicul","titl","comedi","horror","flick","becaus","sever","famou","porn","star","past","appear","group","tourist","supposedli","vacat","ireland","actual","canada","run","afoul","cannibalist","inbr","mutant","someth","plot","littl","right","hill","ey","wrong","turn","onli","problem","unless","miscount","onli","mutant","displai","impress","sort","like","potbelli","mummi","homemad","five","year","ago","gori","silli","death","help","strictli","amateur","night","bore","beyond","belief","end","predict","death","pun","intend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,11,14,22,24,25,30,32,52,53,57,83,96,100,108,121,127,137,167,169,185,210,245,257,264,269,274,281,316,337,385,410,418,440,460,502,505,610,865,926,946,971,1018,1062,1158,1488,1512,2207,2309,2335,2346,2535,2689,2889,3020,3607,5993,6820,8478],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,11,14,22,24,25,30,32,52,53,57,83,96,100,108,121,127,137,167,169,185,210,245,257,264,269,274,281,316,337,385,410,418,440,460,502,505,610,865,926,946,971,1018,1062,1158,1488,1512,2207,2309,2335,2346,2535,2689,2889,3020,3607,5993,6820,8478],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.9739294460164585,1.1175081997259209,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,2.292318797740072,2.0390708128715254,2.1405462403177813,2.138507503627933,2.2190595059394194,2.4359679371086367,2.2939035841256437,2.4609576687888097,2.4214486257841834,2.518833027372001,2.687151791517189,5.500405948648577,2.7602659523229094,2.757740698455715,2.76533567167316,2.748952192422636,2.832333801361687,2.878207028279898,2.973659465713028,3.09496984188738,3.2070272508030975,3.164467636384302,3.212973749990824,3.216957819005698,3.3132665011396125,3.3956930001684253,3.477726550625732,3.9201351739255808,3.9323057095458362,3.9612932464190886,4.181290492043933,4.268777946167049,4.100845126825194,4.2860694432771105,4.581533656170946,4.535724120139652,5.7446844659766265,10.612859070090943,5.0768550934009715,5.274680836730892,5.274680836730892,5.426230734858092,5.373120909544144,5.907203395474402,5.7959777603641776,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.976323312640887E-5,5.936023567393413E-5,5.9821704903396974E-5,5.947605445516318E-5,5.947702890335287E-5,5.939389190272739E-5,5.957053765910049E-5,5.936878315999978E-5,5.950226582703185E-5,6.601451583438181E-5,0.6825109805563572,5.927294885460868E-5,0.21679590975099847,6.124057230691692E-5,5.9316170070584E-5,5.915224576902652E-5,6.062772454634667E-5,5.957611896882187E-5,5.9391284291803126E-5,5.9440509106890495E-5,6.001563089505919E-5,5.963514382713111E-5,5.970304748541295E-5,0.09608354993504706,6.022605468860166E-5,5.9911089377512244E-5,6.242963776060155E-5,5.9290570158831636E-5,5.929215632043464E-5,5.9442372663174385E-5,6.0705806378520105E-5,5.957266704146378E-5,6.394621156585995E-5,5.974023616291602E-5,5.935510527808257E-5,5.962906821622916E-5,5.929562997932069E-5,5.933066933398103E-5,5.915194858336112E-5,5.916729532784619E-5,5.9300473718850115E-5,5.992596806250893E-5,5.9621459035995884E-5,5.9385732453492235E-5,6.010733137254546E-5,5.940852502211971E-5,6.13823752973782E-5,6.0

Make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say \"horrible rip-off of Samara (The Ring)\"? Don't get me started with the \"dead child\". Not even that scary! So what? He has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the Grudge! 1/10!

{"value":"This was a \"cute\" movie at first, then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs, at best.<br /><br />There is too much King James English spoken with is not only annoying in today's world but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film? Forget it.<br /><br />Bing Crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as \"Hank Martin.\" Rhonda Fleming (\"Alisande La Carteloise\") was, too, in addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair. <br /><br />It's a nice movie with a feel-good ending, and I can't knock that. Maybe this is worthy of a rental, for historical sake or if you're a big Crosby fan but, overall, it's not that much.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","cute","movi","at","then","then","get","too","sappi","and","featur","mediocr","song","at","bestbr","br","there","be","too","much","king","jame","english","speak","with","be","not","onli","annoi","in","todai","world","but","not","alwai","easi","to","interpret","can","you","imagin","young","peopl","of","todai","try","to","listen","to","thi","film","forget","itbr","br","bing","crosbi","have","some","good","line","in","here","and","be","likabl","a","hank","martin","rhonda","fleme","alisand","la","cartelois","be","too","in","addit","to","her","good","look","and","beauti","long","red","hair","br","br","it","a","nice","movi","with","a","feelgood","end","and","i","ca","not","knock","that","mayb","thi","be","worthi","of","a","rental","for","histor","sake","or","if","you","re","a","big","crosbi","fan","but","overal","it","not","that","much"],"filtered":["thi","cute","movi","get","sappi","featur","mediocr","song","bestbr","br","much","king","jame","english","speak","onli","annoi","todai","world","alwai","easi","interpret","imagin","young","peopl","todai","try","listen","thi","film","forget","itbr","br","bing","crosbi","good","line","likabl","hank","martin","rhonda","fleme","alisand","la","cartelois","addit","good","look","beauti","long","red","hair","br","br","nice","movi","feelgood","end","ca","knock","mayb","thi","worthi","rental","histor","sake","re","big","crosbi","fan","overal","much"],"filtered2":["cute","get","sappi","featur","mediocr","song","bestbr","king","jame","english","speak","onli","annoi","todai","world","alwai","easi","interpret","imagin","young","peopl","todai","try","listen","forget","itbr","bing","crosbi","good","line","likabl","hank","martin","rhonda","fleme","alisand","la","cartelois","addit","good","look","beauti","long","red","hair","nice","feelgood","end","ca","knock","mayb","worthi","rental","histor","sake","re","big","crosbi","fan","overal"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,11,16,23,24,36,68,81,82,99,107,135,140,163,165,197,262,271,305,325,328,340,344,373,412,431,541,588,620,744,766,779,787,789,813,845,855,953,1185,1232,1270,1337,1410,1438,1504,2075,2167,3303,5113,6040,6065,7160,7546],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,11,16,23,24,36,68,81,82,99,107,135,140,163,165,197,262,271,305,325,328,340,344,373,412,431,541,588,620,744,766,779,787,789,813,845,855,953,1185,1232,1270,1337,1410,1438,1504,2075,2167,3303,5113,6040,6065,7160,7546],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4680183469605717,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.056430207256609,2.1439533986393955,2.366244071437088,2.317169775997098,2.4000574358028657,2.448847599972298,2.558331832813986,2.726701583487816,2.757740698455715,2.8612813773965557,2.973659465713028,3.1550424959247185,2.948928684455311,2.983093497946387,3.0316467233633775,3.107414446935464,3.1419947805322432,3.8023521382691974,3.6375061693251913,3.7568101178222815,3.700222643192818,3.9825254665248626,3.8463152616903136,3.760240652919071,7.611885612799853,3.8204358137024927,3.831445099210862,3.9201351739255808,4.1302590120314875,4.235066888824737,4.470719289830655,4.3521595551061,4.396611317676934,4.443131333311827,4.513582994262438,4.535724120139652,5.0768550934009715,5.390512652256013,5.541743621979936,13.200701152068694,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.237613515321834E-5,6.19555182915302E-5,6.243716336861533E-5,6.207640077350609E-5,6.207741782544255E-5,6.199064600076099E-5,6.217501486766055E-5,0.25015412104495094,6.210375813000609E-5,6.890072953466238E-5,0.7198460201182689,6.186441521436196E-5,6.301908384595553E-5,6.39180649245813E-5,6.190952610057289E-5,6.173843488187629E-5,6.327842291155934E-5,6.218084019723696E-5,6.19879243827539E-5,6.203930135080192E-5,6.263956797815275E-5,6.224244567516532E-5,6.23133181421456E-5,6.238045375343724E-5,6.285919168823041E-5,6.253045581191774E-5,6.51591173838446E-5,6.188280693777261E-5,6.188446244778015E-5,6.204124638343398E-5,6.335991855130091E-5,6.217723734852607E-5,6.674199715285808E-5,6.235213274190453E-5,6.195016359018147E-5,6.223610443311845E-5,6.188808797814083E-5,6.192465928473919E-5,6.173812470298769E-5,6.17541424208735E-5,6.189314349029653E-5,6.254598500633551E-5,6.222816257271689E-5,6.198212981310442E-5,6.273527768256581E-5,0.02518733582284648,6.406606766866704E-5,6.31239574694118E-5,6.176949170123714E-5,6.190600605536053E-5,6.188453472014119E-5,6.362619815374346E-5,6.190692709871209E-5,6.174866006417642E-5,6.242643997752139E-5,6.192287267972412E-5,6.659124406730573E-5,6.187184018653485E-5,6.176877737250164E-5,6.206370515531952E-5,6.26793249496642E-5,
