{"value":"I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One. (didn't make it past the first six episodes) <br /><br />The writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing. The dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.<br /><br />The characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator) and the removal of the Hodes' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché, I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer's loyalty.<br /><br />Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.<br /><br />Add to that I heard that Season Two wasn't as good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.<br /><br />If you're a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you're stoned and then all bets are off.","finished_norm":["i","have","hear","and","read","so","mani","good","thing","about","we","that","i","be","look","forward","to","get","hook","on","anoth","great","cabl","seri","like","entourag","soprano","or","mad","man","but","that","slowli","erod","awai","with","each","episod","i","watch","from","season","on","do","not","make","it","past","the","six","episod","br","br","the","write","be","unorigin","contriv","and","the","portray","of","black","embarrass","the","dialog","feel","forc","like","the","writer","be","try","wai","too","hard","to","be","clever","and","hip","it","be","a","rare","moment","when","i","actual","emit","a","audibl","laughbr","br","the","charact","never","develop","enough","for","me","to","care","about","them","thei","be","selfish","and","unapp","i","absolut","hate","the","addit","of","the","brotherinlaw","who","should","have","be","haul","awai","on","to","catch","a","predat","and","the","remov","of","the","hode","daughter","quinn","from","the","cast","by","send","her","to","board","school","in","mexico","be","so","unorigin","and","cliché","i","have","to","conclud","the","writer","be","test","the","viewer","loyaltybr","br","episod","after","episod","i","like","the","charact","littl","and","can","not","get","past","mani","of","the","technic","flaw","in","the","stori","linebr","br","add","to","that","i","hear","that","season","two","be","not","a","good","so","i","lose","all","motiv","to","continu","to","watch","thi","plai","outbr","br","if","you","re","a","fan","of","good","cast","and","write","i","suspect","thi","show","will","be","a","challeng","for","you","to","like","unless","of","cours","you","re","stone","and","then","all","bet","be","off"],"filtered":["hear","read","mani","good","thing","look","forward","get","hook","anoth","great","cabl","seri","like","entourag","soprano","mad","man","slowli","erod","awai","episod","watch","season","make","past","six","episod","br","br","write","unorigin","contriv","portray","black","embarrass","dialog","feel","forc","like","writer","try","wai","hard","clever","hip","rare","moment","actual","emit","audibl","laughbr","br","charact","never","develop","enough","care","thei","selfish","unapp","absolut","hate","addit","brotherinlaw","haul","awai","catch","predat","remov","hode","daughter","quinn","cast","send","board","school","mexico","unorigin","cliché","conclud","writer","test","viewer","loyaltybr","br","episod","episod","like","charact","littl","get","past","mani","technic","flaw","stori","linebr","br","add","hear","season","two","good","lose","motiv","continu","watch","thi","plai","outbr","br","re","fan","good","cast","write","suspect","thi","show","challeng","like","unless","cours","re","stone","bet"],"filtered2":["hear","read","mani","good","thing","look","forward","get","hook","anoth","great","cabl","like","entourag","soprano","mad","man","slowli","erod","awai","watch","season","make","past","six","write","unorigin","contriv","portray","black","embarrass","dialog","feel","forc","like","writer","try","wai","hard","clever","hip","rare","moment","actual","emit","audibl","laughbr","charact","never","develop","enough","care","selfish","unapp","absolut","hate","addit","brotherinlaw","haul","awai","catch","predat","remov","hode","daughter","quinn","cast","send","board","school","mexico","unorigin","cliché","conclud","writer","test","viewer","loyaltybr","like","charact","littl","get","past","mani","technic","flaw","stori","linebr","add","hear","season","two","good","lose","motiv","continu","watch","plai","outbr","re","fan","good","cast","write","suspect","show","challeng","like","unless","cours","re","stone","bet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,10,14,16,17,28,29,33,36,40,42,43,45,47,50,51,52,65,68,73,92,93,140,145,155,171,188,199,205,216,221,222,229,279,287,296,299,320,338,339,426,432,433,440,460,512,523,556,699,721,817,831,902,923,944,955,977,1013,1100,1180,1185,1306,1332,1348,1375,1422,1451,1462,1527,1533,1971,2120,2227,2347,2382,2674,2768,3378,3831,4073,5316,6308,6484,7953,8036,8560],"values":[1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,10,14,16,17,28,29,33,36,40,42,43,45,47,50,51,52,65,68,73,92,93,140,145,155,171,188,199,205,216,221,222,229,279,287,296,299,320,338,339,426,432,433,440,460,512,523,556,699,721,817,831,902,923,944,955,977,1013,1100,1180,1185,1306,1332,1348,1375,1422,1451,1462,1527,1533,1971,2120,2227,2347,2382,2674,2768,3378,3831,4073,5316,6308,6484,7953,8036,8560],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.5841531782306313,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,1.9218995441445863,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,

{"value":"Usually, I don't think Hollywood productions are fit to be called film, so I call them 'movies' instead. But this piece of elephant manure, is not even fit to be called a movie, hence the quotes in the title.<br /><br />Where shall i start? 1. If this isn't the start of geriatric casting, it sure is the epitome of it. Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone even LESS than half her age, she's supposed to play an 18 year old, and she is FORTY effing TWO!!!! <br /><br />2. A horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of Paris and France, where we see cliché characters such as: the sympathetic grumpy shop owner, the bitchy queen of models, the fairy god mother ex-queen of models, etc. This film is surpassed only in this respect by the Da Vinci Code, (which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy). <br /><br />3. It's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place, especially if the whole focus is about that<br /><br />4. The horrible accents!!! <br /><br />5. The Nana Mouskouri elevator-music!!!<br /><br />I could go on, but i think this is enough. And I was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour, WHILE surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations ...

{"value":"Very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check. A veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family - check. Mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something good vigilante style - check. A sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check. Cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods - check. A corrupt cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together - check.<br /><br />Slow motion and/or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't - check. A serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail, esp. using childhood abuse as the reason for everything - check. A child spree killer that is very, very non-menacing - check. Foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion - check. Morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check.<br /><br />Recently saw this on TV and decided to endure it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and I could not sleep - check. Realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling -

{"value":"I enjoyed the movie very much, emotionally, intellectually, and visually. It contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and doesn't need them one bit, holding my attention the entire time with the visuals, story, and interspersed words of wisdom.<br /><br />However: [1] some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear & understand; [2] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing (especially the F-word, which is the only reason this movie was rated R). [3] The movie is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film, except the final resolution last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] I will not recommend this movie because of 5-seconds of background narration, which did not add one bit to the side-character it applied to, or the film -- it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward: the main character's mother of German ancestry, when watching old WWII movies, \"secretly roots for the Germans.\" There would be no \"local color\" or art if the Nazi's won the war. I don't know of any Germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazi's won WWII.","finished_norm":["i","enjoi","the","movi","veri","much","emotion","intellectu","and","visual","it","contain","no","violenc","or","sex","or","drug","or","special","effect","and","doe","not","ne","them","on","bite","hold","my","attent","the","entir","time","with","the","visual","stori","and","interspers","word","of","wisdombr","br","howev","some","of","the","foreign","languag","accent","make","the","dialog","difficult","to","hear","understand","there","be","unnecessari","overus","of","swear","especi","the","fword","which","be","the","onli","reason","thi","movi","be","rate","r","the","movi","be","balanc","with","humor","and","emot","but","much","of","the","emot","that","hold","you","throughout","the","film","except","the","final","resolut","last","minut","be","unpleas","due","to","the","exagger","longlast","dysfunct","reaction","of","some","of","the","charact","to","loss","live","in","the","depth","of","bitter","and","depress","for","too","long","i","will","not","recommend","thi","movi","becaus","of","second","of","background","narrat","which","do","not","add","on","bite","to","the","sidecharact","it","appli","to","or","the","film","it","onli","turn","me","off","to","the","movi","and","stick","in","my","brain","through","the","whole","movi","and","afterward","the","main","charact","mother","of","german","ancestri","when","watch","old","wwii","movi","secretli","root","for","the","german","there","would","be","no","local","color","or","art","if","the","nazi","win","the","war","i","do","not","know","of","ani","german","todai","except","radic","skinhead","who","think","the","world","would","be","a","well","place","if","the","nazi","win","wwii"],"filtered":["enjoi","movi","veri","much","emotion","intellectu","visual","contain","violenc","sex","drug","special","effect","doe","ne","bite","hold","attent","entir","time","visual","stori","interspers","word","wisdombr","br","howev","foreign","languag","accent","make","dialog","difficult","hear","understand","unnecessari","overus","swear","especi","fword","onli","reason","thi","movi","rate","r","movi","balanc","humor","emot","much","emot","hold","throughout","film","except","final","resolut","last","minut","unpleas","due","exagger","longlast","dysfunct","reaction","charact","loss","live","depth","bitter","depress","long","recommend","thi","movi","becaus","second","background","narrat","add","bite","sidecharact","appli","film","onli","turn","movi","stick","brain","whole","movi","afterward","main","charact","mother","german","ancestri","watch","old","wwii","movi","secretli","root","german","local","color","art","nazi","win","war","know","ani","german","todai","except","radic","skinhead","think","world","well","place","nazi","win","wwii"],"filtered2":["enjoi","veri","emotion","intellectu","visual","contain","violenc","sex","drug","special","effect","doe","ne","bite","hold","attent","entir","time","visual","stori","interspers","word","wisdombr","howev","foreign","languag","accent","make","dialog","difficult","hear","understand","unnecessari","overus","swear","especi","fword","onli","reason","rate","r","balanc","humor","emot","emot","hold","throughout","except","final","resolut","last","minut","unpleas","due","exagger","longlast","dysfunct","reaction","charact","loss","live","depth","bitter","depress","long","recommend","becaus","second","background","narrat","add","bite","sidecharact","appli","onli","turn","stick","brain","whole","afterward","main","charact","mother","german","ancestri","watch","old","wwii","secretli","root","german","local","color","art","nazi","win","war","know","ani","german","todai","except","radic","skinhead","think","world","well","place","nazi","win","wwii"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,10,11,12,15,17,18,20,22,26,27,59,67,95,96,99,106,110,111,113,116,144,154,156,164,165,179,198,200,202,203,212,216,232,254,258,267,298,299,314,369,382,397,414,416,432,438,453,475,489,506,559,568,635,636,673,697,711,789,801,803,875,914,924,947,1075,1081,1094,1214,1336,1363,1597,1599,1602,1704,1770,1934,2046,2238,2294,2338,2352,2362,2847,2887,3172,3189,3528,3554,4391,4912,6237],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,10,11,12,15,17,18,20,22,26,27,59,67,95,96,99,106,110,111,113,116,144,154,156,164,165,179,198,200,202,203,212,216,232,254,258,267,298,299,314,369,382,397,414,416,432,438,453,475,489,506,559,568,635,636,673,697,711,789,801,803,875,914,924,947,1075,1081,1094,1214,1336,1363,1597,1599,1602,1704,1770,1934,2046,2238,2294,2338,2352,2362,2847,2887,3172,3189,3528,3554,4391,4912,6237],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,

{"value":"For the life of me I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie......and I think I have the qualifications to say so.... I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in the \"lifestyle\" ...

Get Real... No chain of command????? Get Real... EOD clearing buildings??? Get Real....EOD/ Military Intelligence / Sniper qualified buck sergeant???? Get Real.... Wait... I shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all???? Get Real....I carjack an Iraqi civilian, while I am only armed with a 9 mil, break into another civilians house, get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of Bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation???? Get Real...<br /><br />There is absolutely no adherence to military protocol {Army} and no resemblance at all to any Army unit that I have even encountered. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard

{"value":"Released on DVD in the UK as Axe, The Choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film which comprises mostly of people wandering around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are quite obviously destined to be the film's survivors), everyone is thoroughly objectionable, meaning that the viewer couldn't care less when they get slaughtered; the deaths aren't gory enough (unless a brief shot of a pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns your stomach); and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity (an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flick!).<br /><br />The wafer-thin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are picked off by an unseen assailant. For a low budget effort, the production values are okay, and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors, but with not nearly enough genuine scares, a reluctance to get really messy (this is a slasher, so where's the graphic splatter?), way too much dreadful dialogue (particularly from the not-dead-soon-enough drummer) and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie quickly becomes extremely

{"value":"Basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970's classic kitsch horror 'Death Line' which ironically was like this cobblers, also partly filmed at the disused Aldwych underground station.<br /><br />Making good use of the now disused Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross as well as the aforementioned Aldwych, this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not this film's strong point.<br /><br />Indeed strong points are sadly lacking. The gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-Gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device.<br /><br />Franke Polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often, indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film, out-acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.<br /><br />If creepy films set on the London Underground are your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' them pick this up on DVD when it hits a bargain bin. If you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat).<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality well written and acted film, you will need to change

{"value":"this film really tries to hard. if your going to make a horror film, at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer. <br /><br />you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesn't. instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything. <br /><br />what was the point of the movie ? where it's actually going ? and more importantly what the hell was going on . . . <br /><br />why were they there and how does it tie into anything? just another weak sci-fi horror. i love the fake reviews on IMDb saying how great it is by related press releases to bump the movie (either that or people have low horizons). it's not worth your 2hrs at all.<br /><br />i'm not saying the film is better than the fragile, but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result. this doesn't and it just waffle's on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary. this film is about as low as when a stranger calls. god that was lame too. <br /><br />big tip, if your gonna make a horror, make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook into your story. because if there's no reasoning or believability then there's no firm hold on anything and it can't be scary. no disrespect to the cast or crew cause they did a good job. it's just the poor writing.","finished_norm":["thi","film","realli","try","to","hard","if","your","go","to","make","a","horror","film","at","littl","give","it","a","reason","to","believ","in","to","hook","the","viewer","br","br","you","wait","and","wait","through","the","film","expect","for","some","grand","explan","but","it","doe","not","instead","it","try","to","be","too","clever","end","and","not","reveal","anyth","br","br","what","be","the","point","of","the","movi","where","it","actual","go","and","much","importantli","what","the","hell","be","go","on","br","br","why","be","thei","there","and","how","doe","it","tie","into","anyth","just","anoth","weak","scifi","horror","i","love","the","fake","review","on","imdb","sai","how","great","it","be","by","relat","press","releas","to","bump","the","movi","either","that","or","peopl","have","low","horizon","it","not","worth","your","hr","at","allbr","br","i","be","not","sai","the","film","be","well","than","the","fragil","but","at","littl","that","give","you","reason","and","why","thing","happen","and","have","a","end","result","thi","doe","not","and","it","just","waffl","on","with","ton","of","pad","to","make","everyth","feel","scari","thi","film","be","about","a","low","a","when","a","strang","call","god","that","be","lame","too","br","br","big","tip","if","your","gonna","make","a","horror","make","it","believ","with","reason","and","explain","to","the","viewer","what","go","on","so","thei","have","a","hook","into","your","stori","becaus","if","there","no","reason","or","believ","then","there","no","firm","hold","on","anyth","and","it","ca","not","be","scari","no","disrespect","to","the","cast","or","crow","caus","thei","do","a","good","job","it","just","the","poor","write"],"filtered":["thi","film","realli","try","hard","go","make","horror","film","littl","give","reason","believ","hook","viewer","br","br","wait","wait","film","expect","grand","explan","doe","instead","try","clever","end","reveal","anyth","br","br","point","movi","actual","go","much","importantli","hell","go","br","br","thei","doe","tie","anyth","anoth","weak","scifi","horror","love","fake","review","imdb","sai","great","relat","press","releas","bump","movi","either","peopl","low","horizon","worth","hr","allbr","br","sai","film","well","fragil","littl","give","reason","thing","happen","end","result","thi","doe","waffl","ton","pad","make","everyth","feel","scari","thi","film","low","strang","call","god","lame","br","br","big","tip","gonna","make","horror","make","believ","reason","explain","viewer","go","thei","hook","stori","becaus","reason","believ","firm","hold","anyth","ca","scari","disrespect","cast","crow","caus","thei","good","job","poor","write"],"filtered2":["realli","try","hard","go","make","horror","littl","give","reason","believ","hook","viewer","wait","wait","expect","grand","explan","doe","instead","try","clever","end","reveal","anyth","point","actual","go","importantli","hell","go","doe","tie","anyth","anoth","weak","scifi","horror","love","fake","review","imdb","great","relat","press","releas","bump","either","peopl","low","horizon","worth","hr","allbr","well","fragil","littl","give","reason","thing","happen","end","result","doe","waffl","ton","pad","make","everyth","feel","scari","low","strang","call","god","lame","big","tip","gonna","make","horror","make","believ","reason","explain","viewer","go","hook","stori","becaus","reason","believ","firm","hold","anyth","ca","scari","disrespect","cast","crow","caus","good","job","poor","write"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,13,14,17,18,20,22,23,24,29,30,36,43,51,52,54,65,66,73,81,82,83,91,92,94,95,104,130,142,146,152,171,176,193,207,217,219,279,289,327,331,352,373,379,394,395,396,414,417,447,452,591,639,768,781,833,903,955,1000,1175,1351,1425,1744,1955,1964,1971,1973,2892,3030,3679,3768,3879,4777,6345,6411],"values":[4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,13,14,17,18,20,22,23,24,29,30,36,43,51,52,54,65,66,73,81,82,83,91,92,94,95,104,130,142,146,152,171,176,193,207,217,219,279,289,327,331,352,373,379,394,395,396,414,417,447,452,591,639,768,781,833,903,955,1000,1175,1351,1425,1744,1955,1964,1971,1973,2892,3030,3679,3768,3879,4777,6345,6411],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6786144649922705,3.8833076578815384,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,3.6459479802144523,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,2.9360366939211433,1.6608112036218214,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.8950689206770979,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,6.876956393220216,6.031778007123427,2.048953536

{"value":"I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts. I must admit, I found it pretty decent...until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems:<br /><br />1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty fit dude, makes no sound while being killed. Don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer? <br /><br />2. When the remark is made that the gym teacher is \"SOOOO in love with Lisa,\" I almost screamed at the screen. When your best friend's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER, you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart.<br /><br />3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get Donna, boyfriend, aunt, and uncle into a car and drive far, far away, then bait the house with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out?<br /><br />I could go on. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors.<br /><br />HOWEVER.<br /><br />This movie might be good for teenagers, or young couples just looking for a fun night out.

{"value":"I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I've gathered, it will be interesting (when I finally do read it and I will). My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did, I was so disappointed it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well cast (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The kid actors, it seemed, were merely asked to show up, get in the characters' clothes, say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it, just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was cut and paste and the plot (screenplay) was just that as well (even though the author had been involved himself, irony?). The building up of the tension, fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came.<br /><br />I've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the

{"value":"I will admit that I have seen maybe five minutes of \"Jerry Springer\". I don't consider myself a snob, but I really think that I am above watching what's on his show. You should try to elevate yourself above that too.<br /><br />I saw this movie as part of a social studies event I was conducting. I was told that this movie really had little to do with Springer himself, rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on \"Springer.\" Handled better, this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are. I will admit, I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all she has in life. How sad that she feels she must go on Jerry's show in order to resolve this.<br /><br />I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this. Have you noticed that after this movie, she has mainly been relegated to \"B\" roles on TV? I will say this about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy. The problem is that Hagan can't carry a scene on her own. She just doesn't have what it takes to do a lead role.

{"value":"I'll give credit where credit is due, and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. She's brash, sassy, hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves.<br /><br />But that is IT. This dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller. The film, my friends, isn't thrilling in the slightest.<br /><br />For instance, who thought of casting C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man? He is not ugly, but for crying out loud, it looks as though Fiorentino's tough-cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.<br /><br />The script is by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no tension as Fiorentino's character gets eerie phone calls, there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation as Fiorentino gets wimpy Howell to lose his inhibitions.<br /><br />Look for interesting but poorly-done cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino.

{"value":"WARNING! SMALL PLOT DETAILS REVEALED!<br /><br />I can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film. It is written so badly that every character is a caricature, yet it seems to take itself seriously. It is poorly cast, especially Ralph Macchio (all baby-faced, 5-foot-nothing of him) as a streetwise tough. Plot elements are all drawn in black and white, with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax.<br /><br />Most egregious of all (PLOT ELEMENT ABOUT TO BE REVEALED) it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi-serious film. One can just imagine the filmmakers saying, \"We need JoBeth to shed her top...hmmm...I've got it!...early in the film, let's give Nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways...then JoBeth can use that line on him later and REALLY bare herself in the hallway...yeah, that's the ticket!\"<br /><br />I will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984, one that proved all too weighty in the late 90's with events like Columbine. However, the execution is dreadful. This film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of \"Heathers\", a campy political statement like \"Network\" or a serious examination like \"Brubaker\". Instead, it tries to be all of these things -- and ends up being none of these things. \"Teachers\" get an

{"value":"Ever notice how in his later movies Burt Reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?<br /><br />Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham too much.<br /><br />And from the looks of \"Stroker Ace\", WAY too much.<br /><br />Can you believe this was based on a book? Neither could I, but it was. And probably not a best-seller, I'll wager. <br /><br />Burt's another good-old-boy in the NASCAR circuit who hitches up with Beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team. Anderson provides what love interest there is and Nabors does his umpteenth Gomer Pyle impression as faithful mechanic/best friend Lugs. <br /><br />A lot of people here are friends of Burt's or Hal's. Others must have needed the work. And even real NASCAR drivers get in on the act, and look to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /><br />As far as laughs go, Bubba Smith (pre-\"Police Academy\") gets them as Beatty's chauffeur. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs real well. REAL WELL.<br /><br />It's a shame that Burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like \"Stroker Ace\" where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not. They didn't bother to write a character for him, why bother to act?<br /><br />Two stars. Mostly for Petersen, and for the out-takes at the end.

{"value":"I can't say I'm all that experienced in misty Mundae flicks having seen only a handful, but it's obvious that this was made on a shoestring, and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a Tomb Raider rip-off inside a garage, it isn't because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing. The film only runs for forty five minutes, and this is definitely a good thing as there isn't nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer. It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist (who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever could), a mummy, which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and Misty - this film's version of Tomb Raider, who keeps her top on for much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version. I have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings, this film could have been better. It's got Misty Mundae for a start, and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter Darian Caine. The pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a Seduction Cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot, although that isn't really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a rubbish film - but the fact that it's short is to its credit, and if you're after a bit of lesbian sex, you could do worse.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","sai","i","be","all","that","experi","in","misti","munda","flick","have","see","onli","a","hand","but","it","obviou","that","thi","be","make","on","a","shoestr","and","while","it","mai","have","be","respect","that","the","filmmak","be","abl","to","make","a","tomb","raider","ripoff","insid","a","garag","it","be","not","becaus","it","complet","obviou","that","thi","be","what","thei","be","do","the","film","onli","run","for","forti","five","minut","and","thi","be","definit","a","good","thing","a","there","be","not","nearli","enough","plot","here","to","stretch","it","out","for","ani","long","it","have","someth","to","do","with","a","evil","nazi","scientist","who","look","about","a","evil","a","a","porn","star","plai","a","nazi","scientist","ever","can","a","mummi","which","be","clearli","a","man","wrap","up","in","toilet","roll","and","misti","thi","film","version","of","tomb","raider","who","keep","her","top","on","for","much","littl","time","than","angelina","joli","do","in","the","big","budget","version","i","have","to","sai","that","even","in","spite","of","it","shortcom","thi","film","can","have","be","well","it","get","misti","munda","for","a","start","and","even","well","than","that","if","you","ask","me","be","the","fact","that","it","conjur","star","the","even","hot","darian","cain","the","pair","get","to","engag","in","all","the","lesbian","sex","that","you","would","expect","from","a","seduct","cinema","film","and","thi","be","at","the","expens","of","the","nonexist","plot","although","that","be","not","realli","a","bad","thing","obvious","thi","be","a","rubbish","film","but","the","fact","that","it","short","be","to","it","credit","and","if","you","re","after","a","bite","of","lesbian","sex","you","can","do","wrong"],"filtered":["ca","sai","experi","misti","munda","flick","see","onli","hand","obviou","thi","make","shoestr","mai","respect","filmmak","abl","make","tomb","raider","ripoff","insid","garag","becaus","complet","obviou","thi","thei","film","onli","run","forti","five","minut","thi","definit","good","thing","nearli","enough","plot","stretch","ani","long","someth","evil","nazi","scientist","look","evil","porn","star","plai","nazi","scientist","ever","mummi","clearli","man","wrap","toilet","roll","misti","thi","film","version","tomb","raider","keep","top","much","littl","time","angelina","joli","big","budget","version","sai","even","spite","shortcom","thi","film","well","get","misti","munda","start","even","well","ask","fact","conjur","star","even","hot","darian","cain","pair","get","engag","lesbian","sex","expect","seduct","cinema","film","thi","expens","nonexist","plot","although","realli","bad","thing","obvious","thi","rubbish","film","fact","short","credit","re","bite","lesbian","sex","wrong"],"filtered2":["ca","experi","misti","munda","flick","see","onli","hand","obviou","make","shoestr","mai","respect","filmmak","abl","make","tomb","raider","ripoff","insid","garag","becaus","complet","obviou","onli","run","forti","five","minut","definit","good","thing","nearli","enough","plot","stretch","ani","long","someth","evil","nazi","scientist","look","evil","porn","star","plai","nazi","scientist","ever","mummi","clearli","man","wrap","toilet","roll","misti","version","tomb","raider","keep","top","littl","time","angelina","joli","big","budget","version","even","spite","shortcom","well","get","misti","munda","start","even","well","ask","fact","conjur","star","even","hot","darian","cain","pair","get","engag","lesbian","sex","expect","seduct","cinema","expens","nonexist","plot","although","realli","bad","thing","obvious","rubbish","fact","short","credit","re","bite","lesbian","sex","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,11,13,14,16,20,22,25,27,29,32,39,40,44,45,46,53,59,68,71,81,82,93,97,99,100,103,130,134,137,154,220,235,237,254,256,257,272,306,321,323,333,341,356,364,383,392,409,454,494,504,611,666,694,795,805,890,943,971,1098,1220,1239,1414,1442,1484,1743,1891,1907,1934,1989,2104,2205,3470,3472,3590,4194,4258,4598,4862,5187,5424,6808],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,11,13,14,16,20,22,25,27,29,32,39,40,44,45,46,53,59,68,71,81,82,93,97,99,100,103,130,134,137,154,220,235,237,254,256,257,272,306,321,323,333,341,356,364,383,392,409,454,494,504,611,666,694,795,805,890,943,971,1098,1220,1239,1414,1442,1484,1743,1891,1907,1934,1989,2104,2205,3470,3472,3590,4194,4258,4598,4862,5187,5424,6808],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,2.7780513171783934,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,1.13

{"value":"Spoiler: Bunch of passive-aggressive people having family reunion. The script has them saying and doing things people would never do, at least anyone with a shred of decency. The hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion, unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion. He tries to defer to his brother's claim, but she, knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper, rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch. At one point, she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him. He tries to cover his eyes. His heart is breaking. She thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion.<br /><br />The movie really drags. The audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul. The writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. We almost walked out, but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up, but nooooo. All the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this. Comparing it to Little Miss Sunshine??? Jeez.

{"value":"I have begun to melt so I will make this review as short and sweet as possible.<br /><br />There's this astronaut, and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys, ya know? Except something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back...well, never mind what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut has begun to melt! No, not just burn up, but MELT! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well OK maybe not that fast, but ya know what I mean.<br /><br />Anyway, he gets all red & gooey, and the fact that he's melting makes him really mad. I guess he also checked out the \"melting man\" handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts ripping people apart.<br /><br />There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need any others? What's important is WHO will he munch next, and WHAT will be left of them? HOW long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing? WHY was this movie made in the first place? WHERE did they get the money? WHEN will you fall asleep while watching it?<br /><br />I've very nearly melted, but I still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring, even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross.

{"value":"The film, a Universal release of a Protelco-MLC production, is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as \"pure energy,\" and then sending it back complete to a \"target area.\" There is no explanation WHY this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday, \"Devil Doll\") thinks it's something to dedicate his, and his assistants', Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen), lives to. <br /><br />During an experiment before noted Dutch scientist \"Lembach\" (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails due to sabotage, so he has himself \"projected\" by his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to seek revenge. Of course, she screws up and he comes out looking like a \"pork roast\" with the power to electrocute people. <br /><br />With this new-found power, he manages to zap some Cockney idiots, a security guy named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his lab boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat, as well. <br /><br />In the end, though, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. On the whole, a completely pointless movie with no message at all. <br /><br />Also one of the most depressing color films you will ever

{"value":"Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise carrying on, but I found Europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought (and therefore annoying) films I've ever seen. The film starts out promisingly if familiarly, as mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son (Sandro Franchina). Whilst mummy and daddy (bland Alexander Knox) entertain their guests at a dinner party, the youngster tries to kill himself, setting in motion a life changing series of events that find Bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy. Spurred on by Communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband, who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles. Bergman plays the saint role to the hilt, echoing her 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect. Unfortunately, the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety, as Andrea and Mom take turns declaiming Marxist and Christian platitudes. By the final tear soaked scene, I had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters. A real step down for Rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's Flowers of St.

{"value":"Take:<br /><br />1. a famous play<br /><br />2. a director with now ideas of his own who is using<br /><br />3. a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1.<br /><br />4. an actor for the lead - who has no feeling for the part he's playing And you'll get: \"Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark\"<br /><br />I listened to the radio play of \"Hamlet\" with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was so disappointed. I hoped that the filmed version would be better, that Schell would at least have a body language to underline what he's saying - nothing. Then the set... the minimalistic design is not everyone's taste, but usually I like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's the setting and nothing more. Alas, that's on a stage, in a theatre. It won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings. That the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which Schell played the Hamlet already... let's say if that was the only thing to complain about... I ask myself how Schell could get the part of Hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play Hamlet a second time. If you've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on \"Hamlet\", don't watch this one, unless you're a masochist, or really hardcore, or like to poke fun on untalented actors.","finished_norm":["takebr","br","a","famou","playbr","br","a","director","with","now","idea","of","hi","own","who","be","usingbr","br","a","copi","of","the","stage","design","of","a","popular","theatr","product","of","the","plai","mention","in","br","br","a","actor","for","the","lead","who","have","no","feel","for","the","part","he","plai","and","you","will","get","hamlet","prinz","von","dänemarkbr","br","i","listen","to","the","radio","plai","of","hamlet","with","maximilian","schell","a","hamlet","and","i","be","so","disappoint","i","hope","that","the","film","version","would","be","well","that","schell","would","at","littl","have","a","bodi","languag","to","underlin","what","he","sai","noth","then","the","set","the","minimalist","design","be","not","everyon","tast","but","usual","i","like","it","when","there","just","enough","on","the","stage","to","make","clear","what","the","set","and","noth","much","ala","that","on","a","stage","in","a","theatr","it","wo","not","work","in","a","film","base","on","a","plai","that","actual","have","believ","set","that","the","idea","for","the","set","be","copi","from","the","theatr","product","in","which","schell","plai","the","hamlet","alreadi","let","sai","if","that","be","the","onli","thing","to","complain","about","i","ask","myself","how","schell","can","get","the","part","of","hamlet","anywher","in","place","and","how","anybodi","can","allow","him","to","plai","hamlet","a","time","if","you","have","get","the","choic","to","view","ani","of","the","about","sixti","film","base","on","hamlet","do","not","watch","thi","on","unless","you","re","a","masochist","or","realli","hardcor","or","like","to","poke","fun","on","untal","actor"],"filtered":["takebr","br","famou","playbr","br","director","idea","hi","usingbr","br","copi","stage","design","popular","theatr","product","plai","mention","br","br","actor","lead","feel","part","plai","get","hamlet","prinz","von","dänemarkbr","br","listen","radio","plai","hamlet","maximilian","schell","hamlet","disappoint","hope","film","version","well","schell","littl","bodi","languag","underlin","sai","noth","set","minimalist","design","everyon","tast","usual","like","enough","stage","make","clear","set","noth","much","ala","stage","theatr","wo","work","film","base","plai","actual","believ","set","idea","set","copi","theatr","product","schell","plai","hamlet","alreadi","let","sai","onli","thing","complain","ask","schell","get","part","hamlet","anywher","place","anybodi","allow","plai","hamlet","time","get","choic","view","ani","sixti","film","base","hamlet","watch","thi","unless","re","masochist","realli","hardcor","like","poke","fun","untal","actor"],"filtered2":["takebr","famou","playbr","director","idea","usingbr","copi","stage","design","popular","theatr","product","plai","mention","actor","lead","feel","part","plai","get","hamlet","prinz","von","dänemarkbr","listen","radio","plai","hamlet","maximilian","schell","hamlet","disappoint","hope","version","well","schell","littl","bodi","languag","underlin","noth","set","minimalist","design","everyon","tast","usual","like","enough","stage","make","clear","set","noth","ala","stage","theatr","wo","work","base","plai","actual","believ","set","idea","set","copi","theatr","product","schell","plai","hamlet","alreadi","let","onli","thing","complain","ask","schell","get","part","hamlet","anywher","place","anybodi","allow","plai","hamlet","time","get","choic","view","ani","sixti","base","hamlet","watch","unless","re","masochist","realli","hardcor","like","poke","fun","untal","actor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,8,11,13,14,20,27,29,40,41,43,48,49,52,58,61,68,91,93,109,123,124,157,164,181,187,190,220,246,259,265,285,306,312,330,334,376,406,460,521,590,669,681,747,809,845,865,872,951,1094,1118,1209,1292,1559,1765,1823,2569,3012,3046,3453,3729,5058,5433,7743,8064,8080],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,8,11,13,14,20,27,29,40,41,43,48,49,52,58,61,68,91,93,109,123,124,157,164,181,187,190,220,246,259,265,285,306,312,330,334,376,406,460,521,590,669,681,747,809,845,865,872,951,1094,1118,1209,1292,1559,1765,1823,2569,3012,3046,3453,3729,5058,5433,7743,8064,8080],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,2.389902141215977,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,9.770981254992442,3.1375198335242067,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,3.3840606616174704,1.7122153074726136,1.865701314626681,3.7637034094785053,2.0064197866819473,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,8.502764557307428,4.523814194644097,2.2323930368088845,2.3360150694757706,2.3930275298746078,2.44422

{"value":"You may say to yourself, \"Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an terrible choice to me, but perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off.\"<br /><br />NOT!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is an awful Elvis. He's too short, too weak-voiced, too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how bad he would be. Add to that a hokey black wig and heavy-handed eye-liner and mascara and it's a big fat embarrassing mess.<br /><br />The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off, after a while you don't even think of him as Elvis anymore. You see him as some other crazed pop star instead. Then, on that level, the movie becomes watchable.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope.<br /><br />There's nothing new to this story; we've heard it many times before. If you've looking for new info or insight, you won't find it.

{"value":"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original \"Sleepaway Camp\" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it. The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula. There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical. This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards. There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse!

{"value":"I saw this movie once a long time ago, and I have no desire to ever see it again.<br /><br />This movie is about Preston Waters, a hard-lucked preteen, who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash. All this changes when a bank robber runs over Preston's bike and passes him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says that he's working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he just goes crazy with the money.<br /><br />On paper, this sounds like a great idea. However, on screen, it is one of the emptiest movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's too unbelievable. I know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible, but I draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman, and being put in charge of a imaginary person's small fortune. Also, this was a shallow movie with weak acting, a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying, or underdeveloped. But \"Juice\" was a funny character.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","onc","a","long","time","ago","and","i","have","no","desir","to","ever","see","it","againbr","br","thi","movi","be","about","preston","water","a","hardluck","preteen","who","alwai","seem","to","be","overlook","by","hi","famili","and","who","alwai","seem","to","be","short","on","cash","all","thi","chang","when","a","bank","robber","run","over","preston","bike","and","pass","him","a","blank","check","a","compens","preston","us","the","check","to","withdraw","million","from","the","bank","iron","the","monei","belong","to","the","bank","robber","who","give","him","the","check","preston","then","bui","a","mansion","and","sai","that","he","work","a","the","assist","of","a","mysteri","and","wealthi","backer","name","mr","macintosh","name","after","hi","comput","after","that","he","just","go","crazi","with","the","moneybr","br","on","paper","thi","sound","like","a","great","idea","howev","on","screen","it","be","on","of","the","empti","movi","i","have","ever","see","for","on","thing","it","too","unbeliev","i","know","some","part","of","the","movi","be","mean","to","be","incred","but","i","draw","the","line","at","a","twelveyearold","boi","go","out","with","a","thirtyyearold","woman","and","be","put","in","charg","of","a","imaginari","person","small","fortun","conjur","thi","be","a","shallow","movi","with","weak","act","a","predict","plot","line","and","charact","who","be","littl","than","memor","the","charact","be","either","cheesi","over","the","top","annoi","or","underdevelop","but","juic","be","a","funni","characterbr","br","if","you","re","look","for","a","good","movi","to","watch","with","your","famili","skip","thi","on"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","onc","long","time","ago","desir","ever","see","againbr","br","thi","movi","preston","water","hardluck","preteen","alwai","seem","overlook","hi","famili","alwai","seem","short","cash","thi","chang","bank","robber","run","preston","bike","pass","blank","check","compens","preston","us","check","withdraw","million","bank","iron","monei","belong","bank","robber","give","check","preston","bui","mansion","sai","work","assist","mysteri","wealthi","backer","name","mr","macintosh","name","hi","comput","go","crazi","moneybr","br","paper","thi","sound","like","great","idea","howev","screen","empti","movi","ever","see","thing","unbeliev","know","part","movi","mean","incred","draw","line","twelveyearold","boi","go","thirtyyearold","woman","put","charg","imaginari","person","small","fortun","conjur","thi","shallow","movi","weak","act","predict","plot","line","charact","littl","memor","charact","either","cheesi","top","annoi","underdevelop","juic","funni","characterbr","br","re","look","good","movi","watch","famili","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["see","onc","long","time","ago","desir","ever","see","againbr","preston","water","hardluck","preteen","alwai","seem","overlook","famili","alwai","seem","short","cash","chang","bank","robber","run","preston","bike","pass","blank","check","compens","preston","us","check","withdraw","million","bank","iron","monei","belong","bank","robber","give","check","preston","bui","mansion","work","assist","mysteri","wealthi","backer","name","mr","macintosh","name","comput","go","crazi","moneybr","paper","sound","like","great","idea","howev","screen","empti","ever","see","thing","unbeliev","know","part","mean","incred","draw","line","twelveyearold","boi","go","thirtyyearold","woman","put","charg","imaginari","person","small","fortun","conjur","shallow","weak","act","predict","plot","line","charact","littl","memor","charact","either","cheesi","top","annoi","underdevelop","juic","funni","characterbr","re","look","good","watch","famili","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,8,10,14,16,21,26,29,30,32,35,39,44,48,51,56,61,62,68,70,88,99,107,113,123,126,137,143,153,159,178,182,192,197,207,236,271,272,278,282,337,347,357,363,364,379,403,487,505,543,571,576,610,712,765,807,830,931,1074,1144,1150,1182,1246,1265,1400,1418,1454,1465,1522,1540,1621,2040,2108,2126,2437,2726,3058,3169,3556,3654,3865,4242,4279,4354,5796,5918,8270],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,8,10,14,16,21,26,29,30,32,35,39,44,48,51,56,61,62,68,70,88,99,107,113,123,126,137,143,153,159,178,182,192,197,207,236,271,272,278,282,337,347,357,363,364,379,403,487,505,543,571,576,610,712,765,807,830,931,1074,1144,1150,1182,1246,1265,1400,1418,1454,1465,1522,1540,1621,2040,2108,2126,2437,2726,3058,3169,3556,3654,3865,4242,4279,4354,5796,5918,8270],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722

{"value":"Gee, what a heck of a movie!... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades, so I decided to start by this one. It was a pretty adequate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces, but I didn't see anything of the sort in this pastel-coloured mess. I haven't really watched many bad films before, but I've got the feeling this is what's called \"so bad that's good\", probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny! First of all, there are the inaccuracies. There are plot-related inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter in particular are as insane as Van Damme's ass cheeks inside that blue spandex. Extremely tacky lines exist too and I won't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves. There isn't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, which is an utterly stupid character. And, to tell the truth, I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins. He succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me. But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio... which is now bankrupt.","finished_norm":["gee","what","a","heck","of","a","movi","i","sai","i","want","to","becom","a","specialist","in","bad","movi","from","all","decad","so","i","decid","to","start","by","thi","on","it","be","a","pretti","adequ","choic","i","enter","thi","adventur","to","find","some","lose","gem","and","uncomprehend","masterpiec","but","i","do","not","see","anyth","of","the","sort","in","thi","pastelcolour","mess","i","have","not","realli","watch","mani","bad","film","befor","but","i","have","get","the","feel","thi","be","what","call","so","bad","that","good","probabl","becaus","it","be","so","unintention","damn","funni","of","all","there","be","the","inaccuraci","there","be","plotrel","inaccuraci","physic","inaccuraci","and","conjur","psycholog","inaccuraci","the","latter","in","particular","be","a","insan","a","van","damm","ass","cheek","insid","that","blue","spandex","extrem","tacki","line","exist","too","and","i","wo","not","even","start","to","talk","about","some","of","the","hilari","action","move","there","be","not","exactli","bad","act","from","everyon","involv","in","that","hot","mess","of","a","movi","except","in","on","particular","case","geoffrei","lewi","look","complet","pathet","a","frank","which","be","a","utterli","stupid","charact","and","to","tell","the","truth","i","be","actual","veri","surpris","to","see","that","van","damm","do","a","decent","job","plai","the","twin","he","succ","in","achiev","a","differ","tone","and","mood","in","the","two","role","that","be","convinc","to","me","but","the","movi","be","mostli","veri","bad","and","the","sad","part","be","that","it","be","produc","by","a","major","motion","pictur","studio","which","be","now","bankrupt"],"filtered":["gee","heck","movi","sai","want","becom","specialist","bad","movi","decad","decid","start","thi","pretti","adequ","choic","enter","thi","adventur","find","lose","gem","uncomprehend","masterpiec","see","anyth","sort","thi","pastelcolour","mess","realli","watch","mani","bad","film","befor","get","feel","thi","call","bad","good","probabl","becaus","unintention","damn","funni","inaccuraci","plotrel","inaccuraci","physic","inaccuraci","conjur","psycholog","inaccuraci","latter","particular","insan","van","damm","ass","cheek","insid","blue","spandex","extrem","tacki","line","exist","wo","even","start","talk","hilari","action","move","exactli","bad","act","everyon","involv","hot","mess","movi","except","particular","case","geoffrei","lewi","look","complet","pathet","frank","utterli","stupid","charact","tell","truth","actual","veri","surpris","see","van","damm","decent","job","plai","twin","succ","achiev","differ","tone","mood","two","role","convinc","movi","mostli","veri","bad","sad","part","produc","major","motion","pictur","studio","bankrupt"],"filtered2":["gee","heck","want","becom","specialist","bad","decad","decid","start","pretti","adequ","choic","enter","adventur","find","lose","gem","uncomprehend","masterpiec","see","anyth","sort","pastelcolour","mess","realli","watch","mani","bad","befor","get","feel","call","bad","good","probabl","becaus","unintention","damn","funni","inaccuraci","plotrel","inaccuraci","physic","inaccuraci","conjur","psycholog","inaccuraci","latter","particular","insan","van","damm","ass","cheek","insid","blue","spandex","extrem","tacki","line","exist","wo","even","start","talk","hilari","action","move","exactli","bad","act","everyon","involv","hot","mess","except","particular","case","geoffrei","lewi","look","complet","pathet","frank","utterli","stupid","charact","tell","truth","actual","veri","surpris","see","van","damm","decent","job","plai","twin","succ","achiev","differ","tone","mood","two","role","convinc","mostli","veri","bad","sad","part","produc","major","motion","pictur","studio","bankrupt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,15,16,21,22,37,38,39,40,43,47,50,52,61,62,71,78,79,90,103,104,107,115,128,129,136,142,148,186,204,221,232,241,246,249,261,269,275,288,289,309,311,326,329,404,406,407,455,462,478,510,528,602,632,666,758,809,816,818,832,889,890,932,967,970,1021,1040,1076,1129,1139,1164,1170,1174,1196,1285,1435,1460,1546,1660,1718,1851,1860,2015,2237,2367,2410,3034,3744,4954,5051,7528,7684,8134,8474],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,15,16,21,22,37,38,39,40,43,47,50,52,61,62,71,78,79,90,103,104,107,115,128,129,136,142,148,186,204,221,232,241,246,249,261,269,275,288,289,309,311,326,329,404,406,407,455,462,478,510,528,602,632,666,758,809,816,818,832,889,890,932,967,970,1021,1040,1076,1129,1139,1164,1170,1174,1196,1285,1435,146

{"value":"I'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way, in my opinion, that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great. The S7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp. The S7s low end is much better too. Sorry Ferrari fans but the Saleen just gets it done so much better.<br /><br />As for other parts of this film, I just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic. The story is way too weak. The acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps.<br /><br />I can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem. This film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.<br /><br />I can't give the film a \"1 Star\" rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'Variety'.<br /><br />ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James

{"value":"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The \"back to the earth\" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the \"don't ask don't tell\" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the \"good ole boy\" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that \"gay culture\" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles.

{"value":"I agree with everything people said on this one but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WORST one I have ever heard my entire life! There are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk! And the vocals are like a broadway version of Danzig singing, \"The darkness of the forest! Oh the darkness of the dark, dark forest!\" or something else so unthreatening. The singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthed-up string section and fake drum beats. It's horrible!! <br /><br />Yes, the male leads are awful. So are the female ones. This is one bad case of gender stereotyping - it's so bad! Everything they say revolves around being a male or a female, just playing up the stereotypes to the max. Makes me sick. Soooo boring!!! <br /><br />The children were so echoey in their lines, you couldn't understand them. And why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair?

{"value":"Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight singing star. Esther's star rises while John's goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-converible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, \"Evergreen.\" Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star. The very first time she appears, singing in a back alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night, not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. She is too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page out of \"Apartment Living,\" not some hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.<br /><br />Kris Kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like...well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent. The direction is tepid, the story is slow and dull.<br /><br />But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, or the lame direction, or the slow story. It's the hair! After staring at Kristofferson's and Streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2+ hours, your eyes

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />Some plutonium's gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction- so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his cocky young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the assistance of Josh's adopted daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) set out to stop them.<br /><br />This was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 9/11. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown New York that day, so there'd have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where Norris and his side-kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else. Other than that, it's as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been in. It makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place, and whether if this one could get made a President's Man 3 might come out sometime soon.<br /><br />If you've seen one Norris film, you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one, but at least you know what you're getting and, like I said, it might have been just

{"value":"Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark's cruel lackey. Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. Kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. It's a role better suited for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan

{"value":"After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first ever so bare with me.<br /><br />First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest (with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me.) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I wasn't particularly thrilled either! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing, after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality. As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in. Until she adds her constantly away father to the house, due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.<br /><br />Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach.<br /><br />In conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this

{"value":"I was p***ed when I couldn't see this one when it was screening at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, I put it on remind as soon as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well let's backtrack a tad as I have yet to give you the plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray totally hammered asks Sean to off the guy that they had Sean following around. And it goes on from there. Which leads me back to the question posed. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it's nowhere near as violent as I was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. I know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without spoiling the film. But needless to say it happened. The ending doesn't save the film either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good like \"Re-animator\" or \"Castle Freak\".<br /><br />My Grade: C<br /><br />Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme<br /><br />Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her ta-tas
