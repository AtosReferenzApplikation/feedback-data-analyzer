{"value":"I totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie. This is a totally SUCKED movie. I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The story development is strange. Mia Kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all. In addition, all the actresses looked way too old for being college students - College students looked like about 30 years old - you figure out the rest. I watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are lame, hasty and, most importantly, no frontal at all. All the sex scenes are laughable, considering how many clothes they had on. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Acting - 0, Score - 0 out 10.","finished_norm":["i","total","disagre","with","that","comment","which","sai","thi","be","a","good","movi","thi","be","a","total","suck","movi","i","mean","suck","suck","the","stori","develop","be","strang","mia","kirshner","chang","from","a","innoc","girl","to","a","partyfun","seek","chick","for","no","convinc","reason","at","all","in","addit","all","the","actress","look","wai","too","old","for","be","colleg","student","colleg","student","look","like","about","year","old","you","figur","out","the","rest","i","watch","onli","about","ten","minut","and","start","fast","forward","to","look","for","sex","scene","all","the","sex","scene","be","lame","hasti","and","much","importantli","no","frontal","at","all","all","the","sex","scene","be","laughabl","consid","how","mani","cloth","thei","have","on","do","yourself","a","favor","put","it","down","and","save","yourself","a","few","buck","conclus","stori","sex","act","score","out"],"filtered":["total","disagre","comment","sai","thi","good","movi","thi","total","suck","movi","mean","suck","suck","stori","develop","strang","mia","kirshner","chang","innoc","girl","partyfun","seek","chick","convinc","reason","addit","actress","look","wai","old","colleg","student","colleg","student","look","like","year","old","figur","rest","watch","onli","ten","minut","start","fast","forward","look","sex","scene","sex","scene","lame","hasti","much","importantli","frontal","sex","scene","laughabl","consid","mani","cloth","thei","favor","put","save","buck","conclus","stori","sex","act","score"],"filtered2":["total","disagre","comment","good","total","suck","mean","suck","suck","stori","develop","strang","mia","kirshner","chang","innoc","girl","partyfun","seek","chick","convinc","reason","addit","actress","look","wai","old","colleg","student","colleg","student","look","like","year","old","figur","rest","watch","onli","ten","minut","start","fast","forward","look","sex","scene","sex","scene","lame","hasti","importantli","frontal","sex","scene","laughabl","consid","mani","cloth","favor","put","save","buck","conclus","stori","sex","act","score"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,11,16,17,19,21,33,50,57,59,67,71,84,88,95,159,184,189,226,254,278,280,317,320,355,373,415,417,421,478,518,542,545,552,626,699,814,879,956,1041,1110,1153,1185,1238,1407,2892,3347,5052,5498],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,11,16,17,19,21,33,50,57,59,67,71,84,88,95,159,184,189,226,254,278,280,317,320,355,373,415,417,421,478,518,542,545,552,626,699,814,879,956,1041,1110,1153,1185,1238,1407,2892,3347,5052,5498],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,3.589841616087325,2.5541073880211935,3.9371420340352055,1.162015545335049,1.4018535447685214,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,3.9141830778533158,1.9214926742550966,2.2212694515902225,2.0317223413467334,2.0323326556775485,2.300267965194495,4.992499677733764,2.498193474075453,2.5940874818617203,11.558608298103085,2.8336934208777267,2.8028805344481915,2.8529247828056143,2.938298364153555,3.0316467233633775,3.070535816550098,3.1588018988486244,3.1932880749197934,9.779333448565879,3.3243163373261977,3.4101163271295305,3.4471119148061256,3.442099372982581,3.424750734647968,7.3056408085964675,3.5813614403160887,7.872791389594723,3.8962296530720266,3.969732115064953,4.176068548062782,4.1554492608600455,4.235066888824737,4.235066888824737,4.291900363587903,4.443131333311827,5.339219357868463,5.541743621979936,6.137727054086234,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691622E-4,1.8602795149399924E-4,1.8607388323225522E-4,1.8603647642975688E-4,1.8605408257553723E-4,1.8602692579199604E-4,1.8608478274858724E-4,1.8599924801951192E-4,1.8602799080910505E-4,1.8622023057954305E-4,1.8769783390787704E-4,1.8602829807924036E-4,1.8620447863330685E-4,1.8622387792744183E-4,1.8613928128212597E-4,1.8603720920051158E-4,1.8610121319542612E-4,1.8618879305904956E-4,1.8604681349948773E-4,1.8604613329387863E-4,1.8621351007268013E-4,1.8606477321704616E-4,1.8606505480995553E-4,1.8618425007623407E-4,1.8604688061125805E-4,1.8622610376242826E-4,1.8609343812280902E-4,1.8602753456675996E-4,1.8611187150105945E-4,1.8616867552698424E-4,1.8606568589487273E-4,1.861653386243682E-4,1.8625674115804858E-4,1.864296162945663E-4,1.8609311654811612E-4,1.8603709636599505E-4,1.861041732454905E-4,1.8605599017042663E-4,1.859994465392311E-4,1.8604675588381717E-4,1.8623320652672116E-4,1.8613104589010134E-4,1.8616576286309937E-4,1.8600870371092383E-4,1.8604680319079413E-4,1.8603702640894375E-4,1.8609999825564626E-4,1.861322682279495E-4,1.8609441928299885E-4,1.860649229887603E-4,1.8603748646421484E-4,1.8641864706196048E-4,1.860842988547517E-4,1.8604676054910304E-4,1.8608330230440961E-4,1.

{"value":"I saw this film awhile back (while working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins phones his performance in (but still blows away Hewitt in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Trust me on this: you should avoid this film like the plague if it ever gets released. It seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. It is relentlessly unfunny, the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again. In terms of his acting, his character is totally unlikable, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the surprising makeup of the jury near the film's end is cute, but this film is just plain awful.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","awhil","back","while","work","on","a","trailer","for","the","film","product","compani","and","it","be","terribl","hewitt","be","mediocr","at","well","hopkin","phone","hi","perform","in","but","still","blow","awai","hewitt","in","their","scene","togeth","and","alec","look","bore","trust","me","on","thi","you","should","avoid","thi","film","like","the","plagu","if","it","ever","get","releas","it","seem","to","go","on","forev","a","the","tire","plot","unfold","at","a","snail","pace","it","be","relentlessli","unfunni","the","cinematographi","be","crappi","and","the","direct","be","pedestrian","alec","baldwin","should","go","to","film","school","if","he","plan","to","direct","again","in","term","of","hi","act","hi","charact","be","total","unlik","which","make","it","imposs","to","root","for","him","dan","ackroyd","be","pretti","funni","and","the","surpris","makeup","of","the","juri","near","the","film","end","be","cute","but","thi","film","be","just","plain","aw"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","awhil","back","work","trailer","film","product","compani","terribl","hewitt","mediocr","well","hopkin","phone","hi","perform","still","blow","awai","hewitt","scene","togeth","alec","look","bore","trust","thi","avoid","thi","film","like","plagu","ever","get","releas","seem","go","forev","tire","plot","unfold","snail","pace","relentlessli","unfunni","cinematographi","crappi","direct","pedestrian","alec","baldwin","go","film","school","plan","direct","term","hi","act","hi","charact","total","unlik","make","imposs","root","dan","ackroyd","pretti","funni","surpris","makeup","juri","near","film","end","cute","thi","film","plain","aw"],"filtered2":["see","awhil","back","work","trailer","product","compani","terribl","hewitt","mediocr","well","hopkin","phone","perform","still","blow","awai","hewitt","scene","togeth","alec","look","bore","trust","avoid","like","plagu","ever","get","releas","seem","go","forev","tire","plot","unfold","snail","pace","relentlessli","unfunni","cinematographi","crappi","direct","pedestrian","alec","baldwin","go","school","plan","direct","term","act","charact","total","unlik","make","imposs","root","dan","ackroyd","pretti","funni","surpris","makeup","juri","near","end","cute","plain","aw"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,10,16,19,20,21,24,32,35,44,48,62,63,64,78,102,105,108,138,155,166,184,190,270,296,326,327,335,546,555,581,586,615,629,754,787,855,858,882,900,901,948,950,960,983,1077,1290,1324,1363,1745,1923,2514,2709,3168,3693,3747,4064,4758,4833,5703],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,10,16,19,20,21,24,32,35,44,48,62,63,64,78,102,105,108,138,155,166,184,190,270,296,326,327,335,546,555,581,586,615,629,754,787,855,858,882,900,901,948,950,960,983,1077,1290,1324,1363,1745,1923,2514,2709,3168,3693,3747,4064,4758,4833,5703],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,4.175107420354542,2.1765612129984904,2.138507503627933,2.2907365189289424,2.3074766467914385,2.4423870329693536,2.496249838866882,2.558331832813986,2.731603554088023,2.9504565686333644,2.942840385588056,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.4572130107926293,3.432149042129413,3.530930586689197,3.4572130107926293,3.5013187326425523,3.488143311483988,3.7465885637507435,3.760240652919071,3.9201351739255808,3.8767358583910254,3.9612932464190886,3.9201351739255808,3.8962296530720266,4.049068857301474,4.125296222689358,4.058285512406398,4.165705761027235,4.235066888824737,4.3336974922663645,4.364659717870332,4.396611317676934,5.089758498236879,4.8184434032493035,5.501738287366237,5.373120909544144,5.878215858601149,5.672363804397,5.719991853386255,12.064733076856815,6.137727054086234,6.0662680901040895,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.807155861912876E-4,1.805554449742294E-4,1.8060002550835153E-4,1.8056371912634868E-4,1.805808073405666E-4,1.8055444944597618E-4,1.8061060438644768E-4,1.80527585888717E-4,1.8055548313277692E-4,1.807420676595344E-4,1.8217620335957382E-4,1.8055578136374467E-4,1.8072677909865392E-4,1.8074560771100275E-4,1.8066349970080503E-4,1.8056443034070445E-4,1.8062655148803265E-4,1.807115549572442E-4,1.80573752103705E-4,1.8057309190815137E-4,1.8073554485423905E-4,1.8059118348844763E-4,1.805914567975533E-4,1.8070714561834017E-4,1.8057381724120427E-4,1.807477680671384E-4,1.8061900513983704E-4,1.8055504031201273E-4,1.8063689625128377E-4,1.80

{"value":"THHE2 is entertaining in that you'll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say \"oh sh*t!\" and \"get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb**s\" or things along those lines but I don't know if its really worth seeing- I was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who don't seem to know the first thing about combat.<br /><br />Yes there was more violence, gore, and a higher body count than the first one but I am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridiculousness like Dead Alive or Feast).

{"value":"After 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off. The story is taken from great movies like \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Hills have Eyes\". I like those kind of movies, even if they're duplicated well (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /><br />But \"Side Sho\" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced. You do not care at all what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical. So how about the blood and gore ?

{"value":"'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic Britain, rather like 'Bend it Like Beckham', or more closely, 'East is East', with which it shares a 1970s setting. The tone is resolutely chirpy (in spite of the dour Black Country accents), but the film lacks 'East is East's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite. Moreover, the portrayal of the film's central relationship, between an Asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it. I have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer, this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story.

{"value":"Parasomnia has an interesting premises, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach. The cast in unconvincing, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in movies like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play roles like this in his sleep (which is a little what he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all. The story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes, especially at the end.<br /><br />This could have been so much better, I do not get the good reviews on this one.

{"value":"Rented it last night. The opening(2001) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. The hitchiker scene served no purpose. Some skits were just retarded. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts:<br /><br />KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song<br /><br />Total: 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie<br /><br />Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.<br /><br />Let me give you some advice: If you want a crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent \"Kentucky Fried Movie\". If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent \"AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON\" or \"UHF\"<br /><br />Otherwise, don't bother renting this movie.

{"value":"I had to endure teen-aged, high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show. I really do not care about high-school girls fretting about their relationships. I've spent my time in Hell dealing with such issues and I care nothing about fictional teenies going through \"lite\" versions of the horrors I endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. We FINALLY see a proto-Cylon. It was good but with one problem. Its red eye-dot would lock onto an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world.

{"value":"Just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better \"Murder, She Wrote\", it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years. I'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered its star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who only had a decent career in the 1960s, never was much of an actor at all (by his own admission) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993.

{"value":"With this movie only running 61 minutes and nothing all that good on television, I decided to pop Revolt of the Zombies into the DVD to pass the time. Even while realizing the era from which it was coming, I was sorely disappointed. It started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score (what - no brooding music?) and then the rather slow moving opening sequences. Gosh, I figured a movie about zombies - even from the 1930s - would have SOME chills to it (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, certainly did) but this had none. Zero. It was scarcely even dramatic (except for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone). Like the equally dull King of the Zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing

{"value":"As I watch this film, it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes Black men. The film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible Black man in it is (save for an heroic moment). For much of the film, the other Black men (and dark-skinned Black women) in the film are way in the background, barely visible.<br /><br />Vanessa Williams' character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional support characters who are light-skinned, and some White characters of some warmth and dignity. But 99% of the Black males in this film are nothing but invisible men. Voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence. Such a horrible flaw, but anything but unusual in the mainstream

{"value":"Lets put it this way. I actually get this movie. I get what the writer/directer was trying to do. I understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climactic and stale. That was what the writer/director was going for. A very very very dry humor/comedy. With all that understanding, I still think the movie sucked. It seemed like the writer/director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this movie. It had all of the same features. Even the main character behaved similar to Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. Its script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me rephrase that. Its only purpose is to rip off Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that look and feel. Too bad it didn't work.","finished_norm":["let","put","it","thi","wai","i","actual","get","thi","movi","i","get","what","the","writerdirect","be","try","to","do","i","understand","that","the","dialog","be","mean","to","be","spindri","and","emotionless","i","understand","that","the","plot","be","suppos","to","be","nonclimact","and","stale","that","be","what","the","writerdirector","be","go","for","a","veri","veri","veri","spindri","humorcomedi","with","all","that","understand","i","still","think","the","movi","suck","it","seem","like","the","writerdirector","be","try","to","recreat","napolean","dynamit","with","thi","movi","it","have","all","of","the","same","featur","even","the","main","charact","behav","similar","to","napolean","but","napolean","dynamit","be","actual","funni","it","script","work","thi","movi","be","not","it","have","no","purpos","good","let","me","rephras","that","it","onli","purpos","be","to","rip","off","napolean","dynamit","and","try","to","captur","that","look","and","feel","too","bad","it","do","not","work"],"filtered":["let","put","thi","wai","actual","get","thi","movi","get","writerdirect","try","understand","dialog","mean","spindri","emotionless","understand","plot","suppos","nonclimact","stale","writerdirector","go","veri","veri","veri","spindri","humorcomedi","understand","still","think","movi","suck","seem","like","writerdirector","try","recreat","napolean","dynamit","thi","movi","featur","even","main","charact","behav","similar","napolean","napolean","dynamit","actual","funni","script","work","thi","movi","purpos","good","let","rephras","onli","purpos","rip","napolean","dynamit","try","captur","look","feel","bad","work"],"filtered2":["let","put","wai","actual","get","get","writerdirect","try","understand","dialog","mean","spindri","emotionless","understand","plot","suppos","nonclimact","stale","writerdirector","go","veri","veri","veri","spindri","humorcomedi","understand","still","think","suck","seem","like","writerdirector","try","recreat","napolean","dynamit","featur","even","main","charact","behav","similar","napolean","napolean","dynamit","actual","funni","script","work","purpos","good","let","rephras","onli","purpos","rip","napolean","dynamit","try","captur","look","feel","bad","work"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,15,16,32,33,35,36,43,48,52,62,64,77,88,124,149,159,179,212,305,421,432,589,794,825,925,1447,1649,2186,2866,2877,4819,7223],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,15,16,32,33,35,36,43,48,52,62,64,77,88,124,149,159,179,212,305,421,432,589,794,825,925,1447,1649,2186,2866,2877,4819,7223],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,3.6001823395697077,1.1966138720291084,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,4.404055040881715,1.6608112036218214,3.3910232448024944,3.4244306149452273,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,1.9463902258768238,2.0317223413467334,4.464786073617769,2.3253197803590226,2.300267965194495,2.507968722980095,7.795138001829784,2.8612813773965557,3.2597778161886266,3.235085203598255,3.530930586689197,7.493177127501487,3.8767358583910254,3.969732115064953,8.955473724978605,4.715065048795469,10.05368934565262,5.426230734858092,5.390512652256013,19.02756440019674,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247387E-4,2.1540780663324013E-4,2.1546099248468404E-4,2.154176779332168E-4,2.1543806466120766E-4,2.1540661893957908E-4,2.1547361338862664E-4,2.1537456994793336E-4,2.1540785215747797E-4,2.1563045283100665E-4,2.1734141771275812E-4,2.154082079555468E-4,2.1561221314088646E-4,2.1563467621359296E-4,2.1553671901055078E-4,2.1541852643227173E-4,2.154926387366302E-4,2.155940503050362E-4,2.1542964756197342E-4,2.154288599298077E-4,2.156226709378493E-4,2.1545044370220904E-4,2.1545076976778405E-4,2.1558878983769247E-4,2.1542972527287184E-4,2.156372535802118E-4,2.1548363572753714E-4,2.1540732385964928E-4,2.1550498033487102E-4,2.1557075556130409E-4,2.1545150052150529E-4,2.1556689165339296E-4,2.156727296156061E-4,2.1587290735061655E-4,2.1548326336575651E-4,2.1541839577752056E-4,2.1549606627473277E-4,2.1544027352728276E-4,2.153747998203635E-4,2.154295808469173E-4,2.1564547810166184E-4,2.1552718298266602E-4,2.155673828931977E-4,2.1538551900011013E-4,2.154296356252023E-4,2.1541831477197884E-4,2.154912319184017E-4,2.1552859836735806E-4,2.1548477184478592E-4,2.1545061712774092E-4,2.154188474849184E-4,2.1586020571993635E-4,2.154730530722391E-4,2.154295862490033E-4,2.1547189913423322E-4,2.1540754425062445E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476625E-4,2.1541914990540849E-4,2.154074212905049E-4,2.1557975239475956E-4,2.1549321327804554E-4,2.1540733124454683E-4,2.1538543124717923E-4,2.15

{"value":"Why did I waste 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this film even made? Why am I even commenting on this film?<br /><br />One reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n't for everybody. I cannot figure out who this movie is for. maybe after dropping a hit of acid, SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE could watch this and make some sense out of it. It is incoherent, it isn't experimental, it's plain and simple garbage. The film follows no plot line whatsoever, just when you think you have something, well.....you don't. <br /><br />I think the ending brought some finality to the film (no pun intended), the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on.

{"value":"Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable AND WORSE OF ALL a bizarre almost Hollywood-like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends!).<br /><br />YOu will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided. I didn't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner, is he / she trying to be racist?<br /><br />A truly bizare movie. Only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened.<br /><br />But on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent.","finished_norm":["just","too","mani","hole","in","thi","movi","to","be","enjoy","and","wrong","of","all","a","bizarr","almost","hollywoodlik","end","that","be","complet","out","of","context","with","the","rest","of","the","movi","thi","be","not","a","spoiler","a","you","will","never","guess","how","it","endsbr","br","you","will","conjur","ne","to","be","thick","skin","to","all","sort","of","polit","correct","underton","the","conflict","between","white","and","black","be","highli","contriv","and","on","side","i","do","not","understand","why","the","author","have","the","local","black","communin","behav","in","such","a","unaccept","manner","be","he","she","try","to","be","racistbr","br","a","truli","bizar","movi","onli","watch","if","you","like","to","be","realli","annoi","by","hole","in","the","plot","and","like","to","debat","all","the","thing","that","mai","or","mai","not","have","suppos","to","have","happenedbr","br","but","on","the","posit","side","the","film","and","act","be","excel"],"filtered":["mani","hole","thi","movi","enjoy","wrong","bizarr","almost","hollywoodlik","end","complet","context","rest","movi","thi","spoiler","never","guess","endsbr","br","conjur","ne","thick","skin","sort","polit","correct","underton","conflict","white","black","highli","contriv","side","understand","author","local","black","communin","behav","unaccept","manner","try","racistbr","br","truli","bizar","movi","onli","watch","like","realli","annoi","hole","plot","like","debat","thing","mai","mai","suppos","happenedbr","br","posit","side","film","act","excel"],"filtered2":["mani","hole","enjoy","wrong","bizarr","almost","hollywoodlik","end","complet","context","rest","spoiler","never","guess","endsbr","conjur","ne","thick","skin","sort","polit","correct","underton","conflict","white","black","highli","contriv","side","understand","author","local","black","communin","behav","unaccept","manner","try","racistbr","truli","bizar","onli","watch","like","realli","annoi","hole","plot","like","debat","thing","mai","mai","suppos","happenedbr","posit","side","act","excel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,13,21,24,25,29,32,36,39,42,46,50,103,110,131,149,212,226,229,243,269,271,342,359,425,475,490,509,575,580,737,810,823,896,1046,1111,1180,1331,1466,1470,1617,1649,2656,3059,6626,7468,7538],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,13,21,24,25,29,32,36,39,42,46,50,103,110,131,149,212,226,229,243,269,271,342,359,425,475,490,509,575,580,737,810,823,896,1046,1111,1180,1331,1466,1470,1617,1649,2656,3059,6626,7468,7538],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,3.311542587503466,1.717994385570355,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.2512118082053005,2.3253197803590226,2.5983793339432615,2.5940874818617203,5.6865257437877545,2.627841366673578,2.76533567167316,2.757740698455715,2.9705344631698933,3.2189558216683714,6.453975986731272,3.3721070011625462,3.3490645070153917,3.360519385990158,3.6314455447135003,3.5039747767006686,3.68099128126493,7.685153879159413,3.850067611308864,3.8844878351953436,4.067587905068712,4.2574141875167335,4.263079925052412,4.513582994262438,4.484804029712395,4.550761997504193,4.662879295624898,4.715065048795469,5.290429193699031,5.444579873526289,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816467E-4,2.2324275812784223E-4,2.2329787848933373E-4,2.2325298847310012E-4,2.2327411672029327E-4,2.232415272346223E-4,2.233109584489241E-4,2.2320831253640859E-4,2.23242805307917E-4,2.2347350255652818E-4,2.252466997550513E-4,2.2324317404730234E-4,2.234545994406501E-4,2.2347787955470633E-4,2.2337635938917745E-4,2.2325386783430921E-4,2.2333067579914016E-4,2.2343577597443498E-4,2.2326539346890391E-4,2.2326457718847376E-4,2.2346543761534032E-4,2.232869460197477E-4,2.2328728394518986E-4,2.2343032416998455E-4,2.232654740063532E-4,2.2348055066696404E-4,2.233213453268012E-4,2.2324225779449936E-4,2.2334346629394183E-4,2.2341163393927886E-4,2.2328804127835615E-4,2.2340762949082032E-4,2.2351731705956904E-4,2.237247757880988E-4,2.2332095942123806E-4,2.2325373242729926E-4,2.233342280058664E-4,2.2327640592866805E-4,2.2320855076990684E-4,2.232653243272448E-4,2.2348907433600594E-4,2.2336647651074396E-4,2.2340813859831569E-4,2.2321965983456378E-4,2.2326538109796089E-4,2.2325364847537184E-4,2.2332921781121286E-4,2.233679433767197E-4,2.2332252276763837E-4,2.2328712575322477E-4,2.2325420056448954E-4,2.2371161216552593E-4,2.23310377752348E-4,2.2326532992581898E-4,2.2330918184256568E-4,2.2324248620167705E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760433E-4,2.232

{"value":"This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical as is most of the script. I loved the book its based off of, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and...I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it, and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even as good. They took so many lines from the first movie, Its hard to tell which movie you're watching.","finished_norm":["thi","socal","prequel","be","just","a","badli","make","remak","to","to","a","well","version","of","danger","liason","the","plot","be","ident","a","be","much","of","the","script","i","love","the","book","it","base","off","of","and","i","love","the","movi","but","i","be","not","even","go","to","bother","with","the","rd","movi","the","pointless","banter","between","the","two","main","charact","in","the","prequel","be","complet","predict","and","unorigin","andi","just","ca","not","stress","how","bad","the","movi","be","if","you","do","not","want","to","take","my","word","for","it","just","watch","it","and","you","will","see","what","i","mean","if","you","have","read","a","review","that","sai","that","if","you","like","the","on","you","will","like","the","on","the","onli","reason","that","be","be","becaus","it","be","the","exact","same","movi","although","the","plot","be","not","even","a","good","thei","take","so","mani","line","from","the","movi","it","hard","to","tell","which","movi","you","re","watch"],"filtered":["thi","socal","prequel","badli","make","remak","well","version","danger","liason","plot","ident","much","script","love","book","base","love","movi","even","go","bother","rd","movi","pointless","banter","two","main","charact","prequel","complet","predict","unorigin","andi","ca","stress","bad","movi","want","take","word","watch","see","mean","read","review","sai","like","like","onli","reason","becaus","exact","movi","although","plot","even","good","thei","take","mani","line","movi","hard","tell","movi","re","watch"],"filtered2":["socal","prequel","badli","make","remak","well","version","danger","liason","plot","ident","script","love","book","base","love","even","go","bother","rd","pointless","banter","two","main","charact","prequel","complet","predict","unorigin","andi","ca","stress","bad","want","take","word","watch","see","mean","read","review","like","like","onli","reason","becaus","exact","although","plot","even","good","take","mani","line","hard","tell","re","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,20,22,31,32,37,47,50,54,68,77,81,88,90,95,103,107,145,151,171,176,179,220,237,258,334,337,448,483,496,531,978,1608,1647,1721,1785,2382,2522,2565,2823,4494],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,20,22,31,32,37,47,50,54,68,77,81,88,90,95,103,107,145,151,171,176,179,220,237,258,334,337,448,483,496,531,978,1608,1647,1721,1785,2382,2522,2565,2823,4494],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,2.814133962290301,2.742262257014735,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,3.6227786505458823,2.0064197866819473,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.373087554090762,2.5040471493269134,2.507968722980095,2.8336934208777267,2.640097787510554,2.7061321952397077,2.942840385588056,2.973659465713028,3.2681460658591432,3.613480989738201,3.293679367864308,3.4272107604888307,4.058285512406398,4.605250182788262,4.933754249760298,4.760735085628657,4.770124825978496,5.102830579804232,11.003476574732474,5.290429193699031,5.339219357868463,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612973E-4,2.1169300653874426E-4,2.1174527517734865E-4,2.1170270760391535E-4,2.117227427540305E-4,2.1169183932737024E-4,2.1175767842838495E-4,2.1166034303434327E-4,2.116930512778971E-4,2.1191181310725396E-4,2.135932716651458E-4,2.1169340094007546E-4,2.118938879684197E-4,2.1191596365579456E-4,2.118196957667694E-4,2.1170354147023984E-4,2.117763756760951E-4,2.118760383584705E-4,2.117144708112858E-4,2.1171369676217488E-4,2.1190416541618467E-4,2.1173490831315577E-4,2.1173522875558997E-4,2.118708686101443E-4,2.1171454718202641E-4,2.1191849657461965E-4,2.117675279277586E-4,2.1169253209079122E-4,2.1178850443817631E-4,2.118531453425939E-4,2.1173594690714962E-4,2.118493480694334E-4,2.1195336081055463E-4,2.1215008639459358E-4,2.1176716198751674E-4,2.117034130686859E-4,2.1177974410483175E-4,2.1172491352726191E-4,2.116605689425247E-4,2.1171440524675943E-4,2.119265792606667E-4,2.1181032419177905E-4,2.1184983083759684E-4,2.116711032654151E-4,2.117144590803694E-4,2.1170333346011956E-4,2.1177499311905086E-4,2.118117151675545E-4,2.1176864445217772E-4,2.1173507874788994E-4,2.1170385698619575E-4,2.1213760380898696E-4,2.1175712777489404E-4,2.1171441055568418E-4,2.1175599373704444E-4,2.116927486810294E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502645E-4,2.117041541913147E-4,2.1169262784140992E-4,2.1186198702179436E-4,2.1

{"value":"There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie's trailer. I am trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local movies, but I can't help but support the backlash against this movie. It is slow, boring and bordering on pointless. Even the \"almost nice and believable moments\" were immediately undercut by painful clichés and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were only passable in this movie. It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV Soap, then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with an RA rating (Rated Awful) but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies.

{"value":"This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives.<br /><br />I thought \"The Walker\" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong. The pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. That's how slow it is.<br /><br />The fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. Maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? <br /><br />It's sad that \"The Walker\" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast.

{"value":"Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about. This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book.<br /><br />The whole 'red room' is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in. In the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head.

{"value":"Don't waste your time on this dreck. As portrayed, the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture. \"Gothic\" was entertainment at least, this is crap. If you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other, this may be right up your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering. Mary Shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever, but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter, but didn't catch the title. I was hoping this was it, but no such luck.

{"value":"Well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to gushing reviews on CBC Radio. A refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie movie apparently. I'd been looking forward to it for months.<br /><br />How can I put it this simply? It sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius.<br /><br />At best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing. An amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle mess.<br /><br />And what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track? That was about the only truly odd thing about it.<br /><br />If you want to see a genuinely funny, bizarre movie involving aliens then try Repoman.

{"value":"Mercifully, there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it \"...underrated...\" The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so. You'll have to catch it on the last show, if you up late and having a bout of insomnia.

{"value":"I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie. Its a big joke. Good.. Its entertaining .. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film .. I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to.<br /><br />Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman/Rani who want a child but can't. I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life.<br /><br />Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & Salman. She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance.

{"value":"It does touch a few interesting points.. But! - It fails to show evidence of all the 'exclusive' studies shown. Who are the 'friends' and 'small groups of scientists' that gathered this data? - What's up with all the Al Gore biography going on there? Like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car.. too bad but.. what does that have to do with the ozone layer?<br /><br />I've seen MUCH better stuff, in much less time, on Discovery Channel.. I really don't understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you've been living under a rock, this 'documentary' shouldn't be any news to you... all this is old news... And all Al Gore is trying to do is get some popularity points.

{"value":"Here we go with other slasher movie, Good looking people and Acting from everyone was really good!<br /><br />Few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 Years after they are still friends, They go to huge house, have fun, Drugs and Sex (no nudity) for least half a hour of the movie! Again they start making pranks phone call all over again! and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with axe just like Urban Legend movie,<br /><br />Deaths scene really weird, really odd times too.<br /><br />Nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless<br /><br />The twist

{"value":"The concept for Sarafina appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. It attempts to combine upbeat African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. Had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs. <br /><br />Aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast.

{"value":"In 1692 Salem, a devious child's lies about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar. Costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray isn't stuffy, though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria. Worked on by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King), the story elements are rather interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937), though to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\", the hoked-up melodrama on display here won't be tolerated for very long. Biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are an ill-matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch-hunt, MacMurray being far too contemporary a presence for these

{"value":"A chemical spill is turning people into zombies. It's up to two doctor's to survive the epidemic. It's an Andreas Schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be. Bad acting, horribly awful special effects, and no budget to speak of. The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement, much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by IMDb. My original review of merely one word: Crap wouldn't fly so I have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is. But I don't know if I can, so.. wait I think I may have enough words, or lines rather to make this review pass. Which is cool, I guess.

{"value":"'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It is a very dark film, and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across.

{"value":"I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out.<br /><br />Not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept, it's just told so oddly, (bad screenplay?) especially when we \"meet the family\" for the first time. I know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I didn't actually time it).
