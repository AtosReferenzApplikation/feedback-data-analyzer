{"value":"I remembered the title so well. To me, it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And it had Vincent Massey's voice from behind whiskers. Well Flora Robson was great. Her next signature, for me, would be \"55 Days at Peking\". The same role but with different sumptuous gowns. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black-and-white films. Was everything done in Elizbethan times at night? It was talky and difficult to fathom, at times. I couldn't tell which was the love interest. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This might have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts. And I missed daylight!","finished_norm":["i","rememb","the","titl","so","good","to","me","it","be","a","flora","robson","movi","with","olivi","and","vivien","leigh","in","support","role","and","it","have","vincent","massei","voic","from","behind","whisker","good","flora","robson","be","great","her","next","signatur","for","me","would","be","dai","at","peke","the","same","role","but","with","differ","sumptuou","gown","and","the","same","voic","a","for","the","armada","it","be","a","subtext","i","like","blackandwhit","film","be","everyth","do","in","elizbethan","time","at","night","it","be","talki","and","difficult","to","fathom","at","time","i","can","not","tell","which","be","the","love","interest","be","it","the","spaniard","or","be","it","vivien","leigh","and","i","do","not","believ","that","elizabeth","i","would","have","be","the","brilliant","strategist","to","recommend","that","fire","ship","be","send","against","the","armada","appar","it","work","for","the","empir","but","not","for","the","script","thi","mai","have","be","much","accur","histor","but","bett","davi","have","much","engag","script","and","i","miss","daylight"],"filtered":["rememb","titl","good","flora","robson","movi","olivi","vivien","leigh","support","role","vincent","massei","voic","behind","whisker","good","flora","robson","great","next","signatur","dai","peke","role","differ","sumptuou","gown","voic","armada","subtext","like","blackandwhit","film","everyth","elizbethan","time","night","talki","difficult","fathom","time","tell","love","interest","spaniard","vivien","leigh","believ","elizabeth","brilliant","strategist","recommend","fire","ship","send","armada","appar","work","empir","script","thi","mai","much","accur","histor","bett","davi","much","engag","script","miss","daylight"],"filtered2":["rememb","titl","good","flora","robson","olivi","vivien","leigh","support","role","vincent","massei","voic","behind","whisker","good","flora","robson","great","next","signatur","dai","peke","role","differ","sumptuou","gown","voic","armada","subtext","like","blackandwhit","everyth","elizbethan","time","night","talki","difficult","fathom","time","tell","love","interest","spaniard","vivien","leigh","believ","elizabeth","brilliant","strategist","recommend","fire","ship","send","armada","appar","work","empir","script","mai","accur","histor","bett","davi","engag","script","miss","daylight"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,46,48,51,54,60,77,90,91,128,132,193,204,210,255,264,290,297,298,308,393,428,458,551,721,803,912,943,953,986,1602,1771,2695,2759,3363,3907,3928,3966,4070,4330,5226,6303,6431,6575,6872],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,46,48,51,54,60,77,90,91,128,132,193,204,210,255,264,290,297,298,308,393,428,458,551,721,803,912,943,953,986,1602,1771,2695,2759,3363,3907,3928,3966,4070,4330,5226,6303,6431,6575,6872],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,1.8837873718108231,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,3.8927804517536475,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,4.681980408231769,2.253494045787767,2.517840471459249,2.624524614047584,2.687151791517189,2.6754694156628323,2.757740698455715,2.8612813773965557,2.813490713560207,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,3.120015873813468,6.7442140023250925,3.2850956241729166,3.528202072035993,3.6841709341823097,3.7636829971100436,3.9405024767500145,3.9911462095687695,4.1302590120314875,4.383707912841026,4.613282354485526,5.102830579804232,5.583416318380505,5.444579873526289,11.935656034581672,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,6.214688095222362,6.1754673820690815,6.543192162194399,6.489124940924123,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.539308554174711E-5,0.04067844466492118,6.545706551261438E-5,6.507885389074502E-5,6.507992013449542E-5,6.49889514116004E-5,6.518223765889327E-5,6.496147735982748E-5,6.51075344421996E-5,0.39054129465160775,0.18455271386735883,6.485661521294499E-5,6.606713177368889E-5,6.700959392576973E-5,6.490390798018056E-5,6.472454158192286E-5,6.633901430792556E-5,6.518834474254575E-5,6.498609815692676E-5,6.503996007796735E-5,6.566925983842524E-5,6.525292989643696E-5,6.532723025641297E-5,0.13751363680823867,6.589950610207762E-5,6.555487023729453E-5,6.831067244612133E-5,6.487589648997984E-5,6.487763207214236E-5,6.50419991861131E-5,6.642445165231712E-5,6.518456763462834E-5,0.13662989308530926,6.536792220432012E-5,6.49465109857635E-5,6.524628194714364E-5,6.488143295875433E-5,6.49197731120018E-5,6.472421640059276E-5,6.474100884843065E-5,6.488673299117927E-5,6.55711505332196E-5,6.523795596228863E-5,6.49800233209685E-5,6.576959874003378E-5,6.500496300900078E-5,6.716475512773643E-5,0.03302972426297754,6.475710052838739E-5,6.49002176807236

{"value":"I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really. Unhappily, I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it. Especially, when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time, so that was why I watched it. Don't get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres. Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'Bogey' and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another.

{"value":"Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results. The title is false as is everything about this film. The period is not persuasively rendered, and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. This 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow, unappealing, and not the least bit interesting. By all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better.

{"value":"Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The film delivers the spell-casting special effects that one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely silly caricatures. You have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including shabby larger-than-life special effects and a (well, yet another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have grinned if I was expecting camp.<br /><br />It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula.

{"value":"This version is likely available at your local dollar store on DVD. The print is not great, nor is the sound, but if you have $1.00 and 90 or so minutes to spare, you'll get your money's worth (which is not saying an awful lot). Anna Neagle is extremely vapid as Nanette. Whatever her charms may have been back in the day, they are not evident in this film. A great number of fine character actors appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material falls remarkably short of their talents. Still, it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing. The musical numbers (there are really only two) are quite horrible. Clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original \"No, No, Nanette\". For what it's worth, the DVD can be had for $1.00.

{"value":"One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is taking a well-known, classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the enduring Phantom of the Opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall. However, the \"Phantom's\" goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. The special effects do provide a good chuckle, especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect, mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame had not yet arrived. If you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, check this flick out.

{"value":"I was very displeased with this move. Everything was terrible from the start. The comedy was unhumorous, the action overdone, the songs unmelodious. Even the storyline was weightless. From a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all. Of course, Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done. They tend to exaggerate way too much. In Chinese films, this style works because that is their signature piece. But, Hindi cinema's signature are the songs. A good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic. But, in the future, I'm sure these action movies will get much sharper. Also to be noted: Comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly.

{"value":"I saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon and I can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash. It's not funny at all and it takes your I.Q. down a few notches. I know this movie is for kids, but that doesn't mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted. I bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a) The word \"poop\" equals big laugh. b) A four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net. c) Kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so-called \"ninjas\" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban \"gang\" in the world that couldn't scare anybody. Maybe the guys at MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh.

{"value":"All the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). They have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. I feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. This was one of the worst movies i saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And the end? It's an open ending... why? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. This movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you'll be scared. <br /><br />When the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told (a bit to loud) him that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange at me.

{"value":"the costumes, the dialog, historical accuracy are terrible. For instance, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The noose was accurate ( as for as I could tell), but that type of noose broke the person's neck. Ms. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope was shot. This type of not did not strangle the person, it killed them at the end of the drop.<br /><br />And right before they go in to rob a bank (in a flashback), they pause on the street for a group hug - with their bandannas hiding their faces - that would have been obvious to people on the street.<br /><br />The poor editing - that is a battery pack under that shirt and it is obvious, the clip of the \"long ride\" shows them riding along, then reverses the film.<br /><br />I did like the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking a crap - it seemed symbolic.

{"value":"I had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments..<br /><br />I was hoping it might improve,<br /><br />What I saw was badly acted, directed & written.<br /><br />This movie should never even have been released directly to DVD,.<br /><br />The lead character who is a bride top be from HELL has an huge Ice sculpture fall on her killing her. She was such a revolting person I was not even sorry for her. She winds up there in a sort of heaven, & was still repulsive, I left shortly after.<br /><br />Eve Longoria portrays her & I hope I never see her again, she cant even act.She is just plain annoying.<br /><br />Paul Rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud.<br /><br />Jason Biggs ( no longer a teen) is also present,<br /><br />I do like comedies BUT not stupid ones

{"value":"First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... It didn't. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. This film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place

{"value":"Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horror tale finds a newly married husband(John Hudson)and wife(Peggy Weber)haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond. Is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane? Or is it the learning challenged gardener Mickey(Alex Nicol)who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house? This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale. Special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards. I swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is character actor Russ Conway. By the way...the lurking gardener(Nicol)is the film's director.

{"value":"Having watched both the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly. I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment ! Disney must be getting desperate for revenues.<br /><br />Especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.<br /><br />Basically, they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make a<br /><br />quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both of which had strong story lines.<br /><br />This movie hardly has a story at all. While the characters and animation are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.<br /><br />Disney - Shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!<br /><br />Next time take the time

{"value":"1937's \"Stella Dallas\" with Barbara Stanwyck hasn't exactly aged well--how anyone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler. Perhaps they thought jaunty, cheerfully brash Bette Midler could make something out of it, but this hoary script defeats her. Plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock, and years later giving the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life, can't escape tatty, old-fashioned trappings and sentiment. Midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses, but that fails to happen here; Stephen Collins is stolid as the man who changes her life, but Trini Alvarado is well-cast as Midler's daughter. This is what used to be referred to as a \"woman's picture\", a wallow, but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930's origins. *1/2 from

{"value":"In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a \"thinking man's horror film.\" Wow, you might say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (dubbed) accent, and a story with no chills, thrills or spills.<br /><br />It isn't even interesting psycho-babble. One will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of Leprechaun 5.<br /><br />The story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams. WHat you get isn't good horror, art house or even a decent after-school special. I found myself after the two hour point saying..where did my two hours go.<br /><br />The direction is uninspired and I wished it could even be pretentious...something interesting..it seems like the

{"value":"this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible. as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film, how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago, but then again i saw this video. in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe, yet this movie lacks them all. you heard me it lacks them all. there is not a single point i like about this movie, none. i hate it. i'm sure anyone will do so too. the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff, yet it fails even at the nudity. i don't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so, and i definitely recommend you don't do so. worst

{"value":"It SURPRISINGLY had a plot! ;) I've seen movies with less plot (I don't wanna mention Asian movies but...). I thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and also the atmosphere wasn't too bad. There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens. Although I do think that about a lot of movies, in this case it was horrible, of course.<br /><br />It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes. The acting was bad but I've seen worse. The movie was bad but I've seen worse. Watching this film is an experience between boredom, laughing fits, death wish, sadism, horniness and entertainment on a low level.<br /><br />So if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you.<br /><br />I gave it 3/10, because it CAN be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right

{"value":"This isn't a movie. It is a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor - the one with the greasy hair, dead-pan stare, ipod and nervous tic - probably shot it herself in a creative phase.<br /><br />If you made it further than the ten minutes I did, don't bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the European Artiste mentality praised above. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and film that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine cringe.<br /><br />The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity.<br /><br />What's next?

Naturally, uber-stupid frat boys who still mainline JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube, SEX OLYMPICS(I really don't need to give you details, do I), and a clown who basically does the \"not very endearing clown\" bit I think I've seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles: well, more power to you.<br /><br />I just want to express that, despite what you've heard, this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what not. The skit movie had already been done in AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and so on. And done way better.","finished_norm":["after","two","long","long","open","skit","on","of","which","my","brother","see","the","conclus","come","of","and","the","other","total","joke","free","we","start","the","fastforward","fest","that","it","groov","tube","proper","natur","uberstupid","frat","boi","who","still","mainlin","jackass","or","tom","green","will","find","the","idea","of","fecal","matt","come","out","of","the","some","tube","sex","olympicsi","realli","do","not","ne","to","give","you","detail","do","i","and","a","clown","who","basic","doe","the","not","veri","endear","clown","bite","i","think","i","have","see","approxi","nineti","time","now","will","eat","thi","up","like","dung","beetl","good","much","power","to","youbr","br","i","just","want","to","express","that","despit","what","you","have","hear","thi","movi","be","in","no","wai","a","model","for","the","mani","infinit","funni","movi","like","kentucki","fry","movi","or","what","not","the","skit","movi","have","alreadi","be","do","in","and","now","for","someth","complet","differ","everyth","you","alwai","want","to","know","about","sex","and","so","on","and","do","wai","well"],"filtered":["two","long","long","open","skit","brother","see","conclus","come","total","joke","free","start","fastforward","fest","groov","tube","proper","natur","uberstupid","frat","boi","still","mainlin","jackass","tom","green","find","idea","fecal","matt","come","tube","sex","olympicsi","realli","ne","give","detail","clown","basic","doe","veri","endear","clown","bite","think","see","approxi","nineti","time","eat","thi","like","dung","beetl","good","much","power","youbr","br","want","express","despit","hear","thi","movi","wai","model","mani","infinit","funni","movi","like","kentucki","fry","movi","skit","movi","alreadi","someth","complet","differ","everyth","alwai","want","know","sex","wai","well"],"filtered2":["two","long","long","open","skit","brother","see","conclus","come","total","joke","free","start","fastforward","fest","groov","tube","proper","natur","uberstupid","frat","boi","still","mainlin","jackass","tom","green","find","idea","fecal","matt","come","tube","sex","olympicsi","realli","ne","give","detail","clown","basic","doe","veri","endear","clown","bite","think","see","approxi","nineti","time","eat","like","dung","beetl","good","power","youbr","want","express","despit","hear","wai","model","mani","infinit","funni","like","kentucki","fry","skit","alreadi","someth","complet","differ","everyth","alwai","want","know","sex","wai","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,12,13,15,18,20,26,30,33,34,37,38,47,50,53,62,64,71,99,103,110,123,154,184,193,197,204,214,216,242,254,282,286,330,366,381,391,408,456,599,686,741,759,846,957,1102,1172,1620,2257,2301,2585,2832,3106,3258,3331,3458,3606,4022,4836,5464,5626,6761,8193,8256],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,12,13,15,18,20,26,30,33,34,37,38,47,50,53,62,64,71,99,103,110,123,154,184,193,197,204,214,216,242,254,282,286,330,366,381,391,408,456,599,686,741,759,846,957,1102,1172,1620,2257,2301,2585,2832,3106,3258,3331,3458,3606,4022,4836,5464,5626,6761,8193,8256],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,2.803707089537043,2.7965700178917925,2.975308642954861,1.519311641348122,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,1.9214926742550966,4.112860414513218,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.2619070973220485,2.348499626138016,2.496249838866882,2.517840471459249,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.7303758068497004,2.6070186965339692,2.689504733779216,5.779304149051542,2.918851229218033,2.780700890737216,2.9292757465539174,3.185521045582134,3.24941502915308,3.109204957709252,3.130944944345658,3.3001658770939146,3.6254214301101193,3.6016814428070463,3.7165362186843414,3.969732115064953,3.9201351739255808,3.969732115064953,4.390138803171316,4.327618446189983,4.605250182788262,10.889159747052577,10.645380111834504,5.1994574154933035,5.3560264761848435,5.426230734858092,5.501738287366237,5.583416318380505,11.298748572344604,5.7446844659766265,6.255510089742618,6.0662680901040895,6.437831646536572,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.0725571293804764E-5,5.038351690790014E-5,5.077520070869958E-5,5.0481821058078385E-5,5.048264814588024E-5,5.041208349213299E-5,5.056201609182516E-5,5.039077180511912E-5,5.050406862975209E-5,5.6031507236231E-5,0.576861950187414,5.0309429989487656E-5,5.124843055194231E-5,5.197950067489237E-5,5.0346115101

{"value":"What reviewers and MST3K left out is the best part (and only memorable scene) of this otherwise dreadful movie: There is a very good rape-in-the-shower scene committed by the bad guy (Ben Gazzara look-alike) on Maria (as mentioned, killed later through T.J.'s ineptitude). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, \"prison mating ritual\" may be more appropriate. The background behind this chance, yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding \"Ben Gazzara,\" introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool. The 30-ish blonde disses him, but our villain must be quite smitten by her, because the courtship is on at that point. His first move is to attempt drowning her, until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off. Kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like, but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway... Let's just say, he catches UP with her in the cabana

{"value":"Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has little going for it.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and \"characters\".<br /><br />The \"Incubus\" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage.<br /><br />The script's reluctance to explore

{"value":"After a fairly lengthy partially pixelated nude shower scene, we're off to the races for this \"Blair Witch Project\"-esquire horror film about three girlfriends venturing to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic lives for a girls' weekend out and smoke pot. They meet two guys who seem friendly enough, so they drink and tell ghost stories, until late in the movie some of them get picked off.<br /><br />This is a fairly slow movie, with needlessly drawn out 'suspense' scenes, the bad acting can't carry the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter, and the movie as a whole is a dud, a deathly-boring dud at that. Nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did I was to numb to really care.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Ashley Totin shows T&A; Evy Lutzky gets topless briefly; and Jennifer Hart shows her

{"value":"\"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah\" is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudo-patriotism. Here, travellers from the future try to ruin Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with their puppy monster, the three-headed golden dragon King Ghidorah. They fail, however and in the end Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between the two behemoths are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about \"Japan is great\" is really stupid. The creators of this movie didn't even threat with respect the enemies of Japan, making them stupid big blond guys, who are easily outsmarted by the clever Japanese. The good thing is that in the end Godzilla and king Ghidorah nearly destroyed the both Japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular combats.

{"value":"The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie.<br /><br />The plot was ridiculous, thinly tied together, and altogether-just lame. Nicolas Cage...shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it, that it would be at least decent. It was not.<br /><br />I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor, and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly.<br /><br />At the end you're left mouth agape, mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad.<br /><br />I heard it compared to : Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli.

{"value":"My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines.<br /><br />I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà, a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as \"Blow\" and \"The Alamo.\" Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art.<br /><br />An

{"value":"Heavily re-edited and often confusing, the original screen version of Man On Fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven't made it any better. This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer, with Scott Glenn's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year-old charge, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - have all done better, the action is sluggish and sparse and only John Scott's exceptionally fine score (part of which turned up in the last reel of Die Hard) makes a positive impression.

{"value":"I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like The Contractor.He is just the next action star to join a growing club:the penniless action stars of the 90s (Van Damme,Segal,Lundgren,Snipes). Here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in Bulgaria( we are supposed to believe that the location is London, like only a complete moron would buy that)The story is the one of 1000 other movies: retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job- after that government wants to get rid of him- good guy gets away after killing bad guys (was that a spoiler? guess not!) The star of the movie: the little girl (Eliza Bennett) outperforms everybody else of the cast!!!One star is for her plus one star for eye candy Lena Headey, makes 2 stars.

{"value":"At first glance, this movie has got everything a psycho wants: a vampire story with a \"not under 18\" restriction, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop! But then, this movie is a succession of bad story (so thin), bad acting -with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you're watching a bad Monty Python -, bad music ('80s hard rock), the videotaping is awful, the ending is a real shame... Plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous, the gore not very impressive. And those vampires reflect in a mirror, and don't even fear daylight! You get to be very disappointed, unless you see it as a \"Space Mutiny\" or \"Troll 2\".

{"value":"I couldn't believe how lame & pointless this was. Basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie, hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie. This movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must've taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple & humble. Luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons. I won't write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie I was wondering why this movie has only got a 4.0/10, & now I know why. A very disappointing movie.

{"value":"This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of Conan Doyle's famous novel 'The Lost World'. And it shows.<br /><br />The film starts promisingly enough, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. Everybody is stranded on the plateau and we're left with a feeble, boring, over-length rehash of the first film.<br /><br />The dinosaurs (who are hardly ever seen) are just laughable. Are we expected to take that cuddly toy that's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent
