{"value":"This was a terrible film. There was no story line whatsoever. To top it all off, when they couldn't explain the blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw in a few aliens! I hate when directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this film if you like. But don't say I didn't warn you. Two things: How could Vinny say \"welcome\" when he didn't have a tongue? Its a pity Mr Jones didn't have a bigger role. Second thing that bugged me, why were we shown Vinny Jones' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid, then these have no further role. Why not? I don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever. In short. Bad story. I wouldn't waste my time - wish I'd have watched Mirrors instead.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","terribl","film","there","be","no","stori","line","whatsoev","to","top","it","all","off","when","thei","can","not","explain","the","blood","and","gore","the","onli","good","part","thei","throw","in","a","few","alien","i","hate","when","director","or","whatev","run","out","of","idea","and","then","blame","the","alien","watch","thi","film","if","you","like","but","do","not","sai","i","do","not","warn","you","two","thing","how","can","vinni","sai","welcom","when","he","do","not","have","a","tongu","it","a","piti","mr","jone","do","not","have","a","big","role","thing","that","bug","me","why","be","we","show","vinni","jone","boil","and","him","cut","them","off","and","putt","them","into","blue","liquid","then","thi","have","no","far","role","why","not","i","do","not","like","to","be","show","someth","and","that","have","noth","to","do","with","the","stori","line","whatsoev","in","short","bad","stori","i","would","not","wast","my","time","wish","i","have","have","watch","mirror","instead"],"filtered":["thi","terribl","film","stori","line","whatsoev","top","thei","explain","blood","gore","onli","good","part","thei","throw","alien","hate","director","whatev","run","idea","blame","alien","watch","thi","film","like","sai","warn","two","thing","vinni","sai","welcom","tongu","piti","mr","jone","big","role","thing","bug","show","vinni","jone","boil","cut","putt","blue","liquid","thi","far","role","like","show","someth","noth","stori","line","whatsoev","short","bad","stori","wast","time","wish","watch","mirror","instead"],"filtered2":["terribl","stori","line","whatsoev","top","explain","blood","gore","onli","good","part","throw","alien","hate","director","whatev","run","idea","blame","alien","watch","like","warn","two","thing","vinni","welcom","tongu","piti","mr","jone","big","role","thing","bug","show","vinni","jone","boil","cut","putt","blue","liquid","far","role","like","show","someth","noth","stori","line","whatsoev","short","bad","stori","wast","time","wish","watch","mirror","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,8,9,11,17,28,29,47,49,53,58,61,82,89,101,107,123,128,137,152,166,272,303,310,339,355,357,358,364,395,399,527,556,565,898,992,1041,1195,1213,1266,1853,2012,2039,3459,3588,4100,7777],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,8,9,11,17,28,29,47,49,53,58,61,82,89,101,107,123,128,137,152,166,272,303,310,339,355,357,358,364,395,399,527,556,565,898,992,1041,1195,1213,1266,1853,2012,2039,3459,3588,4100,7777],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,3.83116108203179,3.0904588387038183,2.6390769554676132,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,4.287906797278791,2.2619070973220485,4.681980408231769,2.2939035841256437,2.3131195476980753,2.4423870329693536,2.8028805344481915,2.868298950055202,2.854312708080462,3.003844442051426,3.185521045582134,3.2829611516442836,3.2030824725120812,2.9878441007049847,3.153168081130368,3.129115117668582,3.439602492783994,3.4471119148061256,7.816221961917559,3.892300374932137,8.008436582272244,4.240607069200353,8.845857251988615,4.251780369798478,4.327618446189983,5.051537285416681,4.8796870284900224,5.089758498236879,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,12.511020179485236,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.05922038290943E-5,7.011618409556467E-5,7.066127056768027E-5,7.025298899356049E-5,7.025414000968911E-5,7.015593876141528E-5,7.036459235304843E-5,7.012628036792156E-5,7.028394981024989E-5,0.13057581365006454,0.5870823861972054,7.001308109027072E-5,0.09441446828256984,7.233723372623096E-5,7.00641338986323E-5,6.987050686236385E-5,7.161333925521276E-5,7.037118498421769E-5,7.015285865693896E-5,7.021100290379967E-5,7.089033553647509E-5,7.044090502128355E-5,7.052111267798837E-5,7.059709126731342E-5,7.113888767375358E-5,7.076685131834943E-5,7.3741755310515E-5,7.003389533733147E-5,7.003576890804255E-5,7.021320413251769E-5,7.170556934926537E-5,7.036710757496592E-5,7.553312906293936E-5,7.05650398647401E-5,7.011012408289917E-5,7.043372852261139E-5,7.00398719865289E-5,7.008126039771127E-5,6.98701558272881E-5,6.988828336922533E-5,7.004559340135653E-5,7.07844259894147E-5,0.11219558086522004,7.014630083733706E-5,7.0998651945399E-5,7.017322337091112E-5,7.25047311168933E-5,7.14385279119026E-5,6.99056544282914E-5,7.00601501996021E-5,7.003585069998476E-5,7.200692280640056E-5,7.006119256107333E-5,6.988207888668608E-5,0.07043540181529064,7.007923846440174E-5,7.536251906094042E-5,7.002148406598838E-5,6.990484600950154E-5,7.0238621132125E-5,7.093532922243639E-5,7.023397444781321E-5,6.98919134567088E-5,7.005464607273546E-

{"value":"Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! At least if I can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile.<br /><br />I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear. The movie was slow, had PAINFULLY little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LA-style token black man.<br /><br />If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, though, that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an \"LA lifestyle\", it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from

{"value":"This movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to watch \"Darkness falls\" actually and thought that this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I fast-forwarded as much as I could and still I couldn't get rid of the boring moments. I just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie. They were actually given money for this crap. Isn't that amazing? I mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood-grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such crap movies? Oh, and the \"tooth-fairy\" was lame.

{"value":"The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory.<br /><br />Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of \"posh totty\" to have been committed to celluloid. Of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.<br /><br />As a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made.

{"value":"Why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? My god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. I can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. Also, there is apparently some controversy as to whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was uncredited but his list of roles here (IMDB) does give him credit. BTW... Rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. This film is proof that no matter how many big \"names\" you have. Sow's ears don't make silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad... Maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film.

{"value":"Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O' Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Dumped by his girlfriend, a hotshot yuppie doesn't want to be left alone on Christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home, imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family. An obnoxious and one-dimensional performance by Affleck, who mainly acts with a flashy smile, makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O' Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for farce, its silliness is lumbering, not much makes sense from scene to scene, and its sentimental messages are as phony as Affleck's grin. 91 min., rated PG-13. *

{"value":"This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw, Fishburne, and the usually solid Ed Harris. Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic. The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along. It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels. The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast. George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty. The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery/thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree. The scripting and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue.

{"value":"Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen, Samurai, the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from. Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings.The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy !

{"value":"I have been a huge Lynn Peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie \"Far North\", and even though I loved her in her one other film \"Slow\" (2004) where she plays \"Francis\", this is by far and away her strongest role.<br /><br />Lynn, as I'm sure you all know (or should), plays the critical role of \"Driver\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, other than Lynn's amazing performance, I'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it.<br /><br />Oh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for TV viewers. Memorable lines like: \"You son-of-a-gun!\", \"You son-of-a-witch!\", \"Shoot!\", and \"Well, Forget You!\"<br /><br />O.K.

{"value":"As far as films go, this is likable enough. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I would have really quite liked it had I not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter disrespect it shows the city it is set in.<br /><br />Glasgow. In Scotland. Yet every character is English (save for Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in menial jobs & roles. As a Scottish woman (& as a viewer who likes her \"real life\" films to be a bit more like real life) I really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented Scottish actors...or at least got English ones who could toss together a decent accent!

{"value":"I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (e.g. Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite Robin Williams movies. But Seize the Day, although well-acted, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise, and Alladin on Ice).<br /><br />Every good story is going to have its ups and downs. This movie, however, is one giant down. I don't need a feel-good Hollywood cheese-fest, but I've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness. This movie reminds me of \"Love Liza\" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall. The answer?

{"value":"Up until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of \"comedy\" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless \"football\" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line \"How can I turn it off? It's not a tap\" - watch to find out what it refers to). \"Dragon Lord\" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies.

{"value":"Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, but it was a severe disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but doesn't get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stranded.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the ego of Lee Tracy's character, who is at best a self-centered, physically and verbally abusive jerk. The reactions of \"the public\" are poorly thought-out and unbelievable, making the \"shenanigans\" seem like contrivances of a bad writer. And it strains credulity that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him.<br /><br />The \"stinging one-liners\" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer, since I didn't even

{"value":"Poorly-made \"blaxploitation\" crime-drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s. Pam Grier stars in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after drug-dealing thugs make Coffy's little sister a junkie. Violent nonsense plods along doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only Grier's flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt (she's not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primal way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time, the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner-city audience. Today however, it's merely a footnote in '70s film history, and lacks the wide-range appeal of other movies in this genre. *1/2 from

{"value":"I don't know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness except for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason. What little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about.

{"value":"Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality. It has Camp Councellor Angela(Pamela Anderson..awful as the killer;her quips when she wastes people aren't even amusing)on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior. We run the gamut of boring, clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove, a kid who gets a chainsaw, one girl who gets drilled, one who gets shoved into the crapper(filled with leeches), one who is roasted, etc.<br /><br />It doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time. That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's(who plays the slut Ally)tits.

{"value":"Why? Because for one reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than Ann Margret singing \"Bye Bye Birdie\" at the opening. She reprises it again at the ending, too (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if that's all of it that you watch. You'll agree, I'm sure.<br /><br />Everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their 'all,' but it's like trying to improve on \"Casablanca\" -- it just can't be done! It's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake, and it just falls short, through no fault of the

{"value":"Dr Mordrid is terrifying. I would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already. There is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against a backdrop of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing. I rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. That movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. That is where this movie belongs. I suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment, go and rent All Dogs Go To Heaven, or Angels In The Outfield. Those movies are worth seeing.

{"value":"American Pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. In fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.<br /><br />Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking.

{"value":"I've just visited Russian forum of our TV-channel that had showed this film. Well... 99 per cent of active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film. But authors had in mind something else... :( We are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here. We are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand. So I'd like to ask authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, the Hell our MIR station? Ah? I'm quite sure, that LUNOHOD events took place much earlier Armstrong's \"walk on Moon\".

{"value":"Four years after making his directorial debut with the art-house snoozer \"Welcome To L.A.\", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be one of the guys. \"Roadie\" is a frat-boy fracas complete with barroom brawls, horny harpies, Art Carney in a souped-up wheelchair...and Meat Loaf at the wheel. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W. Redfish!) is actually a rather charming presence on the screen, and perhaps in a smaller role (in a better movie) he might indeed be ingratiating, but Zalman King's script is full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless Meat Loaf is kept wide-eyed and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie all make appearances--and all look embarrassed. They certainly should, \"Roadie\" is one bad trip.

{"value":"DO NOT WATCH THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A FILM. I have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p**sed off about it.<br /><br />The acting is comparable with high school plays. The script is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (which I believe I should be rewarded for reaching) I had a headache from all the screaming, crying and wailing the five girls make.<br /><br />The majority of the violence is (rare for a film nowadays) suggested rather than graphically depicted but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them, and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s**t, die in the most horrible ways possible.<br /><br />I spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours.

result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....<br /><br />Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing \"masterpieces\" like

{"value":"The show is average. It doesn't make me laugh particularly. However, I think Courtney really brings it down. She doesn't look natural. She has these three ways to talk, all robotic. She talks quietly (with no intonation), she talks normally (with no intonation), or she does that thing where she starts talking normally, and starts yelling gradually. However, her yelling is like \"let's pretend I'm yelling because I shouldn't be too loud on the set\". <br /><br />She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing. It's annoying. You can't really get her personality, because she doesn't really produce emotion, and doesn't get upset.

{"value":"Alas, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell thee, THIS VERSION SUCKS! I don't know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam, but I hope that they're proud of themselves. They took THE classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is quite literally so bad, that not even the presence of a great thespian like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save it. This movie's only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for \"MST3K\"; Mike, Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with this one.<br /><br />But either way, I'm sure that Shakespeare, had he been alive when they made this, would not have wanted his name associated with it. This \"Hamlet\" is not even so bad that's it good; it's just plain bad.

{"value":"This has to be the most brutally unfunny \"comedy\" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a crazed homeless man CAN'T make me laugh? Something's got to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever felt like walking out of. I used free passes, and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can wholeheartedly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene, and that's it. Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh, right? I don't know, I guess the filmmakers thought that \"flan\" was a funny word, or something.

{"value":"Mann photographs the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb fashion, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do. <br /><br />But come on Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect themselves a marshal (yes a marshal!) and to enforce the law themselves, then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town? <br /><br />Nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West.<br /><br />Canadian viewers be prepared for a Reefer Madness type of enjoyable

{"value":"I recently viewed Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was drawn to the movie as a photographer because I'm both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe the movie does a good job getting it's message across, I couldn't help but feel that it was made as a complete afterthought to the photographs and subsequent popular book by Burtynsky. Obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them. While this is a good effect when used economically, I felt like 75% of the movie was just stills from Burtynsky's book (which I already own). That's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with his work you might be better off skipping this one.","finished_norm":["i","recent","view","manufactur","landscap","at","the","seattl","intern","film","festiv","i","be","draw","to","the","movi","a","a","photograph","becaus","i","be","both","familiar","and","a","fan","of","burtynski","work","while","i","believ","the","movi","doe","a","good","job","get","it","messag","across","i","can","not","help","but","feel","that","it","be","make","a","a","complet","afterthought","to","the","photograph","and","subsequ","popular","book","by","burtynski","obvious","on","reason","for","thi","be","the","extens","us","of","still","photograph","featur","zoom","and","pan","across","them","while","thi","be","a","good","effect","when","us","econom","i","feel","like","of","the","movi","be","just","still","from","burtynski","book","which","i","alreadi","own","that","probabl","a","exagger","but","that","how","i","feel","if","you","own","the","book","or","be","familiar","with","hi","work","you","mai","be","well","off","skip","thi","on"],"filtered":["recent","view","manufactur","landscap","seattl","intern","film","festiv","draw","movi","photograph","becaus","familiar","fan","burtynski","work","believ","movi","doe","good","job","get","messag","across","help","feel","make","complet","afterthought","photograph","subsequ","popular","book","burtynski","obvious","reason","thi","extens","us","still","photograph","featur","zoom","pan","across","thi","good","effect","us","econom","feel","like","movi","still","burtynski","book","alreadi","probabl","exagger","feel","book","familiar","hi","work","mai","well","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["recent","view","manufactur","landscap","seattl","intern","festiv","draw","photograph","becaus","familiar","fan","burtynski","work","believ","doe","good","job","get","messag","across","help","feel","make","complet","afterthought","photograph","subsequ","popular","book","burtynski","obvious","reason","extens","us","still","photograph","featur","zoom","pan","across","good","effect","us","econom","feel","like","still","burtynski","book","alreadi","probabl","exagger","feel","book","familiar","work","mai","well","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,18,20,22,43,46,48,56,64,91,95,103,106,140,148,151,185,289,305,312,330,341,503,562,569,576,931,951,1095,1217,1313,1382,2063,2381,2613,3207,3809,3941,4839,5470,5870,6277],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,18,20,22,43,46,48,56,64,91,95,103,106,140,148,151,185,289,305,312,330,341,503,562,569,576,931,951,1095,1217,1313,1382,2063,2381,2613,3207,3809,3941,4839,5470,5870,6277],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,4.982433610865464,1.655771293751733,3.3910232448024944,3.7221218701403576,3.766857155204268,2.0105926690411424,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,8.400736460430558,2.518833027372001,2.8282659991423613,2.8612813773965557,2.8824835850471584,2.9292757465539174,2.933776879434709,6.698129014030783,3.432149042129413,3.6436037491933098,3.587125145032839,3.9241755834625858,4.004218291136122,8.310898521720091,4.477736862489302,13.475764492443776,4.449957298382227,4.900964426937307,5.116075806554253,5.322690055917252,5.521540914662417,5.7446844659766265,5.822646007446338,6.0662680901040895,6.389041482367141,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.957409572442782E-5,6.91049413318622E-5,6.964216635575969E-5,6.923977317663326E-5,6.924090759236148E-5,6.914412264052455E-5,6.934976694924561E-5,6.911489199186878E-5,6.927028746443295E-5,7.685160262578686E-5,0.47948173684861783,6.90033253180434E-5,0.1788539285151345,7.129395812452102E-5,6.905364182302954E-5,6.886280735087176E-5,7.058050393993517E-5,0.054264033967858186,6.914108695850793E-5,6.91983926265206E-5,6.986792766085547E-5,6.942497900662282E-5,6.950402987743743E-5,6.957891267412E-5,7.011289508294348E-5,0.08542729372014293,7.267822315453173E-5,6.902383937397146E-5,6.90256859233201E-5,6.920056210826548E-5,7.067140385584974E-5,6.935224589565843E-5,0.07583710259706826,6.95473235292884E-5,6.909896871904646E-5,6.941790601019402E-5,6.902972982561936E-5,6.907052131710552E-5,6.886246137855985E-5,6.888032747806628E-5,6.90353687239864E-5,6.976354558230258E-5,6.94090476903502E-5,6.913462371832024E-5,0.030628004484429393,6.916115796468773E-5,7.145903980294186E-5,7.040821379352435E-5,6.889744800499053E-5,6.904971557844967E-5,6.902576653562725E-5,7.096841107670902E-5,6.905074290658004E-5,6.887421247897726E-5,6.963020552752581E-5,6.90685285449013E-5,0.09042984236400677,6.901160710279071E-5,6.889665124552956E-5,6.92256125340602E-5,6.991227243045134E-5,6.922103286602927E-5,6.88839052110221E-5,6.904429083423251E-5,6.886329428221999E-5,7.045664817955775E-5,6.945651923661251E-5

I didn't hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence, but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending. There were funny bits along the way to be sure, but few were original. At least it didn't go for the gutter.<br /><br />Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature. Everyone else is a cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have made this as a favor to someone.<br /><br />All in all, it's a harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.","finished_norm":["mai","contain","spoilersbr","br","i","sai","that","but","anyon","savvi","enough","to","be","read","thi","can","probabl","figur","out","everi","plot","turn","right","from","the","startbr","br","thi","be","not","a","movi","that","i","like","i","do","not","hate","it","in","the","wai","of","some","movi","that","insult","your","intellig","but","it","all","feel","too","predict","on","it","trudg","to","the","requisit","happi","end","there","be","funni","bit","along","the","wai","to","be","sure","but","few","be","origin","at","littl","it","do","not","go","for","the","gutterbr","br","christina","appleg","look","fresh","and","ben","affleck","work","hard","their","scene","togeth","be","actual","the","onli","redeem","featur","everyon","els","be","a","cardboard","cutout","includ","surprisingli","jame","gandolfini","who","must","have","make","thi","a","a","favor","to","someonebr","br","all","in","all","it","a","harmless","but","not","inspir","minut"],"filtered":["mai","contain","spoilersbr","br","sai","anyon","savvi","enough","read","thi","probabl","figur","everi","plot","turn","right","startbr","br","thi","movi","like","hate","wai","movi","insult","intellig","feel","predict","trudg","requisit","happi","end","funni","bit","along","wai","sure","origin","littl","go","gutterbr","br","christina","appleg","look","fresh","ben","affleck","work","hard","scene","togeth","actual","onli","redeem","featur","everyon","els","cardboard","cutout","includ","surprisingli","jame","gandolfini","must","make","thi","favor","someonebr","br","harmless","inspir","minut"],"filtered2":["mai","contain","spoilersbr","anyon","savvi","enough","read","probabl","figur","everi","plot","turn","right","startbr","like","hate","wai","insult","intellig","feel","predict","trudg","requisit","happi","end","funni","bit","along","wai","sure","origin","littl","go","gutterbr","christina","appleg","look","fresh","ben","affleck","work","hard","scene","togeth","actual","onli","redeem","featur","everyon","els","cardboard","cutout","includ","surprisingli","jame","gandolfini","must","make","favor","someonebr","harmless","inspir","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,11,14,16,19,24,32,33,43,46,48,52,59,62,69,85,93,96,119,121,141,145,148,158,171,196,246,270,301,305,324,337,339,415,603,605,620,634,709,711,854,909,1115,1381,1406,1658,1814,2738,3271,4112,4873,6077,6847,6979,8070,8484],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,11,14,16,19,24,32,33,43,46,48,52,59,62,69,85,93,96,119,121,141,145,148,158,171,196,246,270,301,305,324,337,339,415,603,605,620,634,709,711,854,909,1115,1381,1406,1658,1814,2738,3271,4112,4873,6077,6847,6979,8070,8484],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,2.803707089537043,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,2.0226120445069267,2.127032521151058,2.011190219103739,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.2657547357741192,2.34599021453259,2.3018654096236517,2.3106972614914807,2.373087554090762,2.478925055209576,2.673149229007135,2.731603554088023,2.8309760279012264,2.8612813773965557,2.8753661172782943,2.973659465713028,3.003844442051426,3.1588018988486244,3.530930586689197,3.5474598886404074,3.7568101178222815,3.5119855004467477,3.6497387377608255,3.6375061693251913,4.291900363587903,3.9612932464190886,4.1554492608600455,4.449957298382227,4.429617614145104,4.637773374493822,4.869215728622727,5.274680836730892,5.999576715605417,5.850044981634453,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.74399943545732E-5,6.698523070645669E-5,6.75059770014899E-5,6.711592674721003E-5,6.711702636610568E-5,6.70232101757905E-5,6.722254659367409E-5,6.699487614198381E-5,6.714550504608E-5,0.09493496012111846,0.5466469856976609,6.6886731641152E-5,6.81351393182996E-5,6.910710205242006E-5,6.693550474810905E-5,6.675052389293626E-5,6.841553221339127E-5,6.722884483887287E-5,6.70202676096539E-5,6.707581549550163E-5,6.772481335117736E-5,6.729545161201605E-5,6.737207769282891E-5,6.744466355015043E-5,6.796226669341132E-5,0.2439937659835318,7.044890642425004E-5,6.69066164531869E-5,6.690840636186412E-5,6.707791843101381E-5,6.850364388415436E-5,6.722494950139924E-5,7.216028854858368E-5,6.741404336419005E-5,6.697944129632664E-5,6.728859557121149E-5,6.691232622234372E-5,6.695186648408764E-5,6.675018853290722E-5,6.67675066113861E-5,6.691779215431278E-5,6.762363306683408E-5,6.728000896963171E-5,0.037585012499509074,6.782829302187899E-5,6.703972296195654E-5,6.92

{"value":"I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and \"intelligence\" of this film were boring. I've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point. Now that I've seen a movie like that I will no longer be thinking along those lines. There's tones about society, racism, and some desire...but South Park has that. And when I watch South Park it actually moves me to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie a seven or above because I love most every film.

{"value":"Cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap I have ever wasted my time watching. This show based on the Geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for Geico. The makeup was half ass-ed to say the least, hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist. This show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials, that in it self makes for a lousy show. Perhaps if the writers were the same from the Geico ads this may of had a chance, instead the pilot lacked a good story line. I give this show a 1 out of 10, I would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option. I pray for a quick death to this show, I'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death.","finished_norm":["caveman","be","by","far","the","big","load","of","crap","i","have","ever","wast","my","time","watch","thi","show","base","on","the","geico","commerci","be","littl","entertain","then","a","actual","sec","ad","for","geico","the","makeup","be","half","ass","to","sai","the","littl","hard","to","imagin","a","caveman","with","prefect","white","tooth","even","after","go","to","the","dentist","thi","show","can","of","have","potenti","for","a","funni","seri","if","thei","can","of","get","the","cast","from","the","commerci","that","in","it","self","make","for","a","lousi","show","perhap","if","the","writer","be","the","same","from","the","geico","ad","thi","mai","of","have","a","chanc","instead","the","pilot","lack","a","good","stori","line","i","give","thi","show","a","out","of","i","would","of","like","to","put","a","zero","out","of","but","that","be","not","a","option","i","prai","for","a","quick","death","to","thi","show","i","have","give","it","littl","then","episod","befor","it","die","a","deserv","death"],"filtered":["caveman","far","big","load","crap","ever","wast","time","watch","thi","show","base","geico","commerci","littl","entertain","actual","sec","ad","geico","makeup","half","ass","sai","littl","hard","imagin","caveman","prefect","white","tooth","even","go","dentist","thi","show","potenti","funni","seri","thei","get","cast","commerci","self","make","lousi","show","perhap","writer","geico","ad","thi","mai","chanc","instead","pilot","lack","good","stori","line","give","thi","show","like","put","zero","option","prai","quick","death","thi","show","give","littl","episod","befor","die","deserv","death"],"filtered2":["caveman","far","big","load","crap","ever","wast","time","watch","show","base","geico","commerci","littl","entertain","actual","sec","ad","geico","makeup","half","ass","littl","hard","imagin","caveman","prefect","white","tooth","even","go","dentist","show","potenti","funni","get","cast","commerci","self","make","lousi","show","perhap","writer","geico","ad","mai","chanc","instead","pilot","lack","good","stori","line","give","show","like","put","zero","option","prai","quick","death","show","give","littl","befor","die","deserv","death"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,14,17,28,30,44,46,52,62,79,82,89,92,101,107,152,159,171,183,195,206,245,287,293,313,318,334,340,359,423,486,547,960,964,1109,1117,1125,1173,1212,1296,1429,1661,1832,2493,3024,3641,3917],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,14,17,28,30,44,46,52,62,79,82,89,92,101,107,152,159,171,183,195,206,245,287,293,313,318,334,340,359,423,486,547,960,964,1109,1117,1125,1173,1212,1296,1429,1661,1832,2493,3024,3641,3917],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,3.3525245991777624,1.2770536940105968,7.726147096759545,2.6728839783437044,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,1.9469506069506084,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.3131195476980753,2.300267965194495,2.373087554090762,2.4885128563647294,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,5.500405948648577,2.841890188081905,2.9012296278682137,2.907069060519773,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,2.948928684455311,3.2189558216683714,3.164467636384302,3.3066947359763783,3.432149042129413,4.058285512406398,4.062925891962901,4.165705761027235,4.224077767249142,8.481214138400706,4.2574141875167335,4.550761997504193,4.370968887063596,4.760735085628657,4.688631791727313,9.617182213612585,5.170884043049248,5.444579873526289,6.032366538428407,12.978249881848246]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.892240822168072E-5,6.845764831029823E-5,6.898984124817876E-5,6.859121721047338E-5,6.859234100034229E-5,6.849646261499264E-5,6.870018069205218E-5,6.846750576433923E-5,6.862144567666364E-5,7.613174808113445E-5,0.7493452528375127,6.835698411461798E-5,6.96328333250889E-5,7.062616099331355E-5,6.840682931434115E-5,6.821778235288407E-5,6.991938960023274E-5,0.19606094392820303,6.849345536763998E-5,6.855022426421076E-5,6.921348788948188E-5,6.87746882521975E-5,6.885299866833493E-5,6.892718005190877E-5,6.945616074768238E-5,6.909292458037771E-5,7.199745987247236E-5,6.837730601923255E-5,6.837913527229984E-5,6.855237342482712E-5,7.000943807368751E-5,6.8702636418639E-5,7.374646027683868E-5,6.889588679667079E-5,6.845173164182628E-5,6.876768150719939E-5,6.83831412961249E-5,6.842355070136266E-5,6.82174396212299E-5,6.823513837233388E-5,6.838872737598877E-5,6.911008353827702E-5,6.875890616157576E-5,6.848705266741064E-5,6.931924217038003E-5,6.851333837247015E-5,7.078969638262149E-5,6.974871326330222E-5,6.825209853449419E-5,6.8
