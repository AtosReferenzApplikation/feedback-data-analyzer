{"value":"You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.","finished_norm":["you","know","when","you","re","on","the","bu","and","someon","decid","to","tell","you","their","lifestori","and","you","sit","there","with","a","pathet","smile","on","your","face","when","all","you","realli","want","to","do","be","slap","the","fool","and","walk","off","good","i","have","a","similar","sensat","while","watch","thi","film","okai","i","do","actual","choos","to","go","and","see","april","and","i","know","about","nanni","moretti","tast","for","make","himself","the","on","and","onli","star","from","caro","diario","but","after","about","half","a","hour","of","thi","late","instal","from","hi","memoir","i","want","to","give","moretti","the","madr","of","all","slap","caro","diario","be","funni","unusu","and","at","littl","a","coupl","of","other","charact","manag","to","get","a","word","in","edgewai","in","april","howev","moretti","have","exclus","right","to","the","dialogu","so","that","all","you","hear","for","a","hour","and","a","half","be","a","highpitch","whine","go","on","about","how","hi","polit","be","well","or","what","quirki","piec","of","popular","cultur","be","tickl","hi","fanci","at","the","moment","he","conjur","find","time","to","slag","off","film","that","he","doe","not","like","someth","i","think","be","reserv","for","loser","like","me","sure","be","in","a","posit","like","hi","you","have","think","he","have","try","and","make","a","point","about","cinema","a","littl","much","intellig","than","thi","by","make","a","proper","film","perhap","on","with","some","idea","and","a","decent","structur","or","mayb","on","that","be","not","complet","domin","by","hi","annoi","voic","and","when","he","start","fawn","over","hi","newborn","babi","i","just","want","to","go","and","be","in","the","compani","of","someon","normal","prefer","not","a","selfobsess","film","director","with","a","strang","penchant","for","tacki","music","the","next","time","someon","you","do","not","know","try","to","tell","you","their","lifestori","give","them","a","slap","from","me","everi","blow","will","be","a","small","victori","in","the","fight","against","moretti"],"filtered":["know","re","bu","someon","decid","tell","lifestori","sit","pathet","smile","face","realli","want","slap","fool","walk","good","similar","sensat","watch","thi","film","okai","actual","choos","go","see","april","know","nanni","moretti","tast","make","onli","star","caro","diario","half","hour","thi","late","instal","hi","memoir","want","give","moretti","madr","slap","caro","diario","funni","unusu","littl","coupl","charact","manag","get","word","edgewai","april","howev","moretti","exclus","right","dialogu","hear","hour","half","highpitch","whine","go","hi","polit","well","quirki","piec","popular","cultur","tickl","hi","fanci","moment","conjur","find","time","slag","film","doe","like","someth","think","reserv","loser","like","sure","posit","like","hi","think","try","make","point","cinema","littl","much","intellig","thi","make","proper","film","perhap","idea","decent","structur","mayb","complet","domin","hi","annoi","voic","start","fawn","hi","newborn","babi","want","go","compani","someon","normal","prefer","selfobsess","film","director","strang","penchant","tacki","music","next","time","someon","know","try","tell","lifestori","give","slap","everi","blow","small","victori","fight","moretti"],"filtered2":["know","re","bu","someon","decid","tell","lifestori","sit","pathet","smile","face","realli","want","slap","fool","walk","good","similar","sensat","watch","okai","actual","choos","go","see","april","know","nanni","moretti","tast","make","onli","star","caro","diario","half","hour","late","instal","memoir","want","give","moretti","madr","slap","caro","diario","funni","unusu","littl","coupl","charact","manag","get","word","edgewai","april","howev","moretti","exclus","right","dialogu","hear","hour","half","highpitch","whine","go","polit","well","quirki","piec","popular","cultur","tickl","fanci","moment","conjur","find","time","slag","doe","like","someth","think","reserv","loser","like","sure","posit","like","think","try","make","point","cinema","littl","intellig","make","proper","perhap","idea","decent","structur","mayb","complet","domin","annoi","voic","start","fawn","newborn","babi","want","go","compani","someon","normal","prefer","selfobsess","director","strang","penchant","tacki","music","next","time","someon","know","try","tell","lifestori","give","slap","everi","blow","small","victori","fight","moretti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,18,20,26,30,36,37,38,39,52,53,58,62,66,68,71,85,90,100,103,113,118,119,121,123,139,150,163,174,188,191,206,216,218,233,244,248,249,251,253,258,271,294,297,309,318,345,363,409,417,428,509,575,584,589,602,603,698,700,754,872,880,882,951,1057,1268,1301,1490,1524,1614,1618,2048,2060,2163,2265,2469,2697,2722,3034,3555,4245,4849,4901,5552,5880,6416,7487,7970],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"I saw this on DVD ( It`s known as CORRUPT in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel`s character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in \" This gritty and powerful police thriller \" . What the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old Italian movie . How old is it Theo ? Well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the CD player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . You see my point about this being an old film ? The DVD case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . It`s also a film with poor production values like so many other Italian films masquerading as American ones . With the exception of Keitel the cast are awful though Johnny Rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( I don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy DVD or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone`s score . It`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns.<br /><br />All of this is a pity because CORRUPT does have its moments . It`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop .

{"value":"I've now watched all four Bo Derek vehicles directed by her husband, John; all are quite terrible, of course, but this is certainly the pits. Featuring the usual flimsy plot, bad scripting  by the director, naturally  and acting, not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star, it deals with her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired Hemingway!!) but who continues to appear and talk to her. In fact, he wants to come back in another, younger bodybut actually does so only in the very last scene! Derek is lovely as always, and still playing naïve(!)  especially during a muddled mid-section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger-than-life (read: hammy) here, but this easily constitutes his nadir; besides, for much of the duration, he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo)! His 'replacement', then, is obviously a handsome-looking stud who hasn't a lick of talent or even personality. Also featured in the cast are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife)  plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who presumably needed this on his resume')! It also goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer on the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and corny) expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand, and that GHOSTS CAN'T DO IT swept the board at the 1990 Razzie

{"value":"Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge Bon Jovi fan. In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much.<br /><br />But this isn't half as good. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy. Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl, no wonder she is so desperate for blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is just \"too bright\". There is no atmosphere or sense of dread. I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension like that.<br /><br />The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight. However the story has less cool bits this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really don't care who or what this one is. There is no army of masters. Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple.<br /><br />So there you have it really. Lack of scares, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story.

{"value":"If you have seen Friends, the writing will feel very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy setups.<br /><br />The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young (about 10 years old I think). Now, they're in their mid-twenties, and they meet again on a class reunion. This is where the series starts.<br /><br />A typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once. They're usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut up into multiple sections, which are then shown in a mixed order.<br /><br />The sketches is where my problems lie with this series. As in the later seasons of Friends, it's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations. One of the main characters does something really stupid that's hard to believe. The situation is then heavily exaggerated, as if it wasn't silly enough. If you're into this kind of in-your-face humor, then maybe you'll like this series. For me it is a great turn-off.<br /><br />The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters. The Class has none of this. The characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far.

{"value":"One question: Why? First off, the premise is not funny or engaging at all. They use taped interviews, and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts. First off, the interviews aren't funny or entertaining to begin with, and even if they were, I am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally, without being turned into cartoons. How does that add any hilarity to it? I turned on CBS's Monday night sitcom line-up, (which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday workdays) and found this on. Of course, the sitcom line-up would be reruns anyway, being summer, but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give \"CC\" a chance. I really did. When it started, I figured, well, maybe it will be funny. Nope. And then it kept going. It was a long half hour.<br /><br />And I can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in their entirety, and had points to them. But no, it was just one-line clips, cut and pasted together really quick. It was like a horrible dreadful version of Cartoon Network's \"Robot Chicken.\" I wasn't a fan of CBS' now-cancelled sitcom \"The Class.\" WHile that was on, it was one half-hour of the line-up I would struggle through. But if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of \"Creatures\"....let's just say I'd take the \"Class.\" Considering it's been a couple hours since it aired, and I come on here to see I am the first to comment...I guess that's a good sign that nobody watched it, and that it won't last much longer.

{"value":"I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. <br /><br />But can you imagine Dracula with an snobbish English accent and the body language to go along with it? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension..? Then this is a movie for you! <br /><br />Otherwise - don't see it! I only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie.<br /><br />Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. Cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing!<br /><br />Or maybe you like this film because of it's place in Dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Cause as movie it isn't that appealing, it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating. <br /><br />And furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it. The scenery looks like cheap Theatre. And i don't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies.

{"value":"I purchased this film on the cheap in a sale, having read the back of the DVD case and assuming that either way I can't lose, it if was rubbish then no loss, if it was any good then bargain...<br /><br />Then I watched it...<br /><br />I am normally a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this film he commanded very little screen presence, seeming not to do a whole lot, even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the \"action\" in the plot seems to affect him very little, and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic.<br /><br />Normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters, however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused, and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it's eventual conclusion...<br /><br />At this point I wept...<br /><br />I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing I have ever been subjected to, the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful, although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl. The acting was poor all round, the script and story was weak, the \"action\" was even weaker, and the \"visuals\" were but bluntly not all that visual.

{"value":"Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film, save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence.<br /><br />FORGET YOU EVER STUMBLED UPON THIS FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /><br />Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idol pretty-boys featuring nonsensical, convoluted \"plot\" that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you're ready to scream.<br /><br />Nothing in this film makes sense. It's an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FOR NO GOOD REASON. We can obviously see something incredibly \"dramatic\" is happening, but we just don't GIVE A CRAP WHY 'cause there's no backstory.<br /><br />By the time this film is over, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, lanky, girly stars' faces. You'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, be \"serious,\" and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces.<br /><br />That some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the \"soul\" of any of its \"actors\" should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /><br />Only the \"converted,\" mindless minions will like this film, the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous. Freud would have a field day.<br /><br />Unless you're one of these mindless \"fans,\" stay the hell away from this

{"value":"I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.The acting was not much more above the lower production values however I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit \"Dead Like Me\" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.I felt as though if anyone might \"make it\" from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'Godfather' or perhaps 'Beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and

{"value":"Ah, Bait. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways. 1. You try to be funny, but are corny and unenjoyable; every joke is predictable and expected, and when it comes, does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to hurl. 2. You try to be dramatic, but are unbelievable; the woman overacts to a terrible degree, and the \"bad guy\" looks like Bill Gates, and is about as scary as...well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate somebody with a gun. Doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. Doesn't fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous, and makes me want to hurl. 3. You try to be action-packed, but instead are dull and dragging too many times. And when the action heats up, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, for the scenes wobble more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself nauseated, and once again I want to hurl. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you FAILED, YOU FAILED! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water, no sunscreen, and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in Bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with Bill Gates for a bad guy, and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just driven OFF A CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape...just kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad, ever again.","finished_norm":["ah","bait","how","do","i","hate","you","let","me","count","the","wai","you","try","to","be","funni","but","be","corni","and","unenjoy","everi","joke","be","predict","and","expect","and","when","it","come","doe","not","inspir","laughter","instead","i","want","to","hurl","you","try","to","be","dramat","but","be","unbeliev","the","woman","overact","to","a","terribl","degre","and","the","bad","gui","look","like","bill","gate","and","be","about","a","scari","aswel","bill","gate","just","try","to","imagin","bill","gate","try","to","intimid","somebodi","with","a","gun","doe","not","work","doe","it","a","lawyer","mayb","but","not","a","gun","doe","not","fit","a","for","jami","foxx","good","just","watch","him","try","to","deliv","a","dramat","and","heartfelt","dialogu","be","ludicr","and","make","me","want","to","hurl","you","try","to","be","actionpack","but","instead","be","dull","and","drag","too","mani","time","and","when","the","action","heat","up","the","tripod","for","the","camera","must","have","be","lose","for","the","scene","wobbl","much","than","that","in","the","blair","witch","project","and","i","find","myself","nauseat","and","onc","again","i","want","to","hurl","you","try","to","be","a","good","movi","but","you","fail","you","fail","you","fail","i","would","rather","walk","barefoot","across","the","sahara","with","a","pack","full","of","beef","jerki","and","no","water","no","sunscreen","and","onli","meryl","streep","for","compani","thi","hell","would","be","love","than","a","singl","minut","much","spend","watch","everyon","in","bait","overact","their","wai","through","a","idiot","write","stori","with","bill","gate","for","a","bad","gui","and","let","not","even","talk","about","the","massiv","bomb","that","go","off","in","a","car","that","jami","foxx","charact","have","just","drive","off","a","cliff","but","somehow","manag","to","escapejust","kill","me","now","or","do","the","right","thing","and","promis","me","that","somehow","i","will","never","have","to","watch","a","movi","that","be","thi","bad","ever","again"],"filtered":["ah","bait","hate","let","count","wai","try","funni","corni","unenjoy","everi","joke","predict","expect","come","doe","inspir","laughter","instead","want","hurl","try","dramat","unbeliev","woman","overact","terribl","degre","bad","gui","look","like","bill","gate","scari","aswel","bill","gate","try","imagin","bill","gate","try","intimid","somebodi","gun","doe","work","doe","lawyer","mayb","gun","doe","fit","jami","foxx","good","watch","try","deliv","dramat","heartfelt","dialogu","ludicr","make","want","hurl","try","actionpack","instead","dull","drag","mani","time","action","heat","tripod","camera","must","lose","scene","wobbl","much","blair","witch","project","find","nauseat","onc","want","hurl","try","good","movi","fail","fail","fail","rather","walk","barefoot","across","sahara","pack","full","beef","jerki","water","sunscreen","onli","meryl","streep","compani","thi","hell","love","singl","minut","much","spend","watch","everyon","bait","overact","wai","idiot","write","stori","bill","gate","bad","gui","let","even","talk","massiv","bomb","go","car","jami","foxx","charact","drive","cliff","somehow","manag","escapejust","kill","right","thing","promis","somehow","never","watch","movi","thi","bad","ever"],"filtered2":["ah","bait","hate","let","count","wai","try","funni","corni","unenjoy","everi","joke","predict","expect","come","doe","inspir","laughter","instead","want","hurl","try","dramat","unbeliev","woman","overact","terribl","degre","bad","gui","look","like","bill","gate","scari","aswel","bill","gate","try","imagin","bill","gate","try","intimid","somebodi","gun","doe","work","doe","lawyer","mayb","gun","doe","fit","jami","foxx","good","watch","try","deliv","dramat","heartfelt","dialogu","ludicr","make","want","hurl","try","actionpack","instead","dull","drag","mani","time","action","heat","tripod","camera","must","lose","scene","wobbl","blair","witch","project","find","nauseat","onc","want","hurl","try","good","fail","fail","fail","rather","walk","barefoot","across","sahara","pack","full","beef","jerki","water","sunscreen","onli","meryl","streep","compani","hell","love","singl","minut","spend","watch","everyon","bait","overact","wai","idiot","write","stori","bill","gate","bad","gui","let","even","talk","massiv","bomb","go","car","jami","foxx","charact","drive","cliff","somehow","manag","escapejust","kill","right","thing","promis","somehow","never","watch","bad","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,16,17,18,19,29,33,34,36,37,38,42,44,48,50,54,55,59,62,65,70,76,85,121,124,129,130,141,152,160,163,166,186,214,215,221,231,236,246,248,283,284,294,336,337,339,340,345,367,394,396,443,461,501,503,517,549,571,659,676,683,705,722,756,764,830,882,885,909,1079,1082,1135,1394,1415,1485,1507,1624,1702,1733,1855,1970,2698,2717,2818,2872,2884,3517,3589,3859,3988,4164,5215,5480,5958,6682,7152,7510,8406],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.

{"value":"I knew it would be, but I gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun. Anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that I'm pretty easy to please. I really didn't think I'd end up feeling this negatively towards it.<br /><br />The plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can become one with a good dragon or something I don't know. It was so stupid, I didn't bother to put much effort into retaining it.<br /><br />It features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts. So many of the events just felt totally random and sudden.<br /><br />I assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it's trying to be so grand and epic, yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly. I feel like I've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a punch in the face. It doesn't take much time at all to establish characters or drama. Imagine the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy in 90 minutes You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no buildup and you'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles. That was the case with Dragon Wars 90 minutes of me not giving a crap, waiting for it to be over.<br /><br />Fantastic CGI with some okay directing, but horrible acting, speedy pacing, and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds.

{"value":"Two years ago at Sundance I loved Josh Kornbluth's directing debut-Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob's, The Best Thief in the World. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower-class area of New York. The movie is not without its poignant moments. But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life isn't fair.<br /><br />More subtle, and more important, is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti-social behavior they may spawn, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity. We can recoil at their language and their living conditions, but we are cannot discount their intent. And in fact, their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the people is evident throughout.<br /><br />Having said all this, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful flaws (including the title). The characters aren't very believable. The writing is uneven. And the plot-line is barely discernible. And for many the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes. To each his own: But while I don't question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it pains me to see 5-year-old children mf'ing and talking about having sex with a line-up of women. It's unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest.","finished_norm":["two","year","ago","at","sundanc","i","love","josh","kornbluth","direct","debuthaiku","tunnel","so","i","be","look","forward","to","hi","brother","and","frequent","collabor","jacob","the","well","thief","in","the","world","thi","be","a","drama","about","a","seemingli","good","kid","grow","up","in","a","lowerclass","area","of","new","york","the","movi","be","not","without","it","poignant","moment","but","at","time","it","be","a","if","kornbluth","be","work","wai","too","hard","to","state","the","obviou","life","can","be","veri","difficult","for","some","peopl","and","life","be","not","fairbr","br","much","subtl","and","much","import","be","our","understand","that","despit","all","of","thi","somewhat","abhorr","cultur","underpin","and","the","antisoci","behavior","thei","mai","spawn","thi","charact","have","no","shortag","of","good","and","human","we","can","recoil","at","their","languag","and","their","live","condit","but","we","be","cannot","discount","their","intent","and","in","fact","their","struggl","to","maintain","a","famili","under","such","advers","have","a","certain","nobil","that","much","of","u","can","bare","appreci","kornbluth","grow","up","in","thi","neighborhood","and","hi","compass","for","the","peopl","be","evid","throughoutbr","br","have","sai","all","thi","the","well","thief","in","the","world","suffer","from","mani","pain","flaw","includ","the","titl","the","charact","be","not","veri","believ","the","write","be","uneven","and","the","plotlin","be","bare","discern","and","for","mani","the","much","disturb","be","that","kornbluth","us","two","young","black","boi","mimick","gangsta","rap","between","scene","to","each","hi","own","but","while","i","do","not","question","the","potenti","realism","of","thi","phenomenon","it","pain","me","to","see","yearold","child","mf","ing","and","talk","about","have","sex","with","a","lineup","of","woman","it","unnecessari","shock","valu","and","be","a","forc","bite","of","borrow","interest"],"filtered":["two","year","ago","sundanc","love","josh","kornbluth","direct","debuthaiku","tunnel","look","forward","hi","brother","frequent","collabor","jacob","well","thief","world","thi","drama","seemingli","good","kid","grow","lowerclass","area","new","york","movi","without","poignant","moment","time","kornbluth","work","wai","hard","state","obviou","life","veri","difficult","peopl","life","fairbr","br","much","subtl","much","import","understand","despit","thi","somewhat","abhorr","cultur","underpin","antisoci","behavior","thei","mai","spawn","thi","charact","shortag","good","human","recoil","languag","live","condit","discount","intent","fact","struggl","maintain","famili","advers","certain","nobil","much","u","bare","appreci","kornbluth","grow","thi","neighborhood","hi","compass","peopl","evid","throughoutbr","br","sai","thi","well","thief","world","suffer","mani","pain","flaw","includ","titl","charact","veri","believ","write","uneven","plotlin","bare","discern","mani","much","disturb","kornbluth","us","two","young","black","boi","mimick","gangsta","rap","scene","hi","question","potenti","realism","thi","phenomenon","pain","see","yearold","child","mf","ing","talk","sex","lineup","woman","unnecessari","shock","valu","forc","bite","borrow","interest"],"filtered2":["two","year","ago","sundanc","love","josh","kornbluth","direct","debuthaiku","tunnel","look","forward","brother","frequent","collabor","jacob","well","thief","world","drama","seemingli","good","kid","grow","lowerclass","area","new","york","without","poignant","moment","time","kornbluth","work","wai","hard","state","obviou","life","veri","difficult","peopl","life","fairbr","subtl","import","understand","despit","somewhat","abhorr","cultur","underpin","antisoci","behavior","mai","spawn","charact","shortag","good","human","recoil","languag","live","condit","discount","intent","fact","struggl","maintain","famili","advers","certain","nobil","u","bare","appreci","kornbluth","grow","neighborhood","compass","peopl","evid","throughoutbr","well","thief","world","suffer","mani","pain","flaw","includ","titl","charact","veri","believ","write","uneven","plotlin","bare","discern","mani","disturb","kornbluth","us","two","young","black","boi","mimick","gangsta","rap","scene","question","potenti","realism","phenomenon","pain","see","yearold","child","mf","ing","talk","sex","lineup","woman","unnecessari","shock","valu","forc","bite","borrow","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,10,15,16,19,20,23,33,46,47,48,50,54,56,57,60,65,70,75,87,91,97,102,112,114,116,125,135,154,165,171,180,182,186,188,212,229,254,264,282,292,301,338,378,381,383,391,451,458,463,498,508,547,561,594,596,600,610,633,699,774,803,811,827,839,842,880,923,961,1015,1081,1094,1157,1205,1494,1645,1763,1962,1976,2003,2055,2548,2694,2763,2973,2993,3147,3649,3741,4027,4139,4268,4470,4580,4581,4883,5938,6946,7218,7332,7770,7828,8269],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"The British 'heritage film' industry is out of control. There's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies? This film rips the guts out of Orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no-one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty. Orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a bleak, grey, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers. But this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing, and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s London, in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate-box world. Worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This film made me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft-centred, anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are 'getting some culture' while they drink their Horlicks and quietly doze off.","finished_norm":["the","british","heritag","film","industri","be","out","of","control","there","noth","wrong","with","film","classic","novel","but","why","must","thei","all","be","film","by","talentless","nobodi","thi","film","rip","the","gut","out","of","orwel","tough","novel","turn","it","into","a","harmless","fluffi","romant","comedi","aspidistra","mai","not","be","orwel","well","work","but","noon","who","read","it","can","forget","it","superb","depict","of","poverti","orwel","emphasis","not","onli","the","cold","and","the","hunger","but","the","humili","of","be","poor","in","the","novel","london","be","a","bleak","grei","cold","heartless","citi","and","comstock","prai","for","it","to","be","blast","awai","by","a","squadron","of","bomber","but","thi","film","iron","out","anyth","that","mai","be","in","ani","wai","disturb","and","creat","instead","a","jolli","nostalg","trip","to","charm","london","in","which","everyth","be","light","with","shaft","of","golden","sunlight","and","even","the","slum","of","lambeth","be","picturesqu","and","fill","with","freshli","scrub","urchin","and","happi","prostitut","comstock","poem","about","the","sharp","wind","sweep","across","the","rubbishstrewn","street","seem","complet","out","of","place","in","thi","chocolatebox","world","wrong","of","all","be","the","script","relentless","bonhomi","ancient","joke","and","clunk","dialogu","it","so","frustrat","becaus","richard","e","grant","be","the","perfect","person","to","plai","gordon","comstock","and","the","film","be","pack","with","great","actor","but","it","all","for","noth","thi","film","make","me","so","angri","britain","literari","histori","be","someth","to","be","proud","of","for","it","rich","complex","and","power","and","what","do","we","do","with","it","we","emploi","bland","nobodi","to","turn","it","into","softcentr","anodyn","pap","for","peopl","who","want","to","feel","that","thei","be","get","some","cultur","while","thei","drink","their","horlick","and","quietli","doze","off"],"filtered":["british","heritag","film","industri","control","noth","wrong","film","classic","novel","must","thei","film","talentless","nobodi","thi","film","rip","gut","orwel","tough","novel","turn","harmless","fluffi","romant","comedi","aspidistra","mai","orwel","well","work","noon","read","forget","superb","depict","poverti","orwel","emphasis","onli","cold","hunger","humili","poor","novel","london","bleak","grei","cold","heartless","citi","comstock","prai","blast","awai","squadron","bomber","thi","film","iron","anyth","mai","ani","wai","disturb","creat","instead","jolli","nostalg","trip","charm","london","everyth","light","shaft","golden","sunlight","even","slum","lambeth","picturesqu","fill","freshli","scrub","urchin","happi","prostitut","comstock","poem","sharp","wind","sweep","across","rubbishstrewn","street","seem","complet","place","thi","chocolatebox","world","wrong","script","relentless","bonhomi","ancient","joke","clunk","dialogu","frustrat","becaus","richard","e","grant","perfect","person","plai","gordon","comstock","film","pack","great","actor","noth","thi","film","make","angri","britain","literari","histori","someth","proud","rich","complex","power","emploi","bland","nobodi","turn","softcentr","anodyn","pap","peopl","want","feel","thei","get","cultur","thei","drink","horlick","quietli","doze"],"filtered2":["british","heritag","industri","control","noth","wrong","classic","novel","must","talentless","nobodi","rip","gut","orwel","tough","novel","turn","harmless","fluffi","romant","comedi","aspidistra","mai","orwel","well","work","noon","read","forget","superb","depict","poverti","orwel","emphasis","onli","cold","hunger","humili","poor","novel","london","bleak","grei","cold","heartless","citi","comstock","prai","blast","awai","squadron","bomber","iron","anyth","mai","ani","wai","disturb","creat","instead","jolli","nostalg","trip","charm","london","everyth","light","shaft","golden","sunlight","even","slum","lambeth","picturesqu","fill","freshli","scrub","urchin","happi","prostitut","comstock","poem","sharp","wind","sweep","across","rubbishstrewn","street","seem","complet","place","chocolatebox","world","wrong","script","relentless","bonhomi","ancient","joke","clunk","dialogu","frustrat","becaus","richard","e","grant","perfect","person","plai","gordon","comstock","pack","great","actor","noth","make","angri","britain","literari","histori","someth","proud","rich","complex","power","emploi","bland","nobodi","turn","softcentr","anodyn","pap","peopl","want","feel","get","cultur","drink","horlick","quietli","doze"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,11,20,22,23,25,27,33,35,37,40,41,43,46,48,49,51,53,77,96,103,104,127,141,145,146,152,153,155,164,165,193,214,248,332,353,362,365,372,474,499,503,553,595,605,641,664,667,677,696,797,824,825,839,864,866,880,937,1009,1011,1028,1042,1066,1083,1092,1106,1109,1161,1246,1366,1472,1507,1723,1846,1968,2099,2225,2261,2488,2559,2593,2619,2667,2729,2845,2938,3233,3298,3309,3498,3878,

{"value":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed movie, there is no doubt about that. And the acting is generally excellent, at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted.<br /><br />However, so many details small and large are just _wrong_ that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully. A small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene (no this does not spoil anything) where Mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell she's ringing is a fuurin, or wind chime - that is only left hanging outside of houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes didn't have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this to a movie made about America where a Christmas wreath is hanging on the door in July and no one thinks anything of it.) And don't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha, which is vaguely pan-Asian/Chinese/kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real thing. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too. <br /><br />So, I suppose that the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what \"Miyako\" is), then I suppose the more you will enjoy this. I honestly think this movie could have been so much better...as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of \"exotic Japan\".","finished_norm":["memoir","of","a","geisha","be","a","beautifulli","film","movi","there","be","no","doubt","about","that","and","the","act","be","gener","excel","at","littl","in","term","of","how","it","portrai","the","charact","a","thei","be","scriptedbr","br","howev","so","mani","detail","small","and","larg","be","just","wrong","that","it","just","bother","me","too","much","to","be","abl","to","enjoi","it","fulli","a","small","detail","that","typifi","the","kind","of","lack","of","sensit","of","sort","be","on","scene","no","thi","doe","not","spoil","anyth","where","mameha","ring","a","bell","that","hang","at","the","door","of","the","hous","where","sayuri","live","on","a","snowi","winter","dai","the","bell","she","ring","be","a","fuurin","or","wind","chime","that","be","onli","leav","hang","outsid","of","hous","in","japan","in","the","summer","peopl","in","tradit","japanes","home","do","not","have","doorbel","thei","just","open","the","door","and","announc","themselv","you","mai","think","thi","be","such","a","trivial","detail","but","i","would","equat","thi","to","a","movi","make","about","america","where","a","christma","wreath","be","hang","on","the","door","in","juli","and","no","on","think","anyth","of","it","and","do","not","even","get","me","start","on","the","total","wrong","hairstyl","give","to","the","maiko","and","geisha","which","be","vagu","panasianchinesekungfuish","and","noth","like","real","thing","i","think","thi","rather","cavali","attitud","toward","the","cultur","thei","be","try","to","portrai","realli","come","out","in","the","attitud","and","the","portray","of","peopl","and","situat","too","br","br","so","i","suppos","that","the","littl","you","know","about","japanes","cultur","and","the","world","of","the","geisha","and","maiko","in","kyoto","which","be","what","miyako","be","then","i","suppos","the","much","you","will","enjoi","thi","i","honestli","think","thi","movi","can","have","be","so","much","bettera","it","be","it","just","anoth","hollywood","version","of","exot","japan"],"filtered":["memoir","geisha","beautifulli","film","movi","doubt","act","gener","excel","littl","term","portrai","charact","thei","scriptedbr","br","howev","mani","detail","small","larg","wrong","bother","much","abl","enjoi","fulli","small","detail","typifi","kind","lack","sensit","sort","scene","thi","doe","spoil","anyth","mameha","ring","bell","hang","door","hous","sayuri","live","snowi","winter","dai","bell","ring","fuurin","wind","chime","onli","leav","hang","outsid","hous","japan","summer","peopl","tradit","japanes","home","doorbel","thei","open","door","announc","themselv","mai","think","thi","trivial","detail","equat","thi","movi","make","america","christma","wreath","hang","door","juli","think","anyth","even","get","start","total","wrong","hairstyl","give","maiko","geisha","vagu","panasianchinesekungfuish","noth","like","real","thing","think","thi","rather","cavali","attitud","toward","cultur","thei","try","portrai","realli","come","attitud","portray","peopl","situat","br","br","suppos","littl","know","japanes","cultur","world","geisha","maiko","kyoto","miyako","suppos","much","enjoi","thi","honestli","think","thi","movi","much","bettera","anoth","hollywood","version","exot","japan"],"filtered2":["memoir","geisha","beautifulli","doubt","act","gener","excel","littl","term","portrai","charact","scriptedbr","howev","mani","detail","small","larg","wrong","bother","abl","enjoi","fulli","small","detail","typifi","kind","lack","sensit","sort","scene","doe","spoil","anyth","mameha","ring","bell","hang","door","hous","sayuri","live","snowi","winter","dai","bell","ring","fuurin","wind","chime","onli","leav","hang","outsid","hous","japan","summer","peopl","tradit","japanes","home","doorbel","open","door","announc","themselv","mai","think","trivial","detail","equat","make","america","christma","wreath","hang","door","juli","think","anyth","even","get","start","total","wrong","hairstyl","give","maiko","geisha","vagu","panasianchinesekungfuish","noth","like","real","thing","think","rather","cavali","attitud","toward","cultur","try","portrai","realli","come","attitud","portray","peopl","situat","suppos","littl","know","japanes","cultur","world","geisha","maiko","kyoto","miyako","suppos","enjoi","honestli","think","bettera","anoth","hollywood","version","exot","japan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,10,11,12,13,14,18,19,21,23,25,26,29,30,34,36,46,49,50,71,73,74,80,104,113,116,122,132,149,160,165,183,184,200,213,220,225,242,269,300,302,363,436,454,469,473,496,563,564,567,580,740,748,757,791,808,838,843,848,858,880,1009,1084,1193,1367,1383,1422,1450,1508,1822,1841,1947,2388,2493,2778,2924,3010,3051,4117,4240,5179,6099,6416,8605],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,

{"value":"When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, starring those twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies. Well, THE BARBARIANS is remarkably trashy action/adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and fails at every level. The look of the film is all wrong. Some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy, tacky \"disco\" look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn't make any sense whatsoever, even for a low budget flick like this one.<br /><br />Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume. He's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon. And it's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first movie, walking around in skimpy fur bikini. I'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called Barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it's almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really ill-conceived. The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass, while the other twin's loincloth barely covers his muscular butt. I'm not kidding! Don't ask me who's who though.<br /><br />Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film. And his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick.

{"value":"A bunch of women who can't act sit around, talk, smoke pot. They have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed, and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store-bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers. We don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a bloodied sheet. I can't eat Spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this. Just the thought of Spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is \"hunting\" them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement. Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of some \"superhuman\" guy freaking out. He p***es blood and punches through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story.<br /><br />There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes, absolutely NOTHING happens.

{"value":"Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this \"Phantom\" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting \"better guns\". Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the \"professionals\".<br /><br />So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is. To be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like, it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not \"respect\" and playing by the rules.

{"value":"My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by.what else.extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the

{"value":"A cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films. The trail leads the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep.<br /><br />This is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill.Personally I'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing. This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not. Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead.Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of S&M to the proceedings. The violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement, its all so incredibly fake. Worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basically par for the course for many of these films)<br /><br />You'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that I stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a Buick. I watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery, not the type of things you should be thinking about in a

{"value":"Considering the limits of this film (The entire movie in one setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors total) it should have been much better made. IF you have these limits in making a film, how could the lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, were talking a hair below the acting in Clerks, except that was an enjoyable movie, this had no substance. Well it tried to, but really fails.<br /><br />It makes attempt to be self-referencing in a couple parts, but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad. And the main character Neal guy, what a pathetic looser. Clearly like 10 people total made this 'film' and they all knew each other, and it probably was a real rock band that they had, but unfortuntly these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around. This was made in 2005, but they all look so naieve it smacks of just pre-grunge era.<br /><br />Thankfully I didn't pay to see this (Starz on Demand delivers again!) but it was under the title \"The Possessed\" not Studio 666, it doesn't matter what you do to the title, it can't help this. This could have been a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad film-making when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they made this, working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can.

{"value":"What a powerful start to a film when Julia Roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was mis-lead. This film was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for, and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with Roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. Her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity....there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film I did not care all that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re-arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. This was I assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience. But I did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as I have said cheated the audience. If it had stayed the course I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol Ms Roberts.

{"value":"I'm afraid that I didn't like this movie very much. Apart from a few saving graces, it's nothing to write home about. <br /><br />J-horror has boomed for the last five-six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success. This is one of them.<br /><br />Basically this is a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but soon after opens them. However, after that, it's quickly downhill for this flick.<br /><br />To be kind I will start with the things I like about \"Gawi\". On the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type. For those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed (no pun intended) murder scenes. We also get a few good suspense sequences/set-pieces.<br /><br />However, there are quite a few drawbacks also...<br /><br />First of all, and my major complaint about this movie, is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity. Usually that's not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are, I was confused on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The performances are okay I guess (a little hard to tell when you don't know the language), but seem a little stiff. And for a horror movie, I don't think it was scary enough. For a while I was quite bored actually.<br /><br />Being a fan of giallo movies, I was expecting quite a lot from \"Nightmare\", but unfortunately I was quite

{"value":"I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie had been made in the past, but I'd never been able to locate it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /><br />As I watched the movie, I had the highest of hopes. As the film went on, I became more and more despondent. They had botched it badly! Never had I been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption. I understand that films can't stick strictly to a book, but they don't need to change things for the sake of it! Most, if not all, of departures from the book were totally unnecessary! <br /><br />I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie. Well, it wasn't just me. Nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created! <br /><br />Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the star wars movie? Why couldn't Calvin's hair have been red? Why did Mrs. Which not have the proper \"witch-like\" outfit that was such a clever play on her name? Basically, we all wondered--why did nearly every single detail have to be changed? <br /><br />I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make. I am still waiting for that movie.

{"value":"American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand, it's porno that's a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the \"important\" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.<br /><br />In all fairness, I did not go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies, and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House, I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.<br /><br />This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porno-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing.","finished_norm":["american","pie","beta","hous","be","sort","of","in","limbo","between","genr","on","the","on","hand","it","a","comedi","with","no","plot","and","few","genuin","clever","joke","on","the","other","hand","it","porno","that","a","tad","too","softcor","to","actual","turn","on","ani","viewer","essenti","beta","hous","be","a","collag","of","sex","scene","some","humili","other","just","lame","attempt","at","humor","with","a","coupl","thin","plot","point","throw","in","a","effort","at","cohes","the","charact","be","bare","even","twodimension","much","develop","reli","on","knowledg","of","nake","mile","and","the","import","plot","scene","be","so","far","apart","that","you","wonder","why","the","writer","even","feel","the","ne","for","a","storybr","br","in","all","fair","i","do","not","go","into","thi","movi","without","expect","i","like","the","origin","three","american","pie","movi","and","think","band","camp","and","nake","mile","be","solid","rental","i","think","nake","mile","be","almost","good","enough","to","be","releas","in","theater","and","so","when","i","see","that","some","of","the","same","charact","be","return","for","beta","hous","i","be","excit","to","see","thi","instal","i","be","awar","that","there","would","be","numer","scene","of","debaucheri","and","sexual","humili","in","multipl","form","and","i","be","fine","with","it","becaus","in","the","past","thi","scene","be","back","by","the","stori","and","be","good","integr","into","the","plot","in","beta","hous","howev","it","almost","a","if","the","writer","forget","why","the","formula","in","the","other","ap","movi","work","thei","spend","too","much","energi","work","in","the","nuditi","that","thei","forget","to","actual","write","a","storybr","br","thi","movi","be","a","disappoint","and","not","even","worth","a","onedollar","rental","the","joke","be","lame","the","stori","be","nonexist","and","the","pornoaspect","be","too","tame","if","that","all","you","realli","care","about","see"],"filtered":["american","pie","beta","hous","sort","limbo","genr","hand","comedi","plot","genuin","clever","joke","hand","porno","tad","softcor","actual","turn","ani","viewer","essenti","beta","hous","collag","sex","scene","humili","lame","attempt","humor","coupl","thin","plot","point","throw","effort","cohes","charact","bare","even","twodimension","much","develop","reli","knowledg","nake","mile","import","plot","scene","far","apart","wonder","writer","even","feel","ne","storybr","br","fair","go","thi","movi","without","expect","like","origin","three","american","pie","movi","think","band","camp","nake","mile","solid","rental","think","nake","mile","almost","good","enough","releas","theater","see","charact","return","beta","hous","excit","see","thi","instal","awar","numer","scene","debaucheri","sexual","humili","multipl","form","fine","becaus","past","thi","scene","back","stori","good","integr","plot","beta","hous","howev","almost","writer","forget","formula","ap","movi","work","thei","spend","much","energi","work","nuditi","thei","forget","actual","write","storybr","br","thi","movi","disappoint","even","worth","onedollar","rental","joke","lame","stori","nonexist","pornoaspect","tame","realli","care","see"],"filtered2":["american","pie","beta","hous","sort","limbo","genr","hand","comedi","plot","genuin","clever","joke","hand","porno","tad","softcor","actual","turn","ani","viewer","essenti","beta","hous","collag","sex","scene","humili","lame","attempt","humor","coupl","thin","plot","point","throw","effort","cohes","charact","bare","even","twodimension","develop","reli","knowledg","nake","mile","import","plot","scene","far","apart","wonder","writer","even","feel","ne","storybr","fair","go","without","expect","like","origin","three","american","pie","think","band","camp","nake","mile","solid","rental","think","nake","mile","almost","good","enough","releas","theater","see","charact","return","beta","hous","excit","see","instal","awar","numer","scene","debaucheri","sexual","humili","multipl","form","fine","becaus","past","scene","back","stori","good","integr","plot","beta","hous","howev","almost","writer","forget","formula","ap","work","spend","energi","work","nuditi","forget","actual","write","storybr","disappoint","even","worth","onedollar","rental","joke","lame","stori","nonexist","pornoaspect","tame","realli","care","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,10,12,13,17,19,22,27,32,43,48,52,63,65,66,69,93,96,101,110,113,125,127,130,131,175,177,187,205,213,214,219,223,224,235,253,254,269,279,283,287,310,320,327,369,372,373,401,424,440,464,467,488,519,524,572,594,600,612,689,877,893,908,927,955,980,1166,1176,1197,1206,1374,1426,1441,1484,1505,1519,1593,1625,1631,1930,2106,2127,2163,2296,2313,2845,3538,3655,3764,4371,5836,5930,7375,7862],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"I've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. <br /><br />The film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc...<br /><br />The film is totally predictable from beginning to end. Even the stupid \"big\" red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old. And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the \"shocking\" surprise ending arrived, I wasn't shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie. It's so silly!<br /><br />Anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the \"rock band\" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography, which I actually liked. But aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it's unintentionally

{"value":"Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mail-boy for struggling TV station UBC (that's United Broadcasting Corporation); he is going nowhere at work, offering ridiculous projects like \"Abraham Lincoln's Doctor's Dog\" to studio executives - because Lincoln, doctors, and dogs are popular. Programming director Joe Flynn (as Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr. Russell's proposals, but has no idea how to pick a hit TV show. His secretary Heather North (as Jennifer Scott), who does double duty as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee who bugs the heck out of Russell when he wants to watch TV. Turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily pick the hits. Russell discovers the chimp's talent, and uses him to advance his own career. Understandably, things gets HAIRY for Russell and the cast!<br /><br />Raffles the chimp (handled by Frank Lamping) performs well; Raffles does look bored and/or distracted during a few scenes, when the chimp is supposed to look interested; these could have been corrected with re-takes or editing. A mild satirical edge is present - imagine a monkey picking hit TV shows! AND, it's a monkey who gets a BEER during the commercials (drinking in a Disney film)! A look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun TV actors to recognize and try to place. You could make a drinking game, in honor of Raffles' beer-guzzling, by guessing actors, and where you've seen them before. Here's a start - Hey, isn't that \"Dr. Bellows\" from \"I Dream of Jeannie\"?

{"value":"I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of \"entertainment\". After all, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I couldn't stand their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a séance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast.<br /><br />Overall, it's passable entertainment at best. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt cheated having to watch Kyser and his knuckleheads.","finished_norm":["i","know","my","summari","would","get","you","how","be","thi","movi","like","a","pet","rock","and","disco","good","unless","you","live","through","the","or","you","probabl","ca","not","understand","why","anyon","would","like","a","new","coke","or","own","a","pet","rock","and","frankli","at","littl","in","the","case","of","pet","rock","i","still","do","not","understand","it","complet","thei","re","just","a","coupl","thing","that","seem","to","make","sens","at","the","time","but","realli","baffl","the","young","gener","the","same","can","be","sai","for","kai","kyser","and","hi","band","at","the","time","the","mostli","thei","be","veri","popular","and","have","enough","clout","that","the","studio","star","them","with","bori","karloff","bela","lugosi","and","peter","lorr","in","thi","film","yet","if","you","do","not","live","at","that","time","it","be","good","befor","my","time","you","wonder","why","anyon","like","thi","sort","of","entertain","after","all","kyser","and","hi","band","mate","be","incredibli","obnoxi","and","their","humor","be","veri","veri","broad","ie","unsophist","and","cheesi","frankli","i","can","not","stand","their","antic","nor","do","i","appreci","that","there","be","just","too","mani","music","number","in","the","film","becaus","of","thi","factor","the","great","support","cast","be","give","a","back","seat","and","fan","of","thi","actor","will","probabl","be","disappointedbr","br","the","film","involv","kyser","and","the","band","come","to","a","mansion","where","a","young","ladi","and","her","wacki","aunt","live","onc","there","the","bridg","be","wash","out","and","strang","happen","begin","eventu","it","culmin","in","some","attempt","on","salli","life","and","a","séanc","of","sort","it","all","plai","for","laughsand","it","realli","not","a","horror","movi","despit","the","castbr","br","overal","it","passabl","entertain","at","well","a","a","lugosi","and","karloff","fan","i","sure","feel","cheat","have","to","watch","kyser","and","hi","knucklehead"],"filtered":["know","summari","get","thi","movi","like","pet","rock","disco","good","unless","live","probabl","ca","understand","anyon","like","new","coke","pet","rock","frankli","littl","case","pet","rock","still","understand","complet","thei","re","coupl","thing","seem","make","sens","time","realli","baffl","young","gener","sai","kai","kyser","hi","band","time","mostli","thei","veri","popular","enough","clout","studio","star","bori","karloff","bela","lugosi","peter","lorr","thi","film","yet","live","time","good","befor","time","wonder","anyon","like","thi","sort","entertain","kyser","hi","band","mate","incredibli","obnoxi","humor","veri","veri","broad","ie","unsophist","cheesi","frankli","stand","antic","appreci","mani","music","number","film","becaus","thi","factor","great","support","cast","give","back","seat","fan","thi","actor","probabl","disappointedbr","br","film","involv","kyser","band","come","mansion","young","ladi","wacki","aunt","live","onc","bridg","wash","strang","happen","begin","eventu","culmin","attempt","salli","life","séanc","sort","plai","laughsand","realli","horror","movi","despit","castbr","br","overal","passabl","entertain","well","lugosi","karloff","fan","sure","feel","cheat","watch","kyser","hi","knucklehead"],"filtered2":["know","summari","get","like","pet","rock","disco","good","unless","live","probabl","ca","understand","anyon","like","new","coke","pet","rock","frankli","littl","case","pet","rock","still","understand","complet","re","coupl","thing","seem","make","sens","time","realli","baffl","young","gener","kai","kyser","band","time","mostli","veri","popular","enough","clout","studio","star","bori","karloff","bela","lugosi","peter","lorr","yet","live","time","good","befor","time","wonder","anyon","like","sort","entertain","kyser","band","mate","incredibli","obnoxi","humor","veri","veri","broad","ie","unsophist","cheesi","frankli","stand","antic","appreci","mani","music","number","becaus","factor","great","support","cast","give","back","seat","fan","actor","probabl","disappointedbr","involv","kyser","band","come","mansion","young","ladi","wacki","aunt","live","onc","bridg","wash","strang","happen","begin","eventu","culmin","attempt","salli","life","séanc","sort","plai","laughsand","realli","horror","despit","castbr","overal","passabl","entertain","well","lugosi","karloff","fan","sure","feel","cheat","watch","kyser","knucklehead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,13,14,15,20,22,26,29,30,34,35,40,41,43,50,51,63,64,68,75,79,81,83,87,92,93,94,100,103,116,118,119,135,140,147,148,158,173,175,177,194,195,212,225,236,241,253,269,288,369,377,391,412,417,459,460,472,510,543,582,687,716,760,927,932,951,961,1333,1384,1405,1416,1518,1572,1750,1838,2068,2126,2151,2167,2534,2576,2671,2906,3064,3081,3088,3279,3371,3394,3442,3567,3579,4609,4657,4735,5206,5305,6684],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders.

{"value":"I wished I'd taped MEN IN WHITE so I could watch it again<br /><br />\" What ? You mean you really enjoyed it Theo ? \" <br /><br />No I mean I could watch it again to see if it was as retarded , stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as I can remember it <br /><br />A lot of people have claimed it was made for children . May I suggest it was also made by children ? because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time <br /><br />The cast don't help but I genuinely started to feel sorry for them . Honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this . To give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narrative I waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later I forgot she was in the movie . Got that ? A star from BAYWATCH appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie . This tells you all you need to know about the standard of MEN IN WHITE <br /><br />Fair enough it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES ( Although THE DISMALS would be a better

{"value":"I did not watch the entire movie. I could not watch the entire movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case.<br /><br />I like Mafia movies both tragic and comic but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy.<br /><br />The problem is Corky Romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived - Chris Kattan is clearly 'acting' rather than taking a role - it bounces you right out of the story. Each scene is utterly predictable, the 'comedic event' that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies such as Mr. Bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed. Corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience.<br /><br />If Chris had not played such an alien character (who never really connects with the other characters in the movie) and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable (except for trying to draw laughs) and the comedy scenes weren't so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed far too familiar) this movie could have been watchable.

{"value":"Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in, what he called a pretty good sci-fi film, Nemesis. So as we watched this, we found ourselves fastforwarding through the BS drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And kick! haha<br /><br />Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in. He finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the Mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family. Instead of joining up, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang? too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or maims them pretty bad) and works to rid his block of these gangmembers.<br /><br />The plot was very cheesy and easy to think of. Gruner is probably not very well known because of his script-choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to. This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against Gruner's character. The music was typical action music (thumping pianos and timpani, swelling guitars) which actually wasn't as bad as I make it sound. The director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment.<br /><br />Ultimately, I gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action film for Oliver Gruner to star in, but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw.","finished_norm":["oliv","gruner","be","total","unknown","to","me","my","friend","show","me","thi","film","becaus","he","have","see","gruner","in","what","he","call","a","pretti","good","scifi","film","nemesi","so","a","we","watch","thi","we","find","ourselv","fastforward","through","the","b","drama","part","just","to","get","to","the","unbeliev","action","sequenc","gruner","love","to","kick","and","kick","and","kick","and","kick","hahabr","br","gruner","charact","be","a","graduat","student","who","be","forc","to","stai","in","a","ghetto","close","to","the","on","that","he","grow","up","in","he","find","himself","watch","after","the","boi","who","live","with","him","becaus","he","realli","want","to","join","in","the","mexican","gang","that","keep","torment","hi","famili","instead","of","join","up","gruner","tell","the","boi","to","fight","back","against","a","gang","too","crazi","gruner","plai","a","typic","van","damm","charact","who","kill","everyon","or","maim","them","pretti","bad","and","work","to","rid","hi","block","of","thi","gangmembersbr","br","the","plot","be","veri","cheesi","and","easi","to","think","of","gruner","be","probabl","not","veri","good","know","becaus","of","hi","scriptchoos","if","thi","movi","be","anyth","to","compar","possibl","choic","to","thi","ghetto","be","pure","hell","and","i","enjoi","see","the","motlei","crow","of","charact","go","through","it","a","if","thei","have","a","chanc","against","gruner","charact","the","music","be","typic","action","music","thump","piano","and","timpani","swell","guitar","which","actual","be","not","a","bad","a","i","make","it","sound","the","director","realli","ne","to","keep","the","action","go","instead","of","take","a","break","everi","minut","for","a","tens","famili","momentbr","br","ultim","i","give","it","a","becaus","it","realli","try","to","be","a","averag","action","film","for","oliv","gruner","to","star","in","but","the","overal","feel","of","the","film","leav","you","want","much","closur","on","what","you","just","see"],"filtered":["oliv","gruner","total","unknown","friend","show","thi","film","becaus","see","gruner","call","pretti","good","scifi","film","nemesi","watch","thi","find","ourselv","fastforward","b","drama","part","get","unbeliev","action","sequenc","gruner","love","kick","kick","kick","kick","hahabr","br","gruner","charact","graduat","student","forc","stai","ghetto","close","grow","find","watch","boi","live","becaus","realli","want","join","mexican","gang","keep","torment","hi","famili","instead","join","gruner","tell","boi","fight","back","gang","crazi","gruner","plai","typic","van","damm","charact","kill","everyon","maim","pretti","bad","work","rid","hi","block","thi","gangmembersbr","br","plot","veri","cheesi","easi","think","gruner","probabl","veri","good","know","becaus","hi","scriptchoos","thi","movi","anyth","compar","possibl","choic","thi","ghetto","pure","hell","enjoi","see","motlei","crow","charact","go","thei","chanc","gruner","charact","music","typic","action","music","thump","piano","timpani","swell","guitar","actual","bad","make","sound","director","realli","ne","keep","action","go","instead","take","break","everi","minut","tens","famili","momentbr","br","ultim","give","becaus","realli","try","averag","action","film","oliv","gruner","star","overal","feel","film","leav","want","much","closur","see"],"filtered2":["oliv","gruner","total","unknown","friend","show","becaus","see","gruner","call","pretti","good","scifi","nemesi","watch","find","ourselv","fastforward","b","drama","part","get","unbeliev","action","sequenc","gruner","love","kick","kick","kick","kick","hahabr","gruner","charact","graduat","student","forc","stai","ghetto","close","grow","find","watch","boi","live","becaus","realli","want","join","mexican","gang","keep","torment","famili","instead","join","gruner","tell","boi","fight","back","gang","crazi","gruner","plai","typic","van","damm","charact","kill","everyon","maim","pretti","bad","work","rid","block","gangmembersbr","plot","veri","cheesi","easi","think","gruner","probabl","veri","good","know","becaus","scriptchoos","anyth","compar","possibl","choic","ghetto","pure","hell","enjoi","see","motlei","crow","charact","go","chanc","gruner","charact","music","typic","action","music","thump","piano","timpani","swell","guitar","actual","bad","make","sound","director","realli","ne","keep","action","go","instead","take","break","everi","minut","tens","famili","momentbr","ultim","give","becaus","realli","try","averag","action","oliv","gruner","star","overal","feel","leav","want","closur","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,7,9,10,12,13,15,22,26,28,30,31,32,36,37,38,40,43,48,52,54,58,59,61,63,74,76,78,85,90,100,104,110,116,118,129,134,142,148,152,161,178,182,184,200,233,246,282,295,338,349,360,366,394,402,412,463,482,486,543,561,571,613,626,642,643,712,726,735,744,768,781,809,818,869,997,1319,1512,2009,2204,2276,2367,2929,3198,3214,3252,3281,3307,3479,4080,4259,5045,5169,6121,
