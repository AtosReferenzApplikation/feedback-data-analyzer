{"value":"While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I'm not even sure where to begin as I've got so many problems with this movie. I suppose I'll just number a few of them: <br /><br />1. The Acting  When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? Not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly A-List names. Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less said the better.<br /><br />2. The Ghosts  The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at Disney World. And, they are about as frightening. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells.<br /><br />3. The Plot  How predictable can one movie be? The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. If you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.<br /><br />4. The Convenient Priest  What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to mind.<br /><br />5. Everything Else  It's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. I suppose I'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture. That's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie.<br /><br />I'll stop. You should be able to get the idea from what I've already mentioned. And, I haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems. Be warned, this thing is horrible.","finished_norm":["while","the","premis","behind","the","hous","where","evil","dwell","mai","be","intrigu","the","execut","be","downright","pathet","i","be","not","even","sure","where","to","begin","a","i","have","get","so","mani","problem","with","thi","movi","i","suppos","i","will","just","numb","a","few","of","them","br","br","the","act","when","you","see","that","edward","albert","doug","mcclure","and","susan","georg","and","her","tooth","be","the","star","of","your","movi","you","know","you","re","in","troubl","not","that","it","matter","much","to","me","but","thi","be","hardli","alist","name","susan","georg","mai","have","be","in","a","coupl","of","movi","i","enjoi","but","i","have","never","consid","her","the","great","actress","i","have","ever","see","and","in","thi","movi","her","act","be","embarrass","a","for","the","other","two","the","littl","sai","the","betterbr","br","the","ghost","the","ghost","or","spirit","or","whatev","you","want","to","call","them","remind","me","quit","a","bite","of","the","ghost","in","the","haunt","mansion","rideat","disnei","world","and","thei","be","about","a","frighten","and","why","do","thei","have","to","be","so","obviou","subtleti","be","not","a","characterist","of","the","hous","where","evil","dwellsbr","br","the","plot","how","predict","can","on","movi","be","the","outcom","of","thi","movi","be","painfulli","obviou","onc","you","meet","the","three","main","charact","if","you","can","not","see","where","thi","movi","be","head","after","about","minut","you","ne","to","see","much","moviesbr","br","the","conveni","priest","what","be","the","chanc","that","the","haunt","hous","you","bui","just","happen","to","be","across","the","street","from","a","group","of","japanes","monk","not","to","mention","that","on","of","them","know","the","histori","of","your","hous","and","come","over","knock","on","the","door","and","ask","if","you","ne","help","remov","evil","spirit","absurd","be","a","word","that","come","to","mindbr","br","everyth","els","it","veri","difficult","for","me","to","think","of","ani","posit","to","write","about","i","suppos","i","will","give","it","a","point","for","the","open","scene","and","a","point","for","the","hous","architectur","that","a","sure","sign","of","a","winner","note","the","architectur","a","a","highlight","of","ani","film","doe","not","sai","much","about","the","actual","moviebr","br","i","will","stop","you","should","be","abl","to","get","the","idea","from","what","i","have","alreadi","mention","and","i","have","not","even","mention","the","annoi","littl","girl","or","the","invas","of","the","crab","or","a","multitud","of","other","problem","be","warn","thi","thing","be","horribl"],"filtered":["premis","behind","hous","evil","dwell","mai","intrigu","execut","downright","pathet","even","sure","begin","get","mani","problem","thi","movi","suppos","numb","br","br","act","see","edward","albert","doug","mcclure","susan","georg","tooth","star","movi","know","re","troubl","matter","much","thi","hardli","alist","name","susan","georg","mai","coupl","movi","enjoi","never","consid","great","actress","ever","see","thi","movi","act","embarrass","two","littl","sai","betterbr","br","ghost","ghost","spirit","whatev","want","call","remind","quit","bite","ghost","haunt","mansion","rideat","disnei","world","thei","frighten","thei","obviou","subtleti","characterist","hous","evil","dwellsbr","br","plot","predict","movi","outcom","thi","movi","painfulli","obviou","onc","meet","three","main","charact","see","thi","movi","head","minut","ne","see","much","moviesbr","br","conveni","priest","chanc","haunt","hous","bui","happen","across","street","group","japanes","monk","mention","know","histori","hous","come","knock","door","ask","ne","help","remov","evil","spirit","absurd","word","come","mindbr","br","everyth","els","veri","difficult","think","ani","posit","write","suppos","give","point","open","scene","point","hous","architectur","sure","sign","winner","note","architectur","highlight","ani","film","doe","sai","much","actual","moviebr","br","stop","abl","get","idea","alreadi","mention","even","mention","annoi","littl","girl","invas","crab","multitud","problem","warn","thi","thing","horribl"],"filtered2":["premis","behind","hous","evil","dwell","mai","intrigu","execut","downright","pathet","even","sure","begin","get","mani","problem","suppos","numb","act","see","edward","albert","doug","mcclure","susan","georg","tooth","star","know","re","troubl","matter","hardli","alist","name","susan","georg","mai","coupl","enjoi","never","consid","great","actress","ever","see","act","embarrass","two","littl","betterbr","ghost","ghost","spirit","whatev","want","call","remind","quit","bite","ghost","haunt","mansion","rideat","disnei","world","frighten","obviou","subtleti","characterist","hous","evil","dwellsbr","plot","predict","outcom","painfulli","obviou","onc","meet","three","main","charact","see","head","minut","ne","see","moviesbr","conveni","priest","chanc","ha

{"value":"A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess, so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it, I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! See, the movie can't even get that part

The acting, camera-work, writing, special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked. People have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script. Wow. The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count. For starters, why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe? I know the government's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country. There wouldn't be anyone to govern! Another thing that I was wondering about, even if the government told everyone to go to work, why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet? And how about the ending? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies. He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature. And another thing, why does he say Hindenburg before he dies. The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people. The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world. He doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots? They also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer. Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR. It's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand. Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses.<br /><br />Anywho, I think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production.

{"value":"I am an avid fan of Lucio Fulci, and yet I must say that \"Zombi 3\" (aka. \"Zombie Flesh Eaters 2\") of 1988, which he made with two other directors, Bruno Mattei and Claudi Fragasso, was quite a disappointment. Especially compared to its great predecessor, Fulci's very own Gore classic \"Zombi 2\" (aka. \"Zombie Felsh Eaters\"/\"Zombie\") of 1979, this is vastly disappointing. Sure, the low rating of 4.5 already suggests that it's not a good film, but, these low ratings usually come from people who are not into Italian Zombie flicks, and as enthusiastic fan of Italian Horror films and low-budget Exploitation cinema, I love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings. Also, many of my fellow Italian Horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated, which I sadly cannot agree with. Not that the film was a complete disaster. It has some redeeming qualities, above all Fulci's nauseating gore effects, that are always a pleasure to watch for an Italian Horror/Gore buff. The basic idea behind the film is also not bad (allthough far from original) and I liked the ruthless portrayal of the military. Sadly, that's about it. While the great predecessor \"Zombi 2\" was extremely gory, but beyond that also genuinely creepy, this is not creepy or scary for a minute, and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch \"Zombi 3\". The film is sometimes fun to watch, but only for the gore, and as an unintentional comedy. I guess that it was mainly the gore that came from Fulci, and the disappointing rest that came from Mattei and Fragasso, the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cult-flicks (such as D'Amato's \"Porno Holocaust\"), and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made, the god-awful \"Troll 2\". Overall, this is definitely watchable for the gore, but, out of all Fulci films I've seen so far, this is definitely the worst, and I've seen the majority of this great filmmaker's repertoire.

{"value":"There is one really good scene in Faat Kine. The title character gets in an argument with another woman and after being threatened, Faat Kine sprays her in the face. The scene works because the act is so unexpected, bizarre, and rather funny at the same time. In that one instance, writer/director Ousmane Sembene gives the audience a character that is easy to root for, an interesting film character that could be worth watching for two hours. In the scene, he presents a brave woman who is bold in her actions. For the rest of the movie, the only other thing he seems to present is conflicting tones. <br /><br />The tone is all over the place. It's true not all movies have to clearly fit within a specific genre, but I don't think Faat Kine fits into any genre. Supposedly, it's a drama, though there are moments of such broad comedy (the aforementioned spraying in the face) that it cannot be taken seriously. On the other hand, the film is certainly not a comedy with the abundant amount of serious topics Sembene has crammed into the picture. There is a way to successfully mix comedy and drama together. Unfortunately, Semebene doesn't find that balance. Instead, one scene after another just drift into each other without much rhyme or reason, leaving two different tones hanging in the wind. <br /><br />Faat Kine also has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale. The film ends with a big party where all the characters' conflicts are resolved, only they aren't resolved quickly. The scene lasts longer than any other scene, going on for probably twenty minutes. Because the rest of the scenes up until this point have been meandering, the finale is particularly hard to endure with repetition beginning early on in the scene, making for a frustrating viewing experience.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being too hard on Faat Kine. I am not the right audience for it. I felt nothing towards the characters and had no connection to any part of the story. There are people who will probably find something meaningful in the story and see strong characters. However, I was unable to do so and thus cannot recommend

{"value":"Even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film. If one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke.....first off, Jeroen Krabbé is i guess the poor man's Gerard Depardieu.....naturally i hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the 'Iron Mask' three musketeer one. Otherwise to me he is box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The poor man's box office poison....really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised. If the '4th Man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the Bourgeoisie....what am i saying? it isn't. Let's just say hypothetically, if it was supposed to be, it wasn't sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing....if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead......i think that is what happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either.....(for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film....very sharp satire)<br /><br />[potential spoiler alert]<br /><br />Really, the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé's character works so so hard to attain.... do you even care? is it funny? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control.....though i'm guessing he didn't cast Jeroen Krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he's incompetent at it. So it becomes like a weird caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé is the butt of the joke as well? I just don't see it...... So you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right? It is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director. So there is some kind of dupery involved.

{"value":"Wow, I can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie. Now, I have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic/funny comedies with John Cusack.<br /><br />This is a mediocre film at best. While the acting wasn't terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters do come off as complete cowards. They don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to. How do we know they aren't in love? By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances. I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.<br /><br />The movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing. This movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike Cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.).<br /><br />The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. No suspense about whether the two will end up together, no joy when they do, no consequences to their actions.<br /><br />It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie, that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'Everyone is too Cynical!'. Criticism of this movie is not cynicism, simply unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even ones with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />If you think this movie is great, try these movies, you hearts will explode: The Princess

{"value":"This adaptation, like 1949's *The Heiress*, is based on the Henry James novel. *The Heiress*, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James' original story than this new remake, which retains James' original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (Leigh), devoted to her father (Finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man (Chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. She's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly  it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in *The Truth About Cats and Dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where *Washington Square* differs from *The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it. It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.","finished_norm":["thi","adapt","like","the","heiress","be","base","on","the","henri","jame","novel","the","heiress","star","olivia","de","havilland","remain","a","a","wellrespect","piec","of","work","though","littl","true","to","jame","origin","stori","than","thi","new","remak","which","retain","jame","origin","titl","it","be","the","stori","of","a","awkward","yet","love","daughter","leigh","devot","to","her","father","finnei","after","her","mother","die","dure","childbirth","the","arrog","father","hold","hi","daughter","in","no","esteem","whatsoev","and","consid","her","a","good","a","all","woman","simplemind","when","a","young","man","chaplin","of","good","famili","and","littl","fortun","come","court","the","father","be","natur","suspici","but","feel","so","sure","that","hi","daughter","can","hold","no","interest","for","ani","man","be","convinc","that","the","young","man","be","a","fortun","hunter","and","forbid","her","to","see","him","leigh","be","a","controversi","actress","much","either","love","her","or","hate","her","and","she","alwai","have","a","particular","edgi","and","tens","to","her","styl","like","she","act","through","grit","tooth","she","not","bad","in","thi","and","she","handl","her","role","rel","deftli","it","just","a","awkward","role","for","ani","actress","make","the","audienc","want","to","grab","the","charact","by","her","shoulder","and","shake","her","until","she","come","to","her","sens","while","the","charact","garner","a","lot","of","sympathi","she","not","particularli","likabl","the","veri","handsom","and","immens","appeal","ben","chaplin","previous","see","in","the","truth","about","cat","and","dog","plai","hi","role","with","the","exact","amount","of","mysteri","requir","to","keep","the","audienc","guess","whether","he","be","after","her","fortun","or","be","realli","in","love","with","her","maggi","smith","be","on","of","the","fine","actress","aliv","and","rais","the","level","of","the","movi","consider","with","her","portray","of","the","wellmean","aunt","finnei","be","marvel","of","cours","a","the","father","who","threaten","to","disinherit","hi","daughter","for","her","disobedi","but","the","daughter","be","will","to","risk","that","for","the","man","she","love","but","doe","her","ardent","suitor","still","want","her","without","her","fortun","thi","be","onli","on","instanc","where","washington","squar","differ","from","the","heiress","anoth","instanc","be","the","abil","to","stick","with","it","it","be","a","handsom","movi","that","be","a","tediou","a","a","drip","faucet","offer","too","littl","stori","in","too","long","of","a","movi"],"filtered":["thi","adapt","like","heiress","base","henri","jame","novel","heiress","star","olivia","de","havilland","remain","wellrespect","piec","work","though","littl","true","jame","origin","stori","thi","new","remak","retain","jame","origin","titl","stori","awkward","yet","love","daughter","leigh","devot","father","finnei","mother","die","dure","childbirth","arrog","father","hold","hi","daughter","esteem","whatsoev","consid","good","woman","simplemind","young","man","chaplin","good","famili","littl","fortun","come","court","father","natur","suspici","feel","sure","hi","daughter","hold","interest","ani","man","convinc","young","man","fortun","hunter","forbid","see","leigh","controversi","actress","much","either","love","hate","alwai","particular","edgi","tens","styl","like","act","grit","tooth","bad","thi","handl","role","rel","deftli","awkward","role","ani","actress","make","audienc","want","grab","charact","shoulder","shake","come","sens","charact","garner","lot","sympathi","particularli","likabl","veri","handsom","immens","appeal","ben","chaplin","previous","see","truth","cat","dog","plai","hi","role","exact","amount","mysteri","requir","keep","audienc","guess","whether","fortun","realli","love","maggi","smith","fine","actress","aliv","rais","level","movi","consider","portray","wellmean","aunt","finnei","marvel","cours","father","threaten","disinherit","hi","daughter","disobedi","daughter","risk","man","love","doe","ardent","suitor","still","want","without","fortun","thi","onli","instanc","washington","squar","differ","heiress","anoth","instanc","abil","stick","handsom","movi","tediou","drip","faucet","offer","littl","stori","long","movi"],"filtered2":["adapt","like","heiress","base","henri","jame","novel","heiress","star","olivia","de","havilland","remain","wellrespect","piec","work","though","littl","true","jame","origin","stori","new","remak","retain","jame","origin","titl","stori","awkward","yet","love","daughter","leigh","devot","father","finnei","mother","die","dure","childbirth","arrog","father","hold","daughter","esteem","whatsoev","consid","good","woman","simplemind","young","man","chaplin","good","famili","littl","fortun","come","court","father","natur","suspici","feel","sure","daughter","hold","interest","ani","man","convinc","young","man","fortun","hunter","forbid","see","leigh","controversi","actress","either","l

{"value":"Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O`Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast A WALK ON THE MOON a movie I had absolutely no knowledge off<br /><br />I missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea Viggo Mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap TVM , certainly the opening with the mawkish Pearl and Marty taking their kids to a Summer camp has that sort of made for TV feel though the brightly lit ( Too brightly lit ) cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn`t until the appearence of Viggo Mortensen as hippy guy Walker that I realised this was a cinema release , after all someone of Mortensen`s stature wouldn`t star in a TVM , I mean that`s like a legend like Robert DeNiro appearing in a straight to video film . Wait a minute , didn`t Bob .... ?<br /><br />Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are an unconvincing on-screen couple and I agree . I can understand why Pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why Walker would be attracted to plain house wife Pearl . The sixties was before my time but surely if you`ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it`s not really a choice at all . Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those days so I guess that explains it<br /><br />I feel the major problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes down to the fact it`s a romantic drama at heart ( Just like you`d expect in a TVM ) with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene ? It jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 . I say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and Woodstock . In other words A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them","finished_norm":["see","a","the","world","snooker","championship","final","finish","in","a","prematur","and","disappoint","manner","with","ronni","osullivan","defeat","gream","dott","by","frame","to","bbc","find","a","gap","in","their","schedul","and","so","decid","to","broadcast","a","walk","on","the","moon","a","movi","i","have","absolut","no","knowledg","offbr","br","i","miss","a","few","second","of","the","titl","credit","so","have","no","idea","viggo","mortensen","star","in","it","and","think","possibli","it","mai","be","a","cheap","tvm","certainli","the","open","with","the","mawkish","pearl","and","marti","take","their","kid","to","a","summer","camp","have","that","sort","of","make","for","tv","feel","though","the","brightli","light","too","brightli","light","cinematographi","seem","to","suggest","thi","be","a","cinemat","film","and","it","wasnt","until","the","appear","of","viggo","mortensen","a","hippi","gui","walker","that","i","realis","thi","be","a","cinema","releas","after","all","someon","of","mortensen","statur","wouldnt","star","in","a","tvm","i","mean","that","like","a","legend","like","robert","deniro","appear","in","a","straight","to","video","film","wait","a","minut","didnt","bob","br","br","some","peopl","on","thi","site","have","mention","that","pearl","and","marti","be","a","unconvinc","onscreen","coupl","and","i","agre","i","can","understand","why","pearl","would","be","attract","to","excit","hippi","gui","but","have","no","idea","why","walker","would","be","attract","to","plain","hous","wife","pearl","the","sixti","be","befor","my","time","but","sure","if","youv","get","the","choic","between","hippi","chick","and","bore","hous","wife","it","not","realli","a","choic","at","all","mind","you","a","lot","of","peopl","take","lsd","in","that","dai","so","i","guess","that","explain","itbr","br","i","feel","the","major","problem","of","a","walk","on","the","moon","come","down","to","the","fact","it","a","romant","drama","at","heart","just","like","youd","expect","in","a","tvm","with","sever","cloi","come","of","ag","scene","so","why","includ","a","fairli","explicit","sex","scene","it","jar","with","the","rest","of","the","movi","and","be","possibli","off","putt","to","the","menopuas","woman","who","be","someth","in","i","sai","possibli","becaus","the","movi","conjur","seem","to","aim","at","a","teeenag","market","with","the","come","of","ag","scene","and","that","teenag","will","probabl","be","bore","with","the","histor","and","social","context","of","man","walk","on","the","moon","and","woodstock","in","other","word","a","walk","on","the","moon","try","to","attract","mani","typ","of","audienc","but","will","probabl","appeal","to","none","of","them"],"filtered":["see","world","snooker","championship","final","finish","prematur","disappoint","manner","ronni","osullivan","defeat","gream","dott","frame","bbc","find","gap","schedul","decid","broadcast","walk","moon","movi","absolut","knowledg","offbr","br","miss","second","titl","credit","idea","viggo","mortensen","star","think","possibli","mai","cheap","tvm","certainli","open","mawkish","pearl","marti","take","kid","summer","camp","sort","make","tv","feel","though","brightli","light","brightli","light","cinematographi","seem","suggest","thi","cinemat","film","wasnt","appear","viggo","mortensen","hippi","gui","walker","realis","thi","cinema","releas","someon","mortensen","statur","wouldnt","star","tvm","mean","like","legend","like","robert","deniro","appear","straight","video","film","wait","minut","didnt","bob","br","br","peopl","thi","site","mention","pearl","marti","unconvinc","onscreen","coupl","agre","understand","pearl","attract","excit","hippi","gui","idea","walker","attract","plain","hous","wife","pearl","sixti","befor","time","sure","youv","get","choic","hippi","chick","bore","hous","wife","realli","choic","mind","lot","peopl","take","lsd","dai","guess","explain","itbr","br","feel","major","problem","walk","moon","come","fact","romant","drama","heart","like","youd","expect","tvm","sever","cloi","come","ag","scene","includ","fairli","explicit","sex","scene","jar","rest","movi","possibli","putt","menopuas","woman","someth","sai","possibli","becaus","movi","conjur","seem","aim","teeenag","market","come","ag","scene","teenag","probabl","bore","histor","social","context","man","walk","moon","woodstock","word","walk","moon","try","attract","mani","typ","audienc","probabl","appeal","none"],"filtered2":["see","world","snooker","championship","final","finish","prematur","disappoint","manner","ronni","osullivan","defeat","gream","dott","frame","bbc","find","gap","schedul","decid","broadcast","walk","moon","absolut","knowledg","offbr","miss","second","titl","credit","idea","viggo","mortensen","star","think","possibli","mai","cheap","tvm","certainli","open","mawkish","pearl","marti","take","kid","summer","camp","sort","make","tv","feel","though","brightli","light","brightli","light","cinematographi","seem","suggest","cinemat","wasnt","appear"

{"value":"I'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. Otherwise, it teems mainly with clichés and stereotypes: mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move around without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds over large distances. And so on and so forth.<br /><br />Throughout the movie I kept wondering what the point of the film was (other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church).<br /><br />The plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth. This was neither a story about growing up during the depression, nor about about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity. It tried to be all of those things and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory.<br /><br />Although the movie was supposed to be about Little Tree's education, we learn almost nothing about it. He was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried his hand at chopping wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); learned how to read (and maybe to write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently he didn't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic.<br /><br />However, grandma and grandpa and Graham Greene's character made sure that in the end Little Tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after, and I'm paraphrasing here, \"riding with the Navajos\" and \"getting caught up in a couple of wars\" - was to \"catch up\" with grandma and grandpa and Graham Greene's character in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense).<br /><br />Last but not least I must say that I found grandpa's trade offensive. Why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still? To counteract the stereotype of the \"drunken Indian\"?","finished_norm":["i","will","give","thi","movi","two","star","becaus","it","teem","with","beauti","photographi","otherwis","it","teem","mainli","with","cliché","and","stereotyp","mountain","peopl","be","either","dumb","white","trash","of","the","fanat","religi","or","rag","racist","kind","or","wise","white","indian","indian","be","magic","peopl","who","move","around","without","a","sound","can","disappear","in","the","blink","of","a","ey","talk","to","anim","and","read","mind","over","larg","distanc","and","so","on","and","so","forthbr","br","throughout","the","movi","i","keep","wonder","what","the","point","of","the","film","be","other","than","show","me","pretti","pictur","of","mountain","log","cabin","wood","a","assort","of","anim","freespirit","mountaindwel","and","freaki","peopl","in","churchbr","br","the","plot","touch","a","whole","rang","of","issu","but","explor","none","of","them","in","depth","thi","be","neither","a","stori","about","grow","up","dure","the","depress","nor","about","about","be","a","orphan","nor","about","a","struggl","for","ident","it","try","to","be","all","of","that","thing","and","much","which","make","it","superfici","and","unsatisfactorybr","br","although","the","movi","be","suppos","to","be","about","littl","tree","educ","we","learn","almost","noth","about","it","he","be","give","a","brief","summari","of","the","histori","of","hi","peopl","who","be","brave","and","stoic","and","a","distilleri","demonstr","try","hi","hand","at","chop","wood","at","which","he","fail","and","whiskei","run","liter","learn","how","to","read","and","mayb","to","write","with","the","help","of","grandma","and","her","dictionari","and","that","be","it","appar","he","do","not","learn","much","dure","hi","stint","in","board","school","becaus","he","be","lock","up","in","the","atticbr","br","howev","grandma","and","grandpa","and","graham","green","charact","make","sure","that","in","the","end","littl","tree","becom","a","veri","spiritu","person","whose","main","goal","a","a","adult","after","and","i","be","paraphras","here","ride","with","the","navajo","and","get","catch","up","in","a","coupl","of","war","be","to","catch","up","with","grandma","and","grandpa","and","graham","green","charact","in","heaven","instead","of","sai","date","girl","get","marri","have","child","or","other","such","nonsensebr","br","last","but","not","littl","i","must","sai","that","i","find","grandpa","trade","offens","why","of","all","thing","do","it","have","to","be","a","whiskei","still","to","counteract","the","stereotyp","of","the","drunken","indian"],"filtered":["give","thi","movi","two","star","becaus","teem","beauti","photographi","otherwis","teem","mainli","cliché","stereotyp","mountain","peopl","either","dumb","white","trash","fanat","religi","rag","racist","kind","wise","white","indian","indian","magic","peopl","move","around","without","sound","disappear","blink","ey","talk","anim","read","mind","larg","distanc","forthbr","br","throughout","movi","keep","wonder","point","film","show","pretti","pictur","mountain","log","cabin","wood","assort","anim","freespirit","mountaindwel","freaki","peopl","churchbr","br","plot","touch","whole","rang","issu","explor","none","depth","thi","neither","stori","grow","dure","depress","orphan","struggl","ident","try","thing","much","make","superfici","unsatisfactorybr","br","although","movi","suppos","littl","tree","educ","learn","almost","noth","give","brief","summari","histori","hi","peopl","brave","stoic","distilleri","demonstr","try","hi","hand","chop","wood","fail","whiskei","run","liter","learn","read","mayb","write","help","grandma","dictionari","appar","learn","much","dure","hi","stint","board","school","becaus","lock","atticbr","br","howev","grandma","grandpa","graham","green","charact","make","sure","end","littl","tree","becom","veri","spiritu","person","whose","main","goal","adult","paraphras","ride","navajo","get","catch","coupl","war","catch","grandma","grandpa","graham","green","charact","heaven","instead","sai","date","girl","get","marri","child","nonsensebr","br","last","littl","must","sai","find","grandpa","trade","offens","thing","whiskei","still","counteract","stereotyp","drunken","indian"],"filtered2":["give","two","star","becaus","teem","beauti","photographi","otherwis","teem","mainli","cliché","stereotyp","mountain","peopl","either","dumb","white","trash","fanat","religi","rag","racist","kind","wise","white","indian","indian","magic","peopl","move","around","without","sound","disappear","blink","ey","talk","anim","read","mind","larg","distanc","forthbr","throughout","keep","wonder","point","show","pretti","pictur","mountain","log","cabin","wood","assort","anim","freespirit","mountaindwel","freaki","peopl","churchbr","plot","touch","whole","rang","issu","explor","none","depth","neither","stori","grow","dure","depress","orphan","struggl","ident","try","thing","make","superfici","unsatisfactorybr","although","suppos","littl","tree","educ","learn","almost","

{"value":"This British pot-boiler has one thing going for it: the young men are uniformly good looking. The older men are opinionated, right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan/Thatcher years. Young or old, however, morals in this three-part mini-series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well.<br /><br />Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford. It is not pivotal to the story, but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician, and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France. They neglect to inform him that, when upset, Cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements. Nick mistakes their self-serving 'gratitude' for affection and moves in, finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years but, as the plot depends on this point, it's best not to question it.<br /><br />While Nick is most pleasing to look at, he is unbearably obsequious. His coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls. Deeply closeted except to Cat (she guesses his big secret on sight), he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay. Though it hardly seems possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he.<br /><br />Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, in true Tory fashion, has become involved in several personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy.<br /><br />Except for one brief moment of indignation, Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement. Denial, self-loathing, naiveté, or ignorance? You decide, if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the

{"value":"Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was \"the only film (he) did purely for the money\" as well as \"the worst film he ever starred in\". Hold on, Michael, weren't you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And weren't both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (the director, Richard Fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sun-stroke during the shoot). What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low-point of Michael Caine. Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline.<br /><br />Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a W.H.O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village. Linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and he sets off on a continent-wide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East.<br /><br />Along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest. The film is based on a best-seller entitled Ebano, by the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver (he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances), and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again. There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow-moving. All in all, it is a resistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let-down from all the talent involved.","finished_norm":["michael","cain","have","alwai","claim","that","ashanti","be","the","onli","film","he","do","pure","for","the","monei","a","good","a","the","wrong","film","he","ever","star","in","hold","on","michael","be","not","you","in","the","swarm","and","hurri","sundown","and","be","not","both","of","that","film","a","good","deal","wrong","than","ashanti","perhap","cain","rememb","onli","too","begrudgingli","the","physic","punish","demand","of","film","a","action","film","in","sear","degre","fahrenheit","temperatur","the","director","richard","fleischer","be","hospitalis","a","a","result","of","sunstrok","dure","the","shoot","what","ashanti","actual","emerg","a","be","not","the","career","lowpoint","of","michael","cain","instead","it","be","a","veri","averag","chase","thriller","with","a","talent","cast","exot","locat","bore","stretch","and","a","highli","formula","storylinebr","br","dr","david","linderbi","cain","be","a","who","medic","who","be","leav","devast","when","hi","black","wife","anansa","beverli","johnson","go","miss","dure","a","aid","trip","to","a","african","tribal","villag","linderbi","gradual","realis","that","hi","wife","have","be","snatch","by","slave","trader","lead","by","suleiman","peter","ustinov","and","he","set","off","on","a","continentwid","pursuit","which","eventu","lead","to","the","middl","eastbr","br","along","the","wai","big","star","pop","in","for","ineffect","and","superflu","guest","role","william","holden","have","a","poor","cameo","a","a","chopper","pilot","omar","sharif","displai","littl","of","hi","customari","charm","or","grace","a","a","pamper","arab","millionair","rex","harrison","look","rightfulli","bore","dure","hi","brief","role","a","a","help","contact","who","assist","cain","in","hi","quest","the","film","be","base","on","a","bestsel","entitl","ebano","by","the","littleknown","author","alberto","vasquezfigueroa","but","the","suspens","that","make","the","book","so","popular","be","larg","absent","in","thi","adapt","ustinov","be","charismat","a","the","slaver","he","seem","in","all","hi","movi","to","be","incap","of","give","bad","perform","and","cain","gener","believ","anguish","a","the","man","who","think","he","will","never","see","hi","wife","again","there","be","occasion","flash","of","action","but","on","the","whole","ashanti","be","quit","slowmov","all","in","all","it","be","a","resist","piec","of","action","hokum","not","by","ani","stretch","a","aw","a","cain","have","frequent","suggest","but","not","a","veri","inspir","film","and","certainli","a","letdown","from","all","the","talent","involv"],"filtered":["michael","cain","alwai","claim","ashanti","onli","film","pure","monei","good","wrong","film","ever","star","hold","michael","swarm","hurri","sundown","film","good","deal","wrong","ashanti","perhap","cain","rememb","onli","begrudgingli","physic","punish","demand","film","action","film","sear","degre","fahrenheit","temperatur","director","richard","fleischer","hospitalis","result","sunstrok","dure","shoot","ashanti","actual","emerg","career","lowpoint","michael","cain","instead","veri","averag","chase","thriller","talent","cast","exot","locat","bore","stretch","highli","formula","storylinebr","br","dr","david","linderbi","cain","medic","leav","devast","hi","black","wife","anansa","beverli","johnson","go","miss","dure","aid","trip","african","tribal","villag","linderbi","gradual","realis","hi","wife","snatch","slave","trader","lead","suleiman","peter","ustinov","set","continentwid","pursuit","eventu","lead","middl","eastbr","br","along","wai","big","star","pop","ineffect","superflu","guest","role","william","holden","poor","cameo","chopper","pilot","omar","sharif","displai","littl","hi","customari","charm","grace","pamper","arab","millionair","rex","harrison","look","rightfulli","bore","dure","hi","brief","role","help","contact","assist","cain","hi","quest","film","base","bestsel","entitl","ebano","littleknown","author","alberto","vasquezfigueroa","suspens","make","book","popular","larg","absent","thi","adapt","ustinov","charismat","slaver","seem","hi","movi","incap","give","bad","perform","cain","gener","believ","anguish","man","think","never","see","hi","wife","occasion","flash","action","whole","ashanti","quit","slowmov","resist","piec","action","hokum","ani","stretch","aw","cain","frequent","suggest","veri","inspir","film","certainli","letdown","talent","involv"],"filtered2":["michael","cain","alwai","claim","ashanti","onli","pure","monei","good","wrong","ever","star","hold","michael","swarm","hurri","sundown","good","deal","wrong","ashanti","perhap","cain","rememb","onli","begrudgingli","physic","punish","demand","action","sear","degre","fahrenheit","temperatur","director","richard","fleischer","hospitalis","result","sunstrok","dure","shoot","ashanti","actual","emerg","career","lowpoint","michael","cain","instead","veri","averag","chase","thriller","talent","cast","exot","locat","bore","stretch","highli","formula","storylinebr","dr",

{"value":"Man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds. But with new worlds come ancient evils... the vampires of space. And not just a handful but entire tribes. In this film (which I saw as \"Bloodsuckers\" but I guess also goes as \"Vampires Wars\") we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires.<br /><br />I will make this review very short because it's undeserving of a good review. The best I can say for this film is it has a good cast of b-list and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana, and was far more attractive here than in \"Bloodrayne 2\". Michael Ironside is Muco, and is always a fan favorite (as I say, he's the poor man's Jack Nicholson). And we even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as \"Damian's wife\", who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argento's \"Jenifer\". So this movie, as bad as it is, isn't without some names attached... but the same can be said of Uwe Boll's work.<br /><br />The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea, but it easily falls into the realm of \"cheese\" and this film falls hard. The acting, especially from the vampires, is over the top and I just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing. Worst of all, the vampire tribes have the names \"Voorhess\" and \"Leatherfaces\". I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans, but it wasn't clever at all. It just sounded dumb and out of place (unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunn's \"Slither\", such as naming stores after lesser-known horror directors).<br /><br />That's all I want to say. If you can stand lots of cheese (on this day I couldn't and I'm from Wisconsin) and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space (although \"space\" looks a lot like any other forest on earth) check this one out, if you can find it. I don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films (Jon Carpenter's \"Vampires\") or other cheesy space movies. Or maybe even some good ones. But, hey, do your thing.","finished_norm":["man","have","be","to","the","far","reach","of","the","earth","and","now","he","be","travel","to","new","world","but","with","new","world","come","ancient","evil","the","vampir","of","space","and","not","just","a","hand","but","entir","tribe","in","thi","film","which","i","see","a","bloodsuck","but","i","guess","conjur","go","a","vampir","war","we","see","what","happen","when","the","imperialist","earthl","meet","the","imperialist","vampiresbr","br","i","will","make","thi","review","veri","short","becaus","it","undeserv","of","a","good","review","the","well","i","can","sai","for","thi","film","be","it","have","a","good","cast","of","blist","and","upcom","star","natassia","malth","be","quintana","and","be","far","much","attract","here","than","in","bloodrayn","michael","ironsid","be","muco","and","be","alwai","a","fan","favorit","a","i","sai","he","the","poor","man","jack","nicholson","and","we","even","get","carrieann","fleme","a","damian","wife","who","horror","fan","will","now","recogn","a","the","eponym","jenif","from","dario","argento","jenif","so","thi","movi","a","bad","a","it","be","be","not","without","some","name","attach","but","the","same","can","be","sai","of","uw","boll","workbr","br","the","concept","of","the","militari","track","and","kill","vampir","in","space","be","not","necessarili","a","bad","idea","but","it","easili","fall","into","the","realm","of","chees","and","thi","film","fall","hard","the","act","especi","from","the","vampir","be","over","the","top","and","i","just","do","not","find","the","explan","of","their","exist","veri","convinc","wrong","of","all","the","vampir","tribe","have","the","name","voorhess","and","leatherfac","i","understand","thi","be","suppos","to","be","a","clever","refer","for","the","horror","fan","but","it","be","not","clever","at","all","it","just","sound","dumb","and","out","of","place","unlik","the","much","much","subtl","refer","in","jame","gunn","slither","such","a","name","store","after","lesserknown","horror","directorsbr","br","that","all","i","want","to","sai","if","you","can","stand","lot","of","chees","on","thi","dai","i","can","not","and","i","be","from","wisconsin","and","want","to","see","averag","actor","with","poor","costum","fight","vampir","in","space","although","space","look","a","lot","like","ani","other","forest","on","earth","check","thi","on","out","if","you","can","find","it","i","do","not","person","recommend","thi","when","you","can","watch","other","cheesi","vampir","film","jon","carpent","vampir","or","other","cheesi","space","movi","or","mayb","even","some","good","on","but","hei","do","your","thing"],"filtered":["man","far","reach","earth","travel","new","world","new","world","come","ancient","evil","vampir","space","hand","entir","tribe","thi","film","see","bloodsuck","guess","conjur","go","vampir","war","see","happen","imperialist","earthl","meet","imperialist","vampiresbr","br","make","thi","review","veri","short","becaus","undeserv","good","review","well","sai","thi","film","good","cast","blist","upcom","star","natassia","malth","quintana","far","much","attract","bloodrayn","michael","ironsid","muco","alwai","fan","favorit","sai","poor","man","jack","nicholson","even","get","carrieann","fleme","damian","wife","horror","fan","recogn","eponym","jenif","dario","argento","jenif","thi","movi","bad","without","name","attach","sai","uw","boll","workbr","br","concept","militari","track","kill","vampir","space","necessarili","bad","idea","easili","fall","realm","chees","thi","film","fall","hard","act","especi","vampir","top","find","explan","exist","veri","convinc","wrong","vampir","tribe","name","voorhess","leatherfac","understand","thi","suppos","clever","refer","horror","fan","clever","sound","dumb","place","unlik","much","much","subtl","refer","jame","gunn","slither","name","store","lesserknown","horror","directorsbr","br","want","sai","stand","lot","chees","thi","dai","wisconsin","want","see","averag","actor","poor","costum","fight","vampir","space","although","space","look","lot","like","ani","forest","earth","check","thi","find","person","recommend","thi","watch","cheesi","vampir","film","jon","carpent","vampir","cheesi","space","movi","mayb","even","good","hei","thing"],"filtered2":["man","far","reach","earth","travel","new","world","new","world","come","ancient","evil","vampir","space","hand","entir","tribe","see","bloodsuck","guess","conjur","go","vampir","war","see","happen","imperialist","earthl","meet","imperialist","vampiresbr","make","review","veri","short","becaus","undeserv","good","review","well","good","cast","blist","upcom","star","natassia","malth","quintana","far","attract","bloodrayn","michael","ironsid","muco","alwai","fan","favorit","poor","man","jack","nicholson","even","get","carrieann","fleme","damian","wife","horror","fan","recogn","eponym","jenif","dario","argento","jenif","bad","without","name","attach","uw","boll","workbr","concept","militari","track","kill","vampir","space","

{"value":"This movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what NOT to do. The original kicked some major tire squealing butt, this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of Bruckheimer films, which is: we all know they suck, but they have great action. This film has NO ACTION. This film is BORING. Where are the cars? Where are the chases? Where's the tension? Where's the suspense? Where's the rush? Where!!?? This isn't really a movie at all, it's a bad commercial. 50 cars in 24 hours? That is wrong. They have 3 days to steal them, the ad is wrong. How bad is that? The leads acting is stiff, wooden and forced. The villain, the cop, the others...who cares. They utter their pointless lines, they serve the illogical plot. They slog through it the best they can as the music video director says \"don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is\" or \"we'll fix it with lots of loud music\" The \"script\" isn't really a script at all, it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of: -------Warning - possible spoiler------ 5------4-----3-----2-----1------ The Fugitive. The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction. And what do they do!? They make him a mute who's hardly in the film! Make Vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film. How could they have been so dumb? How? How? Why? The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away. The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers! Go find the original. Or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN. The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged. Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $250,000? How can that be? You feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie. Where I was once excited to see Coyote Ugly, Remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor, now I say: God help us all. <br /><br

{"value":"I don't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions. I tolerated the first season.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who aren't really lawyers. God forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows, which I had heard was the case when I watched some interviews of the show. It just made me gag a bit.<br /><br />That aside, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. While this might be a compliment in some situations, it's certainly not here. Their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first. But since that's what they're doing literally all the time, I've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. Trying to intersperse some serious, dramatic, and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest I've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show.<br /><br />Alan Shore's flamboyant and gratuitous \"public service announcements\" where he spouts off his opinions do not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for Crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit.<br /><br />I'm giving two stars because there are moments where I thought the show's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care.<br /><br />I think the show's writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by Denny and Alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start. The thing is, I don't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well, but I just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more. I'm not a teenager anymore, and I think this show is promising if its goal wasn't to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings.<br /><br />Of course, I'm writing this after I realized that it's really not gonna get much better than this. It's a shame because it's one of those shows I'd love to love.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","think","thi","be","too","bad","of","a","show","under","the","right","condit","i","toler","the","seasonbr","br","unfortun","thi","be","a","show","about","lawyer","who","be","not","realli","lawyer","god","forbid","anybodi","actual","go","to","law","school","base","on","thi","show","which","i","have","hear","be","the","case","when","i","watch","some","interview","of","the","show","it","just","make","me","gag","a","bitbr","br","that","asid","spader","and","shatner","who","be","suppos","to","be","the","star","of","the","show","be","the","much","annoi","while","thi","mai","be","a","complim","in","some","situat","it","certainli","not","here","their","constantli","harass","the","woman","on","the","show","be","funni","at","but","sinc","that","what","thei","re","do","liter","all","the","time","i","have","realiz","that","thi","be","a","deep","a","the","show","be","go","to","get","try","to","interspers","some","seriou","dramat","and","even","tearjerk","moment","in","the","middl","of","thi","mockeri","of","a","real","show","fail","to","compens","for","the","progress","loss","of","interest","i","have","be","experi","try","to","enjoi","the","showbr","br","alan","shore","flamboy","and","gratuit","public","servic","announc","where","he","spout","off","hi","opinion","do","not","impress","denni","crane","be","just","annoi","i","be","embarrass","for","him","and","for","the","writer","of","the","show","for","crane","speech","wear","a","coloni","outfitbr","br","i","be","give","two","star","becaus","there","be","moment","where","i","think","the","show","attempt","to","deal","with","some","contemporari","issu","be","do","with","carebr","br","i","think","the","show","writer","becom","awar","that","the","sexual","harass","displai","by","denni","and","alan","be","get","overbear","even","to","that","who","be","much","invit","of","them","from","the","start","the","thing","be","i","do","not","care","if","the","sexual","harass","treatment","in","the","show","be","do","good","but","i","just","feel","that","the","writer","be","insult","me","with","artifici","implant","sexual","banter","all","over","the","show","in","the","hope","that","my","libido","will","keep","me","come","back","for","much","i","be","not","a","teenag","anymor","and","i","think","thi","show","be","promis","if","it","goal","be","not","to","cater","to","the","low","common","denomin","to","get","ratingsbr","br","of","cours","i","be","write","thi","after","i","realiz","that","it","realli","not","gonna","get","much","well","than","thi","it","a","shame","becaus","it","on","of","that","show","i","have","love","to","love"],"filtered":["think","thi","bad","show","right","condit","toler","seasonbr","br","unfortun","thi","show","lawyer","realli","lawyer","god","forbid","anybodi","actual","go","law","school","base","thi","show","hear","case","watch","interview","show","make","gag","bitbr","br","asid","spader","shatner","suppos","star","show","much","annoi","thi","mai","complim","situat","certainli","constantli","harass","woman","show","funni","sinc","thei","re","liter","time","realiz","thi","deep","show","go","get","try","interspers","seriou","dramat","even","tearjerk","moment","middl","thi","mockeri","real","show","fail","compens","progress","loss","interest","experi","try","enjoi","showbr","br","alan","shore","flamboy","gratuit","public","servic","announc","spout","hi","opinion","impress","denni","crane","annoi","embarrass","writer","show","crane","speech","wear","coloni","outfitbr","br","give","two","star","becaus","moment","think","show","attempt","deal","contemporari","issu","carebr","br","think","show","writer","becom","awar","sexual","harass","displai","denni","alan","get","overbear","even","much","invit","start","thing","care","sexual","harass","treatment","show","good","feel","writer","insult","artifici","implant","sexual","banter","show","hope","libido","keep","come","back","much","teenag","anymor","think","thi","show","promis","goal","cater","low","common","denomin","get","ratingsbr","br","cours","write","thi","realiz","realli","gonna","get","much","well","thi","shame","becaus","show","love","love"],"filtered2":["think","bad","show","right","condit","toler","seasonbr","unfortun","show","lawyer","realli","lawyer","god","forbid","anybodi","actual","go","law","school","base","show","hear","case","watch","interview","show","make","gag","bitbr","asid","spader","shatner","suppos","star","show","annoi","mai","complim","situat","certainli","constantli","harass","woman","show","funni","sinc","re","liter","time","realiz","deep","show","go","get","try","interspers","seriou","dramat","even","tearjerk","moment","middl","mockeri","real","show","fail","compens","progress","loss","interest","experi","try","enjoi","showbr","alan","shore","flamboy","gratuit","public","servic","announc","spout","opinion","impress","denni","crane","annoi","embarrass","writer","show","crane","speech","wear","coloni","outfitbr","give","two","star","becaus","moment","thin

{"value":"I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day. The quick summary of this movie is MUST AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of the attempt by Pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of Kashmir from India. Supposedly based on fact, you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area from the Pakistani troops - who occupied the high ground. But instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story, all this movie does is make the Indian military look laughable and stupid, which I know is not true.<br /><br />I watched this movie with an almost completely Indian audience, who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but also found themselves laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be funny.<br /><br />The script was absolutely abysmal. It gave the impression that Mr Dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference. The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive.<br /><br />The acting from most of the principals was not stellar, but considering the script they were given, I find it hard to criticise them too much. As for the supporting cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs.<br /><br />The editing was also pretty bad. It was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time, and music would abruptly end at scene changes.<br /><br />Good things: The cinematography was pretty good, although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour corrected (the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes). Also, the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable - for the first half a dozen or so verses at least. Unfortunately they went on a LOT longer than they should have.<br /><br />And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG. There is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 - 2 hour movie out of what was shot. Sadly, a good editor was not working on this

{"value":"This film can be judged from three viewpoints: as history, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /><br />It fails as history, it mentions in passing the coup that threw out Obote, the expulsion of the Asians, and has the Entebbe hi-jack as background, but not in any chronologically consistent time frame. <br /><br />As a profile of Amin it may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this was a better film, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - which proves the Oscar voters don't watch the films they vote on.) It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the point of view of the doctor. It tells instead the fictitious story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin. But the story told is the one incident that Amin was probably innocent of. <br /><br />As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to hold it together. The beginning is taut - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel, but sets up the story. The character of the doctor is well-defined, but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result.<br /><br />Why the doctor decides to stay in Kampala is badly explained - seduced by power? Why he befriends no-one is strange. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable, but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of Amin close at hand. The Man called Horse bit at the end is risible. <br /><br />Finally in 1971, Uganda drove on the left, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the Equator tusks?! <br /><br />In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting, but the last hour will bore you to confusion.

{"value":"This film is a Pia Zadora special! When viewing it, I was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a Hollywood starlet; in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for 'B' movie or soft porn roles; who says at her casting session \"Well of course I do not normally do roles requiring nudity, but if it is artistically necessary for the film...............\". This recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing Pia at such a session saying \"Well of course I do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting, but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol..................\". This is probably grossly unfair, the rather sordid tale is the fault of Harold Robbins book; considering the nature of the story Pia's exposures certainly do not receive undue attention, and perhaps Pia (who once won an acting award in Butterfly) is deliberately satirising her part rather than attempting to act in an almost unplayable role. Critics usually point first to the actors as the problem whenever a film proves disappointing, but this is grossly unfair; the scriptwriters and director are far more often the guilty parties. The real problem with \"The Lonely Lady\" is that the screenplay, like the original book, looks for sensation rather than substance, and nothing can help with this. <br /><br />\tThe screenplay for this film is abysmal, but whether the story could have been filmed more successfully with a better script, tauter directing and really competent acting must remain a matter of personal judgement. As it was released, my viewers rating for it would depend upon whether I am assessing my personal opinion, or assessing to what extent the film succeeds in providing what it aims at doing. My personal rating for it would be two out of ten; but to some extent this film probably provides exactly what its sponsors intended, and judged on this basis a quality rating of four out of ten would be reasonable. Being in a charitable mood, and wanting to make it clear that I am not blaming Pia for my disappointment, I will give an IMDb rating of four.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","a","pia","zadora","special","when","view","it","i","be","remind","of","the","classic","cartoon","show","a","hollywood","starlet","in","urgent","ne","of","anoth","role","but","afraid","of","becom","typecast","for","b","movi","or","soft","porn","role","who","sai","at","her","cast","session","good","of","cours","i","do","not","normal","do","role","requir","nuditi","but","if","it","be","artist","necessari","for","the","film","thi","recollect","bring","up","a","veri","naughti","imag","of","a","similar","cartoon","show","pia","at","such","a","session","sai","good","of","cours","i","do","not","normal","take","ani","role","requir","actual","act","but","if","it","will","realli","give","me","suffici","exposur","to","enhanc","my","statu","a","a","sex","symbol","thi","be","probabl","grossli","unfair","the","rather","sordid","tale","be","the","fault","of","harold","robbin","book","consid","the","natur","of","the","stori","pia","exposur","certainli","do","not","receiv","undu","attent","and","perhap","pia","who","onc","win","a","act","award","in","butterfli","be","deliber","satiris","her","part","rather","than","attempt","to","act","in","a","almost","unplay","role","critic","usual","point","to","the","actor","a","the","problem","whenev","a","film","prove","disappoint","but","thi","be","grossli","unfair","the","scriptwrit","and","director","be","far","much","often","the","guilti","parti","the","real","problem","with","the","lone","ladi","be","that","the","screenplai","like","the","origin","book","look","for","sensat","rather","than","substanc","and","noth","can","help","with","thi","br","br","the","screenplai","for","thi","film","be","abysm","but","whether","the","stori","can","have","be","film","much","successfulli","with","a","well","script","taut","direct","and","realli","compet","act","must","remain","a","matt","of","person","judgem","a","it","be","releas","my","viewer","rate","for","it","would","depend","upon","whether","i","be","assess","my","person","opinion","or","assess","to","what","extent","the","film","succ","in","provid","what","it","aim","at","do","my","person","rate","for","it","would","be","two","out","of","ten","but","to","some","extent","thi","film","probabl","provid","exactli","what","it","sponsor","intend","and","judg","on","thi","basi","a","qualiti","rate","of","four","out","of","ten","would","be","reason","be","in","a","charit","mood","and","want","to","make","it","clear","that","i","be","not","blame","pia","for","my","disappoint","i","will","give","a","imdb","rate","of","four"],"filtered":["thi","film","pia","zadora","special","view","remind","classic","cartoon","show","hollywood","starlet","urgent","ne","anoth","role","afraid","becom","typecast","b","movi","soft","porn","role","sai","cast","session","good","cours","normal","role","requir","nuditi","artist","necessari","film","thi","recollect","bring","veri","naughti","imag","similar","cartoon","show","pia","session","sai","good","cours","normal","take","ani","role","requir","actual","act","realli","give","suffici","exposur","enhanc","statu","sex","symbol","thi","probabl","grossli","unfair","rather","sordid","tale","fault","harold","robbin","book","consid","natur","stori","pia","exposur","certainli","receiv","undu","attent","perhap","pia","onc","win","act","award","butterfli","deliber","satiris","part","rather","attempt","act","almost","unplay","role","critic","usual","point","actor","problem","whenev","film","prove","disappoint","thi","grossli","unfair","scriptwrit","director","far","much","often","guilti","parti","real","problem","lone","ladi","screenplai","like","origin","book","look","sensat","rather","substanc","noth","help","thi","br","br","screenplai","thi","film","abysm","whether","stori","film","much","successfulli","well","script","taut","direct","realli","compet","act","must","remain","matt","person","judgem","releas","viewer","rate","depend","upon","whether","assess","person","opinion","assess","extent","film","succ","provid","aim","person","rate","two","ten","extent","thi","film","probabl","provid","exactli","sponsor","intend","judg","thi","basi","qualiti","rate","four","ten","reason","charit","mood","want","make","clear","blame","pia","disappoint","give","imdb","rate","four"],"filtered2":["pia","zadora","special","view","remind","classic","cartoon","show","hollywood","starlet","urgent","ne","anoth","role","afraid","becom","typecast","b","soft","porn","role","cast","session","good","cours","normal","role","requir","nuditi","artist","necessari","recollect","bring","veri","naughti","imag","similar","cartoon","show","pia","session","good","cours","normal","take","ani","role","requir","actual","act","realli","give","suffici","exposur","enhanc","statu","sex","symbol","probabl","grossli","unfair","rather","sordid","tale","fault","harold","robbin","book","consid","natur","stori","pia","exposur","certainli","receiv","undu","attent","perhap","pia","onc","win","act","award","butterfli","deliber","satiris"

{"value":"Billed as a kind of sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is a fake.<br /><br />As someone born in Sheffield, and still with links to the city, I was extremely disappointed by this film. Someone said it could have been set in Oklahoma, and that just about sums it up for me. This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the US market. Probably many Americans - and many southern English people - don't realize that Sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. In Among Giants it was depicted as some dreary dead-end semi-rural small town, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the people's idea of a party was line-dancing in some village-hall lookalike. This was a small close-knit community, not a metropolitan city.<br /><br />The working-class Sheffield men were totally unlike their real-life counterparts, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks. They don't chatter, and they certainly don't sing in choirs.<br /><br />Even the rural settings, supposedly in the Peak District, looked alien to me. I recognized a few places where I used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end I spotted a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The Peak District is, in the summer, crawling with walkers and tourists in cars. It is situated between two big cities. It is not some kind of wilderness.<br /><br />As for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with, and lust after, Pete Postlethwaite, that was ludicrous, and could only have been a male dream. Her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent.

{"value":"Far from providing the caffeine kick you'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy-boosting of warm beverages, Coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale. Indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee, it'd be rather weak and watery, littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste. Sporadically it hits the spot, but otherwise it isn't the hot action-drama it hopes to be.<br /><br />Plot-wise, Coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug-pushing, lady-pimpin', mob-suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved, sick state. Socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in America is prominent in Coffy, and it makes for some thought-provoking stuff as Coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted Afro-American minorities. Sadly, the timely messages are undermined by the film's poor quality and lack of focus. Coffy's ideas are important, it's just that they are not well-aimed.<br /><br />One of the plus points of Coffy is the presence of Blaxploitation icon Pam Grier. Grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence (how do you deal with a house full of hoods? Drive the car right through the front door!). It's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions, wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible. The low budget can't have helped, but neither does the fact that for a Blaxploitation flick, Coffy lacks groove. Just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality, consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection.<br /><br />The total result is workmanlike and wooden. We get a hip heroine but not a hip movie. It's a shame as Coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the Blaxploitation craze; it just never ascends above being an average, lukewarm

{"value":"Emma is my favourite Jane Austen novel - Emma is well-meaning despite her flaws, so readers can forgive and love her, and the relationship she has with Mr Knightley, which is warm, familiar, respectful but playful, generating that warm, fuzzy, romantic excitement. Mr Knightley is the perfect man, and Emma is as close as you could get in those times to an independent, clever, confident woman - remember, she is only 21, and was sure to have matured and grown out of her flaws. Who doesn't want to be Emma? Who doesn't want to be told off by Mr Knightley? This version of Emma gives you no sense of the things that I love about Emma. I couldn't even finish watching it, I just found it so awful. I couldn't see that warm, generous side of Emma, which drives the reader to love her: The patience and warmth she shows to her father; the closeness between her and Mrs Weston, which demonstrates her willingness to put her friend's happiness above her own (as she sacrifices the only equal companion in her household by forwarding Miss Taylors marriage). Mr Woodhouse's character in this adaptation just appears bizarre, rather than just quaint, elderly and a bit trying.<br /><br />This adaptation most importantly fails bring to life the relationship between Mr Knightley and Emma. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and affection: Mr Knightley is indulgent of Emma's minor faults trusting that her intelligence and genuine care for others will never allow her to go terribly astray; and Emma looks up to him, though playfully hiding this and continuing to use her own judgement. The dressing down he gives her right at the beginning of the show completely overstates the argument between them, and ruins all possibility of portraying the nature of their relationship as I've described above. Mr Knightley is also insufficiently attractive to bring to life the sexual tension between the leads (or to inspire any admiration from the female viewers).<br /><br />Really horrible. I can't understand why anyone who truly like the novel Emma could like it, unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point I switched it off.","finished_norm":["emma","be","my","favourit","jane","austen","novel","emma","be","wellmean","despit","her","flaw","so","reader","can","forgiv","and","love","her","and","the","relationship","she","have","with","mr","knightlei","which","be","warm","familiar","respect","but","play","gener","that","warm","fuzzi","romant","excit","mr","knightlei","be","the","perfect","man","and","emma","be","a","close","a","you","can","get","in","that","time","to","a","independ","clever","confid","woman","rememb","she","be","onli","and","be","sure","to","have","matur","and","grow","out","of","her","flaw","who","doe","not","want","to","be","emma","who","doe","not","want","to","be","tell","off","by","mr","knightlei","thi","version","of","emma","give","you","no","sens","of","the","thing","that","i","love","about","emma","i","can","not","even","finish","watch","it","i","just","find","it","so","aw","i","can","not","see","that","warm","gener","side","of","emma","which","drive","the","reader","to","love","her","the","patienc","and","warmth","she","show","to","her","father","the","close","between","her","and","mr","weston","which","demonstr","her","willing","to","put","her","friend","happi","abov","her","own","a","she","sacrific","the","onli","equal","companion","in","her","household","by","forward","miss","taylor","marriag","mr","woodhous","charact","in","thi","adapt","just","appear","bizarr","rather","than","just","quaint","elderli","and","a","bite","tryingbr","br","thi","adapt","much","importantli","fail","bring","to","life","the","relationship","between","mr","knightlei","and","emma","their","relationship","be","build","on","mutual","respect","and","affect","mr","knightlei","be","indulg","of","emma","minor","fault","trust","that","her","intellig","and","genuin","care","for","other","will","never","allow","her","to","go","terribli","astrai","and","emma","look","up","to","him","though","playfulli","hide","thi","and","continu","to","us","her","own","judgem","the","dress","down","he","give","her","right","at","the","begin","of","the","show","complet","overst","the","argum","between","them","and","ruin","all","possibl","of","portrai","the","natur","of","their","relationship","a","i","have","describ","abov","mr","knightlei","be","conjur","insuffici","attract","to","bring","to","life","the","sexual","tension","between","the","lead","or","to","inspir","ani","admir","from","the","femal","viewersbr","br","realli","horribl","i","ca","not","understand","why","anyon","who","truli","like","the","novel","emma","can","like","it","unless","it","miracul","redeem","itself","after","the","point","i","switch","it","off"],"filtered":["emma","favourit","jane","austen","novel","emma","wellmean","despit","flaw","reader","forgiv","love","relationship","mr","knightlei","warm","familiar","respect","play","gener","warm","fuzzi","romant","excit","mr","knightlei","perfect","man","emma","close","get","time","independ","clever","confid","woman","rememb","onli","sure","matur","grow","flaw","doe","want","emma","doe","want","tell","mr","knightlei","thi","version","emma","give","sens","thing","love","emma","even","finish","watch","find","aw","see","warm","gener","side","emma","drive","reader","love","patienc","warmth","show","father","close","mr","weston","demonstr","willing","put","friend","happi","abov","sacrific","onli","equal","companion","household","forward","miss","taylor","marriag","mr","woodhous","charact","thi","adapt","appear","bizarr","rather","quaint","elderli","bite","tryingbr","br","thi","adapt","much","importantli","fail","bring","life","relationship","mr","knightlei","emma","relationship","build","mutual","respect","affect","mr","knightlei","indulg","emma","minor","fault","trust","intellig","genuin","care","never","allow","go","terribli","astrai","emma","look","though","playfulli","hide","thi","continu","us","judgem","dress","give","right","begin","show","complet","overst","argum","ruin","possibl","portrai","natur","relationship","describ","abov","mr","knightlei","conjur","insuffici","attract","bring","life","sexual","tension","lead","inspir","ani","admir","femal","viewersbr","br","realli","horribl","ca","understand","anyon","truli","like","novel","emma","like","unless","miracul","redeem","point","switch"],"filtered2":["emma","favourit","jane","austen","novel","emma","wellmean","despit","flaw","reader","forgiv","love","relationship","mr","knightlei","warm","familiar","respect","play","gener","warm","fuzzi","romant","excit","mr","knightlei","perfect","man","emma","close","get","time","independ","clever","confid","woman","rememb","onli","sure","matur","grow","flaw","doe","want","emma","doe","want","tell","mr","knightlei","version","emma","give","sens","thing","love","emma","even","finish","watch","find","aw","see","warm","gener","side","emma","drive","reader","love","patienc","warmth","show","father","close","mr","weston","demonstr","willing","put","friend","happi","abov","sacrific","onli","equal","companion","household","forward","miss","taylor","

{"value":"Who could possibly have wished for a sequel to Bert I. Gordon's legendary bad trash-film \"Food of the Gods\"? Nobody, of course, but director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea, anyway, and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history. \"Gnaw\" is a sequel in name only, as the setting moved to a typical late 80's location (a university campus) and also the cheap & cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80's. This script hangs together by clichés, awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other (and more successful) horror classics. Neil Hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing-experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor. Due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists, the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus. Following the good old tradition that Spielberg's \"Jaws\" started, there's an obnoxious Dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere. During a hysterically grotesque climax, the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus' new sport complex! \"Gnaw: Food of the Gods 2\" is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch! The characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff (like descending into the sewers unarmed while they KNOW it's infested with rats), the acting is atrocious and there's a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth-serum! I wonder what Freud's theory would be on that! There's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric. In case you just can't get enough of this junk, there are quite a lot of creature-features revolving on mutated rats, like the Italian schlock film \"Rats: Night of Terror\", the modest 70's cult film \"Willard\" and its lame sequel \"Ben\", the 2003 \"Willard\" remake starring Crispin Glover and the surprisingly good recent rat-movies by once-famous directors Tibor Ticaks (\"Rats\") and John Lafia (\"The Rats\").

{"value":"This is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director Honda (with more evidently elaborate sets)  though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them (witness the giant bats and rodents on display). It also utilizes a surprising number of American actors: Joseph Cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill-at-ease and frail (but, then, his character is supposed to be 204 years old!), an innocuous Richard Jaeckel is the photographer hero while, as chief villains, we get Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina (both essentially campy). As I've often said, I grew up watching English-language films dubbed in Italianbut hearing Hollywood actors in Japanese is another thing entirely! <br /><br />LATITUDE ZERO feels like a juvenile version of a typical Jules Verne adventure, and is fairly entertaining on that level; indeed, it's preferable to Honda's low-brow variations on the monsters-on-the-rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set-up in this case. The plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by Romero  he was intended to establish himself in the underwater, technologically advanced city devised by Cotten (to which the world's foremost minds are being recruited). We're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs, but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on Romero's cave  in fact, Cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits (via flames and laser emitted from his glove!) must surely count as the nadir of his acting career; the other elder in the cast, Romero, is more in his element  after all, he had been The Joker in the BATMAN TV series and movie of the 1960s! Cotten has a scantily-clad blonde physician on his team, and is assisted by a hulking Asian; Romero, on the other hand, is flanked by an Oriental femme fatale  who, however, ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts (the girl's brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condorwhich is among the phoniest-looking creatures you ever saw!). Apparently, a 2-disc set of this one from Media Blasters streets on this very

{"value":"I look around in the video store still in shock how Steven Seagal with his track record of Bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a Year.Attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the Sci Fi Genre for our ever widening Seagal.Visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes.Sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come.<br /><br />Seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the Trashy-but enjoyable Shadow Man last time we saw him.However Attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever!Don't argue for out for a Kill,Ticker,or even Black Dawn folks.This is the bottom of the Septic tank here.<br /><br />Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word Taste. <br /><br />Seagal is yet another agent/I'm a supreme bad-ass yet again named Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his Team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public.Not to mention the dealers are not from around here.<br /><br />The whole Production from Directing to the acting is poor.Was this movie shot in the Dark?Its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since Howling 2.The action is terrible and very badly done.<br /><br />The Producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most:throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed Steven Seagal.Who seems to show little enthusiasm here.Can ya blame him?<br /><br />While it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie signed on for(originally Harvester)and surely has to be better than Attack force.The post-production tampering has not made it more coherent and made Seagal look worse.I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill-advised production re-shoots.<br /><br />So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess.But after seeing how bad Attack Force has turned out do we really want him to make another

{"value":"Well, at least my theater group did, lol. So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that's why I decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them up and just laughed. First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. Tell me, how did the Pink Ladies and T-Birds continue years on after the former gangs left? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T-Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.<br /><br />Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. But when a new student who is Sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, Stephanie. But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T-Birds, so the new student, decides to train as a T-Bird to win her heart. So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T-Bird's butts. But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? Well, find out for yourself.<br /><br />Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that didn't work. The gang didn't click as well as the first Grease did, not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because I thought that she graduated from Rydell, but apparently she didn't. The songs were not really that catchy; I'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, I wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but I warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.<br /><br

{"value":"As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes, I was very eager to see \"The Lady and The Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)\" for how he would treat men and women during a real war, the French Revolution. <br /><br />The film looks beautiful, with each scene designed as a period painting, like a tableaux vivant. And I expected much talking, as that's Rohmer's style. But maybe Rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real woman's writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of \"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\"<br /><br />As awful as the excesses of Robespierre et al, how about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I kept humming to myself: \"Marat, we're poor/and the poor stay poor;\" you could also pick a tune from \"Les Miz.\"<br /><br />I wasn't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the Revolution. At one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast. I simply didn't understand her, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the Revolution keep shifting political focus; I think I was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations, like a character out of \"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\" Hey, the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the Prince of Wales or somebody. <br /><br />Usually in a revolutionary period there's some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women, but I saw none here. I once went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy Q & A; the last question, from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes, heck she had gray hair, was \"Why are revolutionaries so grim?\" She was hooted at and Marcuse didn't deign to respond to it seriously -- but it's the only thing of substance I remember from the whole evening. Rohmer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also grim and didactic.<br /><br />(originally written

{"value":"Now don't get me wrong. If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind, who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid, sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God's(?) sake! That's a good point in and of itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art and science is rooted in it.<br /><br />In this film, he relies heavily on his keenly-honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect isn't up to the task.<br /><br />Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to an interviewee's (and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all \"ambushees\") assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan \"No, it's not\" followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety (a device nauseatingly overused in this film). The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically- suspect gospels. I guess Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus.<br /><br />But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will loudly bray and guffaw (they certainly did at my showing).<br /><br />It's doubly telling, however, that the loudest and most mule-like braying occurred during the approximately 70% of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti-Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10% devoted to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Either criticism of Islam is off-limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh. Very telling, either

{"value":"From it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances, Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout. The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to it, and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez/Tarantino flick 'From Dusk till Dawn'. These things do not make a great movie, however, and this is more than evident all the way through 'Curdled'. The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas, and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool, but it's becomes annoying very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican, it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. The film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who, because of her obsession with grisly murders, takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. It sounds boring and it is.<br /><br />William Baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list, and even he doesn't make an impression. He hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing, he's pretty much wasted. Angela Jones, or rather; the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction, takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability. She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself. She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it weren't for her Latino accent; she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level. Curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash. Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels. Whether you're a Tarantino fan, William Baldwin fan, horror fan or just a movie buff; this is one to miss.","finished_norm":["from","it","uninspir","titl","to","the","flat","act","perform","curdl","be","veri","much","a","unremark","film","throughout","the","film","have","gain","some","fan","by","wai","of","the","fact","that","quentin","tarantino","name","be","attach","to","it","and","the","silli","and","out","of","place","nod","to","the","rodrigueztarantino","flick","from","dusk","till","dawn","thi","thing","do","not","make","a","great","movi","howev","and","thi","be","much","than","evid","all","the","wai","through","curdl","the","film","suffer","from","a","all","too","obviou","lack","of","idea","and","it","try","to","mask","thi","with","murder","that","be","mean","to","be","stylish","and","event","that","be","suppos","to","be","disturb","the","mexican","music","score","that","accompani","mani","of","the","sequenc","in","the","film","be","obvious","mean","to","be","cool","but","it","becom","annoi","veri","quickli","especi","a","asid","from","the","fact","that","the","lead","charact","be","mexican","it","doe","not","fit","with","the","tone","of","the","movi","the","film","plot","be","typic","offbeat","and","it","follow","a","gorehound","who","becaus","of","her","obsess","with","grisli","murder","take","a","job","with","a","firm","that","clean","up","murder","scene","it","sound","bore","and","it","isbr","br","william","baldwin","be","the","onli","name","on","the","cast","list","and","even","he","doe","not","make","a","impress","he","have","not","be","give","anyth","to","do","in","the","movi","and","asid","from","talk","to","hi","victim","and","stand","around","try","to","look","menac","he","pretti","much","wast","angela","jone","or","rather","the","taxi","driver","from","pulp","fiction","take","the","lead","role","a","the","murder","obsess","young","woman","and","it","be","alwai","clear","that","it","her","involv","with","pulp","fiction","that","win","her","thi","role","not","her","act","abil","she","mai","have","be","good","enough","in","her","small","role","in","tarantino","masterpiec","but","she","doe","not","have","the","talent","to","lead","a","film","by","herself","she","look","lose","and","out","of","place","for","the","major","of","the","film","and","if","it","be","not","for","her","latino","accent","she","would","not","convinc","the","audienc","that","she","a","weirdo","on","ani","level","curdl","be","a","on","hundr","percentproof","piec","of","forgett","trash","film","like","thi","often","win","themselv","prais","for","invent","or","black","comed","antic","but","thi","on","fail","on","all","level","whether","you","re","a","tarantino","fan","william","baldwin","fan","horror","fan","or","just","a","movi","buff","thi","be","on","to","miss"],"filtered":["uninspir","titl","flat","act","perform","curdl","veri","much","unremark","film","throughout","film","gain","fan","wai","fact","quentin","tarantino","name","attach","silli","place","nod","rodrigueztarantino","flick","dusk","till","dawn","thi","thing","make","great","movi","howev","thi","much","evid","wai","curdl","film","suffer","obviou","lack","idea","try","mask","thi","murder","mean","stylish","event","suppos","disturb","mexican","music","score","accompani","mani","sequenc","film","obvious","mean","cool","becom","annoi","veri","quickli","especi","asid","fact","lead","charact","mexican","doe","fit","tone","movi","film","plot","typic","offbeat","follow","gorehound","becaus","obsess","grisli","murder","take","job","firm","clean","murder","scene","sound","bore","isbr","br","william","baldwin","onli","name","cast","list","even","doe","make","impress","give","anyth","movi","asid","talk","hi","victim","stand","around","try","look","menac","pretti","much","wast","angela","jone","rather","taxi","driver","pulp","fiction","take","lead","role","murder","obsess","young","woman","alwai","clear","involv","pulp","fiction","win","thi","role","act","abil","mai","good","enough","small","role","tarantino","masterpiec","doe","talent","lead","film","look","lose","place","major","film","latino","accent","convinc","audienc","weirdo","ani","level","curdl","hundr","percentproof","piec","forgett","trash","film","like","thi","often","win","themselv","prais","invent","black","comed","antic","thi","fail","level","whether","re","tarantino","fan","william","baldwin","fan","horror","fan","movi","buff","thi","miss"],"filtered2":["uninspir","titl","flat","act","perform","curdl","veri","unremark","throughout","gain","fan","wai","fact","quentin","tarantino","name","attach","silli","place","nod","rodrigueztarantino","flick","dusk","till","dawn","thing","make","great","howev","evid","wai","curdl","suffer","obviou","lack","idea","try","mask","murder","mean","stylish","event","suppos","disturb","mexican","music","score","accompani","mani","sequenc","obvious","mean","cool","becom","annoi","veri","quickli","especi","asid","fact","lead","charact","mexican","doe","fit","tone","plot","typic","offbeat","follow","gorehound","becaus","obsess","grisli","murder","take","job","firm","clean","murder","s

{"value":"Recap: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy, knowledge that might unbalance the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union. KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology. So, they sets a scheme in motion. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, KGB steps in, takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden, and working for the UN. As a backup, KGB kidnaps Markov's estranged daughter. CIA now send their best agents, a team of (Swedish?) Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter.<br /><br />Comments: A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing. The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas. First off is that it is very dark, probably to conceal locations and bad effects, that some scenes are hard to comprehend. You can't see what is happening. The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts, despite being a ninja-movie. Sure there are some, of quite poor quality, but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions. The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies.<br /><br />What does it have that speaks for it then? The idea and ambition foremost. Some actually, and especially for a Swedish movie, decent action-scenes albeit not of martial arts. Some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore. And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode. Mostly all parts that you look for in a B-movie.<br /><br />Because it definitely is a B-movie, no mistake could be made there. But if you expect it, and watch it like a B-movie, it is entertaining. But don't forget, it is not only a B-movie it is set in the eighties. Some girls, for example, besides wearing... lets say \"interesting\" clothes, have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup.<br /><br />In all, see for the cult status and the ambition. Enjoy it, and then forget it.<br /><br

{"value":"Film makeovers of old TV shows seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days, but this disrespectful, toilet humor, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth foul language, rip-off is a blatant middle finger to all Dukes of Hazzard fans both north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line. From the opening sequence of Bo and Luke Duke making a moonshine run for Uncle Jesse (no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation) to the closing sequence of Uncle Jesse smoking weed with the Governor of Georgia (Uncle Jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways) this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult. I can't tell you how many parents I saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived. The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a family show with basic moral values. The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a kid safe, Hemi powered, show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids George Carlin's seven words. I have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist. Those commits might be correct about the movie. Those commits are ABSOLUTELY incorrect about the show. The show, if anything, was about how to get along and be friends with ANYONE. Hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us, Yankee, Rebel, or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing. Hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul mouthed, trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell. Prove the Hollywood Elitist that they are wrong. DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Boycott the sponsors.

{"value":"What in God's name happened here? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone ...anyone, or even make a dollars profit? But mainly, what happened here? <br /><br />Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in earth-shattering gore films, such as Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the titles. In the gore department, this one isn't much different than the rest. Although, the level of ineptness ...well, earth-shattering.<br /><br />Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is gory, think about it.<br /><br />Getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals causes the dead to come back, and eat the living. Never has the concept been treated in such a manner. The gore effects are a whole, new low. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can't tell whether, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt the English dubbing was being very true to the original script, but stranger things have happened. The whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a Troma movie, except it lasts a hell of a lot longer.<br /><br />I've seen only one film that was worse than this, The Chooper.<br /><br />For proof that Andreas Schnaas is an actual director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence a try, but you've been warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through. But if gore is all you're here for, then you might be able to stomach this one. Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /><br />Updated 7/5/09: After a few more viewings of Zombie '90, I've had a change of heart, or I guess I just get it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, Although, Extreme Pestilence still only deserves one star.","finished_norm":["what","in","god","name","happen","here","how","doe","on","go","about","creat","what","be","practic","a","cheap","knockoff","of","redneck","zombi","be","zombi","ever","suppos","to","entertain","someon","anyon","or","even","make","a","dollar","profit","but","mainli","what","happen","here","br","br","zombi","extrem","pestil","be","direct","by","a","lunat","by","the","name","of","andrea","schnaa","who","special","in","earthshatt","gore","film","such","a","goblet","of","gore","and","anthropophagu","and","some","of","which","contain","profan","in","the","titl","in","the","gore","depart","thi","on","be","not","much","differ","than","the","rest","although","the","level","of","inept","good","earthshatteringbr","br","zombi","extrem","pestil","be","a","bad","a","peter","jackson","deadal","be","gori","think","about","itbr","br","get","too","specif","with","the","stori","would","be","a","wast","of","time","a","accid","involv","chemic","caus","the","dead","to","come","back","and","eat","the","live","never","have","the","concept","be","treat","in","such","a","manner","the","gore","effect","be","a","whole","new","low","just","a","zgrade","nightmar","i","ca","not","tell","whether","or","not","thi","be","origin","mean","to","be","funni","somehow","i","doubt","the","english","dub","be","be","veri","true","to","the","origin","script","but","strang","thing","have","happen","the","whole","thing","just","remind","me","of","a","shotonvideo","introduct","to","a","troma","movi","except","it","last","a","hell","of","a","lot","longerbr","br","i","have","see","onli","on","film","that","be","wrong","than","thi","the","chooperbr","br","for","proof","that","andrea","schnaa","be","a","actual","director","i","would","highli","recommend","niko","the","impal","if","you","think","you","have","no","standard","in","what","you","look","for","in","a","bad","movi","give","extrem","pestil","a","try","but","you","have","be","warn","it","take","nerv","of","steel","to","make","it","all","the","wai","through","but","if","gore","be","all","you","re","here","for","then","you","mai","be","abl","to","stomach","thi","on","other","than","that","no","atmospher","no","and","i","mean","no","budget","no","entertain","valu","but","mostli","no","pride","show","some","pride","schnaa","br","br","updat","after","a","few","much","view","of","zombi","i","have","have","a","chang","of","heart","or","i","guess","i","just","get","it","now","zombi","be","hilari","so","nevermind","the","harsh","word","although","extrem","pestil","still","onli","deserv","on","star"],"filtered":["god","name","happen","doe","go","creat","practic","cheap","knockoff","redneck","zombi","zombi","ever","suppos","entertain","someon","anyon","even","make","dollar","profit","mainli","happen","br","br","zombi","extrem","pestil","direct","lunat","name","andrea","schnaa","special","earthshatt","gore","film","goblet","gore","anthropophagu","contain","profan","titl","gore","depart","thi","much","differ","rest","although","level","inept","good","earthshatteringbr","br","zombi","extrem","pestil","bad","peter","jackson","deadal","gori","think","itbr","br","get","specif","stori","wast","time","accid","involv","chemic","caus","dead","come","back","eat","live","never","concept","treat","manner","gore","effect","whole","new","low","zgrade","nightmar","ca","tell","whether","thi","origin","mean","funni","somehow","doubt","english","dub","veri","true","origin","script","strang","thing","happen","whole","thing","remind","shotonvideo","introduct","troma","movi","except","last","hell","lot","longerbr","br","see","onli","film","wrong","thi","chooperbr","br","proof","andrea","schnaa","actual","director","highli","recommend","niko","impal","think","standard","look","bad","movi","give","extrem","pestil","try","warn","take","nerv","steel","make","wai","gore","re","mai","abl","stomach","thi","atmospher","mean","budget","entertain","valu","mostli","pride","show","pride","schnaa","br","br","updat","much","view","zombi","chang","heart","guess","get","zombi","hilari","nevermind","harsh","word","although","extrem","pestil","still","onli","deserv","star"],"filtered2":["god","name","happen","doe","go","creat","practic","cheap","knockoff","redneck","zombi","zombi","ever","suppos","entertain","someon","anyon","even","make","dollar","profit","mainli","happen","zombi","extrem","pestil","direct","lunat","name","andrea","schnaa","special","earthshatt","gore","goblet","gore","anthropophagu","contain","profan","titl","gore","depart","differ","rest","although","level","inept","good","earthshatteringbr","zombi","extrem","pestil","bad","peter","jackson","deadal","gori","think","itbr","get","specif","stori","wast","time","accid","involv","chemic","caus","dead","come","back","eat","live","never","concept","treat","manner","gore","effect","whole","new","low","zgrade","nightmar","ca","tell","whether","origin","mean","funni","somehow","doubt","english","dub","veri","true","origin","script","strang","thing","happen","whole","

{"value":"Dear dear dear dear dear...me! I had the strength to see it through... But why?!<br /><br />The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. But this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. This was some kind of Tremors for kids. I can't believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it.<br /><br />What audience is this movie for? I can only think of 12-14 year olds. If you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. The characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. You know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you've seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids. I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. It's so bad..so wrong..so...crap.<br /><br />But OK, we did get a laugh now and then. Not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..It's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. Still makes me grin when I think about it. But that only happened one more time sadly..and that's when the \"badass\" gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment \"They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!\" At this point we where almost crying with laughter. But after that..nothing could ever top that..(?)..so it's pretty much downhill from there. <br /><br />So tops here are demonic trouts and overacting. If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he's either a \"plant\", vegetable or someone very evil. This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far. Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...*goosebumps* no..I'll leave it at that.","finished_norm":["dear","dear","dear","dear","dearm","i","have","the","strength","to","see","it","through","but","whybr","br","the","two","film","where","fun","and","actual","somewhat","good","but","thi","be","so","bad","we","have","problem","see","the","whole","thing","thi","be","some","kind","of","tremor","for","kid","i","ca","not","believ","thi","movi","be","make","at","allseem","like","the","prop","where","take","from","some","bad","western","seri","of","some","kind","for","kid","and","thei","just","do","whatev","thei","can","with","itbr","br","what","audienc","be","thi","movi","for","i","can","onli","think","of","year","old","if","you","re","old","than","you","will","have","seriou","problem","with","thi","movi","it","not","onli","slow","but","it","so","utterli","bore","the","charact","be","overact","not","just","a","littl","either","and","so","stereotyp","it","fun","for","a","whilebut","not","long","enough","to","not","make","you","want","to","fling","tomato","at","the","screen","you","know","everyth","that","be","go","to","happen","too","caus","yesyouv","see","it","a","billion","time","befor","in","ani","hero","seri","on","tv","for","kid","i","pick","all","the","survivor","and","all","the","tremor","fodder","the","the","charact","get","introduc","it","so","badso","wrongsocrapbr","br","but","okai","we","do","get","a","laugh","now","and","then","not","just","at","the","silli","plot","hole","but","some","scene","where","worth","a","replai","or","twoor","on","scene","that","be","where","two","babi","tremor","fling","themselv","at","on","of","the","obviou","tremor","fodder","guysit","realli","a","great","scene","which","make","u","replai","it","over","and","over","and","laugh","wholeheartedli","still","make","me","grin","when","i","think","about","it","but","that","onli","happen","on","much","time","sadlyand","that","when","the","badass","gunman","show","up","and","overact","hi","part","wonderfullythat","and","on","comment","thei","spring","from","the","grind","like","some","demon","trout","at","thi","point","we","where","almost","cry","with","laughter","but","after","thatnoth","can","ever","top","thatso","it","pretti","much","downhil","from","there","br","br","so","top","here","be","demon","trout","and","overact","if","anybodi","ever","tell","you","thi","be","a","good","movieh","either","a","plant","veget","or","someon","veri","evil","thi","movi","have","get","to","be","the","wrong","of","the","tremor","by","far","look","forward","to","see","tremor","it","bind","to","be","box","offic","hit","compar","to","thisthisgoosebump","noill","leav","it","at","that"],"filtered":["dear","dear","dear","dear","dearm","strength","see","whybr","br","two","film","fun","actual","somewhat","good","thi","bad","problem","see","whole","thing","thi","kind","tremor","kid","ca","believ","thi","movi","make","allseem","like","prop","take","bad","western","seri","kind","kid","thei","whatev","thei","itbr","br","audienc","thi","movi","onli","think","year","old","re","old","seriou","problem","thi","movi","onli","slow","utterli","bore","charact","overact","littl","either","stereotyp","fun","whilebut","long","enough","make","want","fling","tomato","screen","know","everyth","go","happen","caus","yesyouv","see","billion","time","befor","ani","hero","seri","tv","kid","pick","survivor","tremor","fodder","charact","get","introduc","badso","wrongsocrapbr","br","okai","get","laugh","silli","plot","hole","scene","worth","replai","twoor","scene","two","babi","tremor","fling","themselv","obviou","tremor","fodder","guysit","realli","great","scene","make","u","replai","laugh","wholeheartedli","still","make","grin","think","onli","happen","much","time","sadlyand","badass","gunman","show","overact","hi","part","wonderfullythat","comment","thei","spring","grind","like","demon","trout","thi","point","almost","cry","laughter","thatnoth","ever","top","thatso","pretti","much","downhil","br","br","top","demon","trout","overact","anybodi","ever","tell","thi","good","movieh","either","plant","veget","someon","veri","evil","thi","movi","get","wrong","tremor","far","look","forward","see","tremor","bind","box","offic","hit","compar","thisthisgoosebump","noill","leav"],"filtered2":["dear","dear","dear","dear","dearm","strength","see","whybr","two","fun","actual","somewhat","good","bad","problem","see","whole","thing","kind","tremor","kid","ca","believ","make","allseem","like","prop","take","bad","western","kind","kid","whatev","itbr","audienc","onli","think","year","old","re","old","seriou","problem","onli","slow","utterli","bore","charact","overact","littl","either","stereotyp","fun","whilebut","long","enough","make","want","fling","tomato","screen","know","everyth","go","happen","caus","yesyouv","see","billion","time","befor","ani","hero","tv","kid","pick","survivor","tremor","fodder","charact","get","introduc","badso","wrongsocrapbr","okai","get","laugh","silli","plot","hole","scene","worth","replai","twoor","scene","two","babi","tremor","fling","themse
