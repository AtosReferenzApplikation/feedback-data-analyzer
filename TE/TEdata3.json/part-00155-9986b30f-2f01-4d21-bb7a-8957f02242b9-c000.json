{"value":"I remember back when I was little when I was away at camp and we would campout under the stars. There was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out. Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp. Well, much to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin, which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they run into a deer. Well, it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk. The movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film. It wasn't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the \"wendigo.\" My suggestion is that you stay very far away this film. It will leave you wanting your hour and a half back.","finished_norm":["i","rememb","back","when","i","be","littl","when","i","be","awai","at","camp","and","we","would","campout","under","the","star","there","be","alwai","someon","there","that","would","have","a","good","stori","to","tell","that","involv","the","wood","that","surround","u","and","thei","would","alwai","creep","me","out","good","when","i","find","wendigo","at","the","librari","i","check","it","out","hope","to","be","on","of","that","film","that","have","a","supernatur","be","haunt","peopl","in","the","wood","much","like","the","stori","that","be","tell","at","camp","good","much","to","my","dismai","i","be","so","far","from","the","truth","wendigo","be","realli","bad","the","stori","start","of","when","a","famili","of","three","be","drive","to","their","winter","cabin","which","look","like","your","normal","suburban","home","and","noth","like","a","cabin","in","the","wood","and","thei","run","into","a","deer","good","it","seem","the","local","redneck","be","actual","hunt","thi","particular","deer","and","be","pretti","upset","at","our","citi","folk","the","movi","spend","far","too","much","time","follow","the","famili","everydai","activ","instead","of","get","to","the","point","of","the","film","it","be","not","until","about","the","last","minut","that","we","actual","have","some","action","involv","the","wendigo","my","suggest","be","that","you","stai","veri","far","awai","thi","film","it","will","leav","you","want","your","hour","and","a","half","back"],"filtered":["rememb","back","littl","awai","camp","campout","star","alwai","someon","good","stori","tell","involv","wood","surround","u","thei","alwai","creep","good","find","wendigo","librari","check","hope","film","supernatur","haunt","peopl","wood","much","like","stori","tell","camp","good","much","dismai","far","truth","wendigo","realli","bad","stori","start","famili","three","drive","winter","cabin","look","like","normal","suburban","home","noth","like","cabin","wood","thei","run","deer","good","seem","local","redneck","actual","hunt","thi","particular","deer","pretti","upset","citi","folk","movi","spend","far","much","time","follow","famili","everydai","activ","instead","get","point","film","last","minut","actual","action","involv","wendigo","suggest","stai","veri","far","awai","thi","film","leav","want","hour","half","back"],"filtered2":["rememb","back","littl","awai","camp","campout","star","alwai","someon","good","stori","tell","involv","wood","surround","u","alwai","creep","good","find","wendigo","librari","check","hope","supernatur","haunt","peopl","wood","like","stori","tell","camp","good","dismai","far","truth","wendigo","realli","bad","stori","start","famili","three","drive","winter","cabin","look","like","normal","suburban","home","noth","like","cabin","wood","run","deer","good","seem","local","redneck","actual","hunt","particular","deer","pretti","upset","citi","folk","spend","far","time","follow","famili","everydai","activ","instead","get","point","last","minut","actual","action","involv","wendigo","suggest","stai","veri","far","awai","leav","want","hour","half","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,8,9,13,14,15,16,17,23,35,37,38,49,52,59,63,66,71,74,78,90,100,101,112,129,137,139,144,152,155,174,181,182,197,206,224,241,260,283,290,302,365,461,475,504,595,646,655,700,758,832,908,1005,1247,1262,1275,1610,1699,1826,1916,2202,2902,2921,3688,3784,5045,5296,5838,7321],"values":[3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,8,9,13,14,15,16,17,23,35,37,38,49,52,59,63,66,71,74,78,90,100,101,112,129,137,139,144,152,155,174,181,182,197,206,224,241,260,283,290,302,365,461,475,504,595,646,655,700,758,832,908,1005,1247,1262,1275,1610,1699,1826,1916,2202,2902,2921,3688,3784,5045,5296,5838,7321],"values":[1.9381148836729736,2.714457859969082,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,3.83116108203179,1.364847727375781,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6920303308087352,3.4244306149452273,1.8693254449200722,3.745925514644013,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,1.9486336368009016,2.0064197866819473,4.095425683930709,2.1405462403177813,6.295746123656246,2.2466628996789315,2.4106958340079214,2.2939035841256437,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.3131195476980753,4.614953293582877,2.456282578459816,2.4442286541160034,5.473059344848157,5.116663665627972,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,5.325548992363167,2.6754694156628323,2.7678802023081546,2.8612813773965557,2.902686292364678,3.008694896185175,3.358217889001879,3.3721070011625462,3.41740676039221,3.6284289511740746,3.5900195030592035,11.189344336303087,3.616452760127

{"value":"This isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology, or being dated, issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with, but rather a review on the story telling, which most of us are truly interested in.<br /><br />The plot is about a combination of WWII Allied and German Navy members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who are thrust together on a German U boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs.<br /><br />The manipulations aren't so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. What films like this need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions.<br /><br />This film lacks both. For a full length film, only 6 characters are given any time, and 3 of them are barely looked into. McClure's hero is beyond \"routine\", and doesn't make much sense in any era.<br /><br />The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.<br /><br />A lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","on","of","that","review","about","poor","special","effect","or","technologi","or","be","date","issu","that","onli","the","dorkiest","peopl","can","relat","with","but","rather","a","review","on","the","stori","tell","which","much","of","u","be","truli","interest","inbr","br","the","plot","be","about","a","combin","of","wwii","alli","and","german","navi","member","and","two","civilian","the","hero","and","heroin","who","be","thrust","togeth","on","a","german","u","boat","and","wind","up","in","a","savag","land","of","dinosaursbr","br","the","manipul","be","not","so","bad","by","film","standard","and","we","know","from","the","plot","that","realism","be","not","go","to","be","high","what","film","like","thi","ne","be","credibl","and","likabl","charact","along","with","some","semblanc","of","reason","in","the","actionsbr","br","thi","film","lack","both","for","a","full","length","film","onli","charact","be","give","ani","time","and","of","them","be","bare","look","into","mcclure","hero","be","beyond","routin","and","doe","not","make","much","sens","in","ani","erabr","br","the","femal","seem","to","be","look","for","a","answer","to","a","riddl","about","the","land","of","dinosaur","thei","enter","but","the","riddl","be","not","much","of","a","riddl","and","we","can","care","lessbr","br","a","lot","of","failur","in","a","film","that","should","have","be","well","even","for","it","time"],"filtered":["thi","review","poor","special","effect","technologi","date","issu","onli","dorkiest","peopl","relat","rather","review","stori","tell","much","u","truli","interest","inbr","br","plot","combin","wwii","alli","german","navi","member","two","civilian","hero","heroin","thrust","togeth","german","u","boat","wind","savag","land","dinosaursbr","br","manipul","bad","film","standard","know","plot","realism","go","high","film","like","thi","ne","credibl","likabl","charact","along","semblanc","reason","actionsbr","br","thi","film","lack","full","length","film","onli","charact","give","ani","time","bare","look","mcclure","hero","beyond","routin","doe","make","much","sens","ani","erabr","br","femal","seem","look","answer","riddl","land","dinosaur","thei","enter","riddl","much","riddl","care","lessbr","br","lot","failur","film","well","even","time"],"filtered2":["review","poor","special","effect","technologi","date","issu","onli","dorkiest","peopl","relat","rather","review","stori","tell","u","truli","interest","inbr","plot","combin","wwii","alli","german","navi","member","two","civilian","hero","heroin","thrust","togeth","german","u","boat","wind","savag","land","dinosaursbr","manipul","bad","standard","know","plot","realism","go","high","like","ne","credibl","likabl","charact","along","semblanc","reason","actionsbr","lack","full","length","onli","charact","give","ani","time","bare","look","mcclure","hero","beyond","routin","doe","make","sens","ani","erabr","femal","seem","look","answer","riddl","land","dinosaur","enter","riddl","riddl","care","lessbr","lot","failur","well","even","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,6,8,9,10,11,16,17,18,20,23,26,27,30,32,35,47,60,72,90,95,106,110,112,146,160,173,176,183,203,205,211,270,324,336,343,375,422,502,589,616,618,647,800,806,870,903,925,968,1009,1170,1208,1267,1308,1361,1438,1450,1573,1650,1799,1828,2054,2281,2308,2535,3156,3597,3671,4398,4605,5199,6107,6239,8134],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,6,8,9,10,11,16,17,18,20,23,26,27,30,32,35,47,60,72,90,95,106,110,112,146,160,173,176,183,203,205,211,270,324,336,343,375,422,502,589,616,618,647,800,806,870,903,925,968,1009,1170,1208,1267,1308,1361,1438,1450,1573,1650,1799,1828,2054,2281,2308,2535,3156,3597,3671,4398,4605,5199,6107,6239,8134],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,1.982619630677639,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,2.600540117735859,1.3364419891718522,2.742262257014735,1.463169012899134,1.7064694353107215,1.838176641236591,1.9209463754160525,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.159084361316692,2.1290479736304078,4.493325799357863,2.326138445979858,2.3722295531801256,2.4368824319140248,5.008094298653827,2.4885128563647294,2.569760528637609,2.571852579609833,2.5687161421197025,2.731603554088023,2.8753661172782943,2.9233055795674137,2.9705344631698933,6.519555632377253,3.2090054908152035,3.3132665011396125,3.496027715008137,3.5173618574831282,3.5642670069567886,3.6746621462132825,3.9121030022283168,3.880604335168946,7.889252387867754,3.948766986599908,8.679627438

{"value":"There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. There's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br />The \"film\" is total trash. Surreal bad trash. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. There's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very hot or erotic. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.<br /><br />Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!).

{"value":"Where do they get the money to make films like this? I mean, there's nothing redeeming about this film. None of the actors are known, the writing is terrible, the photography is blurry, the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable. For someone who watches all kinds of film, good and bad, I must admit that this film is about the worst I've seen since Attack of the Eye People back in the 50's. I don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, heaven forbid, art but this film would seem to appeal to no one. The story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who's a bad version of the Celtic Soul eater, although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones. The bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from. Take it from there as that, alas, is the best part. My advice is that unless you are into bad mythology, amateurish writing, unconvincing acting and tedious settings, you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting

{"value":"Pere is an idiot, but he is aware about it and acts in consequence. His life is totally boring and he doesn't know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk. When he is returning home, he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements. Although she ignores him, he fells in love and starts to follow her, obsessively. Well the beginning of the film is a bit slow, and can result boring for most people. However, as action begins, it is a little better (not much!, maybe, the best part is the 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that you can see in the middle of the movie; it is not good for the erothism, but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene. Probably it is the best of the film. Neither the actors nor the directing is good, and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people (not for me). All the film is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the film says), that have anything interesting. I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films (maybe his worst!), he knows to do it better.","finished_norm":["pere","be","a","idiot","but","he","be","awar","about","it","and","act","in","consequ","hi","life","be","total","bore","and","he","doe","not","know","how","to","chang","it","when","hi","last","friend","nicco","die","he","feel","total","empti","and","he","decid","to","go","out","to","becom","drink","when","he","be","return","home","he","crash","with","a","girl","that","put","advertis","although","she","ignor","him","he","fell","in","love","and","start","to","follow","her","obsess","good","the","begin","of","the","film","be","a","bite","slow","and","can","result","bore","for","much","peopl","howev","a","action","begin","it","be","a","littl","well","not","much","mayb","the","well","part","be","the","minut","of","sex","almost","differ","scene","about","it","that","you","can","see","in","the","middl","of","the","movi","it","be","not","good","for","the","eroth","but","for","the","funni","and","unexpect","that","be","the","scene","probabl","it","be","the","well","of","the","film","neither","the","actor","nor","the","direct","be","good","and","the","result","be","a","bore","film","that","that","can","result","funni","for","some","peopl","not","for","me","all","the","film","be","base","on","absurd","situat","idiot","a","the","film","sai","that","have","anyth","interest","i","like","ventura","pon","but","i","have","to","admit","that","thi","be","not","on","of","hi","well","film","mayb","hi","wrong","he","know","to","do","it","well"],"filtered":["pere","idiot","awar","act","consequ","hi","life","total","bore","doe","know","chang","hi","last","friend","nicco","die","feel","total","empti","decid","go","becom","drink","return","home","crash","girl","put","advertis","although","ignor","fell","love","start","follow","obsess","good","begin","film","bite","slow","result","bore","much","peopl","howev","action","begin","littl","well","much","mayb","well","part","minut","sex","almost","differ","scene","see","middl","movi","good","eroth","funni","unexpect","scene","probabl","well","film","neither","actor","direct","good","result","bore","film","result","funni","peopl","film","base","absurd","situat","idiot","film","sai","anyth","interest","like","ventura","pon","admit","thi","hi","well","film","mayb","hi","wrong","know","well"],"filtered2":["pere","idiot","awar","act","consequ","life","total","bore","doe","know","chang","last","friend","nicco","die","feel","total","empti","decid","go","becom","drink","return","home","crash","girl","put","advertis","although","ignor","fell","love","start","follow","obsess","good","begin","bite","slow","result","bore","peopl","howev","action","begin","littl","well","mayb","well","part","minut","sex","almost","differ","scene","see","middl","good","eroth","funni","unexpect","scene","probabl","well","neither","actor","direct","good","result","bore","result","funni","peopl","base","absurd","situat","idiot","anyth","interest","like","ventura","pon","admit","well","mayb","wrong","know","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,14,18,19,20,21,23,25,26,41,43,54,59,60,61,62,71,75,84,102,104,108,113,115,129,131,144,147,148,154,159,161,163,184,204,237,249,254,260,278,293,302,334,390,447,473,488,554,667,691,706,718,763,928,1122,1144,1183,1530,1625,2307,2815],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,14,18,19,20,21,23,25,26,41,43,54,59,60,61,62,71,75,84,102,104,108,113,115,129,131,144,147,148,154,159,161,163,184,204,237,249,254,260,278,293,302,334,390,447,473,488,554,667,691,706,718,763,928,1122,1144,1183,1530,1625,2307,2815],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.9708269144703846,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,2.62476135602347,5.826725200115285,1.162015545335049,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,4.045224089013853,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,2.2212694515902225,2.087553710177271,2.0728240170322856,6.4155225108837985,2.1521782565202803,2.201553588425805,2.4106958340079214,2.2512118082053005,2.2931108769894046,4.568864643066313,2.3018654096236517,2.348499626138016,2.300267965194495,2.4323182980210873,4.800114871605731,4.992499677733764,2.624524614047584,2.640097787510554,2.6754694156628323,2.889652074525771,2.6754694156628323,2.8336934208777267,2.9012296278682137,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,3.132778125427319,9.621081752409292,3.335489637924323,3.3933092088131493,3.439602492783994,3.6652429242967908,3.5929222627171646,7.318024749092309,3.634471265630037,3.7465885637507435,4.017463517886143,4.263079925052412,4.229557233013768,4.315570107673808,4.573751515728891,4.671389985292807,5.0768550934009715,5.3392193578

{"value":"Towards the end of this thriller Ally Sheedy's gaunt latter-day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image. She convinces one that, if a nasty Bette Davis-type role were to come her way, she could carry it off brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can't find many other reasons for seeing this. If you've wondered what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) then here's your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sex-starved crazy woman is really tiresome, and even if you like this sort of thing more than I do you'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes. Savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role. Of the leading actors, Nicholas Walker inspires no sympathy at all for Paul Keller's plight and his acting is wooden. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a little. Sheedy's meticulous, understated performance (though she often seems to be on automatic pilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest.

{"value":"This is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line. Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong (having seen her work on the O.C. I know she can do better), then find a better script and budget.<br /><br />The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly computer generated, that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on-screen. And Samaire Armstrong's (alert!)changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad GCIF figure before she even begins to change(Final Fantasy's humans, as well as Pixar's made these laughable, think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll).<br /><br />The story of was interesting, though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. As it also got into the balance between evil, (maybe) not so evil, and the possible end of human-kind should the two lines mate. The subplot of a \"book of werewolf linage\" which effected some of the other characters in a spell-like manner for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past. <br /><br />Bring in a better script and direction, and I'd come back again.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","prime","exampl","of","low","budget","win","over","what","would","be","a","good","stori","line","let","bring","back","samair","armstrong","have","see","her","work","on","the","oc","i","know","she","can","do","well","then","find","a","well","script","and","budgetbr","br","the","special","effect","be","so","bad","and","mostli","badli","comput","gener","that","it","almost","lose","me","with","the","time","the","wolf","be","see","onscreen","and","samair","armstrong","alertchang","into","a","werewolf","be","do","by","reduc","her","at","to","a","bad","gcif","figur","befor","she","even","begin","to","changefin","fantasi","human","a","good","a","pixar","make","thi","laughabl","think","of","the","figur","a","a","nude","barbi","dollbr","br","the","stori","of","be","interest","though","the","idea","of","bloodlin","in","werewolf","be","noth","new","a","it","conjur","get","into","the","balanc","between","evil","mayb","not","so","evil","and","the","possibl","end","of","humankind","should","the","two","line","mate","the","subplot","of","a","book","of","werewolf","linag","which","effect","some","of","the","other","charact","in","a","spelllik","manner","for","a","while","be","effect","but","can","have","be","expand","much","in","explain","what","have","happen","in","the","past","br","br","bring","in","a","well","script","and","direct","and","i","have","come","back","again"],"filtered":["thi","prime","exampl","low","budget","win","good","stori","line","let","bring","back","samair","armstrong","see","work","oc","know","well","find","well","script","budgetbr","br","special","effect","bad","mostli","badli","comput","gener","almost","lose","time","wolf","see","onscreen","samair","armstrong","alertchang","werewolf","reduc","bad","gcif","figur","befor","even","begin","changefin","fantasi","human","good","pixar","make","thi","laughabl","think","figur","nude","barbi","dollbr","br","stori","interest","though","idea","bloodlin","werewolf","noth","new","conjur","get","balanc","evil","mayb","evil","possibl","end","humankind","two","line","mate","subplot","book","werewolf","linag","effect","charact","spelllik","manner","effect","expand","much","explain","happen","past","br","br","bring","well","script","direct","come","back"],"filtered2":["prime","exampl","low","budget","win","good","stori","line","let","bring","back","samair","armstrong","see","work","oc","know","well","find","well","script","budgetbr","special","effect","bad","mostli","badli","comput","gener","almost","lose","time","wolf","see","onscreen","samair","armstrong","alertchang","werewolf","reduc","bad","gcif","figur","befor","even","begin","changefin","fantasi","human","good","pixar","make","laughabl","think","figur","nude","barbi","dollbr","stori","interest","though","idea","bloodlin","werewolf","noth","new","conjur","get","balanc","evil","mayb","evil","possibl","end","humankind","two","line","mate","subplot","book","werewolf","linag","effect","charact","spelllik","manner","effect","expand","explain","happen","past","bring","well","script","direct","come","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,12,17,20,24,26,34,38,39,47,48,49,60,63,77,79,86,87,94,102,106,107,123,124,131,147,151,163,203,217,221,225,250,256,292,307,321,395,402,415,440,448,489,510,552,765,962,996,1046,1409,1857,1867,2014,2073,2191,2854,3208,3945,5280,6327,6947],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,12,17,20,24,26,34,38,39,47,48,49,60,63,77,79,86,87,94,102,106,107,123,124,131,147,151,163,203,217,221,225,250,256,292,307,321,395,402,415,440,448,489,510,552,765,962,996,1046,1409,1857,1867,2014,2073,2191,2854,3208,3945,5280,6327,6947],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,3.4960351200691706,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,3.745925514644013,3.8927804517536475,1.9469506069506084,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.08112281984698,2.087553710177271,6.477253083950076,4.287906797278791,2.2619070973220485,2.2323930368088845,2.2512118082053005,2.2844323215331563,2.8002454868101863,2.4000574358028657,2.569760528637609,2.6113665294700725,2.6423424573643777,2.641219492619754,5.3625870878976425,2.748952192422636,2.9752256367457734,2.8767855639325206,6.18993968377476,3.153168081130368,3.084424928710765,6.317603797697249,3.212973749990824,3.2681460658591432,3.3956930001684253,3.374440724508766,3.424750734647968,3.965503778955432,15.117344296254373,4.130259012031

{"value":"The Hazing is confused mumbo-jumbo that wants so hard to be The Evil Dead that it even references Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is, it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie. This movie is nowhere near as original. The plot has been used before, by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and that was a lot more fun. This flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings.<br /><br />Brad Dourif is, as usual, not given much to do here, but when he is on screen he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the acting of the kids, it's passable but by no means good. The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric. There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims, but it was never scary for a second. The gore level is mid-range to low, but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times.

{"value":"Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, make no mistake. But it's also an incredibly enjoyable one. This is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one Chuck Connors, who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes. I suppose he's supposed to be sort of an Obi Wan Kenobi type (\"The tough ninja-buster\", the box copy exclaims) but his 'wisdom' is laughable. \"Move without thinking\"??? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration.<br /><br />But really, his two aides, Sonny and Dennis, have such horrible dialogue that 'Brooklyn', as we call The Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Especially watch for Dennis' logic regarding the 'genetic splicing' the Sakura are involved with. If you know anything about cloning you will die laughing. And yes, this is a major plot point, folks.<br /><br />A terribly fun movie, Sakura Killers is a hard-to-find gem. I won't spoil the 'trick' ending for you either, except that it's a perfect set up for a Sakura Killers 2.

{"value":"MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY MAKE ME UNSEE THIS MOVIE! what drugs are you people on! this could very well be the worst movie ever! i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time, i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema. when i thought to watch this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family we thought \"oh hey, this may be funny! it will probably be bad but still a little funny\" how wrong we were, we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be. All of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over, and during the course of the movie, one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I had watched the video from The Ring instead, that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days. For all who wish to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! you may think you are some sort of \"tough guy\" by renting this but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and urinate on you.","finished_norm":["my","ey","in","the","name","of","god","and","all","that","be","holi","make","me","unse","thi","movi","what","drug","be","you","peopl","on","thi","can","veri","good","be","the","wrong","movi","ever","i","feel","like","i","be","on","a","bad","acid","trip","the","whole","time","i","ne","to","call","a","therapist","to","help","me","deal","with","the","trauma","of","thi","epic","disast","from","start","to","finish","glow","rope","be","a","unholi","masterpiec","of","satan","cinema","when","i","think","to","watch","thi","movi","with","my","jewish","well","friend","and","hi","famili","we","think","oh","hei","thi","mai","be","funni","it","will","probabl","be","bad","but","still","a","littl","funni","how","wrong","we","be","we","be","not","prepar","for","how","aw","thi","movi","can","be","all","of","my","friend","line","up","for","lobotomi","a","soon","a","the","film","be","over","and","dure","the","cours","of","the","movi","on","of","my","friend","attempt","to","hang","himself","with","hi","belt","while","anoth","try","to","slit","hi","wrist","with","a","wooden","spoon","i","wish","i","have","watch","the","video","from","the","ring","instead","that","wai","the","pain","and","suffer","would","be","over","in","onli","seven","short","dai","for","all","who","wish","to","see","thi","movi","you","be","not","prepar","you","mai","think","you","be","some","sort","of","tough","gui","by","rent","thi","but","thi","movi","will","break","you","push","you","to","the","grind","and","urin","on","you"],"filtered":["ey","name","god","holi","make","unse","thi","movi","drug","peopl","thi","veri","good","wrong","movi","ever","feel","like","bad","acid","trip","whole","time","ne","call","therapist","help","deal","trauma","thi","epic","disast","start","finish","glow","rope","unholi","masterpiec","satan","cinema","think","watch","thi","movi","jewish","well","friend","hi","famili","think","oh","hei","thi","mai","funni","probabl","bad","still","littl","funni","wrong","prepar","aw","thi","movi","friend","line","lobotomi","soon","film","dure","cours","movi","friend","attempt","hang","hi","belt","anoth","try","slit","hi","wrist","wooden","spoon","wish","watch","video","ring","instead","wai","pain","suffer","onli","seven","short","dai","wish","see","thi","movi","prepar","mai","think","sort","tough","gui","rent","thi","thi","movi","break","push","grind","urin"],"filtered2":["ey","name","god","holi","make","unse","drug","peopl","veri","good","wrong","ever","feel","like","bad","acid","trip","whole","time","ne","call","therapist","help","deal","trauma","epic","disast","start","finish","glow","rope","unholi","masterpiec","satan","cinema","think","watch","jewish","well","friend","famili","think","oh","hei","mai","funni","probabl","bad","still","littl","funni","wrong","prepar","aw","friend","line","lobotomi","soon","dure","cours","friend","attempt","hang","belt","anoth","try","slit","wrist","wooden","spoon","wish","watch","video","ring","instead","wai","pain","suffer","onli","seven","short","dai","wish","see","prepar","mai","think","sort","tough","gui","rent","break","push","grind","urin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,20,23,25,33,36,43,44,46,55,62,64,71,73,107,110,111,132,138,142,143,148,152,161,177,182,185,199,234,239,240,269,272,281,352,360,399,409,449,459,468,573,633,661,697,848,890,974,1034,1043,1064,1084,1108,1174,1257,1295,1508,1567,1810,2317,2396,2566,2999,3526,3559,4381,4917,5559,6025,6407,6670],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,20,23,25,33,36,43,44,46,55,62,64,71,73,107,110,111,132,138,142,143,148,152,161,177,182,185,199,234,239,240,269,272,281,352,360,399,409,449,459,468,573,633,661,697,848,890,974,1034,1043,1064,1084,1108,1174,1257,1295,1508,1567,1810,2317,2396,2566,2999,3526,3559,4381,4917,5559,6025,6407,6670],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,3.200185830788664,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,3.311542587503466,1.9536997889255368,4.045224089013853,1.883428577602134,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,2.1439533986393955,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.3018654096236517,2.3131195476980753,7.296954894063262,2.458149992634611,2.7365296724240786,2.518833027372001,2.558331832813986,2.673149229007135,2.6593400337329487,2.7666071276613566,2.76533567167316,2.8028805344481915,2.832

{"value":"This is high grade cheese fare of B movie kung fu flicks. Bruce \"wannabe\" Lee is played by Bruce Li...I think. Of course, let's show quick clips of Bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice, it kind of looks like Bruce. You'll laugh in awe at how the film splicing isn't very good, but some cool deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown in the mix. According to the movie, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce even though his character is supposed to be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimes Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very POORLY). See Bruce go one-on-one with the cowardly lion. The props department stopped by Kay-Bee, you see. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man. Towards the end, the director decided \"let's throw a flashback\" for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago!!

{"value":"Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week. This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town. They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion.<br /><br />The TV version was (for its time) grim. No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down. The unrated version is even worse--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard \"uses\" her. YUCK! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink. You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. The needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch. A sick, sleazy film.

{"value":"Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital. She escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's all pretty to look at and listen too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast. Luckily enough, leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts.

{"value":"Three story lines and not enough tying them together, \"Inside Man\" was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Though having its moments, the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl, jumped quickly between highs and lows, and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical \"super-detective\" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as \"evil genius\" and \"criminal mastermind\" (both not the same in retrospect). Overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. Yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden \"ah-ha!\" or summation of everything. It all ended up with very little of the energy it began with, with a lot of plot-holes, tons of questions, and as I said earlier, no where near Spike Lee's normal level. I have to completely disagree with the so-called \"professional critics\"... this is not the movie they play it up to

{"value":"I'm somewhat of a fan of Lynche's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very let down. It's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor. The animation is very crude, no doubt done using Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows. <br /><br />For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed by it. However, if you've spent much time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch submitted this work to the website, then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of Newgrounds artists. But, since I saw this on DVD, instead of on Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would have otherwise. These cartoons are fit for the internet, but with a name like David Lynch on it, I expected better quality both in story and in animation.","finished_norm":["i","be","somewhat","of","a","fan","of","lynch","work","so","i","be","excit","when","i","find","thi","dvd","unfortun","i","be","veri","let","down","it","a","seri","of","short","cartoon","which","attempt","to","show","a","disturb","and","disgust","sort","of","humor","the","anim","be","veri","crude","no","doubt","do","us","macromedia","each","cartoon","have","a","big","fat","gui","beat","up","hi","famili","and","gener","act","like","a","jerk","to","everyon","he","know","br","br","for","peopl","who","be","not","familiar","with","thi","vein","of","anim","thei","will","probabl","be","somewhat","impress","by","it","howev","if","you","have","spend","much","time","on","newgroundscom","like","me","then","thi","cartoon","will","be","no","differ","than","ani","of","the","other","stuff","you","have","see","befor","mani","of","the","popular","amateur","artist","on","newground","be","do","much","well","work","than","what","be","show","on","thi","dvd","if","lynch","submit","thi","work","to","the","websit","then","he","would","blend","in","perfectli","with","some","of","the","well","of","newground","artist","but","sinc","i","see","thi","on","dvd","instead","of","on","newground","i","give","it","a","instead","of","a","a","i","would","have","otherwis","thi","cartoon","be","fit","for","the","internet","but","with","a","name","like","david","lynch","on","it","i","expect","well","qualiti","both","in","stori","and","in","anim"],"filtered":["somewhat","fan","lynch","work","excit","find","thi","dvd","unfortun","veri","let","seri","short","cartoon","attempt","show","disturb","disgust","sort","humor","anim","veri","crude","doubt","us","macromedia","cartoon","big","fat","gui","beat","hi","famili","gener","act","like","jerk","everyon","know","br","br","peopl","familiar","thi","vein","anim","thei","probabl","somewhat","impress","howev","spend","much","time","newgroundscom","like","thi","cartoon","differ","ani","stuff","see","befor","mani","popular","amateur","artist","newground","much","well","work","show","thi","dvd","lynch","submit","thi","work","websit","blend","perfectli","well","newground","artist","sinc","see","thi","dvd","instead","newground","give","instead","otherwis","thi","cartoon","fit","internet","name","like","david","lynch","expect","well","qualiti","stori","anim"],"filtered2":["somewhat","fan","lynch","work","excit","find","dvd","unfortun","veri","let","short","cartoon","attempt","show","disturb","disgust","sort","humor","anim","veri","crude","doubt","us","macromedia","cartoon","big","fat","gui","beat","famili","gener","act","like","jerk","everyon","know","peopl","familiar","vein","anim","probabl","somewhat","impress","howev","spend","time","newgroundscom","like","cartoon","differ","ani","stuff","see","befor","mani","popular","amateur","artist","newground","well","work","show","dvd","lynch","submit","work","websit","blend","perfectli","well","newground","artist","sinc","see","dvd","instead","newground","give","instead","otherwis","cartoon","fit","internet","name","like","david","lynch","expect","well","qualiti","stori","anim"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,15,17,20,21,23,26,27,28,30,38,48,50,55,56,79,82,113,124,130,140,143,148,152,162,177,182,204,225,227,246,247,269,272,277,283,319,361,369,418,524,567,596,627,653,675,676,678,724,839,951,963,1095,1151,1158,1475,1798,1807,1918,2650,2831,3344,3649,4047],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,15,17,20,21,23,26,27,28,30,38,48,50,55,56,79,82,113,124,130,140,143,148,152,162,177,182,204,225,227,246,247,269,272,277,283,319,361,369,418,524,567,596,627,653,675,676,678,724,839,951,963,1095,1151,1158,1475,1798,1807,1918,2650,2831,3344,3649,4047],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.3114004109387893,0.9418936859054116,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,3.4960351200691706,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,3.0904588387038183,1.3364419891718522,1.519311641348122,5.086534867203742,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.9469506069506084,2.020196584395323,2.1521782565202803,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,2.317169775997098,2.3409902041158843,2.3018654096236517,4.6262390953961505,2.3586007221245198,2.458149992634611,2.7365296724240786,2.624524614047584,2.641219492619754,2.6005321873043625,2.673149229007135,8.191127420549101,2.76533567167316,2.8028805344481915,9.349197700029837,2.7678802023081546,2.9056060024680126,3.0399731661399314,3.121829110937649,3.164467636384302,3.4028786598293,3.454678155189441,6.971057861819834,3.477726550625732,15.964584838275078,3.749984152751882,3.6105180246075443,3.6715125373103863,7.597548633842627,3.965503778955432,4.004218291136122,4.035401218572811,4.15544926086004

{"value":"This film is totally garbage. Some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class. Nothing more than a piece of self-complacence catharsis. Disgusting.<br /><br />If this kind of a movie is set in US, it will sure make itself a big joke. And simply because it comes out from 'the other side', it makes itself a masterpiece, a wonderful amusement for certain brain-washed and/or brain-washing westerns (some George W. maybe:). A typical cold-war sequelae, some kind of joke anyway.<br /><br />I would say, if this -- like expressed in this film -- is all what Soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years, then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through. BUT NO! 'cause like many others, I've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something also relevant with dog, \"White Bim Black Ear\" -- both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's movie -- is a real masterpiece.

{"value":"An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies. To disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days, he throws in The Matrix.<br /><br />But it's not only the same lame film-as-art speech all over again. This speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /><br />It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having Zizte edited into the movies he is taking about. For someone who is supposed to know much about movies, his own is, cinematographicly speaking: yeiks.<br /><br />To put it in Zizek's own words - I saw 5\\-\\!7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />Mr. (Zizek), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.

{"value":"I watched this movie as I liked the plot, a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they're connected.<br /><br />The setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first (and best) Saw movie & although there wasn't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace.<br /><br />There was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering 'Alpha males' and it was a welcome surprise (for me anyway)to see Melissa Joan Hart hasn't given up on acting yet.<br /><br />A few things let it down for me personally; 1. The paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies.<br /><br />2. MJH's line about her cop ex 'getting her into this' when in reality, he was the least deserving person to be there, he hadn't KNOWINGLY contributed to the events leading up to their capture.<br /><br />3. The ending..... what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no cliff hanger, no obvious end... it just ends.<br /><br />And for that alone I dropped two stars off my rating.

{"value":"I don't know why I'm commenting this stupid reality-show I happened to watch a few episodes of(a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something,I didn't watch the entire thing though.Only like three episodes)as I was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day.Maybe I'm just bored today:-)<br /><br />I feel sorry for Britney,I really do.For all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity.Or she's self-centered to the extreme.She married the nitwit Federline(okay anybody can make a mistake) and before that she \"starred\" this horrible show about her everyday life with him,where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it,no matter if it is in someone's face or into the shower as Federline is standing in there. She's babbling about her sex-life without leaving anything to your imagination,I don't care for my part,but I can't help wondering how she feels about it now when she's divorced.And yes,for her sake I'm embarrassed.But I shouldn't be.She seem to live a pretty empty,shallow life though.I don't want to swap lives with her even if I could.

{"value":"First I'd like to excuse my bad English.<br /><br />I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan, but I liked that movie nevertheless. Live Feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting, but hey, who's surprised? The acting in Live Feed was... well, not there! I've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey, but not by students in media or acting school. This was NO class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off on Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie! Short, quick and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okey, there where buckets of blood, but it didn't even look real. The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw-movies. And Braindead was fun!

{"value":"Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie... I had had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and thought that they wont do it again. But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack.<br /><br />Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein..... and what u get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight loss...!!!<br /><br />Music-wise another major disaster... in the music album, they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts...! that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, i would say, watch it to listen to that background song which goes

{"value":"This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. It was poorly made and the actors couldn't act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own. The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case. It appears that the director or make-up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie. Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie. This was honestly an awful movie and I couldn't believe how badly it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like \"whats going on?\" The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene.<br /><br />IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is.

{"value":"$25,000 Pyramid Clues: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slither. Eight Legged Freaks.<br /><br />Pyramid Category: Movies that were funnier and more thrilling than Snakes on a Plane.<br /><br />Hell, with that definition I'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of Ted and Elaine in Airplane! as superior to Snakes in both laughs and thrills.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this isn't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies: Anaconda! Besides the never to be seen again casting of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same flick, you had Jon Voight pulling off the all-time cinematic heist. His final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a \"so-ludicrous-it's-fun\" movie.<br /><br />In the end, Snakes on a Plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible. Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year, all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop-sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater.

{"value":"1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The 3rd Universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective. The story is similar and the results are ho-hum. This time the story's location is the U.S. as the Egyptian priest's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney(which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not asked to do much acting for this character). The new priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice. Again, a girl gets in the way, as the priest falls for one of the descendent's fiancé and wants her, yes--- to be immortal with him(haven't we heard this before?). The plan is, of course, thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches(similar to the Frankenstein monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story...how do they get a sequel??

{"value":"I had the (mis)fortune to see this film at a showing in the US. Having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing, I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. <br /><br />The original film was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fitted into that early seventies, post 1969 revolution thing; this film just stinks of....... , well, nothing really. It's that bad.<br /><br />Imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what I mean ?<br /><br />Madonna never could act, and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse with every one of those years, increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat.<br /><br />Guy Ritchie, who has built his \"reputation\" on Lock Stock, could never direct either - his movies are shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. He doesn't disappoint here either; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle.<br /><br />Please people, take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below.

{"value":"The effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that I have to assume that that was the desired intent. The sets are artificial and at no time did I not feel that I was watching a movie. It seemed like the actors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to one another. While the film has elements of early film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre.<br /><br />Given that the presentation had no appeal to me, I was at least expecting an engaging story. Usually I am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes. By the time of the, \"Gee, I forgot the $80,000,\" moment, I thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief.

{"value":"I'll be honest- the reason I rented this movie was because I am a huge fan of Kyle Chandler's (most notably from Early Edition). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him as in a different role (out of curiosity). The plot itself also drew me in; a wanna-be hitman (Tony Greco- a.k.a. Mr. Chandler) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or, rather, the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in \"the family\". The movies was nothing like I expected. It was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you'd know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically- it was filthy, and made little sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes the guns do go BOOM. But there's more to a movie than that. This film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it. The acting really made up for it- James Belushi was pretty amusing as \"The Rose\". Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as believable as she could get. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to \"the family\".

{"value":"Not one of Keaton's best efforts, this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into - the Talmadges. A Polish/English language barrier and a series of coincidences leads Buster into a marriage with a large Irish woman, who (along with her father and brothers) treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune. Mistaken identities abound here - gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off.<br /><br />This Metro short does have at least two real laughs - Buster's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate. The other is a family photo, with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability.<br /><br />The yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags, but stops short (for all the buildup) of development.<br /><br />Kino's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.","finished_norm":["not","on","of","keaton","well","effort","thi","be","perhap","a","veil","attempt","to","reveng","himself","on","the","famili","he","marri","into","the","talmadg","a","polishenglish","languag","barrier","and","a","seri","of","coincid","lead","buster","into","a","marriag","with","a","larg","irish","woman","who","along","with","her","father","and","brother","treat","him","shabbili","until","thei","think","he","mai","be","a","heir","to","a","fortun","mistak","ident","abound","here","gag","be","set","up","and","but","for","the","main","fail","to","pai","offbr","br","thi","metro","short","doe","have","at","littl","two","real","laugh","buster","cleverli","turn","around","hi","lack","of","dinner","by","us","the","calendar","on","the","wall","and","the","basic","ignor","of","hi","adopt","famili","to","liter","bring","the","meat","to","hi","plate","the","other","be","a","famili","photo","with","the","entir","group","slowli","collaps","to","the","floor","a","the","tripod","of","the","camera","lose","it","stabilitybr","br","the","yeast","beer","overflow","can","have","be","the","catalyst","for","a","massiv","seri","of","gag","build","upon","gag","but","stop","short","for","all","the","buildup","of","developmentbr","br","kino","print","be","crisp","and","clear","and","the","score","be","on","for","player","piano","drum","and","sound","effect","not","on","of","buster","well","effort","but","worth","a","few","laugh"],"filtered":["keaton","well","effort","thi","perhap","veil","attempt","reveng","famili","marri","talmadg","polishenglish","languag","barrier","seri","coincid","lead","buster","marriag","larg","irish","woman","along","father","brother","treat","shabbili","thei","think","mai","heir","fortun","mistak","ident","abound","gag","set","main","fail","pai","offbr","br","thi","metro","short","doe","littl","two","real","laugh","buster","cleverli","turn","around","hi","lack","dinner","us","calendar","wall","basic","ignor","hi","adopt","famili","liter","bring","meat","hi","plate","famili","photo","entir","group","slowli","collaps","floor","tripod","camera","lose","stabilitybr","br","yeast","beer","overflow","catalyst","massiv","seri","gag","build","upon","gag","stop","short","buildup","developmentbr","br","kino","print","crisp","clear","score","player","piano","drum","sound","effect","buster","well","effort","worth","laugh"],"filtered2":["keaton","well","effort","perhap","veil","attempt","reveng","famili","marri","talmadg","polishenglish","languag","barrier","coincid","lead","buster","marriag","larg","irish","woman","along","father","brother","treat","shabbili","think","mai","heir","fortun","mistak","ident","abound","gag","set","main","fail","pai","offbr","metro","short","doe","littl","two","real","laugh","buster","cleverli","turn","around","lack","dinner","us","calendar","wall","basic","ignor","adopt","famili","liter","bring","meat","plate","famili","photo","entir","group","slowli","collaps","floor","tripod","camera","lose","stabilitybr","yeast","beer","overflow","catalyst","massiv","gag","build","upon","gag","stop","short","buildup","developmentbr","kino","print","crisp","clear","score","player","piano","drum","sound","effect","buster","well","effort","worth","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,14,18,20,46,47,56,70,80,96,98,106,109,133,157,177,178,179,182,183,198,215,219,221,231,250,272,286,315,318,322,324,342,381,401,410,477,518,564,590,593,630,733,763,849,871,897,998,999,1085,1094,1237,1274,1374,1464,1478,1608,1701,2000,2036,2395,2408,2419,2520,2659,2804,3480,3487,3948,4292,4383,4462,4526,5508,6434,6478,6708,7349,7587,7872,8326],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,14,18,20,46,47,56,70,80,96,98,106,109,133,157,177,178,179,182,183,198,215,219,221,231,250,272,286,315,318,322,324,342,381,401,410,477,518,564,590,593,630,733,763,849,871,897,998,999,1085,1094,1237,1274,1374,1464,1478,1608,1701,2000,2036,2395,2408,2419,2520,2659,2804,3480,3487,3948,4292,4383,4462,4526,5508,6434,6478,6708,7349,7587,7872,8326],"values":[1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,1.8610609350701788,2.094675786251684,1.9951803900462557,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,2.159084361316692,2.125691139326857,4.642472950759303,2.3360150694757706,2.458149992634611,2.532833256045391,2.507968722980095,8.209589017272236,2.4885128563647294,2.5439726117360975,2.605934685587711,2.5792094178355414,2.6423424573643777,2.7049353070058615,2.6812935439488212,5.605761068896383,2.780700890737216,2.854312708080462,2.902686292364678,2.885344817328191,2.8753661172782943,3.112795625839981,3.24941502915308,6.17585

{"value":"The script for this Columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera. Deeply character-driven films are great, but only if the characters are compelling. And in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel. The villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist. The great Lt. Columbo himself is no where near his famous, lovable, self-effacing, crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!! I could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would have at least TRIED to struggle or fight back at least a little. And speaking of reality....the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police. The POLICE?? Give me a break. Everyone knows the FBI takes over EVERY kidnapping case.

{"value":"I found this to be an utter waste of time, effort and money. I know Disney always displays lack of creativity when making \"straight-to-video\" films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a \"new perspective\" is an all-time low...soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a \"new version of the movie we all love.\" Nathan Lane surprisingly returns to his role of Timon yet again. Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original \"Lion King\" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it REALLY happened...as they see it.<br /><br />Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah...<br /><br />The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being in anything of real commercial substance? Overall if you liked the original you'll hate this. It's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike.

{"value":"This is a terrible film, and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion. The characters are uninflected, obviously drawn, predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillment.<br /><br />William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made, but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection.<br /><br />Holden's character--the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) coincidentally--is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre-hippie cool: the bachelor pad, the swinging hi-fi, the lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously uncool, a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon would find them and their big honkin' cars sexy.<br /><br />Ugh. Youth culture was never that desperate.

{"value":"The movie is a total crap. We have two good actors who are miscast and a meat-head of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is a crap. The characters poorly sketched. Non existent story telling. No editing to speak of. Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star..that is a dream in itself. The movie drags along to the point of decadence. The whole charade about Arjun bringing his Manna to London, let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this Producer Vipul Shah but this is not one of them. It seems all the good directors are falling prey to the Box Office mania..that the Mumbai Media Morons have created. This is yet another crap movie in the lines of \"Wanted\" with idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is good to the Indian Cinema as Titanic was to the Winter Cruise Business. On a positive note-I like Asin character dancing Bharatnatyam when she changes to the Western style dancing when the teacher is not looking.","finished_norm":["the","movi","be","a","total","crap","we","have","two","good","actor","who","be","miscast","and","a","meathead","of","a","actor","salman","khan","just","to","attract","the","femal","audienc","the","stori","be","a","crap","the","charact","poorli","sketch","non","exist","stori","tell","no","edit","to","speak","of","ajai","devgan","a","a","rock","starthat","be","a","dream","in","itself","the","movi","drag","along","to","the","point","of","decad","the","whole","charad","about","arjun","bring","hi","manna","to","london","let","him","grope","hi","girlfriend","and","let","him","not","plai","at","wemblei","vimblei","in","the","dub","process","be","absurd","salman","khan","over","the","top","act","or","fake","be","too","pain","to","watch","i","rememb","see","some","good","movi","from","thi","produc","vipul","shah","but","thi","be","not","on","of","them","it","seem","all","the","good","director","be","fall","prei","to","the","box","offic","maniathat","the","mumbai","medium","moron","have","creat","thi","be","yet","anoth","crap","movi","in","the","line","of","want","with","idiot","actor","like","salman","khan","who","have","no","place","in","a","good","hindi","cinema","he","be","good","to","the","indian","cinema","a","titan","be","to","the","winter","cruis","busi","on","a","posit","notei","like","asin","charact","danc","bharatnatyam","when","she","chang","to","the","western","styl","danc","when","the","teacher","be","not","look"],"filtered":["movi","total","crap","two","good","actor","miscast","meathead","actor","salman","khan","attract","femal","audienc","stori","crap","charact","poorli","sketch","non","exist","stori","tell","edit","speak","ajai","devgan","rock","starthat","dream","movi","drag","along","point","decad","whole","charad","arjun","bring","hi","manna","london","let","grope","hi","girlfriend","let","plai","wemblei","vimblei","dub","process","absurd","salman","khan","top","act","fake","pain","watch","rememb","see","good","movi","thi","produc","vipul","shah","thi","seem","good","director","fall","prei","box","offic","maniathat","mumbai","medium","moron","creat","thi","yet","anoth","crap","movi","line","want","idiot","actor","like","salman","khan","place","good","hindi","cinema","good","indian","cinema","titan","winter","cruis","busi","posit","notei","like","asin","charact","danc","bharatnatyam","chang","western","styl","danc","teacher","look"],"filtered2":["total","crap","two","good","actor","miscast","meathead","actor","salman","khan","attract","femal","audienc","stori","crap","charact","poorli","sketch","non","exist","stori","tell","edit","speak","ajai","devgan","rock","starthat","dream","drag","along","point","decad","whole","charad","arjun","bring","manna","london","let","grope","girlfriend","let","plai","wemblei","vimblei","dub","process","absurd","salman","khan","top","act","fake","pain","watch","rememb","see","good","produc","vipul","shah","seem","good","director","fall","prei","box","offic","maniathat","mumbai","medium","moron","creat","yet","anoth","crap","line","want","idiot","actor","like","salman","khan","place","good","hindi","cinema","good","indian","cinema","titan","winter","cruis","busi","posit","notei","like","asin","charact","danc","bharatnatyam","chang","western","styl","danc","teacher","look"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,10,16,17,21,35,37,40,41,47,58,66,73,90,107,111,124,164,168,170,184,194,250,261,278,290,313,324,344,348,362,364,380,398,409,422,459,492,509,528,582,587,607,639,648,654,706,730,764,770,790,928,949,1025,1092,1114,1196,1245,1387,1492,1541,2457,2608,2620,2697,2862,2921,3521,3527,3967,4638,4801,5358,7089],"values":[2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,10,16,17,21,35,37,40,41,47,58,66,73,90,107,111,124,164,168,170,184,194,250,261,278,290,313,324,344,348,362,364,380,398,409,422,459,492,509,528,582,587,607,639,648,654,706,730,764,770,790,928,949,1025,1092,1114,1196,1245,1387,1492,1541,2457,2608,2620,2697,2862,2921,3521,3527,3967,4638,4801,5358,7089],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,3.3930723249613526,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,4.70627975028631,1.7064694353107215,1.865701314626681,1.929723173391612,1.8950689206770979,2.0477128419653545,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,4.464786073617769,2.3930275298746078,2.4894767118610357,2.4071371113909277,2.496249838866882,2.5378812223426954,2.6812935439488212,2.7085302779237206,2.8336934208777267,2.8612813773965557,8.721207181559318,2.8753661172782943,2.983093497946387,3.0103169565570433,3.058539100262467,2.9878441007049847,3.1020620
