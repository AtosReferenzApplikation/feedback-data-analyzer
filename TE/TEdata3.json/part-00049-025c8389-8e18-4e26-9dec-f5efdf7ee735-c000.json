{"value":"I honestly believe that ANYONE considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure. Like the \"films\" of Edward Wood, Jr. in the '60s and '70s, this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts, re-editing their films, and reworking their special effects until they finally look right. This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios' pre-screening process. If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.<br /><br />Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is \"good enough\" can truly be. Every performance, every line of dialog, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity. A beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think \"At least I accomplished SOMETHING\" or \"Just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself\". This movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out.<br /><br />Critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment \"the worst movie ever made\".<br /><br />Beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are, and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites. Also, beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay, and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story. Writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think \"I can do better than THAT\" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really IS to produce even mediocre results.<br /><br />I sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers. Particularly those entering the craft in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment. There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects. The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off. Some can't even come CLOSE to it.","finished_norm":["i","honestli","believ","that","anyon","consid","filmmak","be","subject","to","thi","mindboggl","failur","like","the","film","of","edward","wood","jr","in","the","and","thi","film","be","a","shine","exampl","of","why","real","filmmak","expend","so","much","energi","rewrit","script","reedit","their","film","and","rework","their","special","effect","until","thei","final","look","right","thi","movi","be","conjur","a","decent","argum","for","the","studio","prescreen","process","if","mr","hine","be","forc","to","endur","the","honest","reaction","of","a","imparti","audienc","perhap","he","would","have","cut","or","the","walkingrunningstrol","scene","and","edit","thi","movi","down","to","a","much","bearabl","minutesbr","br","film","student","should","view","thi","movi","a","a","exampl","of","just","how","danger","think","their","work","be","good","enough","can","truli","be","everi","perform","everi","line","of","dialog","everi","digit","effect","everi","filter","effect","ind","everi","frame","of","video","express","the","danger","of","strive","for","mere","mediocr","a","begin","filmmak","mai","find","himselfherself","tempt","from","time","to","time","to","think","at","littl","i","accomplish","someth","or","just","finish","thi","will","be","a","accomplish","in","itself","thi","movi","will","help","them","understand","just","how","badli","a","film","can","turn","outbr","br","critic","mai","conjur","benefit","from","see","thi","movi","befor","thei","dub","the","late","summer","entertain","the","wrong","movi","ever","madebr","br","begin","writer","can","learn","from","thi","film","just","how","import","rewrit","be","and","perhap","understand","the","necess","for","rewrit","conjur","begin","director","can","learn","the","import","of","a","good","screenplai","and","some","degre","of","respect","for","just","how","hard","it","be","to","write","a","script","that","caus","the","audienc","to","feel","emotion","compel","through","the","stori","writer","and","director","who","watch","bad","madeforc","movi","of","the","week","and","think","i","can","do","well","than","that","can","see","get","a","idea","from","thi","movi","how","difficult","it","realli","be","to","produc","even","mediocr","resultsbr","br","i","sincer","believ","thi","movi","can","serv","a","a","educ","tool","to","begin","filmmak","particularli","that","enter","the","craft","in","thi","current","postluca","and","postspielberg","environ","there","be","a","reason","filmmak","such","a","thi","be","hail","for","their","abil","with","special","effect","the","war","of","the","world","illustr","clearli","that","not","everyon","can","pull","it","off","some","ca","not","even","come","close","to","it"],"filtered":["honestli","believ","anyon","consid","filmmak","subject","thi","mindboggl","failur","like","film","edward","wood","jr","thi","film","shine","exampl","real","filmmak","expend","much","energi","rewrit","script","reedit","film","rework","special","effect","thei","final","look","right","thi","movi","conjur","decent","argum","studio","prescreen","process","mr","hine","forc","endur","honest","reaction","imparti","audienc","perhap","cut","walkingrunningstrol","scene","edit","thi","movi","much","bearabl","minutesbr","br","film","student","view","thi","movi","exampl","danger","think","work","good","enough","truli","everi","perform","everi","line","dialog","everi","digit","effect","everi","filter","effect","ind","everi","frame","video","express","danger","strive","mere","mediocr","begin","filmmak","mai","find","himselfherself","tempt","time","time","think","littl","accomplish","someth","finish","thi","accomplish","thi","movi","help","understand","badli","film","turn","outbr","br","critic","mai","conjur","benefit","see","thi","movi","befor","thei","dub","late","summer","entertain","wrong","movi","ever","madebr","br","begin","writer","learn","thi","film","import","rewrit","perhap","understand","necess","rewrit","conjur","begin","director","learn","import","good","screenplai","degre","respect","hard","write","script","caus","audienc","feel","emotion","compel","stori","writer","director","watch","bad","madeforc","movi","week","think","well","see","get","idea","thi","movi","difficult","realli","produc","even","mediocr","resultsbr","br","sincer","believ","thi","movi","serv","educ","tool","begin","filmmak","particularli","enter","craft","thi","current","postluca","postspielberg","environ","reason","filmmak","thi","hail","abil","special","effect","war","world","illustr","clearli","everyon","pull","ca","even","come","close"],"filtered2":["honestli","believ","anyon","consid","filmmak","subject","mindboggl","failur","like","edward","wood","jr","shine","exampl","real","filmmak","expend","energi","rewrit","script","reedit","rework","special","effect","final","look","right","conjur","decent","argum","studio","prescreen","process","mr","hine","forc","endur","honest","reaction","imparti","audienc","perhap","cut","walkingrunningstrol","scene","edit","bearabl","minut

Actually, to be honest, I'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80's horror effort. In the year 1909, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more, no less  to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed. She's only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers. So when Dr. Hackenstein yells out \"I need three female bodies to bring back my wife\", his words aren't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females (and one really annoying nerdy kid) with car trouble show up at his doorstep. Why doesn't that ever happen to me? \"I need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem!!!\"  See, nothing! Anyway, the good Doctor sees his wish fulfilled, but unfortunately  for science that is  he develops sympathy for one of the three girls. \"Dr. Hackenstein\" is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of \"Re-Animator\" and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic, like a severed head talking one-liners. It's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere, as it doesn't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre. The funniest character is undoubtedly the loud-speaking female grave robber Ruby; depicted by the anti-cherubic Anne Ramsey. 80's horror buffs will certainly remember her from Wes Craven's \"Deadly Friend\", where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball. \"Dr. Hackenstein\" supposedly takes place in the early 1900's, but there are hardly any attempts to re-create the atmosphere of that era (except maybe for some automobiles). Dr. Hackenstein's laboratory is a quite clichéd 80's set piece, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent

{"value":"It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone awarded viewers a leg-crossing that twisted many people's minds. And now, God knows why, she's in the game again. \"Basic Instinct 2\" is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica \"Basic Instinct\" featuring a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original might not even get close to this one, since \"Instinct 2\" is painful film-making, as the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones assassinates the legacy of the first film.<br /><br />The plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look forcefully sexy) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is appointed to examine her, but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction.<br /><br />And there it is, without no further explanations, the basic force that moves this \"Instinct\". Nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy, C-class erotic film. Sharon Stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn-off. Part of it because of the amateurish writing, the careless direction, and terrifyingly low chemistry. The movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this wouldn't be rated NC-17) than the first entrance in the series. \"Instinct\" is a compelling torture.<br /><br />To top it off, everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film. The acting here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here, she gets extremely obnoxious. David Morrisey stars in the worst role of his life, and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie- confused and aroused. \"Instinct 2\" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series, that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you....<br /><br />\"Basic Instinct 2\" never sounded like a good movie, and, indeed, it isn't. Some films should never get out of paper, and that is the feeling you get after watching this. Now, it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg dropped out, and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge paycheck for

{"value":"Crazed Shotgun toting-incest driven-revenge seeking truck drivers & obsessive control disorder \"daddy raped me when I was 12\" handcuff carrying, all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4am on Sunday nights. (And yes I know that was an entire sentence, but bare with me people; this is a long-winded review for a short pointless film).<br /><br />Filmed in \"somewhere\" Canada, with almost no budget, the plot to this freak show is trite, the police in it obviously never heard of \"State Jurisdiction\" because they end up chasing both Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiotic, Anal Retentive, Generic, insecure College Student) all across the U.S. (and I thought only the FBI could do that). The camera is shaky, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like \"Ishtar\" and \"Leonard Part 6\".<br /><br />As far as the Skin scenes go (which is the only reason to even rent this movie, don't even think of buying it) there are two of them. The first one is the only one worth watching though which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____(insert unknown actor here, he's obviously done nothing else worth noting) in a seedy, disgusting Motel room (the kind with the busted sink that drips, and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it). It's all S&M (riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax, and underwear licking) folks and in the end, he gets left in a motel room, with no money and cops waiting at his door (that's goes to show you guys, don't let a hooker tie you up in a \"middle-of-nowhere\" motel room). Sadly though, Kari shows no skin worth remembering, and that alone can cause deep-seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so that is definitely a downer towards this flick.<br /><br />As for the ending, *Snicker*Snicker* I know you probably wouldn't mind if I revealed it to you but I won't, you should spend your hard earned money for that one. All in all I give it a 1/5 for action, a 3/5 for Skin (See last paragraph) and a 0/0 for acting, character development or intricate plot twists.<br /><br />- Laughing

{"value":"It must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film. Probably Cruise, the Exec. Prod., saw what was happening and had Towne use much, much more of the nude footage in the final cut then Towne wanted to, to make up for the disaster he saw looming.(Maybe Cruise even thought of \"Titanic\".)A few items: Colin Farrell can't act his way out of a paper bag. But he's one of the flavors-of-the-decade, a producer's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films. He has so many moments of not believing in what he's doing and you can see it in his eyes. I think he would have been at his best as a film actor, albeit not as rich or famous as he is now, playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act. The trap of spending a lot of money for period sets, costumes, cars, et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash/wax. No one seems to want anything to look, well, worn. Or dirty. Is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didn't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items?<br /><br />This was a story about the depression-thirties folks, not a Disney Broadway musical about that era. How about doing it in black and white or better yet, given Caleb Deschanel as your D.P., have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times. It should have been, after all, a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did, in the Depression. More on Farrell. Did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer? H.L. Mencken on the wall; did I see his eyes roll at one point? Hayek and Farrell as a sexually dynamic duo? Sending a boy to do a man's work? Perhaps in the book, which I haven't read, the story was about an older woman and a youth. I cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because I bailed out early on. But the memory of the scenes I did see made me think that someone was doing a not-too-amusing parody of a noir movie. Sort of what Saturday Night Live has been like for the past decade: not funny.

all.)","finished_norm":["it","must","have","be","excruci","to","attend","the","daili","a","the","shoot","continu","on","thi","failur","of","a","film","probabl","cruis","the","exec","prod","see","what","be","happen","and","have","town","us","much","much","much","of","the","nude","footag","in","the","final","cut","then","town","want","to","to","make","up","for","the","disast","he","see","loomingmayb","cruis","even","think","of","titanica","few","item","colin","farrel","ca","not","act","hi","wai","out","of","a","paper","bag","but","he","on","of","the","flavorsofthedecad","a","produc","darl","and","on","be","forc","to","avoid","the","embarrass","of","watch","him","by","not","attend","hi","film","he","have","so","mani","moment","of","not","believ","in","what","he","do","and","you","can","see","it","in","hi","ey","i","think","he","would","have","be","at","hi","well","a","a","film","actor","albeit","not","a","rich","or","famou","a","he","be","now","plai","banana","to","dynam","lead","who","can","act","the","trap","of","spend","a","lot","of","monei","for","period","set","costum","car","et","al","and","photograph","them","a","if","thei","just","come","from","the","spindri","clean","or","car","washwax","no","on","seem","to","want","anyth","to","look","good","wear","or","dirti","be","thi","becaus","the","product","design","be","tell","by","the","line","produc","to","make","sure","thei","do","not","ruin","the","stuff","becaus","then","the","compani","wouldhav","to","pai","for","the","ruin","itemsbr","br","thi","be","a","stori","about","the","depressionthirti","folk","not","a","disnei","broadwai","music","about","that","era","how","about","do","it","in","black","and","white","or","well","yet","give","caleb","deschanel","a","your","dp","have","him","desatur","the","color","dure","the","mix","to","suggest","some","of","the","actual","grime","and","poor","of","the","time","it","should","have","be","after","all","a","bite","depress","to","live","so","desper","a","thi","folk","do","in","the","depress","much","on","farrel","do","anyon","for","a","moment","believ","thi","gui","be","a","writer","hl","mencken","on","the","wall","do","i","see","hi","ey","roll","at","on","point","hayek","and","farrel","a","a","sexual","dynam","duo","send","a","boi","to","do","a","man","work","perhap","in","the","book","which","i","have","not","read","the","stori","be","about","a","old","woman","and","a","youth","i","cannot","delv","too","deepli","into","the","middl","to","latter","part","of","the","film","becaus","i","bail","out","earli","on","but","the","memori","of","the","scene","i","do","see","make","me","think","that","someon","be","do","a","nottooamus","parodi","of","a","noir","movi","sort","of","what","saturdai","night","live","have","be","like","for","the","past","decad","not","funni","in","my","mind","i","keep","think","of","a","gui","noir","sketch","music","and","all"],"filtered":["must","excruci","attend","daili","shoot","continu","thi","failur","film","probabl","cruis","exec","prod","see","happen","town","us","much","much","much","nude","footag","final","cut","town","want","make","disast","see","loomingmayb","cruis","even","think","titanica","item","colin","farrel","ca","act","hi","wai","paper","bag","flavorsofthedecad","produc","darl","forc","avoid","embarrass","watch","attend","hi","film","mani","moment","believ","see","hi","ey","think","hi","well","film","actor","albeit","rich","famou","plai","banana","dynam","lead","act","trap","spend","lot","monei","period","set","costum","car","et","al","photograph","thei","come","spindri","clean","car","washwax","seem","want","anyth","look","good","wear","dirti","thi","becaus","product","design","tell","line","produc","make","sure","thei","ruin","stuff","becaus","compani","wouldhav","pai","ruin","itemsbr","br","thi","stori","depressionthirti","folk","disnei","broadwai","music","era","black","white","well","yet","give","caleb","deschanel","dp","desatur","color","dure","mix","suggest","actual","grime","poor","time","bite","depress","live","desper","thi","folk","depress","much","farrel","anyon","moment","believ","thi","gui","writer","hl","mencken","wall","see","hi","ey","roll","point","hayek","farrel","sexual","dynam","duo","send","boi","man","work","perhap","book","read","stori","old","woman","youth","delv","deepli","middl","latter","part","film","becaus","bail","earli","memori","scene","see","make","think","someon","nottooamus","parodi","noir","movi","sort","saturdai","night","live","like","past","decad","funni","mind","keep","think","gui","noir","sketch","music"],"filtered2":["must","excruci","attend","daili","shoot","continu","failur","probabl","cruis","exec","prod","see","happen","town","us","nude","footag","final","cut","town","want","make","disast","see","loomingmayb","cruis","even","think","titanica","item","colin","farrel","ca","act","wai","paper","bag","flavorsofthedecad","produc","darl","forc","avoid","embarrass","watch","attend","mani","moment","believ","see","ey","think","well","actor"

{"value":"I haven't seen this movie in a while, so I'm afraid I can't be very specific about details... It did have some interesting points. Ralph Bakshi's attempt at an animated adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's masterpiece was a very ambitious project, so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production. Therefore, not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy (with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made), the film itself seems less than finished. It seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed, but whether or not it's intentional is hard to say. The whole thing seems shabbily made and undone, especially the Orcs and the Nazgul. Another problem, of course, is the huge gaps in the plot. Bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie, and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours (the new trilogy by Peter Jackson does it in about twice that time.) Far too many important bits were left out (and I don't refer only to Tom Bombadil, which, I think, was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie.) And of course, the ending, which is completely sudden and out of place. I'm not even sure if Bakshi originally intended to end the film there, or if he even had any idea where he's going to end it.<br /><br />The characters... well, most of them were okay. The hobbits don't look so bad (except for the gay Sam. Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make Sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character?) If you're a Tolkien fanatic (like me), watch this movie (though I'm not too sure about buying it. What special features does the DVD version have, anyway?) But know in advance that you're not going to watch a real 'Lord Of The Rings Movie' but not much more than a historical curiosity, which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the Beatles carried on with their plan (I actually think a psychedelic LOTR could have been quite cool. The idea was to cast George as Gandalf, Paul as Frodo, Ringo as Sam and John as Gollum.) If you didn't read the book or didn't like it much or don't like animation films or don't want to see a half-finished movie... stay away.","finished_norm":["i","have","not","see","thi","movi","in","a","while","so","i","be","afraid","i","ca","not","be","veri","specif","about","detail","it","do","have","some","interest","point","ralph","bakshi","attempt","at","a","anim","adapt","of","jrr","tolkien","masterpiec","be","a","veri","ambiti","project","so","ambiti","in","fact","that","it","go","bankrupt","at","some","point","dure","the","product","therefor","not","onli","doe","it","stop","abruptli","somewher","around","the","middl","of","the","book","of","the","trilogi","with","sort","of","a","shade","of","a","hint","of","a","sequel","that","be","never","make","the","film","itself","seem","littl","than","finish","it","seem","that","some","charact","be","anim","while","other","be","film","but","whether","or","not","it","intent","be","hard","to","sai","the","whole","thing","seem","shabbili","make","and","undo","especi","the","orc","and","the","nazgul","anoth","problem","of","cours","be","the","huge","gap","in","the","plot","bakshi","be","in","a","rush","to","finish","thi","movi","and","he","somehow","hope","to","cram","a","book","and","a","half","in","littl","much","than","two","hour","the","new","trilogi","by","peter","jackson","doe","it","in","about","twice","that","time","far","too","mani","import","bit","be","leav","out","and","i","do","not","refer","onli","to","tom","bombadil","which","i","think","be","love","in","the","book","but","would","look","silli","in","a","movi","and","of","cours","the","end","which","be","complet","sudden","and","out","of","place","i","be","not","even","sure","if","bakshi","origin","intend","to","end","the","film","there","or","if","he","even","have","ani","idea","where","he","go","to","end","itbr","br","the","charact","good","much","of","them","be","okai","the","hobbit","do","not","look","so","bad","except","for","the","gai","sam","do","you","know","that","the","produc","of","the","new","trilogi","origin","want","to","make","sam","a","woman","so","there","would","be","a","feminin","lead","charact","if","you","re","a","tolkien","fanat","like","me","watch","thi","movi","though","i","be","not","too","sure","about","bui","it","what","special","featur","doe","the","dvd","version","have","anywai","but","know","in","advanc","that","you","re","not","go","to","watch","a","real","lord","of","the","ring","movi","but","not","much","much","than","a","histor","curios","which","probabl","look","not","much","well","than","the","version","would","have","have","the","beatl","carri","on","with","their","plan","i","actual","think","a","psychedel","lotr","can","have","be","quit","cool","the","idea","be","to","cast","georg","a","gandalf","paul","a","frodo","ringo","a","sam","and","john","a","gollum","if","you","do","not","read","the","book","or","do","not","like","it","much","or","do","not","like","anim","film","or","do","not","want","to","see","a","halffinish","movi","stai","awai"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","afraid","ca","veri","specif","detail","interest","point","ralph","bakshi","attempt","anim","adapt","jrr","tolkien","masterpiec","veri","ambiti","project","ambiti","fact","go","bankrupt","point","dure","product","therefor","onli","doe","stop","abruptli","somewher","around","middl","book","trilogi","sort","shade","hint","sequel","never","make","film","seem","littl","finish","seem","charact","anim","film","whether","intent","hard","sai","whole","thing","seem","shabbili","make","undo","especi","orc","nazgul","anoth","problem","cours","huge","gap","plot","bakshi","rush","finish","thi","movi","somehow","hope","cram","book","half","littl","much","two","hour","new","trilogi","peter","jackson","doe","twice","time","far","mani","import","bit","leav","refer","onli","tom","bombadil","think","love","book","look","silli","movi","cours","end","complet","sudden","place","even","sure","bakshi","origin","intend","end","film","even","ani","idea","go","end","itbr","br","charact","good","much","okai","hobbit","look","bad","except","gai","sam","know","produc","new","trilogi","origin","want","make","sam","woman","feminin","lead","charact","re","tolkien","fanat","like","watch","thi","movi","though","sure","bui","special","featur","doe","dvd","version","anywai","know","advanc","re","go","watch","real","lord","ring","movi","much","much","histor","curios","probabl","look","much","well","version","beatl","carri","plan","actual","think","psychedel","lotr","quit","cool","idea","cast","georg","gandalf","paul","frodo","ringo","sam","john","gollum","read","book","like","much","like","anim","film","want","see","halffinish","movi","stai","awai"],"filtered2":["see","afraid","ca","veri","specif","detail","interest","point","ralph","bakshi","attempt","anim","adapt","jrr","tolkien","masterpiec","veri","ambiti","project","ambiti","fact","go","bankrupt","point","dure","product","therefor","onli","doe","stop","abruptli","somewher","around","middl","book","trilogi","sort","shade","hint","sequel","never","make","seem","littl","finish","seem","charact","anim","whether","

Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s, the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off.<br /><br />This film is a case-in-point. The first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me. By then, the story didn't have much appeal, either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I don't think I've seen a movie she starred in that I liked, including this one, where the goody two-shoes English teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave Siam. (I which she had!). <br /><br />However, divorcing myself from likes-and-dislikes, there is no denying this Rogers and Hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks, particularly those who liked \"The Sound Of Music\" a decade later. There are similarities in the R&H musicals. Thus, if you liked the Julie Andrews flick, you should like this, too. <br /><br />This is a Lavish production with, yes, a capital \"L.\" This is the kind of big-production musicals you rarely saw after that generation. You also get the dubbed singers, unlike today, where the actress isn't able to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue of Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in \"West Side Story\" and Audrey Hepburn in \"My Fair Lady.\" <br /><br />Yul Brynner is \"King Mongkut\" and is the stereotypical traditionalist, the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way. He isn't \"progressive,\" as the left wingers like the say, but the education teacher (Kerr, as \"Anna Leonowens\") will set him straight. Secular-progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! However, Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more-bark-than-bite character. Justifiably, he is the big star of this film. Brynner had magnetism. Even in \"The Magnificent Seven,\" Yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience.<br /><br />In summary, it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it.

{"value":"Should have been titled 'Balderdash!' Little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved. Little more than training film quality with poor camera work, muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping 'Japs' with laughing Japanese infantry, laughing Japanese fighter pilots and one-dimensional square-jawed Americans dying left and right. Sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you. The plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer's afternoon in my childhood, peering through the neighbor's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend Steve and my little brother. In actual fact, the Makin Island raid was a near total failure with Carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally, thirsty and completely disoriented, looking for someone to surrender to, before they happened upon some equally confused Japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them! In the withdrawal several of Carlson's Marines ended up on another island and were abandoned! The film, of course, couldn't tell that story, not in 1943, so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums. With Randolph Scott, and his jaw, as Colonel Thorwald (Carlson) leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures, the green recruit (Harry Landon, Robert Mitchum), the grizzled veteran (J. Carroll Naish, Milburn Stone, Sam Levene), the country-bumpkin (Rod Cameron), the all-American boy (Alan Curtis), and scores of sneering (when they weren't laughing) 'Japs'. And yet the cast nearly overcomes the material. Almost. Randolph Scott's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel. But in the end, the one-note object of the exercise wins. Any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when Randy Scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring (well sorta stirring) call to arms. The cast was better than this material. So was the audience.

{"value":"James Bond in the wilderness? Well, that's the way it looks: Pierce Brosnan is after all best known as Bond in \"Tommorrow Never Dies\" (1997) and \"Golden Eye\" (1995) - both shot prior to this release. Frankly, the film's two leads are both badly miscast, with Brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance, and with Annie Galipeau (as Pony, Grey Owl's love interest) having to battle with carelessly-written dialogue.<br /><br />The two aunts, on the other hand are perfect. But the film is not about aunts. It is about the wilds of the Canadian wilderness. And while the photography may be pretty, there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds. Annie Galipeau, as Pony, just fails to be convincing, unfortunately, because I really wanted to believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old on this film, and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her. He makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is.. but in the wrong sort of way.<br /><br />But one thing for sure, she appears picture-perfect throughout. But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness? It just doesn't fit, especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with Bond (sorry, Grey Owl), and use photo-ops for kissing close-ups.<br /><br />I've lived with forest people in the Pacific North West, and they simply don't look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival. Which brings me to another point: the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set: the 1930s. I put the blame here largely on a lack-lustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc, plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action.<br /><br />William Nicholson wrote the screenplay, and his latest offering, \"Elizabeth, the Golden Age\" opened three days ago, so I do hope there is an improvement.<br /><br />Yes, I've read the comments others have posted, but I'm not convinced. A lot of potential, but mishandled and even maybe ill-conceived. If it had had a religious film, it would have been panned, but because it preaches environmentalism, the film remains somewhat above criticism, since it is \"politically correct.\" Sorry, for all that, I don't buy it.

{"value":"Nell Shipman must have been paid a hefty sum of money to promote the Maxwell automobile's off-road capabilities. The plot of the movie is pretty simple, Nell plays a writer who has a bad case of writer's block, and needs inspiration, so she goes to visit Mexico to absorb the atmosphere. There she meets the hero (Bert Van Tuyle), a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse. While Nell is visiting with her father's partner at his mining camp, a gang of local bandits kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness. The hero needs to get to her quickly, so he decides to drive there in his car. This is where the film takes a weird twist. Bert proceeds to drive over every terrain imaginable, huge rocks, small streams, heavy brush, scraggly tree stumps, steep inclines, etc etc, for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles. Now mind you, this isn't a modern-day ATV, it's a 1920 Maxwell automobile, so it looks very out-of-place as an off-road vehicle. And it clearly has limitations for some of the terrain it encounters, we get to see it stuck more than once in this film. But the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles. Once the hero gets to the hidden camp and rescues the girl, he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the bandits in hot pursuit (on horseback), and at this point it became hysterically funny to me. Watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks, getting stuck in gravel and mountain brush, going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs, the bandits should have had ample time to catch up. But they never do, even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night. And in a silly climax, the car climbs a mountainside, and helps Nell and the hero push a huge boulder down the side to crush the pursuing bandits.<br /><br />After seeing this film you would think the army should invest in 1920 Maxwell automobiles because they clearly have better off-road capabilities than Hummers and Bradley tanks combined. Watch this film just for laughs, it's worth it just to see Nell cuddling up to the car grill and saying \"You did your best, brave little

{"value":"I didn't even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when I saw it, but I guessed it through the running time. It has the same washed-out colors, bland characters, and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80's, plus a 'social platform' that practically screams \"Afterschool special\". Anyhoo.<br /><br />Rona Jaffe's (thank you) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I count myself one of said geeks, tho I have never played D&D specifically I have dabbled in one of its brethren. M&M was also made in the heyday of D&D's major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality, be worshiping Satan without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendously.<br /><br />We meet 4 young college students, who play the aptly named Mazes and Monsters, to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life. Except that M&M as presented is more boring than their mundane lives. None of the allure of gaming is presented here-and Jay Jay's request to take M&M into 'the real world' comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we don't really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different-but they're all rich WASPy prigs who have problems no one really has.<br /><br />But things just continue, getting worse in more ways than one. The low budget comes dreadfully clear, (I love the 'Entrance' sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns) Robbie/Pardu shows why he's not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever, and the payoff atop the 'Two Towers' is unintentionally hilarious. Tom Hanks' blubbering \"Jay Jay, what am I doing here?\" made me laugh for minutes on end. Definitely the low point in his career.<br /><br />Don't look at it as a cogent satire, just a laughable piece of 80's TV trash, and you'll still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but it's all worthwhile for Pardu's breakdown at the end. At least Tom Hanks has gotten better. Not that he could go much worse from

{"value":"This film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot.<br /><br />The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying \"suggested by the book Silas Marner\". Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:<br /><br />A wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.<br /><br />In this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. In only one can I find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far. On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!<br /><br />I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. If I was a trustee of George Eliot's I would insist on reparation. If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or better still removed from the archives!<br /><br />If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","a","flagrant","ripoff","of","on","of","the","well","novel","of","all","time","sila","marner","by","georg","eliotbr","br","the","detail","of","the","film","show","on","imdb","do","give","acknowledg","to","the","origin","authoress","but","i","do","not","see","thi","at","the","begin","of","the","film","onli","a","credit","at","the","end","of","it","sai","suggest","by","the","book","sila","marner","suggest","it","be","noth","but","a","complet","rip","off","of","all","the","essenti","elem","of","the","storybr","br","a","wrong","and","sad","old","man","a","artisan","poor","and","lone","have","all","hi","monei","steal","on","night","a","child","wander","up","to","hi","door","a","her","mother","lie","dye","in","the","snow","outsid","the","man","take","her","in","and","bring","her","up","until","on","dai","the","local","squir","or","rich","politician","here","demand","to","adopt","the","child","it","be","he","who","have","father","the","child","dure","a","illicit","affair","year","befor","the","battl","then","ensu","a","to","who","should","have","legal","custodi","of","the","childbr","br","in","thi","and","everi","other","aspect","of","the","film","the","stori","be","exactli","the","same","in","onli","on","can","i","find","a","differ","sila","marner","have","epilepsi","but","perhap","that","would","have","strain","the","act","abil","of","mr","martin","too","far","on","top","of","that","he","have","hi","hair","dye","in","some","carrot","juic","concoct","presum","to","make","him","look","young","but","actual","make","him","look","much","the","clown","that","he","be","there","be","conjur","the","addit","of","meaningless","joke","that","thi","offbeat","comedian","cannot","resist","bring","into","the","stori","which","have","no","part","in","it","and","onli","detract","from","the","profound","of","the","stori","like","when","the","child","cry","in","the","courthous","declar","she","can","onli","be","happi","with","the","man","who","have","father","her","all","thi","year","thi","be","convei","in","the","film","by","the","girl","appli","nasal","decongest","to","the","bridg","of","her","nose","to","make","her","tearfulbr","br","i","be","surpris","that","legal","and","integr","within","the","film","industri","permit","such","a","film","to","be","make","if","i","be","a","truste","of","georg","eliot","i","would","insist","on","repar","if","i","be","steve","martin","i","would","send","the","profit","to","that","estat","or","to","the","poor","at","the","veri","littl","it","should","be","entitl","sila","marner","adapt","by","martin","or","well","still","remov","from","the","archivesbr","br","if","you","be","interest","in","thi","stori","and","i","hope","you","be","dismiss","thi","complet","and","watch","sila","marner","or","read","the","book","the","bbc","make","a","excel","adapt","of","it","in","the"],"filtered":["thi","film","flagrant","ripoff","well","novel","time","sila","marner","georg","eliotbr","br","detail","film","show","imdb","give","acknowledg","origin","authoress","see","thi","begin","film","onli","credit","end","sai","suggest","book","sila","marner","suggest","noth","complet","rip","essenti","elem","storybr","br","wrong","sad","old","man","artisan","poor","lone","hi","monei","steal","night","child","wander","hi","door","mother","lie","dye","snow","outsid","man","take","bring","dai","local","squir","rich","politician","demand","adopt","child","father","child","dure","illicit","affair","year","befor","battl","ensu","legal","custodi","childbr","br","thi","everi","aspect","film","stori","exactli","onli","find","differ","sila","marner","epilepsi","perhap","strain","act","abil","mr","martin","far","top","hi","hair","dye","carrot","juic","concoct","presum","make","look","young","actual","make","look","much","clown","conjur","addit","meaningless","joke","thi","offbeat","comedian","resist","bring","stori","part","onli","detract","profound","stori","like","child","cry","courthous","declar","onli","happi","man","father","thi","year","thi","convei","film","girl","appli","nasal","decongest","bridg","nose","make","tearfulbr","br","surpris","legal","integr","within","film","industri","permit","film","make","truste","georg","eliot","insist","repar","steve","martin","send","profit","estat","poor","veri","littl","entitl","sila","marner","adapt","martin","well","still","remov","archivesbr","br","interest","thi","stori","hope","dismiss","thi","complet","watch","sila","marner","read","book","bbc","make","excel","adapt"],"filtered2":["flagrant","ripoff","well","novel","time","sila","marner","georg","eliotbr","detail","show","imdb","give","acknowledg","origin","authoress","see","begin","onli","credit","end","suggest","book","sila","marner","suggest","noth","complet","rip","essenti","elem","storybr","wrong","sad","old","man","artisan","poor","lone","monei","steal","night","child","wander","door","mother","lie","dye","snow","outsid","man","take","bring","dai","local","squir","rich","politician","d

{"value":"I did not really want to watch this one. It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I don't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker. The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film. I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale. So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle. And to my complete shock, Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero! He is the one who romances the young Divya! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too, only in the second part of this idiotic film.<br /><br />Just let me repeat the question: why would a 17 year-old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired, chubby, swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself. He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse -- acts like a teenager at his forties. On top of that, just to make himself more pathetic, he plays a pop-star...<br /><br />To make things clear, I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are. As long as they make a convincing couple, there should be no problem. In fact, leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls (Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi, Mithun Chakraborty-Madhuri Dixit, Shahrukh Khan-Deepika, Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal) and made the pairing pretty well. Also, I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor, I think he is a good actor, and his act in Bobby is still well-engraved in my heart, but it's not that he looks in this film like, say, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today.<br /><br />That was such a disappointment. Oh, and as for the reason every person actually watched this film, Shahrukh Khan made a good debut. He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do. The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well. If you want to watch this film, go for the second half only. Personally, I would not do even that.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","realli","want","to","watch","thi","on","it","seem","to","be","a","old","raj","kanwar","movi","which","disgust","me","even","befor","i","start","watch","it","becaus","i","do","not","consid","him","even","close","to","be","mediocr","a","a","filmmak","the","onli","reason","i","take","thi","on","be","obvious","the","shahrukh","khan","appear","in","the","film","i","have","not","even","know","what","the","film","be","all","about","becaus","i","be","sure","it","would","be","just","a","ordinari","fairi","tale","so","i","just","imagin","a","love","stori","between","shahrukh","khan","and","divya","bharti","with","a","substanti","support","role","by","rishi","kapoor","who","i","think","would","be","plai","her","father","or","uncl","and","to","my","complet","shock","rishi","kapoor","be","actual","the","hero","he","be","the","on","who","romanc","the","young","divya","i","be","sadden","to","find","out","that","shahrukh","have","a","small","part","of","no","substanc","and","that","too","onli","in","the","part","of","thi","idiot","filmbr","br","just","let","me","repeat","the","question","why","would","a","yearold","love","divya","have","fall","for","a","plu","long","hair","chubbi","swell","piglet","like","rishi","kapoor","rishi","kapoor","should","be","asham","of","take","thi","part","the","onli","thing","he","do","be","ridicul","himself","he","romanc","a","girl","who","can","logic","be","young","than","hi","own","daughter","and","to","make","thing","wrong","act","like","a","teenag","at","hi","fourti","on","top","of","that","just","to","make","himself","much","pathet","he","plai","a","popstarbr","br","to","make","thing","clear","i","have","no","problem","with","actor","romanc","ladi","much","young","than","thei","themselv","be","a","long","a","thei","make","a","convinc","coupl","there","should","be","no","problem","in","fact","lead","actor","have","alwai","be","cast","opposit","young","girl","amitabh","bachchansridevi","mithun","chakrabortymadhuri","dixit","shahrukh","khandeepika","salman","khansneha","ullal","and","make","the","pair","pretti","good","conjur","i","have","noth","against","rishi","kapoor","i","think","he","be","a","good","actor","and","hi","act","in","bobbi","be","still","wellengrav","in","my","heart","but","it","not","that","he","look","in","thi","film","like","sai","shahrukh","khan","salman","khan","or","aamir","khan","look","todaybr","br","that","be","such","a","disappoint","oh","and","a","for","the","reason","everi","person","actual","watch","thi","film","shahrukh","khan","make","a","good","debut","he","excel","in","the","veri","littl","hi","part","allow","him","to","do","the","late","divya","bharti","make","a","promis","debut","a","good","if","you","want","to","watch","thi","film","go","for","the","half","onli","person","i","would","not","do","even","that"],"filtered":["realli","want","watch","thi","seem","old","raj","kanwar","movi","disgust","even","befor","start","watch","becaus","consid","even","close","mediocr","filmmak","onli","reason","take","thi","obvious","shahrukh","khan","appear","film","even","know","film","becaus","sure","ordinari","fairi","tale","imagin","love","stori","shahrukh","khan","divya","bharti","substanti","support","role","rishi","kapoor","think","plai","father","uncl","complet","shock","rishi","kapoor","actual","hero","romanc","young","divya","sadden","find","shahrukh","small","part","substanc","onli","part","thi","idiot","filmbr","br","let","repeat","question","yearold","love","divya","fall","plu","long","hair","chubbi","swell","piglet","like","rishi","kapoor","rishi","kapoor","asham","take","thi","part","onli","thing","ridicul","romanc","girl","logic","young","hi","daughter","make","thing","wrong","act","like","teenag","hi","fourti","top","make","much","pathet","plai","popstarbr","br","make","thing","clear","problem","actor","romanc","ladi","much","young","thei","themselv","long","thei","make","convinc","coupl","problem","fact","lead","actor","alwai","cast","opposit","young","girl","amitabh","bachchansridevi","mithun","chakrabortymadhuri","dixit","shahrukh","khandeepika","salman","khansneha","ullal","make","pair","pretti","good","conjur","noth","rishi","kapoor","think","good","actor","hi","act","bobbi","still","wellengrav","heart","look","thi","film","like","sai","shahrukh","khan","salman","khan","aamir","khan","look","todaybr","br","disappoint","oh","reason","everi","person","actual","watch","thi","film","shahrukh","khan","make","good","debut","excel","veri","littl","hi","part","allow","late","divya","bharti","make","promis","debut","good","want","watch","thi","film","go","half","onli","person","even"],"filtered2":["realli","want","watch","seem","old","raj","kanwar","disgust","even","befor","start","watch","becaus","consid","even","close","mediocr","filmmak","onli","reason","take","obvious","shahrukh","khan","appear","even","know","becaus","sure","ordinari","fairi","tale","imagin","love","stori","shahrukh","khan","divya","bharti","substa

{"value":"Being that I loved the original \"Caligula\" even with all its flaws, I have to say this remake trailer was abysmal.<br /><br />Listening to Jovovich say in that lazy American accent \"Mmm cuhligyooluh...\" makes me feel sick. The set doesn't look Roman at all... it looks like some rich actor's Hollywood mansion backyard, and the Roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop.<br /><br />That \"charming\" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty year old Hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind, as if not knowing it's a movie trailer.<br /><br />The acting has got to be some of the worst I've ever seen, with most of the lines I hear being random actors screaming \"CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!\" as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can.<br /><br />The random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and the scenes with notable actors/actresses like Gerard Butler (who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds) not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all-out over the top with their minimal lines, just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery.<br /><br />Courtney Love's part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack-whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something. You can't tell because she's either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically.<br /><br />Karen Black is just annoying... randomly laughing, and screaming in such a way that irritates you.<br /><br />Helen Mirren... she was in the original, and her return to \"Caligula\" consists of... \"CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" I particularly \"love\" (and by love, I mean hate) Ennia's line, \"Caligola... j00 no maki me *something incoherent*.... *something that sounds like j00nalo*\" It's also insanely arrogant to say Caligula's four year reign was greater than Jesus's birth and death.<br /><br />Honestly, this has got to be the worst, most exploitative, self-indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as \"art\" I've ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he shouldn't have shown up or given his name over for this crap-pile, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen).

{"value":"This film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed...before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental. This ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it; as Rino Di Silvestro's messy film completely lacks vision, and if there is any point to the plot; it wasn't put there on purpose. Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a 'so bad it's good' film, but I completely disagree. Normally, I enjoy films like this; but Werewolf Woman is indeed a bad film, and despite all the sex and savagery on display; it doesn't even make for a fun watch, and that really is unforgivable. The film really doesn't have much plot, but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman, who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf. She dreams of going out and finding men, having sex with them and eventually killing them. Back in the real world, she falls in love, but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge...<br /><br />The film is made up of scenes of sex and gore, which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events. These scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters; but they really don't do that, and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film. It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot, and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice. The sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic, but the gore works well. The premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation, as there's plenty of naked women, and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica; but this isn't capitalised on, and while I can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines, I really can't stand watching films and being bored. Overall, I wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans. There's plenty of better stuff than this out there, and while the title may sound intriguing - the film isn't.","finished_norm":["thi","film","end","with","a","speech","in","which","the","narrat","tell","u","the","fate","of","two","of","the","lead","charact","and","that","the","name","of","peopl","and","place","have","be","changedbefor","tell","u","that","relat","to","actual","peopl","and","event","be","pure","coincident","thi","end","line","actual","sum","up","everyth","that","have","go","befor","it","a","rino","di","silvestro","messi","film","complet","lack","vision","and","if","there","be","ani","point","to","the","plot","it","be","not","put","there","on","purpos","werewolf","woman","be","often","see","a","a","guilti","pleasur","or","a","so","bad","it","good","film","but","i","complet","disagre","normal","i","enjoi","film","like","thi","but","werewolf","woman","be","ind","a","bad","film","and","despit","all","the","sex","and","savageri","on","displai","it","doe","not","even","make","for","a","fun","watch","and","that","realli","be","unforgiv","the","film","realli","doe","not","have","much","plot","but","the","thin","sliver","we","be","give","involv","a","young","woman","who","conjur","happen","to","dream","that","she","be","a","werewolf","she","dream","of","go","out","and","find","man","have","sex","with","them","and","eventu","kill","them","back","in","the","real","world","she","fall","in","love","but","her","lover","be","kill","and","she","go","out","for","revengebr","br","the","film","be","make","up","of","scene","of","sex","and","gore","which","be","pad","out","with","extrem","dull","talk","sequenc","in","which","variou","charact","mull","over","the","recent","event","thi","scene","be","probabl","there","to","forward","the","plot","and","build","charact","but","thei","realli","do","not","do","that","and","succ","onli","in","turn","what","can","have","be","a","passabl","exploit","romp","into","a","extrem","underwhelm","film","it","would","seem","that","the","director","be","much","interest","in","styl","and","atmospher","than","the","plot","and","thi","be","show","by","the","fact","that","the","film","look","and","sound","nice","the","sex","scene","be","often","overlong","and","not","veri","erot","but","the","gore","work","good","the","premis","be","ripe","for","give","wai","to","a","veri","sexi","slice","of","exploit","a","there","plenti","of","nake","woman","and","the","fact","that","the","central","charact","have","a","werewolf","origin","mean","that","there","can","be","plenti","of","erotica","but","thi","be","not","capitalis","on","and","while","i","can","stomach","huge","dose","of","bad","act","and","poorli","do","plot","line","i","realli","ca","not","stand","watch","film","and","be","bore","overal","i","would","not","even","recommend","thi","film","to","big","exploit","fan","there","plenti","of","well","stuff","than","thi","out","there","and","while","the","titl","mai","sound","intrigu","the","film","be","not"],"filtered":["thi","film","end","speech","narrat","tell","u","fate","two","lead","charact","name","peopl","place","changedbefor","tell","u","relat","actual","peopl","event","pure","coincident","thi","end","line","actual","sum","everyth","go","befor","rino","di","silvestro","messi","film","complet","lack","vision","ani","point","plot","put","purpos","werewolf","woman","often","see","guilti","pleasur","bad","good","film","complet","disagre","normal","enjoi","film","like","thi","werewolf","woman","ind","bad","film","despit","sex","savageri","displai","doe","even","make","fun","watch","realli","unforgiv","film","realli","doe","much","plot","thin","sliver","give","involv","young","woman","conjur","happen","dream","werewolf","dream","go","find","man","sex","eventu","kill","back","real","world","fall","love","lover","kill","go","revengebr","br","film","make","scene","sex","gore","pad","extrem","dull","talk","sequenc","variou","charact","mull","recent","event","thi","scene","probabl","forward","plot","build","charact","thei","realli","succ","onli","turn","passabl","exploit","romp","extrem","underwhelm","film","seem","director","much","interest","styl","atmospher","plot","thi","show","fact","film","look","sound","nice","sex","scene","often","overlong","veri","erot","gore","work","good","premis","ripe","give","wai","veri","sexi","slice","exploit","plenti","nake","woman","fact","central","charact","werewolf","origin","mean","plenti","erotica","thi","capitalis","stomach","huge","dose","bad","act","poorli","plot","line","realli","ca","stand","watch","film","bore","overal","even","recommend","thi","film","big","exploit","fan","plenti","well","stuff","thi","titl","mai","sound","intrigu","film"],"filtered2":["end","speech","narrat","tell","u","fate","two","lead","charact","name","peopl","place","changedbefor","tell","u","relat","actual","peopl","event","pure","coincident","end","line","actual","sum","everyth","go","befor","rino","di","silvestro","messi","complet","lack","vision","ani","point","plot","put","purpos","werewolf","woman","often","see","guilti","pleasur","bad","good","complet","disagre","normal"

{"value":"I watched full house when I was younger and I can not understand why I did. I don't remember really enjoying the show. I think I and the majority of Americans watching this were hypnotized by its badness. It will put you in a trance state and there is no going back. I am still scarred but I try to move on. I know it's a family show but that does not mean it has to be SO bad. The show is SO cliché with every episode ending with a \"talk\" from the dad to make everyone's problems go away. The characters on the show are all loathsome. There is a know it all, cleaning obsessed, corny father who you want to punch in the face every time he comes on screen. We then have a supposed \"rocker\" uncle that is just there to look pretty for the moms that have to watch this crap. We have another uncle who is completely unfunny who does lame Bullwinkle impressions (need I say more about him). There is the eldest daughter who can not act and is always whining about something. Then a middle daughter who always says, \"HOW RUDE!\" to pretty much everything anyone says. Finally, there is the youngest daughter Michelle. Do not get me started on Michelle played but the horrible actors known as The Olsen Twins. If you believe in Christianity I guess you would associate her with the antichrist. She is always demanding things, trying too hard to be \"cute\", is constantly saying \"DUH!\" and rolling her eyes which makes you want to smack her. I am not a big fan of using a lot of physical abuse as punishment to children. But in her case, I would make an acceptation. She needed it on a daily basis. She is the most selfish character to ever be introduced to mainstream television. One example of this is when her rocker uncle is busy doing his job in the attic. The brat decides to constantly annoy him and demand attention. He yells at her and she gets upset. POOR BABY! The rest of the episode is catering to her emotional needs and the uncle eventually apologizes to her. UGGHH! The show will lower your IQ along with slowly destroying your will to live. I am surprised we don't hear in the news about full house being played in the background when police find people that have committed suicide. Do yourself a favor and do not watch reruns of the show.

{"value":"This film actually works from a fairly original idea - I've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway. However, the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest; we follow a bunch of kids that, for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest. The fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks/nutcases/zombies etc; but really, the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme. Many films of this ilk don't have a single good idea - and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one. The only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they're beautiful women that the characters lust for, rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from. This is good up until a point; but it soon gets boring, and the almost complete lack of any back-story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the 'horror trash' category.<br /><br />It's been years since The Evil Dead made the woodlands a prime horror location, and in spite of films like The Blair Witch Project; it still makes for an excellent horror setting. This is one of the film's major assets, as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown - the only problem is that Forest of the Damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its sleeve. The death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination, and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme doesn't help, as you're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away. The cast is made up of kids mainly, but there is a role here for Tom Savini; who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department. The only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves. The naked ladies tend to look great, and if it wasn't for them, this film would get very boring very quickly. There's nothing to recommend this film for really; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment

{"value":"The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in his film \"Jawab'(1985) too. The problem here is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action-thriller (viz. Khakee) or an emotions-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome. If we ignore two of his-Pukar (2000) and Lajja(2001), this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value. Therefore this film comes as a surprise, as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of his protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with his own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee\" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all, there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre, newcomer actor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work, two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half, Santoshi's fast-paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character. But all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your Family!","finished_norm":["the","premis","and","subject","about","make","a","crimin","realiz","what","hi","victim","go","through","by","captur","hi","famili","hostag","sound","promis","and","interest","but","thi","be","the","onli","interest","part","which","be","conjur","deal","year","ago","with","quit","finess","by","director","ravi","tandon","in","hi","film","jawab","too","the","problem","here","be","ac","director","rajkumar","santoshi","find","himself","in","some","sort","of","confus","a","to","whether","to","make","it","a","fast","pace","actionthril","viz","khake","or","a","emotionsrich","heavi","duti","drama","viz","damini","and","thi","confus","be","quit","evid","in","the","final","outcom","if","we","ignor","two","of","hispukar","and","lajja","thi","brilliant","director","have","alwai","give","u","fairli","engross","film","with","high","entertain","valu","therefor","thi","film","come","a","a","surpris","a","to","what","make","thi","script","sensit","director","go","for","halfbak","character","of","both","of","hi","protagonistsamitabh","bachchan","and","aryeman","a","the","film","be","get","over","audienc","do","not","know","whom","to","hate","and","whom","to","sympath","with","and","thi","factor","be","the","major","limit","forc","in","the","complet","narrat","therefor","what","start","a","a","war","between","a","common","man","and","a","underworld","don","end","on","a","strang","note","of","selfreal","and","regret","by","the","don","about","what","go","wrong","with","hi","own","famili","the","revel","of","don","son","a","a","real","baddi","doe","not","come","a","a","surpris","elem","in","the","climax","which","if","compar","to","similar","situat","in","khake","work","so","effect","with","aishwarya","charact","that","be","not","all","there","be","much","to","it","the","whole","dramat","of","life","of","a","underworld","don","oper","from","abroad","look","quit","illog","hi","openli","land","up","at","mumbai","from","where","he","be","suppos","to","be","abscond","a","good","a","run","after","hi","enemi","and","shoot","them","himself","doe","not","look","believ","pitch","a","mediocr","newcom","actor","like","aryeman","opposit","mr","bachchan","be","again","not","a","good","idea","but","nonetheless","film","have","some","plu","point","ashok","mehta","fine","camerawork","two","good","fight","sequenc","coordin","abba","ali","moughal","some","light","wellact","scene","of","akshai","kumar","in","the","ist","half","santoshi","fastpac","slick","treatment","and","of","cours","mr","bachchan","a","usual","try","hard","to","put","some","life","into","hi","lifeless","charact","but","all","thi","put","togeth","doe","not","make","thi","view","a","excit","experi","for","you","and","your","famili"],"filtered":["premis","subject","make","crimin","realiz","hi","victim","go","captur","hi","famili","hostag","sound","promis","interest","thi","onli","interest","part","conjur","deal","year","ago","quit","finess","director","ravi","tandon","hi","film","jawab","problem","ac","director","rajkumar","santoshi","find","sort","confus","whether","make","fast","pace","actionthril","viz","khake","emotionsrich","heavi","duti","drama","viz","damini","thi","confus","quit","evid","final","outcom","ignor","two","hispukar","lajja","thi","brilliant","director","alwai","give","u","fairli","engross","film","high","entertain","valu","therefor","thi","film","come","surpris","make","thi","script","sensit","director","go","halfbak","character","hi","protagonistsamitabh","bachchan","aryeman","film","get","audienc","know","hate","sympath","thi","factor","major","limit","forc","complet","narrat","therefor","start","war","common","man","underworld","end","strang","note","selfreal","regret","go","wrong","hi","famili","revel","son","real","baddi","doe","come","surpris","elem","climax","compar","similar","situat","khake","work","effect","aishwarya","charact","much","whole","dramat","life","underworld","oper","abroad","look","quit","illog","hi","openli","land","mumbai","suppos","abscond","good","run","hi","enemi","shoot","doe","look","believ","pitch","mediocr","newcom","actor","like","aryeman","opposit","mr","bachchan","good","idea","nonetheless","film","plu","point","ashok","mehta","fine","camerawork","two","good","fight","sequenc","coordin","abba","ali","moughal","light","wellact","scene","akshai","kumar","ist","half","santoshi","fastpac","slick","treatment","cours","mr","bachchan","usual","try","hard","put","life","hi","lifeless","charact","thi","put","togeth","doe","make","thi","view","excit","experi","famili"],"filtered2":["premis","subject","make","crimin","realiz","victim","go","captur","famili","hostag","sound","promis","interest","onli","interest","part","conjur","deal","year","ago","quit","finess","director","ravi","tandon","jawab","problem","ac","director","rajkumar","santoshi","find","sort","confus","whether","make","fast","pace","actionthril","viz","khake","emotionsrich","heavi","duti","drama","viz","damini","confus","quit","evid","final","outc

{"value":"Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this a double entendre about the star?) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day. And it works for that for that purpose: being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.<br /><br />The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice. His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship. Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs. On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed 'Anonymous' as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity. At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not. Both have ex post facto regrets. Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and is indeed cheating on Alice. Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as 'Anonymous' to test his fidelity. The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise (of sorts) of the fluffy script.<br /><br />British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting. Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved. But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages. One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive. There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor, but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise.

{"value":"I don't like using the word \"awful\" to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time, effort, talent and money is spent in its creation but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte Brontë's novel 'Jane Eyre' is a total waste of time.<br /><br />The script is lacking in finesse and power, everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination. The lead actors are woefully miscast, clearly hired for their star names, and the musical score drippy and dull. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all. She is like a wet noodle, worse even than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick.<br /><br />Joan Plowright's Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out. <br /><br />There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the would-be second wife, played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty cipher.<br /><br />Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as Jane's Aunt, Mrs Reed. She would have been better-cast as Mrs Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved school teacher, evokes any authentic sympathy or believability. <br /><br />I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after viewing Robert Young's for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib.<br /><br />I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I've read some very good things on this web-site. I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /><br />About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, beyond that it is a complete

{"value":"The summary pretty much sums it all up. This is nowhere near as good as the original. With a script co-written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he was also writing Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone.<br /><br />Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.<br /><br />Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon. He eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex-forces to placate Rambo.<br /><br />The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself. He is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.<br /><br />After a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a cute woman) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.<br /><br />He finds there are still prisoners and rescues one. As the 3 flee from half the Vietnamese Army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick-up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board.<br /><br />Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. It is clear as Trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.<br /><br />Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz.

{"value":"This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece, even better than say Gosford Park. Then it inexplicably slows down, loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story, several threads started are not ended.<br /><br />*******SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and Cécile. He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago, despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco. As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of Cécile's marriage. Having accomplished this, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together. *******END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />It remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraq's former regime. Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?). Her sister is traditional Islamic, and enters a relation with Cécile's husband. It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art.<br /><br />Deneuve and Depardieu are great.

{"value":"I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend how \"great it was\".<br /><br />Now, I am pretty conservative in my views, but I knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it. I figured before the movie started Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses, and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought thats where the political statement would begin and end.<br /><br />OK, the plot was solid: Single president falls for a lobbyist. OK, this has potential I thought to be pretty entertaining, since the plot was unique. But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial. The movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the President and Sydney(Annette Bening).<br /><br />There were several ridiculous premises in this movie: 1) The character Sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a \"closer\". Could she have been more flighty? She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything. Hardly a \"closer\". I am an sales, and she could not \"close\" selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst.<br /><br />2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible.<br /><br />3) The speech at the end was simply ludicrous. The line about \"I am a proud card carrying member of the ACLU\" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit something like that, being an active member of an ultra fringe group. Second, why even bring something like that up. You just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative.<br /><br />I thought the plot was great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the movie went from being a \"movie\" to a left wing political statement, which is why the movie failed.<br /><br />Its a shame to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their

{"value":"Okay...so i've seen a lot of really odd/unusual movies in my day. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think of that. Well not anymore...from here on out, whenever someone asks me, \"hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?\" Slipstream is what i'll say! And I do not mean \"unusual\" in a good way.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the movie, it was obvious that this was going to be one of those \"trippy camera effect\" movies. By that I mean, little things like flashing images on the screen, rewinding and fast-forwarding people's words and scenes, messing with the color on the screen, flash forwards and flash backs constantly...then you have the actual acting itself. People randomly get violent, shoot things/people, say the weirdest things that just don't make much, if any sense.<br /><br />The movie is about a writer who starts to intermingle real life with the book he's writing and for a lack of a better way to explain it, you basically see this \"trip\" he goes on throughout the movie. The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch, not painful! Honestly, I had a real hard time even finishing Slipstream. It kind of hurt my brain a bit.<br /><br />I can see some film buff making a claim as to this movie having certain cinematic nuances that make it not only unique but add to the feeling of dementia...blah, blah, blah. Point is, this movie hurts your brain when you watch it....it makes very little sense, it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over...and you can say you actually sat through it! So in closing, if you want to see a movie that will have you saying \"what the heck\" over and over again both out loud and in your head, go ahead and waste an hour and 30 minutes and check this out.<br /><br />Mr Hopkins, while I applaud you as an actor and commend your choice to take a stab at directing....please, do not ever make a movie like this again. Next time, try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache.","finished_norm":["okayso","i","have","see","a","lot","of","realli","oddunusu","movi","in","my","dai","fear","and","loath","in","la","vega","come","to","mind","when","i","think","of","that","good","not","anymorefrom","here","on","out","whenev","someon","ask","me","hei","what","the","much","unusu","movi","you","have","ever","see","slipstream","be","what","i","will","sai","and","i","do","not","mean","unusu","in","a","good","waybr","br","from","the","veri","begin","of","the","movi","it","be","obviou","that","thi","be","go","to","be","on","of","that","trippi","camera","effect","movi","by","that","i","mean","littl","thing","like","flash","imag","on","the","screen","rewind","and","fastforward","peopl","word","and","scene","mess","with","the","color","on","the","screen","flash","forward","and","flash","back","constantlythen","you","have","the","actual","act","itself","peopl","randomli","get","violent","shoot","thingspeopl","sai","the","weird","thing","that","just","do","not","make","much","if","ani","sensebr","br","the","movi","be","about","a","writer","who","start","to","intermingl","real","life","with","the","book","he","write","and","for","a","lack","of","a","well","wai","to","explain","it","you","basic","see","thi","trip","he","go","on","throughout","the","movi","the","thing","be","johnni","depp","go","on","a","similar","trip","in","fear","and","loath","in","la","vega","but","the","onli","differ","be","that","hi","trip","be","entertain","to","watch","not","pain","honestli","i","have","a","real","hard","time","even","finish","slipstream","it","kind","of","hurt","my","brain","a","bitbr","br","i","can","see","some","film","buff","make","a","claim","a","to","thi","movi","have","certain","cinemat","nuanc","that","make","it","not","onli","uniqu","but","add","to","the","feel","of","dementiablah","blah","blah","point","be","thi","movi","hurt","your","brain","when","you","watch","itit","make","veri","littl","sens","it","take","all","of","your","concentr","to","even","remot","try","and","understand","what","be","go","on","and","even","at","the","end","the","onli","thing","you","can","be","happi","about","be","that","it","overand","you","can","sai","you","actual","sit","through","it","so","in","close","if","you","want","to","see","a","movi","that","will","have","you","sai","what","the","heck","over","and","over","again","both","out","loud","and","in","your","head","go","ahead","and","wast","a","hour","and","minut","and","check","thi","outbr","br","mr","hopkin","while","i","applaud","you","a","a","actor","and","commend","your","choic","to","take","a","stab","at","directingpleas","do","not","ever","make","a","movi","like","thi","again","next","time","try","someth","that","reli","a","littl","much","on","great","storytel","than","camera","techniqu","that","tend","to","leav","the","viewer","with","a","headach"],"filtered":["okayso","see","lot","realli","oddunusu","movi","dai","fear","loath","la","vega","come","mind","think","good","anymorefrom","whenev","someon","ask","hei","much","unusu","movi","ever","see","slipstream","sai","mean","unusu","good","waybr","br","veri","begin","movi","obviou","thi","go","trippi","camera","effect","movi","mean","littl","thing","like","flash","imag","screen","rewind","fastforward","peopl","word","scene","mess","color","screen","flash","forward","flash","back","constantlythen","actual","act","peopl","randomli","get","violent","shoot","thingspeopl","sai","weird","thing","make","much","ani","sensebr","br","movi","writer","start","intermingl","real","life","book","write","lack","well","wai","explain","basic","see","thi","trip","go","throughout","movi","thing","johnni","depp","go","similar","trip","fear","loath","la","vega","onli","differ","hi","trip","entertain","watch","pain","honestli","real","hard","time","even","finish","slipstream","kind","hurt","brain","bitbr","br","see","film","buff","make","claim","thi","movi","certain","cinemat","nuanc","make","onli","uniqu","add","feel","dementiablah","blah","blah","point","thi","movi","hurt","brain","watch","itit","make","veri","littl","sens","take","concentr","even","remot","try","understand","go","even","end","onli","thing","happi","overand","sai","actual","sit","close","want","see","movi","sai","heck","loud","head","go","ahead","wast","hour","minut","check","thi","outbr","br","mr","hopkin","applaud","actor","commend","choic","take","stab","directingpleas","ever","make","movi","like","thi","next","time","try","someth","reli","littl","much","great","storytel","camera","techniqu","tend","leav","viewer","headach"],"filtered2":["okayso","see","lot","realli","oddunusu","dai","fear","loath","la","vega","come","mind","think","good","anymorefrom","whenev","someon","ask","hei","unusu","ever","see","slipstream","mean","unusu","good","waybr","veri","begin","obviou","go","trippi","camera","effect","mean","littl","thing","like","flash","imag","screen","rewind","fastforward","peopl","word","scene","mess","color","screen","flash","forward","flash","back","co

{"value":"Professor Paul Steiner is doing research in matter transference. He has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear, only to have that object re-materialize in a different location. But there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn't succeed. After a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding, Professor Steiner decides to test his machine on himself. As expected, things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill.<br /><br />In hindsight, maybe it wasn't such a good idea to re-watch The Projected Man in the same week I watched The Fly, Return of the Fly, and Curse of the Fly. There seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period. I'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for The Projected Man, but much of it is so similar to the Fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence. However, The Projected Man isn't even nearly as good as the worst of the Fly trilogy.<br /><br />Besides being terribly unoriginal, The Projected Man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie. A big issue I have is with Bryant Haliday in the lead. He's such a horse's ass that, not only do I not care about his suffering, I actually root for it. Supporting cast members Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost as bad. They're so bland and dull they hardly matter. In fact, there's very little to get excited about while watching The Projected Man. The soundtrack  not very memorable. The \"look\"  I would describe much of it as \"muddy\". The plot  predictable. The action  there isn't any. Overall, this is one to avoid.<br /><br />Fortunately, I watched The Projected Man via a copy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode. Funny stuff! While not an absolute, very often, the poorer the movie  the better the MST3K riffs. The guys hit almost all of their marks with The Projected Man. I'll give it a very enthusiastic 4/5 on my MST3K rating

{"value":"Since I'd seen the other three, I figured I might as well catch this made for TV fourth part of The Omen series. As a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece; it's a travesty. The film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. It's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. The film does keep a thread with the original, which I won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. The basics of the plot largely copy Richard Donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name Delia (not Damiella or Damiana, fortunately). There's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at eight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses...<br /><br />The first two sequels to The Omen weren't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. I guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. It brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. The film looks and feels like a TV movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. Indeed, Asia Vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the Antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable. Faye Grant is given the meatiest role, and doesn't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. On the whole, this film really isn't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and doesn't even do justice to weaker second

{"value":"I watched this a few days ago, so details are getting hazy. The film is shot on hand-held cameras, and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally, since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way. I can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything, designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the compromises that come with a big budget, and so was more \"real\". However what we have here isn't much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of Full Metal Jacket, so anyone who has seen that, or any one of the other rip offs there of, will know what to expect.<br /><br />The main problem I had was the stereotyped characters, with the weedy soft kids out of their depth, close harmony singing, Ebonics spouting black dudes, world weary sergeants, bitter and twisted psychos etc etc... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time. Maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation, maybe it was laziness, or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience, all I know is it was annoying. One novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees (where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation,) although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it. This seems to be the main pivot of the plot, with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth, but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way. The other big bug I had was how all the characters (with the exception of the psychos and the real softies) would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence, faced with Farrell's ubiquitous stoicism, immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic.<br /><br />I guess if I had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads, which was strong and very convincing, tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters, this wasn't too hard.<br /><br />In my imagination, Bozz grew up to be Zeke off Tour of Duty, and for my money, 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","a","few","dai","ago","so","detail","be","get","hazi","the","film","be","shoot","on","handheld","camera","and","a","lot","be","make","of","thi","at","the","time","it","be","releas","origin","sinc","we","have","not","have","mani","studio","pictur","make","in","thi","wai","i","ca","not","help","but","feel","thi","be","much","of","a","gimmick","than","anyth","design","to","make","the","audienc","think","that","what","we","be","see","on","the","screen","have","not","have","all","the","compromis","that","come","with","a","big","budget","and","so","be","much","real","howev","what","we","have","here","be","not","much","much","than","a","notasgood","rip","off","of","the","half","of","full","metal","jacket","so","anyon","who","have","see","that","or","ani","on","of","the","other","rip","off","there","of","will","know","what","to","expectbr","br","the","main","problem","i","have","be","the","stereotyp","charact","with","the","weedi","soft","kid","out","of","their","depth","close","harmoni","sing","ebon","spout","black","dude","world","weari","sergeant","bitter","and","twist","psycho","etc","etc","all","be","put","into","the","sort","of","situat","that","would","provid","the","much","friction","and","tension","at","ani","give","time","mayb","thi","be","intent","to","highlight","the","stupid","and","injustic","of","the","situat","mayb","it","be","lazi","or","mayb","it","be","just","a","committe","try","to","appeal","to","the","big","audienc","all","i","know","be","it","be","annoi","on","novel","thing","be","the","mixtur","of","volunt","and","drafte","where","normal","all","the","charact","would","have","be","forc","into","the","situat","although","onli","the","scene","between","the","two","main","charact","realli","make","much","plai","of","it","thi","seem","to","be","the","main","pivot","of","the","plot","with","the","volunt","come","to","their","sens","and","the","drafte","gain","a","sens","of","duti","and","self","worth","but","it","all","do","in","a","rather","forc","and","unsubtl","wai","the","other","big","bug","i","have","be","how","all","the","charact","with","the","except","of","the","psycho","and","the","real","softi","would","react","to","each","inevit","conflict","with","at","aggress","and","threat","of","violenc","face","with","farrel","ubiquit","stoicism","immedi","back","down","and","be","all","reason","and","diplomaticbr","br","i","guess","if","i","have","to","find","a","plu","it","would","be","the","act","from","the","two","lead","which","be","strong","and","veri","convinc","tho","consid","the","formula","natur","of","the","charact","thi","be","not","too","hardbr","br","in","my","imagin","bozz","grow","up","to","be","zeke","off","tour","of","duti","and","for","my","monei","episod","of","that","would","be","much","fun","to","watch"],"filtered":["watch","thi","dai","ago","detail","get","hazi","film","shoot","handheld","camera","lot","make","thi","time","releas","origin","sinc","mani","studio","pictur","make","thi","wai","ca","help","feel","thi","much","gimmick","anyth","design","make","audienc","think","see","screen","compromis","come","big","budget","much","real","howev","much","much","notasgood","rip","half","full","metal","jacket","anyon","see","ani","rip","know","expectbr","br","main","problem","stereotyp","charact","weedi","soft","kid","depth","close","harmoni","sing","ebon","spout","black","dude","world","weari","sergeant","bitter","twist","psycho","etc","etc","put","sort","situat","provid","much","friction","tension","ani","give","time","mayb","thi","intent","highlight","stupid","injustic","situat","mayb","lazi","mayb","committe","try","appeal","big","audienc","know","annoi","novel","thing","mixtur","volunt","drafte","normal","charact","forc","situat","although","onli","scene","two","main","charact","realli","make","much","plai","thi","seem","main","pivot","plot","volunt","come","sens","drafte","gain","sens","duti","self","worth","rather","forc","unsubtl","wai","big","bug","charact","except","psycho","real","softi","react","inevit","conflict","aggress","threat","violenc","face","farrel","ubiquit","stoicism","immedi","back","reason","diplomaticbr","br","guess","find","plu","act","two","lead","strong","veri","convinc","tho","consid","formula","natur","charact","thi","hardbr","br","imagin","bozz","grow","zeke","tour","duti","monei","episod","much","fun","watch"],"filtered2":["watch","dai","ago","detail","get","hazi","shoot","handheld","camera","lot","make","time","releas","origin","sinc","mani","studio","pictur","make","wai","ca","help","feel","gimmick","anyth","design","make","audienc","think","see","screen","compromis","come","big","budget","real","howev","notasgood","rip","half","full","metal","jacket","anyon","see","ani","rip","know","expectbr","main","problem","stereotyp","charact","weedi","soft","kid","depth","close","harmoni","sing","ebon","spout","black","dude","world","weari","sergeant","bitter","twist","psycho","etc","etc","put","sort","situat","pr

{"value":"I admit to liking a lot of the so-called \"frat-pack\" movies. No matter how bad they are, I can find something to like about Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black. But \"Envy\" just left me about as cold as the white horse that Ben disposed of. This time, it's Ben and Jack Black as a couple of nutty neighbors, one of whom (Black) discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other (Stiller) writhes in envy. That's supposedly the plot, but then it veers off in other directions that don't really make much sense.<br /><br />I guess the 'Vapoorize' thing is sort of amusing at first. The problem is, they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture (Black has a license plate that reads 'Caca King') and it gets fairly tiresome. But even Ben and Jack are used poorly; the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down. The two best performances by far are Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken. Walken's neo-hippie-dippie guy is so offbeat and so well-modulated a performance that it really never suggests any of Walken's other familiar nutcase characters. It's completely unique, yet comes across as unmistakably Walken. And Weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about. Even with limited screen time, she still dominates every scene she's in.<br /><br />The whole crux of the so-called drama is that Ben, in a jealous drunken stupor, accidentally shoots Jack's prize white stallion, and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up, fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead. But the plot twist isn't believable because there's nothing about Jack's character to indicate that he would do such a thing. He plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void. You discount it completely. It's all filler. And what's the point of the out-of-control merry-go-round, except that Barry Levinson wants us to know that he's seen \"Strangers on a Train\"? The screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed. Someone with Levinson's track record should know better. Maybe someone will invent something to make this film disappear. Oh, wait, they already

{"value":"I got this in the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You gotta love those bargain packs. For even if they don't feature true remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, there's no denying that there are always a few gems included. And by \"gems\", I mean there's always some good crap to be seen, especially if the films are from the '70s as The Mansion of Madness is.<br /><br />My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens roll it's Poe's Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. Doesn't matter, really, as crap is crap is crap, no? Yes! But saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all. There are some funky elements here and there, and obviously the flick did have a decent budget.<br /><br />The opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap TV look. The dialogue is always hilarious. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. \"WHAT STRENGTH!\" says Our Hero. Funny, then, that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun. You'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end. That's how memorable these characters are.<br /><br />The best part about Mansion of Madness, however, has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure. It's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable. And why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? I'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop. What the hell? Oh yeah, there's plenty of boobies to be seen, too, for those of you that dig such things. Boobies, bad dialogue, and wacky music. That best sums of Mansion of Madness for me. It's well worth at least one viewing, and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or whatnot. I can't say I was ever bored watching it, but I can't deny that it's also a barrel of poop.

{"value":"Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as it wants to be.<br /><br />This is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking. A young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s sci-fi movie called Codename:Dragonfly. Think Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique.<br /><br />But Jeremy Davies is an angst-ridden filmmaker. He's no hack he's an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. Hardly original.<br /><br />All the characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as rice-paper. Characters that might be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing.<br /><br />This movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison. Those movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. Those movies have lessons that apply outside<br /><br />The movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a send-up but what's the satirical target? The actors say it's an homage but I think I would rather a full-length version of Codename:Dragonfly.<br /><br />Coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci-fi movie within a movie. But he fails to share why we should be amused.<br /><br />Outside of the sci-fi movie its just a mess. There are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after its already been chosen. What?<br /><br />Just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story, lack of a point, a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms.<br /><br />I guess if your Roman Coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst-ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing. In that sense it may be considered autobiograhical.<br /><br />I would watch it at Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Watch the 15-minute Codename:Dragonfly movies included on the DVD as extras and then send it back.","finished_norm":["styl","but","no","substanc","not","a","funni","a","it","should","be","not","a","deep","a","it","want","to","bebr","br","thi","be","anoth","in","the","genr","of","film","about","the","difficulti","of","filmmak","a","young","filmak","be","hire","to","finish","a","campi","scifi","movi","call","codenamedragonfli","think","barbarella","or","danger","diaboliquebr","br","but","jeremi","davi","be","a","angstridden","filmmak","he","no","hack","he","a","artist","the","movi","he","want","to","make","be","a","diari","of","hi","life","hardli","originalbr","br","all","the","charact","outsid","of","jeremi","davi","filmmak","be","a","thin","a","ricepap","charact","that","mai","be","interest","such","a","hi","father","hi","doppelgang","or","jason","schwarzmann","a","a","hack","director","be","introduc","and","then","show","the","door","without","add","a","thingbr","br","thi","movi","be","full","of","ey","candi","but","when","compar","to","other","film","about","filmmak","such","a","stardust","memori","or","it","pale","in","comparison","that","movi","be","funni","provoc","with","welldevelop","charact","that","movi","have","lesson","that","appli","outsidebr","br","the","movi","want","to","be","comic","and","campi","but","it","just","deriv","and","there","be","not","on","funni","scene","the","filmmak","describ","it","a","a","sendup","but","what","the","satir","target","the","actor","sai","it","a","homag","but","i","think","i","would","rather","a","fulllength","version","of","codenamedragonflybr","br","coppola","be","clearli","amus","by","the","set","a","be","evid","by","the","visual","humor","of","the","scifi","movi","within","a","movi","but","he","fail","to","share","why","we","should","be","amusedbr","br","outsid","of","the","scifi","movi","it","just","a","mess","there","be","continu","error","the","filmmak","choos","a","scifi","weapon","after","it","alreadi","be","choos","whatbr","br","just","becaus","he","have","a","scene","be","the","filmmak","be","confront","by","the","critic","complain","about","the","lack","of","stori","lack","of","a","point","a","scene","where","he","admit","empti","clever","doe","not","mean","that","he","have","address","that","criticismsbr","br","i","guess","if","your","roman","coppola","you","can","get","awai","with","make","a","movi","about","a","angstridden","idealist","filmmak","who","doe","not","know","what","he","want","to","sai","and","so","end","up","sai","noth","in","that","sens","it","mai","be","consid","autobiograhicalbr","br","i","would","watch","it","at","circuit","citi","on","a","wall","full","of","tv","if","i","have","a","choic","watch","the","minut","codenamedragonfli","movi","includ","on","the","dvd","a","extra","and","then","send","it","back"],"filtered":["styl","substanc","funni","deep","want","bebr","br","thi","anoth","genr","film","difficulti","filmmak","young","filmak","hire","finish","campi","scifi","movi","call","codenamedragonfli","think","barbarella","danger","diaboliquebr","br","jeremi","davi","angstridden","filmmak","hack","artist","movi","want","make","diari","hi","life","hardli","originalbr","br","charact","outsid","jeremi","davi","filmmak","thin","ricepap","charact","mai","interest","hi","father","hi","doppelgang","jason","schwarzmann","hack","director","introduc","show","door","without","add","thingbr","br","thi","movi","full","ey","candi","compar","film","filmmak","stardust","memori","pale","comparison","movi","funni","provoc","welldevelop","charact","movi","lesson","appli","outsidebr","br","movi","want","comic","campi","deriv","funni","scene","filmmak","describ","sendup","satir","target","actor","sai","homag","think","rather","fulllength","version","codenamedragonflybr","br","coppola","clearli","amus","set","evid","visual","humor","scifi","movi","within","movi","fail","share","amusedbr","br","outsid","scifi","movi","mess","continu","error","filmmak","choos","scifi","weapon","alreadi","choos","whatbr","br","becaus","scene","filmmak","confront","critic","complain","lack","stori","lack","point","scene","admit","empti","clever","doe","mean","address","criticismsbr","br","guess","roman","coppola","get","awai","make","movi","angstridden","idealist","filmmak","doe","know","want","sai","end","sai","noth","sens","mai","consid","autobiograhicalbr","br","watch","circuit","citi","wall","full","tv","choic","watch","minut","codenamedragonfli","movi","includ","dvd","extra","send","back"],"filtered2":["styl","substanc","funni","deep","want","bebr","anoth","genr","difficulti","filmmak","young","filmak","hire","finish","campi","scifi","call","codenamedragonfli","think","barbarella","danger","diaboliquebr","jeremi","davi","angstridden","filmmak","hack","artist","want","make","diari","life","hardli","originalbr","charact","outsid","jeremi","davi","filmmak","thin","ricepap","charact","mai","interest","father","doppelgang","jason","schwarzmann","hack","director","introduc","show","door","without","add","thingbr","full","ey","candi","compar","filmmak","stardust","

{"value":"I saw an interview with Rob Schneider (who plays the lead character, Marvin Mange, in this film.) He said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you'd be laughing at this movie. Obviously that must be the secret. I had the volume turned up. I was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster, and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after Schneider's hilarious performance in \"Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo.\"<br /><br />The story is stupid: Mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton), and as a result starts to lose control of his \"animal instincts.\" This makes him a \"supercop.\" He can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses. Of course, he also has a nasty habit of eating people's cows and trying to seduce their goats, but surely that's a small price to pay? It just didn't do anything for me. <br /><br />The cast left much to be desired. Is there a more irritating actor in all of Hollywood than John McGinley? Here, he plays Sgt. Sisk, Mange's commander on the police force, as a repugnantly cartoonish character (much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular TV series \"Scrubs.\") I was anxious to get a look at Colleen Haskell's first \"serious\" acting job (can anything in this movie be called \"serious?\") She, of course, gained her fame as a contestant on the first \"Survivor\" and she proves here what we knew from that: she's cute as a button. What she doesn't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress. And what's with Ed Asner as Police Chief Wilson. I mean, how old is this guy now? He's the size of some of the cows Mange tried to eat, and he seemed out of breath the whole way through. I'm surprised he made it through the filming. There's a brief cameo at the end by Adam Sandler (who also served as Executive Producer of this.)<br /><br />Anyway, I chuckled twice: Mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car, and the scene Schneider has with Haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more acting talent! So, for two chuckles -

{"value":"Dear me... Peter Sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been. But his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He didn't seem to realize how to use his talents. He would have been better off working with more of the Kubricks of the film world than the people he did. Of his later films, only \"The Optimists of Nine Elms\" and \"Being There\" have impressed me of those I have seen.<br /><br />That said, the Boultings and Sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - I have yet to see \"Carlton Browne\" and \"Heavens Above!\" - at least in the sense of using Sellers well to a degree. But, \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" really is a poor film and a dire choice on Sellers' part in terms of character. In his films from 1955-64, you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. Here, you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. It's almost Sellers playing a Niven cad without the joviality. He certainly does not convince, try as he might, or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as Cary Grant, and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.<br /><br />Hawn and Sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy, genial romance of the like perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is very artificial seeming, all the way through - I know that it is part of Danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies, but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces. Sellers has a very grating way of playing \"charm\" as well... this character really has no depth, and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest. Sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty, iconoclastic performance in \"Lolita\".<br /><br />There really is nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, as frankly they leave little or no impression. This is truly one of the most anaemic, complacent, misguided and lightly dull films I have ever seen. A nonentity of a \"vehicle\" for Sellers' undisputed talents.<br /><br />Rating:- *
