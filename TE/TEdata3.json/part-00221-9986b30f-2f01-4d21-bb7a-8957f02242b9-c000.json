{"value":"Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing! This time, it's being brought to you by the never-inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As far as exploitation movies go, this one doesn't click! As science fiction, it's plain unoriginal! All that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the Earth, and showing off all that's nearly bare to resist! Give me a f---ing break!!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, then why not dust off those old SI swimsuit mags from the attic for a change?! This would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high, but that still wouldn't make this one great. I'd like to point out another film called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why top-notch 1st-person \"femme fatale\" action movies don't translate well in America.

{"value":"Revolution is a terrible movie, I don't care if you're a history teacher, news writer, Al Pacino fan, there's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate '10'.<br /><br />The key point to the plot is Tom Dobb (Al) trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat. Everything revolves around that note. Tom's son joins the army to make up for the note, making Tom join the army as well, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat. The End.<br /><br />It had a few battle scenes, and they were pretty mediocre at best. Transistions between scenes used \"five months later\" and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle. The love story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow. So save your \"Notes\" and watch the Patriot instead.","finished_norm":["revolut","be","a","terribl","movi","i","do","not","care","if","you","re","a","histori","teacher","new","writer","al","pacino","fan","there","no","wai","thi","movi","can","possibli","earn","a","legitim","br","br","the","kei","point","to","the","plot","be","tom","dobb","al","try","to","get","monei","from","a","note","he","get","for","radic","patriot","take","hi","boat","everyth","revolv","around","that","note","tom","son","join","the","armi","to","make","up","for","the","note","make","tom","join","the","armi","a","good","thei","go","on","a","adventur","try","to","get","out","of","the","armi","year","late","the","war","be","over","and","thei","can","final","turn","in","the","note","for","their","boat","the","endbr","br","it","have","a","few","battl","scene","and","thei","be","pretti","mediocr","at","well","transist","between","scene","us","five","month","late","and","magic","put","the","charact","in","some","famou","histor","battl","the","love","stori","be","a","joke","and","the","movi","a","a","whole","be","just","hard","to","follow","so","save","your","note","and","watch","the","patriot","instead"],"filtered":["revolut","terribl","movi","care","re","histori","teacher","new","writer","al","pacino","fan","wai","thi","movi","possibli","earn","legitim","br","br","kei","point","plot","tom","dobb","al","try","get","monei","note","get","radic","patriot","take","hi","boat","everyth","revolv","around","note","tom","son","join","armi","make","note","make","tom","join","armi","good","thei","go","adventur","try","get","armi","year","late","war","thei","final","turn","note","boat","endbr","br","battl","scene","thei","pretti","mediocr","well","transist","scene","us","five","month","late","magic","put","charact","famou","histor","battl","love","stori","joke","movi","whole","hard","follow","save","note","watch","patriot","instead"],"filtered2":["revolut","terribl","care","re","histori","teacher","new","writer","al","pacino","fan","wai","possibli","earn","legitim","kei","point","plot","tom","dobb","al","try","get","monei","note","get","radic","patriot","take","boat","everyth","revolv","around","note","tom","son","join","armi","make","note","make","tom","join","armi","good","go","adventur","try","get","armi","year","late","war","final","turn","note","boat","endbr","battl","scene","pretti","mediocr","well","transist","scene","us","five","month","late","magic","put","charact","famou","histor","battl","love","stori","joke","whole","hard","follow","save","note","watch","patriot","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,10,17,19,20,31,32,33,36,54,56,57,66,68,78,87,96,98,111,126,140,150,152,156,159,166,171,189,193,205,214,260,287,314,434,499,505,558,560,759,786,787,865,953,982,1022,1076,1114,1231,1236,1312,1319,1450,1506,2059,2239,2295,2465,3191,4077,4146],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,10,17,19,20,31,32,33,36,54,56,57,66,68,78,87,96,98,111,126,140,150,152,156,159,166,171,189,193,205,214,260,287,314,434,499,505,558,560,759,786,787,865,953,982,1022,1076,1114,1231,1236,1312,1319,1450,1506,2059,2239,2295,2465,3191,4077,4146],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,2.389902141215977,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,2.9360366939211433,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,2.0064197866819473,2.115024371522662,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,2.1183455303375887,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,4.665424022293026,2.3131195476980753,2.3451551414151686,2.300267965194495,2.4423870329693536,2.373087554090762,2.498193474075453,2.517840471459249,2.571852579609833,2.7303758068497004,2.6754694156628323,2.841890188081905,3.189397019426827,3.4101163271295305,3.3814747511661465,3.3956930001684253,3.4572130107926293,17.311510401500502,11.909196345194859,7.800348862726086,3.760240652919071,3.9201351739255808,4.1302590120314875,12.466347782580137,4.165705761027235,4.202455303235976,4.364659717870332,4.327618446189983,4.396611317676934,9.292144354617035,8.806251997396256,9.359947457968397,4.605250182788262,4.911775343041523,5.014723312293965,5.521540914662417,5.463272006538442,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,11.874112717248165]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.88013673885367E-5,4.8472288359407444E-5,4.8849114180692705E-5,4.856686347854962E-5,4.856765919192753E-5,4.849977131005E-5,4.864401642537292E-5,4.847926805220379E-5,4.858826711957444E-5,5.3906030040172696E-5,0.6618742749162576,4.840101182506955E-5,4.930439270886433E-5,5.000773070480773E-5,4.843630533797789E-5,4.8302448288321706E-5,4.9507292

{"value":"Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.<br /><br />Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986. The movie falls into the 80's trap of weird/stupid special effects, including some weird demented looking rocking horse.<br /><br />Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters. This also isn't really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has the avg. horror flick fall backs, gore, pointless nudity, knocks against the catholic church. Basic stuff, boring movie.<br /><br />The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10.

{"value":"This kind of \"inspirational\" saccharine is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth. It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it. The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car; I guess you'd need such prompting to feel if you're stupid enough to watch a film as simple-minded and sappy as this. Streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that---a display, switched on and off like a light. Because I can't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film. Even though it's based on a true story, and an inspirational one at that I'm sure, the set-up, execution and performances play like a third-rate TV movie or half-witted high school

{"value":"Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners, perhaps the wittiest play ever written, is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast. Sanders is, as one would expect, casually, indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed, the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the Hays office insisted. Preminger's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal. Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words.

{"value":"It's amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release. I mean..... look at the cast here , the promotion is superb, good enough songs and the trailers are fine. This makes it a house full on the first day, but it's only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable. House full the first day , the movie is out the next week. <br /><br />This film, inspired by 'Love Actually' is what they say, didn't manage to handle the whole cast well. They tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can't connect with any single one of them.

{"value":"This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this film suck? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not slam the effects/gore, as I understand that this is low budget. But was there even one zombie that was not obese? C'mon! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find some.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier \"Stands at attention\". Please, don't put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. This was an ugly movie filled with ugly people, and has no business even mentioning Romero on the cover.

{"value":"Someone mentioned editing. This is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. For starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in? And, what exactly are they testing? Apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit. The acting is pretty bad. Everyone is emoting. Everyone is keeping secrets. They frequently mention that if it weren't for the money, they'd hang it up. There's a deranged minister who spouts scripture. On and on. But, again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors. There are some really cheesy elements. Those little rooms and those chaise lounges. The awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper?).

{"value":"Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to \"get started\"... then I waited for it to redeem itself... and when it did neither, I just sat there, dumbfounded that: 1) it could possibly be this bad, and 2) that I had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew couldn't possibly have made this bad of a movie... and boy, did I ever lose my faith! Don't bother with this one! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! I can't believe a script this bad ever got funded! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea, (the word \"concept\" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) and it STILL didn't go anyplace! Its just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst, baffles me!

{"value":"Although I recently put this on my 10 worst films list, I have to say it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in \"The Maddening\" or any of the \"Look Who's Talking\" sequels. Still, it's pretty nauseating, even with sexy Drew Barrymore playing something of a horror-movie answer to Holly Golightly, relocating from New York City to Los Angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look-alike. Poor Sally Kellerman, a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s, is reduced here to a paltry supporting role, and Barrymore's leading man George Newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor, always pausing for a laugh after every line. The picture is swill, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (although right out of a \"Scooby Doo\" episode) is interesting. But as for the finale...get real!

{"value":"I opted to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it had been selected to the Cannes film festival's prestigious Competition section. I was surprised that Cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.<br /><br />The film, some reviewers, have noted does not have too much of gunfire--but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copolla's \"Godfather\" that seem to resurface here in this Chinese/Hong Kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.<br /><br />This film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here.

{"value":"I'm not saying that because the production values were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. That shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? It was terrible, the lighting was just plain bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course not I skipped through most of it, and I don't want to hear anyone say I need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. This film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible. Awful movie...don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors \"funny\" lines, it's because of how painstakingly bad the production

{"value":"My friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the \"hot\" girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was just predicable and annoying.<br /><br />The acting was at times good.....but more times bad. The most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend. The more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen. (you know what fat ugly kid I'm talking about)<br /><br />The plot has been done so many times before i think they should be sued by other movie companies. OK, it is a good idea but thats all this movie had.<br /><br />Overall this movie can only be watched if by your self, to save any abuse from your friends.

{"value":"Well it looked good on paper,Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again, this time on a mix of heist movie, Da Vinci Code,American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed. A reasonable cast(including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) battles against a puerile script and loses badly. The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons.However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mention 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.)I don't think I've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is virtually no suspense, no surprises and no climax- it just stops. National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the

{"value":"This will be best known for the Ferrari that was crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion.<br /><br />Tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn't see the numbers. Largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck. This is not a good movie, but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />Misogynistic, despite the fact one of the leads is a woman, this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls. Want evidence? There are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the Sports illustrated swimsuit DVD.<br

{"value":"The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of Johns best movies. Don't get me wrong, with any John Wayne move there is always some good spots. And this one has it's fair share. But over all the picture moves slow and just doesn't live up to the aspirations it could have been. Bruce Dern again does an outstanding job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better. This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers.<br /><br />This would be a good family move to watch with your children. Just be aware, there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it. But most kids that I know who have seen the movie like it.

{"value":"I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.<br /><br />Not once were any of the scenes believable. The shots were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.<br /><br />2/10; the bonus is from the one time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly.

{"value":"The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution lets it down.<br /><br />The movie lacks pace, for one thing. It should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and more than a little boring.<br /><br />I think the problem's mainly in the screenplay and editing. There aren't enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense, and there are scenes which don't really move the story along very effectively.<br /><br />The producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the writer and the director, this evidently ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />Much of the acting seems kind of flat, and that is down to the director - all the

{"value":"Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care \"Bostid!\" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. No deathless lines in this one.

{"value":"Remember the chain-smoking channeler exposed on 60 Minutes a few years ago? This is her. Lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers. The producers have been using phony \"word of mouth\" promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age dreck and day-old baloney, this film is for you. If you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha isn't a wacko, so you'll give her a bunch of your money.

{"value":"Well I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it wasn't even worth that. It seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain, I am guessing.<br /><br />Neagle - despite her glory, awards, and reputation - is a homely British gal who can't sing or dance or act.<br /><br />Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was mistaken. She was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII. Her \"serious\" roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here.<br /><br />Only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented. Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day.

{"value":"Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all on top form here. They deserve oscar nominations for their performances. I am a great fan of the tv show aswell. Their music rocks and they're all so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM!!!!!!<br /><br />IF YOU'RE AN S CLUB FAN DO NOT READ THIS!!!!!<br /><br />The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even executed properly (i feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so unbelievably bad that 8 little, passionate S Club fans weren't laughing. They thought they could do it better. And they did. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, \"the fat, ugly one who started a mosh band\" must be thanking his lucky stars that he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. BEWARE OF THIS MOVIE! DO NOT GO AND SEE IT!

{"value":"I doubt this will ever even be a cult film. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much out of this film and got even less. What could have been clever and moving was campy. It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of Gram's and all the versions of his \"afterlife adventures\" I have heard. Rock and roll is full of tales, good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt. They can be great stories even though exaggerated. However, this movie took a good story and turned into tripe. Stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull, somehow.

{"value":"Working at a video store I get to see quite a few movies and on occasion I try to watch some of the not so big movies. Proud happened to be one of them. The initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during WWII had some merit. However in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in WWII. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie. I commend the men that served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured.

{"value":"The plot of this movie hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else's daughter. Or, alternately, could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.<br /><br />That said, the characters were acted with conviction by the actors. I thought changing Scott Bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is. You couldn't see into his eyes at

{"value":"After watching the first 20mn of Blanche(sorry I couldn't take more of it), I have now confirmed she does not. <br /><br />Basically, this \"movie\" is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk. It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies (\"Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ\", \"La Folie des Grandeurs\",...): a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a \"finesse\" of direction avoiding the dreaded \"heavy comedy\" stigma.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the horsey-faced Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into an horror movie. Horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.","finished_norm":["after","watch","the","mn","of","blanchesorri","i","can","not","take","much","of","it","i","have","now","confirm","she","doe","not","br","br","basic","thi","movi","be","a","insult","to","the","real","french","actor","particip","in","thi","farcic","piec","of","junk","it","start","from","a","concept","successfulli","us","in","french","comedi","deux","heur","moin","le","quart","avant","jesu","christ","la","foli","de","grandeur","a","histor","movi","with","anachron","tone","dialogu","thi","can","give","brilliant","result","if","support","by","brilliant","actor","and","a","finess","of","direct","avoid","the","dread","heavi","comedi","stigmabr","br","unfortun","the","horseyfac","lou","doillon","ruin","everyth","and","blanch","instead","of","a","comedi","just","turn","into","a","horror","movi","horror","to","cinephil","who","want","to","be","puzzl","and","shock","watch","fine","actor","such","a","decaun","zem","or","rochefort","struggl","in","the","middl","of","thi","gaudi","burlesqu","kitchyprissi","farc"],"filtered":["watch","mn","blanchesorri","take","much","confirm","doe","br","br","basic","thi","movi","insult","real","french","actor","particip","thi","farcic","piec","junk","start","concept","successfulli","us","french","comedi","deux","heur","moin","le","quart","avant","jesu","christ","la","foli","de","grandeur","histor","movi","anachron","tone","dialogu","thi","give","brilliant","result","support","brilliant","actor","finess","direct","avoid","dread","heavi","comedi","stigmabr","br","unfortun","horseyfac","lou","doillon","ruin","everyth","blanch","instead","comedi","turn","horror","movi","horror","cinephil","want","puzzl","shock","watch","fine","actor","decaun","zem","rochefort","struggl","middl","thi","gaudi","burlesqu","kitchyprissi","farc"],"filtered2":["watch","mn","blanchesorri","take","confirm","doe","basic","insult","real","french","actor","particip","farcic","piec","junk","start","concept","successfulli","us","french","comedi","deux","heur","moin","le","quart","avant","jesu","christ","la","foli","de","grandeur","histor","anachron","tone","dialogu","give","brilliant","result","support","brilliant","actor","finess","direct","avoid","dread","heavi","comedi","stigmabr","unfortun","horseyfac","lou","doillon","ruin","everyth","blanch","instead","comedi","turn","horror","horror","cinephil","want","puzzl","shock","watch","fine","actor","decaun","zem","rochefort","struggl","middl","gaudi","burlesqu","kitchyprissi","farc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,18,30,31,37,41,56,71,80,83,96,102,127,152,193,218,227,248,286,335,447,458,464,508,554,709,710,726,750,766,842,899,912,953,967,995,1141,1177,1482,1931,2081,2238,2421,2517,2639,2800,2988,6915,7529,8485],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,18,30,31,37,41,56,71,80,83,96,102,127,152,193,218,227,248,286,335,447,458,464,508,554,709,710,726,750,766,842,899,912,953,967,995,1141,1177,1482,1931,2081,2238,2421,2517,2639,2800,2988,6915,7529,8485],"values":[1.9218995441445863,1.2153159934048174,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,4.70627975028631,1.8610609350701788,1.9214926742550966,1.9951803900462557,4.584637595480144,2.0390708128715254,2.087553710177271,7.30790381132591,2.3131195476980753,2.517840471459249,2.5940874818617203,2.6005321873043625,2.689504733779216,2.780700890737216,2.908534262247101,3.2070272508030975,3.2850956241729166,3.2872346624216657,3.4149707055943286,3.439602492783994,3.6497387377608255,3.6528204042982337,3.7034641371169887,4.030886538218284,3.9825254665248626,3.8883864756110005,8.394243914521228,7.881004953500029,4.1302590120314875,4.110553940952155,4.030886538218284,4.770124825978496,4.263079925052412,4.506310234933358,5.143104478942172,4.9909126636002465,5.259176650194926,5.907203395474402,5.156897801074508,5.3064295350454715,5.322690055917252,5.390512652256013,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.239956198514967E-5,6.197878715085708E-5,6.246061312113547E-5,6.209971503310635E-5,6.21007324670207E-5,6.201392805312937E-5,6.219836616411479E-5,6.198771169122527E-5,6.212708266430822E-5,6.892660683223443E-5,0.6392086558887877,6.188764985777481E-5,0.018367856644317254,6.394207086468461E-5,0.08164993934458119,6.176162221039751E-5,0.06238965171337983,6.220419368153141E-5,6.20112054129543E-5,6.206260167683706E-5,6.26630937485082E-5,6.226582229685317E-5,6.233672138166363E-5,6.240388220732097E-5,6.288279994346139E-5,0.14831882457949244,6.518358943053355E-5,6.190604848863192E-5,6.190770462040537E-5,6.206454743997212E-5,6.338371486634091E-5,6.220058947968554E-5,6.676706368745855E-5,6.237555055916296E-5,6.197343043842368E-5,6.225947867320296E-5,6.191133151241967E-5,6.194791655423665E-5,6.176131191501388E-5,6.17773356487322

We are supposed to believe that during the height of a World War in what would obviously be a Top Secret code facility, she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function. From that standpoint I'm sorry that I ever watched this film. It has forever changed my perception of Ms. Rogers. Talentwise, she is an extreme lightweight.<br /><br />Lee Bowman is his usual self, meaning that he is merely adequate.<br /><br

{"value":"If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down. The film begins in jolly old England around 1100ad and then jumps to present day California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new Security Chief and Military Advisor for a Science Lab 400 feet underground. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the lead Scientist and we soon find out it's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone. Is it a Dinosaur or what? As with the above movies, all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off. The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a \"direct to video\" movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for. But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before.

{"value":"I thought they should have called this movie \"Whites\" instead of \"Heights\". Godawful...the kind of film that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so important...give me a break. Such a lily white cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in it, this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal it...and so they introduce, get this, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (I thought he was an albino at first)who's supposed to be Welsh!I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Intellectually dishonest...this movie is the kind of film that's able to fool so many people into thinking it's worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious.

{"value":"For those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten, the Disney company went almost down the tubes by the end of the 1980s. People were NOT seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material....at least no what people expected. A major problem: profanity.<br /><br />Yes, the idiots running the Disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words - including the Lord's name in vain, if you can believe that - interspersed in these \"family films.\" In fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /><br />This movie, in addition to the language problems, has a nasty tone to it, too, which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning. Thankfully, Disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent '80s movies.

{"value":"i guess its possible that I've seen worse movies, but this one is a real stinker! the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it. the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching. he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together.<br /><br />angie harmon, playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president, truly butchered the role. there was no chemistry with gooding, her demeanor was flat and wooden, and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd. this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the \"b\" list.<br /><br />and what was cuba gooding thinking??? he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances, but this was far beneath what

{"value":"ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not really Richard Harris's finest hour either. As a demented, Ahab-like fisherman, Harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale's \"wife\" and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris. She yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He doesn't listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale. There are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale's eye --- there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris's crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the Orca and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn don't fare very well
