{"value":"Not that I want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot. During the whole film, I was like...erm...what is this movie all about? I don't get the animations at all. Probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s. During the film, there is a group of people walked out. After the movie, many people said, \"That's it?\" Frankly speaking, I cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award. If you are thinking of watching this film, I strongly recommend you not to. You will regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it.","finished_norm":["not","that","i","want","to","be","mean","but","thi","movi","realli","surpris","me","a","lot","dure","the","whole","film","i","be","likeermwhat","be","thi","movi","all","about","i","do","not","get","the","anim","at","all","probabl","thi","movi","will","onli","be","suitabl","for","that","who","belong","to","the","dure","the","film","there","be","a","group","of","peopl","walk","out","after","the","movi","mani","peopl","sai","that","it","frankli","speak","i","cannot","believ","that","thi","movi","be","award","the","well","child","film","award","if","you","be","think","of","watch","thi","film","i","strongli","recommend","you","not","to","you","will","regret","it","i","be","not","joke","you","will","find","that","you","be","just","wast","both","your","time","and","monei","of","you","go","and","watch","it"],"filtered":["want","mean","thi","movi","realli","surpris","lot","dure","whole","film","likeermwhat","thi","movi","get","anim","probabl","thi","movi","onli","suitabl","belong","dure","film","group","peopl","walk","movi","mani","peopl","sai","frankli","speak","believ","thi","movi","award","well","child","film","award","think","watch","thi","film","strongli","recommend","regret","joke","find","wast","time","monei","go","watch"],"filtered2":["want","mean","realli","surpris","lot","dure","whole","likeermwhat","get","anim","probabl","onli","suitabl","belong","dure","group","peopl","walk","mani","peopl","frankli","speak","believ","award","well","child","award","think","watch","strongli","recommend","regret","joke","find","wast","time","monei","go","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,11,12,13,20,23,37,38,50,72,88,89,91,111,126,148,180,214,239,277,294,298,326,344,410,1004,1333,1540,1678,2217,2767],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,11,12,13,20,23,37,38,50,72,88,89,91,111,126,148,180,214,239,277,294,298,326,344,410,1004,1333,1540,1678,2217,2767],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,2.729695454751562,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.717994385570355,1.9209463754160525,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.1183455303375887,2.2391270689902285,2.3018654096236517,2.7097314792693545,2.7303758068497004,5.318680067465897,3.1163992333432793,2.886778509330039,2.7819920465008363,2.942840385588056,2.983093497946387,3.2070272508030975,8.352137096125563,4.383707912841026,4.528289141652134,4.679973728984199,5.00274712124725,5.290429193699031]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.151407910419247E-4,3.1486152885493927E-4,3.149392705986616E-4,3.1487595773126934E-4,3.149057570056962E-4,3.148597928034573E-4,3.14957718570316E-4,3.148129468016083E-4,3.148615953977046E-4,3.151869707380269E-4,3.176878876124214E-4,3.148621154676392E-4,3.1516030978823666E-4,3.151931440551358E-4,3.1504996003968954E-4,3.148771979820933E-4,3.149855279160079E-4,3.1513376117631056E-4,3.148934537341721E-4,3.1489230245246254E-4,3.151755959470423E-4,3.1492385144635905E-4,3.1492432805631606E-4,3.1512607195271076E-4,3.148935673241699E-4,3.151969113911795E-4,3.149723682202121E-4,3.148608231849207E-4,3.150035676265985E-4,3.150997112561131E-4,3.1492539619881976E-4,3.1509406338303333E-4,3.152487667018878E-4,3.1554136643944245E-4,3.149718239391047E-4,3.1487700700408115E-4,3.149905379474643E-4,3.1490898570460136E-4,3.148132828060732E-4,3.1489335621679376E-4,3.1520893317181194E-4,3.1503602123047954E-4,3.150947814281143E-4,3.148289510280185E-4,3.148934362861972E-4,3.148768885983042E-4,3.149834715702089E-4,3.1503809009787584E-4,3.149740288824671E-4,3.1492410494240905E-4,3.148776672646543E-4,3.15522800469539E-4,3.1495689955601385E-4,3.1489336411302137E-4,3.149552128451633E-4,3.148611453303455E-4,0.9751143381200144,3.149102689270999E-4,3.1487810931259754E-4,3.1486096559957423E-4,3.1511286192498125E-4,3.1498636772302907E-4,3.148608339794233E-4,3.1482882275958476E-4,3.147971632438013E-4,3.1508178971126767E-4,3.1487625878413535E-4,3.150193898198584E-4,3.1511184002468656E-4,3.1496887991478627E-4,3.1489378117885073E-4,3.148292354791923E-4,3.149097746145011E-4,3.148290659082668E-4,3.1484558762848966E-4,3.1482924438964435E-4,3.1503361256357543E-4,3.1493984847872616E-4,3.148612542375924E-4,3.1489175445278657E-4]}}
{"value":"Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves \"civilized\" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.","finished_norm":["linda","lovelac","be","the","victim","of","a","sadist","woman","hater","chuck","traynor","i","do","not","understand","how","have","sex","with","a","dog","which","be","anim","abus","a","good","can","be","find","to","be","entertain","or","funni","linda","lovelac","be","a","virtual","prison","who","be","coerc","into","make","thi","film","i","know","some","peopl","will","critic","thi","comment","but","i","feel","strongli","that","thi","typ","of","film","fuel","the","fire","of","hatr","and","far","misogynist","feel","toward","woman","thi","societi","continu","to","portrai","woman","a","sexual","object","a","oppos","to","human","be","we","call","ourselv","civil","howev","i","feel","we","have","a","long","wai","to","go","befor","we","can","ever","scratch","the","surfac","of","be","civil"],"filtered":["linda","lovelac","victim","sadist","woman","hater","chuck","traynor","understand","sex","dog","anim","abus","good","find","entertain","funni","linda","lovelac","virtual","prison","coerc","make","thi","film","know","peopl","critic","thi","comment","feel","strongli","thi","typ","film","fuel","fire","hatr","far","misogynist","feel","toward","woman","thi","societi","continu","portrai","woman","sexual","object","oppos","human","call","ourselv","civil","howev","feel","long","wai","go","befor","ever","scratch","surfac","civil"],"filtered2":["linda","lovelac","victim","sadist","woman","hater","chuck","traynor","understand","sex","dog","anim","abus","good","find","entertain","funni","linda","lovelac","virtual","prison","coerc","make","know","peopl","critic","comment","feel","strongli","typ","fuel","fire","hatr","far","misogynist","feel","toward","woman","societi","continu","portrai","woman","sexual","object","oppos","human","call","ourselv","civil","howev","feel","long","wai","go","befor","ever","scratch","surfac","civil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,23,26,33,38,43,44,62,70,79,99,101,113,142,195,212,254,277,280,292,384,433,469,519,535,551,563,579,609,852,1049,1184,1261,1315,2110,2144,2213,2217,2323,2356,2494,3151,3307,3460,4147,5182,6129],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,23,26,33,38,43,44,62,70,79,99,101,113,142,195,212,254,277,280,292,384,433,469,519,535,551,563,579,609,852,1049,1184,1261,1315,2110,2144,2213,2217,2323,2356,2494,3151,3307,3460,4147,5182,6129],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,4.982433610865464,1.604729392502474,2.0226120445069267,6.2840273587550515,1.9469506069506084,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,2.2844323215331563,2.51289241584188,2.5983793339432615,2.889652074525771,3.1163992333432793,2.8028805344481915,2.9752256367457734,3.109204957709252,3.164467636384302,3.328770687675578,3.5614461306151473,3.4986697244709752,3.528202072035993,3.459754308221302,3.5642670069567886,3.68099128126493,4.2078172463773615,4.176068548062782,4.3773181147422555,4.383707912841026,4.403125998698128,10.103074570833362,5.064116067623542,5.102830579804232,5.00274712124725,5.463272006538442,5.129498826886393,5.156897801074508,11.700089963268907,5.5623629091826725,5.649374286172302,5.907203395474402,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805338E-4,2.192553104372058E-4,2.1930944626706017E-4,2.1926535805328172E-4,2.1928610891855583E-4,2.192541015295695E-4,2.1932229259911834E-4,2.1922148009526632E-4,2.1925535677457425E-4,2.1948193342720765E-4,2.2122345868647692E-4,2.1925571892772577E-4,2.194633679490939E-4,2.194862322456884E-4,2.1938652538130749E-4,2.1926622170779174E-4,2.1934165776813378E-4,2.1944488069798165E-4,2.1927754147741044E-4,2.192767397769628E-4,2.1947401253786446E-4,2.192987090676409E-4,2.1929904095723205E-4,2.194395262708672E-4,2.1927762057634108E-4,2.1948885564790843E-4,2.1933249395190808E-4,2.1925481904056058E-4,2.1935421980567494E-4,2.1942116987548003E-4,2.192997847633016E-4,2.194172369524268E-4,2.195249653380586E-4,2.1972871854514204E-4,2.1933211493919226E-4,2.1926608871935236E-4,2.193451465271647E-4,2.1928835723826427E-4,2.1922171407355996E-4,2.1927747357072417E-4,2.1949722707154392E-4,2.193768190257817E-4,2.194177369665051E-4,2.1923262471379955E-4,2.1927752932743083E-4,2.1926600626693123E-4,2.1934022582203937E-4,2.1937825969134945E-4,2.193336503619007E-4,2.1929888559081074E-4,2.1926654849491618E-4,2.1971579004444669E-4,2.1932172227464677E-4,2.192774790692995E-4,2.1932054772559183E-4,2.1925504336804636E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630255E-4,2.19266856317086E-4,2.192549182116762E-4,2.194303274057621E-4,2.1934224257171331E-4,2.192548265573634E-4,2.192325353934708E-4,2.1921048914035556E-4,2.194086901232128E-4,2.192655676928647E-4,2.1936523766456553E-4,2.19429615800672

{"value":"This tiresome, plodding Las Vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in. It's something you 'look at' if you have absolutely nothing else better to do. The only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous Stella Stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she'll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears. Many great shots of mid-70s Las Vegas (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well. Otherwise, one big yawn. The Rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still ain't worth it in my humble

{"value":"This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects. It is very weak on plot. Most of the computer talk was just mumbo-jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology. This movie had none of that. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers.<br /><br />The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? Movie was boring. Lame sequel.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","mostli","chase","scene","and","special","effect","it","be","veri","weak","on","plot","much","of","the","comput","talk","be","just","mumbojumbo","i","watch","thi","becaus","i","be","a","big","fan","of","the","origin","war","game","movi","which","be","base","mostli","on","comput","fact","and","real","comput","terminologi","thi","movi","have","none","of","that","much","of","the","comput","scene","be","not","onli","imposs","and","highli","unrealist","of","real","comput","and","network","but","just","lame","it","be","like","it","be","write","by","somebodi","who","have","no","comprehens","of","real","computersbr","br","the","riplei","game","be","lame","and","be","essenti","just","a","arcad","game","no","real","hack","so","what","be","the","point","movi","be","bore","lame","sequel"],"filtered":["thi","movi","mostli","chase","scene","special","effect","veri","weak","plot","much","comput","talk","mumbojumbo","watch","thi","becaus","big","fan","origin","war","game","movi","base","mostli","comput","fact","real","comput","terminologi","thi","movi","none","much","comput","scene","onli","imposs","highli","unrealist","real","comput","network","lame","like","write","somebodi","comprehens","real","computersbr","br","riplei","game","lame","essenti","arcad","game","real","hack","point","movi","bore","lame","sequel"],"filtered2":["mostli","chase","scene","special","effect","veri","weak","plot","comput","talk","mumbojumbo","watch","becaus","big","fan","origin","war","game","base","mostli","comput","fact","real","comput","terminologi","none","comput","scene","onli","imposs","highli","unrealist","real","comput","network","lame","like","write","somebodi","comprehens","real","computersbr","riplei","game","lame","essenti","arcad","game","real","hack","point","bore","lame","sequel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,15,19,22,32,65,66,69,80,82,97,106,108,140,186,203,314,334,370,373,374,379,387,510,530,765,896,901,1082,1197,1264,1791,1902,5006,8352],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,15,19,22,32,65,66,69,80,82,97,106,108,140,186,203,314,334,370,373,374,379,387,510,530,765,896,901,1082,1197,1264,1791,1902,5006,8352],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.2979240167361772,1.3711311285073675,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,2.127032521151058,7.980721560185023,2.020196584395323,2.0545557924622586,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,2.317169775997098,2.571852579609833,2.569760528637609,3.189397019426827,2.942840385588056,2.9958122703541616,9.211607449650295,10.371639032377889,3.1272886331425473,3.360519385990158,6.748881449017532,3.5784919978881358,19.82751889477716,3.8844878351953436,3.8962296530720266,4.165705761027235,4.240607069200353,4.327618446189983,4.8184434032493035,4.85885294158718,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006071E-4,2.4075667160687809E-4,2.4081611628889936E-4,2.4076770454650997E-4,2.407904903538247E-4,2.4075534414722287E-4,2.4083022240173427E-4,2.4071952367870053E-4,2.4075672248833943E-4,2.410055184725419E-4,2.4291782711448494E-4,2.4075712015618697E-4,2.4098513236326798E-4,2.4101023885640492E-4,2.4090075419782656E-4,2.407686528956507E-4,2.408514866239233E-4,2.4096483215235828E-4,2.4078108274307977E-4,2.4078020242355175E-4,2.4099682081796454E-4,2.4080432614165316E-4,2.40804690578132E-4,2.409589526411717E-4,2.4078116959887924E-4,2.4101311952363032E-4,2.4084142415433334E-4,2.4075613202122106E-4,2.408652805627838E-4,2.4093879611840696E-4,2.4080550732584623E-4,2.4093447751165535E-4,2.410527703252277E-4,2.412765046734121E-4,2.408410079735814E-4,2.4076850686564593E-4,2.4085531750952713E-4,2.4079295915591955E-4,2.4071978060217065E-4,2.4078100817709672E-4,2.4102231189432859E-4,2.4089009598459943E-4,2.4093502655981753E-4,2.4073176119878174E-4,2.4078106940160748E-4,2.4076841632749457E-4,2.4084991425345288E-4,2.4089167792962186E-4,2.4084269396814205E-4,2.4080451997563943E-4,2.4076901172928733E-4,2.4126230833403916E-4,2.408295961481615E-4,2.4078101421489206E-4,2.408283064164759E-4,2.4075637834747294E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305148E-4,2.4076934973816342E-4,2.4075624091759245E-4,2.409488516856197E-4,2.4085212877650365E-4,2.4075614027516218E-4,2.4073166311921863E-4,2.4070745489132738E-4,2.4092509253415922E-4,2.4076793474448388E-4,2.4087737889248647E-4,2.40948070296688E-4,2.4083875684592342E-4,2.4078133312136908E-4,2.4073197870238744E-4,2.4079356239037106E-4,2.407318490411622E-4,2.407444822592773E-4,2.4073198551570246E-4,2.4088825421425373E-4,2.408165581608595E-4,2.4075646162263954E-4,2.407797833994223E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesn't succeed on ANY level. The acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete garbage, I can't believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens.

{"value":"Just a warning... This is the worst movie I have seen in years... I couldn't watch it to the end... It is a pure waste of time... I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are searching for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around inside the building, but still they are whispering so that Snipes doesn't suspect a thing.","finished_norm":["just","a","warn","thi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","see","in","year","i","can","not","watch","it","to","the","end","it","be","a","pure","wast","of","time","i","realli","feel","sorri","for","snipe","that","he","end","up","in","such","a","movi","there","realli","be","not","much","to","sai","about","it","horribl","act","incredibli","bad","line","stori","everyth","the","onli","reason","i","would","advis","you","to","watch","thi","movi","be","if","you","realli","want","to","see","how","a","movi","should","not","be","just","to","tell","you","on","scene","the","polic","be","search","for","snipe","and","thei","be","surround","the","build","with","helicopt","and","car","thei","be","shoot","around","insid","the","build","but","still","thei","be","whisper","so","that","snipe","doe","not","suspect","a","thing"],"filtered":["warn","thi","wrong","movi","see","year","watch","end","pure","wast","time","realli","feel","sorri","snipe","end","movi","realli","much","sai","horribl","act","incredibli","bad","line","stori","everyth","onli","reason","advis","watch","thi","movi","realli","want","see","movi","tell","scene","polic","search","snipe","thei","surround","build","helicopt","car","thei","shoot","around","insid","build","still","thei","whisper","snipe","doe","suspect","thing"],"filtered2":["warn","wrong","see","year","watch","end","pure","wast","time","realli","feel","sorri","snipe","end","realli","horribl","act","incredibli","bad","line","stori","everyth","onli","reason","advis","watch","realli","want","see","tell","scene","polic","search","snipe","surround","build","helicopt","car","shoot","around","insid","build","still","whisper","snipe","doe","suspect","thing"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,9,11,13,17,18,19,21,24,25,29,37,43,57,64,89,90,95,98,107,117,193,230,284,437,471,477,527,687,726,890,977,1089,1275,2043,2372,3497,5514],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,9,11,13,17,18,19,21,24,25,29,37,43,57,64,89,90,95,98,107,117,193,230,284,437,471,477,527,687,726,890,977,1089,1275,2043,2372,3497,5514],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,3.3953824709201923,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.834162586674748,1.883428577602134,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.0881990796736947,2.1439533986393955,2.2797301185117202,2.517840471459249,2.7121382192999195,3.110998680163279,3.1952392950510555,3.496027715008137,6.702690019428234,3.439602492783994,3.604618302480356,3.6466665387238555,3.9161110236258554,4.035401218572811,4.2078172463773615,4.3095999406873045,4.900964426937307,5.290429193699031,18.19880427031227,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278305E-4,2.5058620691581333E-4,2.5064807858603375E-4,2.5059769030472644E-4,2.506214064035926E-4,2.505848252590658E-4,2.5066276061866876E-4,2.5054754232407155E-4,2.505862598746465E-4,2.5084521362060534E-4,2.528355973796037E-4,2.5058667377834796E-4,2.508239951938734E-4,2.5085012672676986E-4,2.507361720640579E-4,2.5059867737275835E-4,2.5068489300962516E-4,2.5080286617253615E-4,2.5061161470196715E-4,2.5061069844103896E-4,2.508361608610076E-4,2.5063580707447943E-4,2.506361863900527E-4,2.507967466145737E-4,2.50611705103887E-4,2.5085312500494253E-4,2.506744197127901E-4,2.505856453001281E-4,2.5069925012294797E-4,2.507757671478344E-4,2.506370364836777E-4,2.507712722224069E-4,2.508943946566084E-4,2.5112726355820155E-4,2.5067398654034543E-4,2.505985253806879E-4,2.5068888030138403E-4,2.5062397600113874E-4,2.505478097371298E-4,2.506115370916283E-4,2.508626926787705E-4,2.5072507870075764E-4,2.507718436869294E-4,2.505602794736539E-4,2.506116008157935E-4,2.505984311460743E-4,2.5068325644292313E-4,2.507267252329184E-4,2.5067574137014524E-4,2.506360088222568E-4,2.505990508567383E-4,2.511124876152887E-4,2.506621087966182E-4,2.506115433759328E-4,2.5066076640818566E-4,2.505859016833083E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686772E-4,2.5059940266573117E-4,2.505857586424852E-4,2.507862332604842E-4,2.5068556137980284E-4,2.505856538910585E-4,2.505601773897302E-4,2.5053498079616153E-4,2.507615040780932E-4,2.5059792990114857E-4,2.507118423993322E-4,2.5078541996925865E-4,2.506716435043775E-4,2.506118753026201E-4,2.505605058574263E-4,2.506246038642508E-4,2.5056037090243457E-4,2.505735199054818E-4,2.505605129489131E-4,2.507231617352096E-4,2.50648538498599E-4,2.505859883584064E-4,2.506102623091282E-4]}}
{"value":"An interesting change from the first one. there was more mystery to this movie then the first. Even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up. All up the movie is enjoyable. The story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film, Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to the Bates motel, but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother, things start going wrong. Perkins plays an aged Norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent, he swang that spade awfully hard.","finished_norm":["a","interest","chang","from","the","on","there","be","much","mysteri","to","thi","movi","then","the","even","when","it","end","your","ask","yourself","what","happen","who","be","the","killer","there","be","some","good","part","through","the","movi","the","half","start","off","slow","and","then","in","the","last","half","the","pace","pick","up","all","up","the","movi","be","enjoy","the","stori","be","year","after","the","event","that","occur","in","the","film","norman","bate","be","out","of","a","asylum","and","back","to","the","bate","motel","but","when","a","woman","turn","up","claim","to","be","hi","real","mother","thing","start","go","wrong","perkin","plai","a","ag","norman","good","again","and","the","scene","at","the","end","be","excel","he","swing","that","spade","awfulli","hard"],"filtered":["interest","chang","much","mysteri","thi","movi","even","end","ask","happen","killer","good","part","movi","half","start","slow","last","half","pace","pick","movi","enjoy","stori","year","event","occur","film","norman","bate","asylum","back","bate","motel","woman","turn","claim","hi","real","mother","thing","start","go","wrong","perkin","plai","ag","norman","good","scene","end","excel","swing","spade","awfulli","hard"],"filtered2":["interest","chang","mysteri","even","end","ask","happen","killer","good","part","half","start","slow","last","half","pace","pick","enjoy","stori","year","event","occur","norman","bate","asylum","back","bate","motel","woman","turn","claim","real","mother","thing","start","go","wrong","perkin","plai","ag","norman","good","scene","end","excel","swing","spade","awfulli","hard"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,6,17,19,24,25,29,40,57,60,61,63,70,71,80,94,96,144,171,206,252,278,306,390,397,403,442,446,470,546,580,737,751,1259,2498,2777,3054,4159,4711,5797,5881,7379],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,6,17,19,24,25,29,40,57,60,61,63,70,71,80,94,96,144,171,206,252,278,306,390,397,403,442,446,470,546,580,737,751,1259,2498,2777,3054,4159,4711,5797,5881,7379],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.6284968758320737,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,2.094675786251684,3.8429853485101932,1.9951803900462557,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.2931108769894046,2.373087554090762,5.194609285626992,3.0433232530252132,2.8336934208777267,2.8739486825973213,3.132778125427319,3.3176717946075294,3.189397019426827,3.257696649984802,3.233054746047873,3.3814747511661465,3.4572130107926293,3.5039747767006686,3.68099128126493,3.8023521382691974,4.315570107673808,5.214056214914456,5.290429193699031,5.672363804397,12.350934764138163,6.600350576034347,12.875663293073144,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815696E-4,2.4557311712357496E-4,2.4563375102320043E-4,2.455843707821272E-4,2.456076124297671E-4,2.455717631074922E-4,2.456481393351681E-4,2.4553522603438366E-4,2.455731690229428E-4,2.458269422827268E-4,2.477775075192787E-4,2.4557357464631454E-4,2.458061483401665E-4,2.4583175709999247E-4,2.45720082151569E-4,2.4558533810341906E-4,2.4566982895768744E-4,2.4578544201440576E-4,2.4559801661553737E-4,2.455971186848212E-4,2.458180706276571E-4,2.45621725008755E-4,2.456220967359495E-4,2.4577944488095305E-4,2.455981052089262E-4,2.458346953962615E-4,2.4565956518386684E-4,2.4557256674326413E-4,2.4568389885049985E-4,2.457588851178833E-4,2.4562292982306915E-4,2.457544801154609E-4,2.4587513942998123E-4,2.46103349684445E-4,2.4565914067723176E-4,2.4558518915201836E-4,2.4567373648188103E-4,2.4561013062135846E-4,2.4553548809772344E-4,2.455979405578283E-4,2.4584407166447064E-4,2.457092107159918E-4,2.457550401475786E-4,2.45547708371559E-4,2.455980030071629E-4,2.4558509680261057E-4,2.4566822513123846E-4,2.4571082430853604E-4,2.4566086040087205E-4,2.456219227204773E-4,2.4558570411568404E-4,2.4608886934091685E-4,2.456475005531109E-4,2.455979467164124E-4,2.456461850197627E-4,2.455728179973835E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.456111314579804E-4,2.4558604888657974E-4,2.455726778181564E-4,2.4576914185124143E-4,2.4567048395681903E-4,2.4557257516232906E-4,2.4554760832987013E-4,2.4552291580549017E-4,2.457449073872683E-4,2.455846055853151E-4,2.456962392127305E-4,2.457683448302727E-4,2.4565684451475237E-4,2.45598272002757E-4,2.455479302264222E-4,2.4561074592378655E-4,2.455477979712658E-4,2.455606839225922E-4,2.4554793717604064E-4,2.4570733210020184E-4,2.4563420173500793E-4,2.455729029385072E-4,2.455966912779256E-4]}}

{"value":"The movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. Kill Kill, would have been nice. The movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs. The scenes are unnecessary and choppy. The movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured. Just a waste of movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but I have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense.

{"value":"There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. The base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. However, that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. Had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)","finished_norm":["there","be","a","numb","of","problem","with","thi","movi","but","the","bottom","line","be","that","it","try","to","do","too","much","with","too","littl","the","base","stori","be","quit","good","but","the","monei","just","be","not","there","to","do","the","stori","justic","the","nonexist","budget","realli","kill","thi","movi","stuart","gordon","the","writerdirector","have","write","credit","on","honei","i","shrink","the","kid","which","be","a","box","offic","smash","howev","that","movi","have","some","seriou","cash","back","from","disnei","honestli","thi","be","a","good","exampl","of","when","to","not","make","a","movi","have","he","wait","a","few","much","year","technologi","would","have","make","it","cheap","to","do","mani","of","the","effect","not","to","mention","he","can","have","find","a","compani","with","monei"],"filtered":["numb","problem","thi","movi","bottom","line","try","much","littl","base","stori","quit","good","monei","stori","justic","nonexist","budget","realli","kill","thi","movi","stuart","gordon","writerdirector","write","credit","honei","shrink","kid","box","offic","smash","howev","movi","seriou","cash","back","disnei","honestli","thi","good","exampl","make","movi","wait","much","year","technologi","make","cheap","mani","effect","mention","find","compani","monei"],"filtered2":["numb","problem","bottom","line","try","littl","base","stori","quit","good","monei","stori","justic","nonexist","budget","realli","kill","stuart","gordon","writerdirector","write","credit","honei","shrink","kid","box","offic","smash","howev","seriou","cash","back","disnei","honestli","good","exampl","make","wait","year","technologi","make","cheap","mani","effect","mention","find","compani","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,13,14,17,36,38,50,57,63,65,76,106,107,113,114,120,126,167,256,285,307,331,334,351,356,493,516,587,654,757,841,860,882,1424,1454,1484,1829,2099,2186,2516,4220,4264,4841],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,13,14,17,36,38,50,57,63,65,76,106,107,113,114,120,126,167,256,285,307,331,334,351,356,493,516,587,654,757,841,860,882,1424,1454,1484,1829,2099,2186,2516,4220,4264,4841],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.357228929984541,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,2.1337665533324026,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.4433074195966826,2.2044500422972613,4.478254137980457,2.4609576687888097,2.748952192422636,2.808171552082607,2.8767855639325206,2.932274249550174,2.942840385588056,3.0135689919434205,3.028335462059722,3.342254038012865,3.442099372982581,3.6105180246075443,3.634471265630037,3.7165362186843414,4.30366520516749,3.8538340941043407,3.9612932464190886,4.5432147918688095,4.506310234933358,4.484804029712395,4.944927550358424,5.214056214914456,5.02684467282631,5.1994574154933035,6.342521466732247,6.137727054086234,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278305E-4,2.5058620691581333E-4,2.5064807858603375E-4,2.5059769030472644E-4,2.506214064035926E-4,2.505848252590658E-4,2.5066276061866876E-4,2.5054754232407155E-4,2.505862598746465E-4,2.5084521362060534E-4,2.528355973796037E-4,2.5058667377834796E-4,2.508239951938734E-4,2.5085012672676986E-4,2.507361720640579E-4,2.5059867737275835E-4,2.5068489300962516E-4,2.5080286617253615E-4,2.5061161470196715E-4,2.5061069844103896E-4,2.508361608610076E-4,2.5063580707447943E-4,2.506361863900527E-4,2.507967466145737E-4,2.50611705103887E-4,2.5085312500494253E-4,2.506744197127901E-4,2.505856453001281E-4,2.5069925012294797E-4,2.507757671478344E-4,2.506370364836777E-4,2.507712722224069E-4,2.508943946566084E-4,2.5112726355820155E-4,2.5067398654034543E-4,2.505985253806879E-4,2.5068888030138403E-4,2.5062397600113874E-4,2.505478097371298E-4,2.506115370916283E-4,2.508626926787705E-4,2.5072507870075764E-4,2.507718436869294E-4,2.505602794736539E-4,2.506116008157935E-4,2.505984311460743E-4,2.5068325644292313E-4,2.507267252329184E-4,2.5067574137014524E-4,2.506360088222568E-4,2.505990508567383E-4,2.511124876152887E-4,2.506621087966182E-4,2.506115433759328E-4,2.5066076640818566E-4,2.505859016833083E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686772E-4,2.5059940266573117E-4,2.505857586424852E-4,2.507862332604842E-4,2.5068556137980284E-4,2.505856538910585E-4,2.505601773897302E-4,2.5053498079616153E-4,2.507615040780932E-4,2.5059792990114857E-4,2.507118423993322E-4,2.5078541996925865E-4,2.506716435043775E-4,2.506118753026201E-4,2.505605058574263E-4,2.506246038642508E-4,2.5056037090243457E-4,2.505735199054818E-4,2.505605129489131E-4,2.507231617352096E-4,2.50648538498599E-4,2.505859883584064E-4,2.506102623091282E-4]}}
{"value":"Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze is a horrible movie. Poorly scripted, over-acted, and just plain silly. That being said... it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level. This movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like \"Santa Claus conquers the Martians\" or \"Yor, the Hunter from the Future\"... so bad it is almost good. If you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch. It's campy. It's fun. It has a theme by Sousa. If you're looking for a good movie though, look elsewhere. 3/10.<br /><br />BTW, I've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a

It is all fat to far-fetched.<br /><br />There are however some good scenes in flash backs from Northern Irland which are filmed great.","finished_norm":["a","a","huge","fan","or","the","cracker","seri","i","have","be","wait","year","for","the","next","addit","thi","episod","i","be","afraid","just","doe","not","live","up","to","the","legendbr","br","fitz","return","to","manchest","after","year","for","hi","daughter","wed","and","get","involv","in","a","murder","investig","be","a","soldier","torment","by","flash","back","from","hi","tour","of","duti","in","northern","irland","go","on","a","kill","spreebr","br","what","i","do","not","like","about","thi","episod","be","the","extrem","conveni","wai","it","be","all","set","up","and","how","fitz","be","lead","to","the","murder","it","be","all","fat","to","farfetchedbr","br","there","be","howev","some","good","scene","in","flash","back","from","northern","irland","which","be","film","great"],"filtered":["huge","fan","cracker","seri","wait","year","next","addit","thi","episod","afraid","doe","live","legendbr","br","fitz","return","manchest","year","hi","daughter","wed","get","involv","murder","investig","soldier","torment","flash","back","hi","tour","duti","northern","irland","go","kill","spreebr","br","like","thi","episod","extrem","conveni","wai","set","fitz","lead","murder","fat","farfetchedbr","br","howev","good","scene","flash","back","northern","irland","film","great"],"filtered2":["huge","fan","cracker","wait","year","next","addit","afraid","doe","live","legendbr","fitz","return","manchest","year","daughter","wed","get","involv","murder","investig","soldier","torment","flash","back","tour","duti","northern","irland","go","kill","spreebr","like","extrem","conveni","wai","set","fitz","lead","murder","fat","farfetchedbr","howev","good","scene","flash","back","northern","irland","great"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,18,19,33,51,57,63,76,109,113,116,140,157,241,273,297,329,331,426,444,488,657,1113,1151,1185,1244,1452,1497,2193,2643,3214,3257,4688,4732,7325],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,18,19,33,51,57,63,76,109,113,116,140,157,241,273,297,329,331,426,444,488,657,1113,1151,1185,1244,1452,1497,2193,2643,3214,3257,4688,4732,7325],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.4018535447685214,1.7139899308309823,3.668325173349496,3.745925514644013,2.1337665533324026,2.125691139326857,2.1521782565202803,2.2466628996789315,2.317169775997098,2.3360150694757706,2.6627744961815836,5.934838391705887,2.813490713560207,2.951986790814132,2.932274249550174,3.3909310864081816,3.2535472664379905,3.3933092088131493,4.00861390260916,4.268777946167049,4.3336974922663645,4.235066888824737,4.339813719283801,8.998179973919743,4.770124825978496,5.00274712124725,5.322690055917252,5.541743621979936,5.604922523601468,12.275454108172468,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.793182480923799E-4,2.790707300717221E-4,2.791396347907475E-4,2.790835187952801E-4,2.7910993073992175E-4,2.790691913599072E-4,2.7915598575282486E-4,2.790276704158132E-4,2.7907078905046805E-4,2.7935917847073577E-4,2.81575812241537E-4,2.7907125000324585E-4,2.793355481124972E-4,2.7936465005730523E-4,2.7923774199117694E-4,2.790846180648675E-4,2.791806339670201E-4,2.7931201732250344E-4,2.7909902600037166E-4,2.790980055866413E-4,2.7934909666990084E-4,2.791259683574242E-4,2.791263907903875E-4,2.793052021448872E-4,2.790991266784181E-4,2.793679891544124E-4,2.7916897015427483E-4,2.7907010461631005E-4,2.7919662307570263E-4,2.7928183790959467E-4,2.791273375154746E-4,2.792768320390158E-4,2.7941394999145107E-4,2.796732894625993E-4,2.7916848774244587E-4,2.7908444879562244E-4,2.791850745004232E-4,2.7911279242761006E-4,2.7902796822612893E-4,2.790989395679451E-4,2.7937864440057743E-4,2.7922538762804877E-4,2.792774684627977E-4,2.7904185541696204E-4,2.7909901053573515E-4,2.79084343849214E-4,2.791788113692404E-4,2.792272213240764E-4,2.7917044204647324E-4,2.791261930381847E-4,2.790850340033513E-4,2.796568339153171E-4,2.791552598371499E-4,2.7909894656659624E-4,2.7915376485734025E-4,2.790703901429644E-4,0.9779431299389859,2.7911392978421506E-4,2.790854258030185E-4,2.7907023084246886E-4,2.792934937215172E-4,2.7918137831187346E-4,2.7907011418378485E-4,2.7904174172900027E-4,2.790136809995249E-4,2.792659535345737E-4,2.7908378562699945E-4,2.792106467356919E-4,2.7929258798221543E-4,2.7916587836994205E-4,2.7909931622390534E-4,2.790421075341293E-4,2.791134916608967E-4,2.7904195723859416E-4,2.790566009092306E-4,2.7904211543171645E-4,2.79223252758051E-4,2.79140146982288E-4,2.7907048667055544E-4,2.7909751987893923E-4]}}

{"value":"The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me.

{"value":"Brief summary: This movie demeans everyone it touches. That means you.<br /><br />First off, let me say I'm not a purist, and this might have been funny for a few minutes. The impersonations are not bad. But overall it's just dull and excruciatingly not funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again.<br /><br />It's clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now-trademarked Laurel and Hardy. The producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history, or their talents. This is what offended me the most.<br /><br />Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent

{"value":"I think they really let the quality of the DVD production get away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried.<br /><br />Anyone else have this issue? It's really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it. For one, I've never seen a Finnish horror film before so I was sort of bummed that the movie was done in English. Also since it's never made clear what is wrong with Sarah, she just came off as retarded and therefore I really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away.","finished_norm":["i","think","thei","realli","let","the","qualiti","of","the","dvd","product","get","awai","from","them","i","rent","thi","dvd","from","movi","store","and","the","time","i","final","get","it","to","plai","on","the","rd","dvd","player","i","triedbr","br","anyon","els","have","thi","issu","it","realli","hard","to","give","the","film","a","unbias","review","after","go","through","such","a","hassl","to","plai","it","for","on","i","have","never","see","a","finnish","horror","film","befor","so","i","be","sort","of","bum","that","the","movi","be","do","in","english","conjur","sinc","it","never","make","clear","what","be","wrong","with","sarah","she","just","come","off","a","retard","and","therefor","i","realli","just","hope","someon","would","shoot","her","in","the","face","and","make","all","the","horrif","happen","go","awai"],"filtered":["think","thei","realli","let","qualiti","dvd","product","get","awai","rent","thi","dvd","movi","store","time","final","get","plai","rd","dvd","player","triedbr","br","anyon","els","thi","issu","realli","hard","give","film","unbias","review","go","hassl","plai","never","see","finnish","horror","film","befor","sort","bum","movi","english","conjur","sinc","never","make","clear","wrong","sarah","come","retard","therefor","realli","hope","someon","shoot","face","make","horrif","happen","go","awai"],"filtered2":["think","realli","let","qualiti","dvd","product","get","awai","rent","dvd","store","time","final","get","plai","rd","dvd","player","triedbr","anyon","els","issu","realli","hard","give","unbias","review","go","hassl","plai","never","see","finnish","horror","befor","sort","bum","english","conjur","sinc","never","make","clear","wrong","sarah","come","retard","therefor","realli","hope","someon","shoot","face","make","horrif","happen","go","awai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,8,12,13,25,30,34,39,40,42,79,83,94,117,124,139,155,156,158,162,171,176,181,190,196,247,251,269,319,588,590,661,793,806,999,1229,1575,2109,2246,2565,5539,7771,8392],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,8,12,13,25,30,34,39,40,42,79,83,94,117,124,139,155,156,158,162,171,176,181,190,196,247,251,269,319,588,590,661,793,806,999,1229,1575,2109,2246,2565,5539,7771,8392],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,3.3953824709201923,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,3.2569937516641474,3.2439908614907673,1.9469506069506084,2.292318797740072,2.08112281984698,2.2797301185117202,2.2323930368088845,2.2939035841256437,4.614953293582877,2.3451551414151686,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,2.5040471493269134,2.4442286541160034,2.558331832813986,2.478925055209576,8.191127420549101,2.6942272927333892,2.76533567167316,2.9056060024680126,3.6375061693251913,3.4986697244709752,3.5727776966246974,3.770603439954617,3.880604335168946,4.1302590120314875,4.3095999406873045,4.733083554298147,4.933754249760298,5.444579873526289,5.290429193699031,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247379E-4,2.1540780663324005E-4,2.1546099248468396E-4,2.1541767793321673E-4,2.154380646612076E-4,2.15406618939579E-4,2.1547361338862656E-4,2.1537456994793328E-4,2.154078521574779E-4,2.1563045283100657E-4,2.173414177540458E-4,2.154082079555467E-4,2.1561221314088638E-4,2.1563467621359288E-4,2.155367190105507E-4,2.1541852643227165E-4,2.1549263873663012E-4,2.1559405030503612E-4,2.1542964756197334E-4,2.1542885992980763E-4,2.1562267093784923E-4,2.1545044370220896E-4,2.1545076976778397E-4,2.1558878983769238E-4,2.1542972527287176E-4,2.1563725358021173E-4,2.1548363572753706E-4,2.154073238596492E-4,2.1550498033487094E-4,2.15570755561304E-4,2.154515005215052E-4,2.1556689165339287E-4,2.1567272961560603E-4,2.1587290735061647E-4,2.1548326336575643E-4,2.1541839577752047E-4,2.154960662747327E-4,2.1544027352728268E-4,2.1537479982036342E-4,2.1542958084691722E-4,2.1564547810166176E-4,2.1552718298266594E-4,2.1556738289319762E-4,2.1538551900011004E-4,2.154296356252022E-4,2.1541831477197876E-4,2.154912319184016E-4,2.1552859836735798E-4,2.1548477184478584E-4,2.1545061712774084E-4,2.154188474849183E-4,2.1586020571993627E-4,2.1547305307223903E-4,2.1542958624900323E-4,2.1547189913423314E-4,2.1540754425062436E-4,0.9829748465565418,2.154411514247662E-4,2.154191499054084E-4,2.1540742129050482E-4,2.1557975239475948E-4,2.1549321327804546E-4,2.1540733124454674E-4,2.1538543124717915E-4,2.1536377186288163E-4,2.1555849480439074E-4,2.154178838940332E-4,2.1551580485178998E-4,2.1557905327695406E-4,2.1548124925554292E-4,2.1542987157835373E-4,2.15385713603127E-4,2.154408132481935E-4,2.1538559759371403E-4,2.153969006815443E-4,2.15385719

{"value":"Hey HULU.com is playing the Elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the Name Monsteroid, good fun to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie ....Have Fun with bad movies. Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad movie making. Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it.

{"value":"Did anyone read the script. This has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson couldn't pull this one out. About two-thirds it looked like Giamatti eyes were saying, I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I ever saw, but it's on the really really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie just doesn't move with Vaughn's con-man dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. It was just a lackluster walk through, that no one seemed to be able to get

{"value":"Snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station, as you toss this into the waste disposal unit. Spend a useful 90 min. living your favourite game. Disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk. It takes a bits from several other \"science fiction\" movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story. There's nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film. Any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally i would like my 90 min of life back.","finished_norm":["snuggl","down","in","your","favourit","chair","and","switch","on","the","playstat","a","you","toss","thi","into","the","wast","dispos","unit","spend","a","us","min","live","your","favourit","game","disjoint","poorli","film","non","direct","junk","it","take","a","bit","from","sever","other","scienc","fiction","movi","and","badli","attempt","to","join","the","part","into","a","pathet","weak","stori","there","noth","new","here","the","filmmak","do","not","seem","to","realis","that","provid","simpl","entertain","would","achiev","a","monetari","game","but","a","touch","of","skill","ingenu","and","flair","be","requir","to","turn","it","into","a","good","film","ani","monei","spend","watch","thi","be","a","wast","and","person","i","would","like","my","min","of","life","back"],"filtered":["snuggl","favourit","chair","switch","playstat","toss","thi","wast","dispos","unit","spend","us","min","live","favourit","game","disjoint","poorli","film","non","direct","junk","take","bit","sever","scienc","fiction","movi","badli","attempt","join","part","pathet","weak","stori","noth","new","filmmak","seem","realis","provid","simpl","entertain","achiev","monetari","game","touch","skill","ingenu","flair","requir","turn","good","film","ani","monei","spend","watch","thi","wast","person","like","min","life","back"],"filtered2":["snuggl","favourit","chair","switch","playstat","toss","wast","dispos","unit","spend","us","min","live","favourit","game","disjoint","poorli","non","direct","junk","take","bit","sever","scienc","fiction","badli","attempt","join","part","pathet","weak","stori","noth","new","filmmak","seem","realis","provid","simpl","entertain","achiev","monetari","game","touch","skill","ingenu","flair","requir","turn","good","ani","monei","spend","watch","wast","person","like","min","life","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,17,27,31,35,49,56,61,63,75,87,89,96,102,116,126,153,177,195,283,316,323,374,379,398,448,602,695,736,745,910,916,976,989,1164,1319,1382,1481,1482,1579,1694,1826,2034,2215,2247,2305,2606,3135,4771,5476],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,17,27,31,35,49,56,61,63,75,87,89,96,102,116,126,153,177,195,283,316,323,374,379,398,448,602,695,736,745,910,916,976,989,1164,1319,1382,1481,1482,1579,1694,1826,2034,2215,2247,2305,2606,3135,4771,5476],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.2770536940105968,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.6920303308087352,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.9742250248702675,2.115024371522662,3.9880092219144876,2.0390708128715254,2.087553710177271,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.458149992634611,2.51289241584188,5.535760404616309,2.878207028279898,3.0433232530252132,6.914426021585259,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.2681460658591432,3.506637894120152,3.6715125373103863,3.6841709341823097,3.6969916226113715,4.096025840389245,4.100845126825194,4.058285512406398,4.044492190274062,4.268777946167049,4.403125998698128,4.449957298382227,4.597282013139085,4.506310234933358,4.605250182788262,4.688631791727313,9.801928853874614,4.956227105612356,4.979216623837056,5.064116067623542,10.128232135247083,5.243909178064138,5.482320201509136,6.101359409915359,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613003E-4,2.1169300653874453E-4,2.1174527517734895E-4,2.1170270760391562E-4,2.1172274275403077E-4,2.116918393273705E-4,2.1175767842838522E-4,2.1166034303434357E-4,2.1169305127789737E-4,2.1191181310725423E-4,2.135932716651461E-4,2.1169340094007576E-4,2.1189388796841998E-4,2.1191596365579486E-4,2.1181969576676966E-4,2.117035414702401E-4,2.1177637567609538E-4,2.118760383584708E-4,2.1171447081128606E-4,2.1171369676217518E-4,2.1190416541618494E-4,2.1173490831315607E-4,2.1173522875559027E-4,2.118708686101446E-4,2.1171454718202668E-4,2.1191849657461995E-4,2.117675279277589E-4,2.1169253209079152E-4,2.117885044381766E-4,2.1185314534259418E-4,2.117359469071499E-4,2.1184934806943367E-4,2.119533608105549E-4,2.1215008639459388E-4,2.1176716198751704E-4,2.1170341306868618E-4,2.1177974410483202E-4,2.1172491352726219E-4,2.1166056894252497E-4,2.1171440524675973E-4,2.11926579260667E-4,2.1181032419177934E-4,2.118498308375971E-4,2.1167110326541537E-4,2.117144590803697E-4,2.1170333346011983E-4,2.1177499311905113E-4,2.1181171516755477E-4,2.1176864445217802E-4,2.117350787478902E-4,2.1170385698619605E-4,2.1213760380898726E-4,2.1175712777489434E-4,2.1171441055568445E-4,2.1175599373704471E-4,2.116927486810297E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502675E-4,2.1170415419131497E-4,2.116926278414102E-4,2.1186198702179463E-4,2.1177694030929739E-4,2.1169253934833333E-4,2.1167101702582145E-4,2.1164973116690394E-4,2.1184109602769713E-4,

{"value":"Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen... Can somebody tell me where should have I laughed? There's not a single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading actors are pestilential, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who _can't_ make a Sicilian accent!!! Not to say about the dream-like insertion about Dracula... just another expedient, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this \"film\" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too, too hard to rescue. I would have given it \"0\"/10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it by one mark.","finished_norm":["definit","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","can","somebodi","tell","me","where","should","have","i","laugh","there","not","a","singl","hint","or","shadow","of","a","idea","the","three","lead","actor","be","pestilenti","especi","the","on","i","think","it","aldo","from","sicili","who","can","t","make","a","sicilian","accent","not","to","sai","about","the","dreamlik","insert","about","dracula","just","anoth","expedi","draw","from","the","wrong","cabaret","tradit","to","make","thi","film","last","a","littl","long","massironi","and","littizzetto","do","what","thei","can","but","thi","socal","movi","be","realli","too","too","hard","to","rescu","i","would","have","give","it","but","the","low","mark","be","and","so","i","have","to","overestim","it","by","on","mark"],"filtered":["definit","wrong","movi","ever","see","somebodi","tell","laugh","singl","hint","shadow","idea","three","lead","actor","pestilenti","especi","think","aldo","sicili","make","sicilian","accent","sai","dreamlik","insert","dracula","anoth","expedi","draw","wrong","cabaret","tradit","make","thi","film","last","littl","long","massironi","littizzetto","thei","thi","socal","movi","realli","hard","rescu","give","low","mark","overestim","mark"],"filtered2":["definit","wrong","ever","see","somebodi","tell","laugh","singl","hint","shadow","idea","three","lead","actor","pestilenti","especi","think","aldo","sicili","make","sicilian","accent","dreamlik","insert","dracula","anoth","expedi","draw","wrong","cabaret","tradit","make","last","littl","long","massironi","littizzetto","socal","realli","hard","rescu","give","low","mark","overestim","mark"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,12,13,14,25,30,41,44,73,90,99,123,133,144,157,171,217,224,267,392,443,559,576,717,1082,1190,1303,1450,1768,1785,2145,2420,7845],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,12,13,14,25,30,41,44,73,90,99,123,133,144,157,171,217,224,267,392,443,559,576,717,1082,1190,1303,1450,1768,1785,2145,2420,7845],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.559277576165403,1.3364419891718522,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.8950689206770979,2.0477128419653545,2.056430207256609,2.2619070973220485,2.3212364753796515,2.2931108769894046,2.3360150694757706,2.373087554090762,2.6113665294700725,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,3.0670934723591254,3.239158528985891,3.5727776966246974,3.587125145032839,7.479663562575727,4.165705761027235,4.383707912841026,4.370968887063596,4.484804029712395,4.798834931860927,4.770124825978496,5.626901430320244,5.129498826886393,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.234369434614289E-4,3.231503296343699E-4,3.232301179470342E-4,3.2316513835412453E-4,3.231957221011733E-4,3.2314854788094107E-4,3.232490515657042E-4,3.23100468647525E-4,3.231503979288886E-4,3.2348433884844916E-4,3.260510929237654E-4,3.2315093168978155E-4,3.234569760431409E-4,3.234906746795235E-4,3.2334372131256856E-4,3.2316641125483124E-4,3.232775929986952E-4,3.2342972853301654E-4,3.2318309494325074E-4,3.231819133537905E-4,3.234726646135257E-4,3.2321429288206875E-4,3.232147820388904E-4,3.234218368888708E-4,3.231832115235309E-4,3.2349454119153854E-4,3.2326408687093875E-4,3.2314960538742894E-4,3.2329610760873685E-4,3.2339478224098825E-4,3.2321587830048645E-4,3.2338898568637554E-4,3.235477616049997E-4,3.2384806409665556E-4,3.2326352826150844E-4,3.2316621524927983E-4,3.2328273492035996E-4,3.2319903579630557E-4,3.231008134973832E-4,3.231829948587055E-4,3.235068794482582E-4,3.2332941556106155E-4,3.2338972263415525E-4,3.23116894188806E-4,3.23183077035954E-4,3.231660937264441E-4,3.2327548251912913E-4,3.233315388918588E-4,3.232657912505023E-4,3.2321455305145945E-4,3.2316689289136154E-4,3.2382900937340595E-4,3.2324821099066585E-4,3.23183002962803E-4,3.2324647987677164E-4,3.2314993601340476E-4,0.9744592174568528,3.232003527999259E-4,3.231673465763166E-4,3.2314975155118034E-4,3.2340827910418114E-4,3.2327845491382566E-4,3.2314961646609926E-4,3.231167625436768E-4,3.23084269583998E-4,3.233763889074317E-4,3.2316544733227516E-4,3.2331234632480377E-4,3.2340723030213067E-4,3.2326050673508566E-4,3.2318343100798446E-4,3.2311718612822106E-4,3.231998454744364E-4,3.231170120933027E-4,3.231339687515377E-4,3.2311719527324277E-4,3.233269434854578E-4,3.232307110399218E-4,3.231500477876595E-4,3.2318135092789945E-4]}}
{"value":"The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst film he has ever been in. The acting and the story was just terrible. I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr. Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. I couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this film is just so bad I can't even describe how badly they made this film. Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should. <br /><br />Hedeen's outlook: 0/10 No Stars F","finished_norm":["the","cat","in","the","hat","be","just","a","slap","in","the","face","film","mike","myer","a","the","cat","in","the","hat","be","downright","not","funni","and","mike","myer","can","not","have","be","ani","wrong","thi","be","hi","wrong","film","he","have","ever","be","in","the","act","and","the","stori","be","just","terribl","i","mean","how","can","thei","make","the","much","belov","stori","by","dr","seuss","be","make","into","film","and","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","of","alltim","and","such","a","disappoint","i","can","not","have","see","a","much","wrong","film","than","thi","besid","mayb","babi","geniu","but","thi","film","be","just","so","bad","i","ca","not","even","describ","how","badli","thei","make","thi","film","bo","welch","should","be","fire","or","the","writer","should","br","br","hedeen","outlook","no","star","f"],"filtered":["cat","hat","slap","face","film","mike","myer","cat","hat","downright","funni","mike","myer","ani","wrong","thi","hi","wrong","film","ever","act","stori","terribl","mean","thei","make","much","belov","stori","dr","seuss","make","film","wrong","film","alltim","disappoint","see","much","wrong","film","thi","besid","mayb","babi","geniu","thi","film","bad","ca","even","describ","badli","thei","make","thi","film","bo","welch","fire","writer","br","br","hedeen","outlook","star","f"],"filtered2":["cat","hat","slap","face","mike","myer","cat","hat","downright","funni","mike","myer","ani","wrong","wrong","ever","act","stori","terribl","mean","make","belov","stori","dr","seuss","make","wrong","alltim","disappoint","see","wrong","besid","mayb","babi","geniu","bad","ca","even","describ","badli","make","bo","welch","fire","writer","hedeen","outlook","star","f"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,9,17,21,25,27,44,62,81,88,100,163,166,187,251,287,448,551,668,698,739,792,972,1096,1327,1341,1490,1557,1671,1732,2489,3039,3942,4053,4255],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,9,17,21,25,27,44,62,81,88,100,163,166,187,251,287,448,551,668,698,739,792,972,1096,1327,1341,1490,1557,1671,1732,2489,3039,3942,4053,4255],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,5.118555152330806,1.3002700588679295,1.604729392502474,2.0226120445069267,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,2.1405462403177813,2.4000574358028657,2.4423870329693536,2.4732161909892554,2.6942272927333892,2.841890188081905,3.2681460658591432,3.528202072035993,3.5813614403160887,3.90413483257914,4.004218291136122,8.230887852492694,3.9911462095687695,4.429617614145104,9.226564708971052,4.449957298382227,4.558366596889411,4.550761997504193,5.3560264761848435,9.521470171257315,5.185068678041204,11.489368931953253,5.770002273960917,6.489124940924123,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035197E-4,2.55808234739393E-4,2.5587139576862226E-4,2.5581995743348233E-4,2.558441677579871E-4,2.5580682428995945E-4,2.5588638376375963E-4,2.5576876440667947E-4,2.558082888018483E-4,2.5607263894884244E-4,2.581045008063244E-4,2.5580871133099124E-4,2.56050978346078E-4,2.5607765444043913E-4,2.55961325048381E-4,2.558209650712686E-4,2.559089773770746E-4,2.560294090118494E-4,2.558341720046744E-4,2.558332366495585E-4,2.560633975365527E-4,2.558588685280094E-4,2.558592557482335E-4,2.560231619269079E-4,2.558342642905022E-4,2.5608071520047073E-4,2.5589828582462147E-4,2.558076614200599E-4,2.55923633681826E-4,2.5600174526388246E-4,2.5586012355716944E-4,2.5599715666759437E-4,2.561228448805952E-4,2.5636056659471274E-4,2.558978436251893E-4,2.558208099117979E-4,2.559130477609907E-4,2.5584679090401085E-4,2.557690373924244E-4,2.5583409277699456E-4,2.560904822574154E-4,2.5595000050774447E-4,2.559977400410071E-4,2.5578176698886615E-4,2.558341578291234E-4,2.558207137134059E-4,2.5590730670555504E-4,2.5595168135239543E-4,2.558996350243204E-4,2.5585907448005856E-4,2.5582134633837344E-4,2.5634548273227803E-4,2.558857183582285E-4,2.5583409919225926E-4,2.55884347995432E-4,2.5580792314607243E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.5584783345399567E-4,2.5582170547880075E-4,2.558077771243863E-4,2.560124294824373E-4,2.559096596755834E-4,2.5580767019001876E-4,2.5578166277759036E-4,2.5575594110598853E-4,2.5598718496251E-4,2.5582020202291345E-4,2.559364883717662E-4,2.5601159924283515E-4,2.558954517621164E-4,2.5583443803604865E-4,2.5578199809030583E-4,2.5584743185131726E-4,2.5578186032295373E-4,2.557952833413214E-4,2.5578200532957394E-4,2.559480435940782E-4,2.5587186526541896E-4,2.558080116274143E-4,2.558327914289873E-4]}}
{"value":"I usually enjoy films like this. It's shot documentary style, but the acting and writing are just awful. The acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so cliché, but not at all in a good way. As of typing this, I'm surprised it's at a 5.2/10 on IMDb. I'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie. I suppose if that's the case, you might manage a couple of laughs, as it's always funny seeing your relatives/friends make a movie. Well, in a way, I guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers, directors, actors, etc., 'cause if they can do it, you can do it.

{"value":"As a former Kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town I was looking forward to seeing this movie. But, what a disappointment! Although the acting and the production values aren't bad, the script is awful, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is disturbing.<br /><br />The main message of this film is that Women are nothing without husbands and children. I can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women. Has the writer been living under a rock? <br /><br />Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It's an embarrassment to the city it's named after.","finished_norm":["a","a","former","kalamazoo","resid","with","a","fond","for","the","town","i","be","look","forward","to","see","thi","movi","but","what","a","disappoint","although","the","act","and","the","product","valu","be","not","bad","the","script","be","aw","the","plot","be","unrealist","and","the","theme","be","disturbingbr","br","the","main","messag","of","thi","film","be","that","woman","be","noth","without","husband","and","child","i","can","hardli","believ","how","regress","it","be","in","it","view","of","woman","have","the","writer","be","live","under","a","rock","br","br","although","i","enjoi","see","my","belov","citi","on","the","big","screen","i","would","not","suggest","thi","movi","to","anyon","it","terribl","it","a","embarrass","to","the","citi","it","name","after"],"filtered":["former","kalamazoo","resid","fond","town","look","forward","see","thi","movi","disappoint","although","act","product","valu","bad","script","aw","plot","unrealist","theme","disturbingbr","br","main","messag","thi","film","woman","noth","without","husband","child","hardli","believ","regress","view","woman","writer","live","rock","br","br","although","enjoi","see","belov","citi","big","screen","suggest","thi","movi","anyon","terribl","embarrass","citi","name"],"filtered2":["former","kalamazoo","resid","fond","town","look","forward","see","disappoint","although","act","product","valu","bad","script","aw","plot","unrealist","theme","disturbingbr","main","messag","woman","noth","without","husband","child","hardli","believ","regress","view","woman","writer","live","rock","although","enjoi","see","belov","citi","big","screen","suggest","anyon","terribl","embarrass","citi","name"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,16,21,32,49,70,77,82,91,116,125,138,143,158,166,179,180,187,190,192,200,237,287,312,450,451,534,536,556,569,582,595,646,665,699,1039,1264,1963,2489,3047,7810],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,16,21,32,49,70,77,82,91,116,125,138,143,158,166,179,180,187,190,192,200,237,287,312,450,451,534,536,556,569,582,595,646,665,699,1039,1264,1963,2489,3047,7810],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.6920303308087352,4.189351572503368,1.9463902258768238,2.020196584395323,2.0105926690411424,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.2907365189289424,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.4423870329693536,2.507968722980095,2.7097314792693545,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.5308211829319704,5.280195575021108,2.841890188081905,2.8824835850471584,3.469984576472117,3.216957819005698,3.4933926673701317,3.6254214301101193,3.43462735814388,3.6436037491933098,3.7099788181381825,7.256857902348149,3.5900195030592035,3.5929222627171646,3.5813614403160887,4.105687751300982,4.327618446189983,4.911775343041523,5.185068678041204,5.426230734858092,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485934E-4,2.612525409305091E-4,2.6131704620099323E-4,2.612645131159257E-4,2.61289238703044E-4,2.612511004628137E-4,2.613323531820882E-4,2.6121223056003453E-4,2.6125259614356286E-4,2.6152257239224746E-4,2.6359767788534363E-4,2.6125302766529364E-4,2.6150045079199457E-4,2.615276946273662E-4,2.614088894243552E-4,2.612655421990288E-4,2.6135542764993457E-4,2.6147842240272423E-4,2.6127903021247635E-4,2.6127807495041863E-4,2.615131342971645E-4,2.6130425234607965E-4,2.6130464780742025E-4,2.614720423625506E-4,2.612791244624016E-4,2.6153082052883005E-4,2.613445085516979E-4,2.6125195540935606E-4,2.613703958813555E-4,2.614501698937485E-4,2.613055340857286E-4,2.6144548363945033E-4,2.6157384684497785E-4,2.6181662793414343E-4,2.6134405694103966E-4,2.612653837373357E-4,2.613595846628694E-4,2.6129191767686443E-4,2.6121250935567063E-4,2.612789492986125E-4,2.615407954557389E-4,2.6139732386619733E-4,2.614460794286615E-4,2.612255098731043E-4,2.6127901573523045E-4,2.6126528549157607E-4,2.61353721421908E-4,2.613990404838676E-4,2.613458864660951E-4,2.6130446268135755E-4,2.6126593158055125E-4,2.6180122304543014E-4,2.6133167361488843E-4,2.612789558504117E-4,2.6133027408698444E-4,2.6125222270562153E-4,0.979351423393872,2.6129298241519416E-4,2.612662983644794E-4,2.612520735761904E-4,2.614610815020013E-4,2.613561244696412E-4,2.612519643659639E-4,2.6122540344392456E-4,2.611991343440662E-4,2.614352997089238E-4,2.6126476291089585E-4,2.6138352415462304E-4,2.6146023359260596E-4,2.6134161417251043E-4,2.6127930190573344E-4,2.612257458930213E-4,2.612925722653009E-4,2.6122560519359925E-4,2.6123931389089377E-4,2.6122575328636104E-4,2.6139532530400003E-4,2.6131752568997924E-4,2.6125231307009086E-4,2.612776202543232E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie makes no sense at all, there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous NYPD vehicles through. The characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever. I will put my comments in the chat board, but save your time and money, this is stupid. I can't stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music, and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level. But it is nice to see Denzel W. prevail over the Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt.

{"value":"This production has absolutely no storyline. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV. Her acting is far from flawless and personally I think she has crossed boundary of professional decency; relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands (as most movies do). Do not bother to watch this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who has proved to be better with her close on on the

{"value":"I am a current A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this movie in class, and what I got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film.

Also, the film didn't make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic. I.E. Deaf People who were born hearing and later went deaf. Is it right or wrong in that instance? The film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the Deaf w/ a capital \"D\".
