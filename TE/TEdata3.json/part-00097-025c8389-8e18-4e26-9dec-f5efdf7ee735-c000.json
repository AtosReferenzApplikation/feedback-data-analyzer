{"value":"I'm always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes. People who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst.<br /><br />Stigmata wouldn't be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First of all the sound. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when Patrica was talking in her monotone voice, she could hardly be heard.<br /><br />I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica had basically 3 emotions. Quiet, in great pain, or really angry she has stigmata. The first was the predominate one, the second involved screaming pain, the third involving raising her voice. It was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion.<br /><br />Maybe I missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible filming and MTV like style. When you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story, in a 2 hour feature film, it's nauseating. I fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child. And no Pittsburg does not rain that often!!<br /><br />I think maybe a real story, with something to say could have been intended, but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that Ms. Arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story.","finished_norm":["i","be","alwai","supris","on","how","differ","all","peopl","be","and","how","for","almost","everi","movi","you","get","both","extrem","peopl","who","think","it","the","well","movi","and","peopl","who","think","it","the","worstbr","br","stigma","would","not","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","but","it","up","there","of","all","the","sound","the","produc","spend","much","time","on","the","soundtrack","than","the","edit","it","be","so","loud","when","the","soundtrack","be","plai","and","no","on","be","talk","and","then","when","patrica","be","talk","in","her","monoton","voic","she","can","hardli","be","heardbr","br","i","usual","like","patrica","and","gaberi","but","thei","be","both","flat","in","thi","movi","patrica","have","basic","emot","quiet","in","great","pain","or","realli","angri","she","have","stigma","the","be","the","predomin","on","the","involv","scream","pain","the","involv","rais","her","voic","it","be","loud","that","distiguish","the","three","and","not","emotionbr","br","mayb","i","miss","a","lot","of","the","deep","mean","and","subplot","everyon","be","talk","about","or","mayb","i","be","distract","by","the","terribl","film","and","mtv","like","styl","when","you","watch","a","minut","video","you","ne","fast","cut","and","slow","motion","to","convei","a","quick","stori","in","a","hour","featur","film","it","nauseat","i","fail","to","see","the","mean","of","her","see","that","woman","across","the","steet","and","drop","a","child","and","no","pittsburg","doe","not","rain","that","oftenbr","br","i","think","mayb","a","real","stori","with","someth","to","sai","can","have","be","intend","but","all","the","budget","be","spend","on","bui","music","and","the","equip","to","do","slow","rain","drop","shot","and","rent","that","gorgou","apart","that","m","arquett","live","in","that","thei","end","up","fire","the","gui","with","the","stori"],"filtered":["alwai","supris","differ","peopl","almost","everi","movi","get","extrem","peopl","think","well","movi","peopl","think","worstbr","br","stigma","wrong","movi","ever","see","sound","produc","spend","much","time","soundtrack","edit","loud","soundtrack","plai","talk","patrica","talk","monoton","voic","hardli","heardbr","br","usual","like","patrica","gaberi","thei","flat","thi","movi","patrica","basic","emot","quiet","great","pain","realli","angri","stigma","predomin","involv","scream","pain","involv","rais","voic","loud","distiguish","three","emotionbr","br","mayb","miss","lot","deep","mean","subplot","everyon","talk","mayb","distract","terribl","film","mtv","like","styl","watch","minut","video","ne","fast","cut","slow","motion","convei","quick","stori","hour","featur","film","nauseat","fail","see","mean","see","woman","across","steet","drop","child","pittsburg","doe","rain","oftenbr","br","think","mayb","real","stori","someth","sai","intend","budget","spend","bui","music","equip","slow","rain","drop","shot","rent","gorgou","apart","m","arquett","live","thei","end","fire","gui","stori"],"filtered2":["alwai","supris","differ","peopl","almost","everi","get","extrem","peopl","think","well","peopl","think","worstbr","stigma","wrong","ever","see","sound","produc","spend","time","soundtrack","edit","loud","soundtrack","plai","talk","patrica","talk","monoton","voic","hardli","heardbr","usual","like","patrica","gaberi","flat","patrica","basic","emot","quiet","great","pain","realli","angri","stigma","predomin","involv","scream","pain","involv","rais","voic","loud","distiguish","three","emotionbr","mayb","miss","lot","deep","mean","subplot","everyon","talk","mayb","distract","terribl","mtv","like","styl","watch","minut","video","ne","fast","cut","slow","motion","convei","quick","stori","hour","featur","nauseat","fail","see","mean","see","woman","across","steet","drop","child","pittsburg","doe","rain","oftenbr","think","mayb","real","stori","someth","intend","budget","spend","bui","music","equip","slow","rain","drop","shot","rent","gorgou","apart","m","arquett","live","end","fire","gui","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,12,13,17,18,20,23,24,25,40,44,51,53,55,59,70,72,80,85,88,110,116,118,131,163,166,174,178,180,186,197,204,215,224,240,241,246,255,256,261,265,283,286,303,305,329,347,348,380,390,428,441,458,503,506,526,542,551,572,593,661,665,796,834,904,926,957,1021,1044,1161,1173,1221,1356,1408,1613,2061,2239,2627,2992,3191,3213,3589,7424],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,12,13,17,18,20,23,24,25,40,44,51,53,55,59,70,72,80,85,88,110,116,118,131,163,166,174,178,180,186,197,204,215,224,240,241,246,255,256,261,265,283,286,303,305

{"value":"The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. It's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.<br /><br />The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.<br /><br />Very little happens in this film. And when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. These guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. It really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. But the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. It's a travesty. Unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. The story in general is, to say the least, uneven. The women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious.<br /><br />The whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. It doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. All we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.<br /><br />A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I cannot agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. It's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either.<br /><br />I can't recommend this to anyone.","finished_norm":["the","bloodsuck","lead","the","danc","what","a","laughabl","titl","it","so","utterli","mislead","it","not","surpris","that","the","filmmak","try","and","mislead","u","though","becaus","thi","be","on","terribl","moviebr","br","the","stori","basic","involv","a","murder","mysteri","in","a","castl","on","a","remot","islandbr","br","veri","littl","happen","in","thi","film","and","when","someth","doe","wake","the","viewer","from","hi","stupor","it","invari","be","unintent","comedi","in","the","form","of","atroci","dialogu","deliv","by","a","hopeless","group","of","voiceartist","thi","gui","be","so","bad","thei","make","the","actor","thei","deliv","voic","for","appear","like","a","group","of","remediallevel","moron","it","realli","be","hard","to","determin","how","bad","the","act","be","when","you","have","dub","thi","abysm","but","the","voiceartist","cannot","be","blame","for","the","script","it","a","travesti","unintention","funni","at","well","pathet","at","wrong","the","stori","in","gener","be","to","sai","the","littl","uneven","the","woman","charact","be","particularli","idiot","the","man","be","either","creepi","or","tediousbr","br","the","whole","enterpris","smack","of","pure","exploit","of","the","audienc","it","doe","not","remot","deliv","what","it","promis","and","even","when","the","murder","final","start","happen","thei","all","occur","off","screen","all","we","get","be","a","few","halfheart","sever","head","shotsbr","br","a","few","peopl","have","sai","that","thi","movi","be","a","giallo","i","cannot","agre","littl","with","thi","opinion","anyon","who","enjoi","italian","thriller","should","give","thi","movi","a","wide","berth","a","there","be","noth","remot","thrill","about","it","it","basic","a","softcor","porn","film","with","a","horror","angl","but","it","not","veri","erot","eitherbr","br","i","ca","not","recommend","thi","to","anyon"],"filtered":["bloodsuck","lead","danc","laughabl","titl","utterli","mislead","surpris","filmmak","try","mislead","u","though","becaus","thi","terribl","moviebr","br","stori","basic","involv","murder","mysteri","castl","remot","islandbr","br","veri","littl","happen","thi","film","someth","doe","wake","viewer","hi","stupor","invari","unintent","comedi","form","atroci","dialogu","deliv","hopeless","group","voiceartist","thi","gui","bad","thei","make","actor","thei","deliv","voic","appear","like","group","remediallevel","moron","realli","hard","determin","bad","act","dub","thi","abysm","voiceartist","blame","script","travesti","unintention","funni","well","pathet","wrong","stori","gener","sai","littl","uneven","woman","charact","particularli","idiot","man","either","creepi","tediousbr","br","whole","enterpris","smack","pure","exploit","audienc","doe","remot","deliv","promis","even","murder","final","start","happen","thei","occur","screen","get","halfheart","sever","head","shotsbr","br","peopl","sai","thi","movi","giallo","agre","littl","thi","opinion","anyon","enjoi","italian","thriller","give","thi","movi","wide","berth","noth","remot","thrill","basic","softcor","porn","film","horror","angl","veri","erot","eitherbr","br","ca","recommend","thi","anyon"],"filtered2":["bloodsuck","lead","danc","laughabl","titl","utterli","mislead","surpris","filmmak","try","mislead","u","though","becaus","terribl","moviebr","stori","basic","involv","murder","mysteri","castl","remot","islandbr","veri","littl","happen","someth","doe","wake","viewer","stupor","invari","unintent","comedi","form","atroci","dialogu","deliv","hopeless","group","voiceartist","gui","bad","make","actor","deliv","voic","appear","like","group","remediallevel","moron","realli","hard","determin","bad","act","dub","abysm","voiceartist","blame","script","travesti","unintention","funni","well","pathet","wrong","stori","gener","littl","uneven","woman","charact","particularli","idiot","man","either","creepi","tediousbr","whole","enterpris","smack","pure","exploit","audienc","doe","remot","deliv","promis","even","murder","final","start","happen","occur","screen","get","halfheart","sever","head","shotsbr","peopl","giallo","agre","littl","opinion","anyon","enjoi","italian","thriller","give","wide","berth","noth","remot","thrill","basic","softcor","porn","horror","angl","veri","erot","eitherbr","ca","recommend","anyon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,9,10,13,14,15,17,18,20,21,22,23,25,30,36,41,45,49,53,55,62,70,71,77,81,83,86,94,111,112,127,156,157,158,166,168,170,171,192,200,207,208,225,241,248,264,273,279,286,298,316,323,326,403,410,428,465,492,497,517,538,552,602,622,683,689,705,714,726,755,816,883,898,918,949,971,1030,1218,1219,1259,1293,1368,1387,1582,1860,1958,2100,2102,2125,2199,2528,2826,2973,3162,3289,3538,4090,4614,5165,5375,6873,7216,8096,8442],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. But the good outweigh the bad (barely). Give this a rent, but I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /><br />My Grade: C <br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras: An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and

{"value":"No,<br /><br />Basically your watching something that doesn't make sense. To not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick I will explain the story.<br /><br />A normal everyday to day women, is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car. She follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family.<br /><br />I specifically made an account to comment on this film, of how horribly written this was. The acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this, usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking, What just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing.<br /><br />Spoiler Starts__<br /><br />They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. It was not elaborated on all during the film, and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened. Nothing gets explained during the film. The main character shouldn't of even been the main character. At the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away (her sisters boyfriend) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after. <br /><br />I bought this movie for $10, threw it out right after.. don't waste your time. I really hope nothing like this is made again.","finished_norm":["nobr","br","basic","your","watch","someth","that","doe","not","make","sens","to","not","spoil","the","film","for","peopl","who","actual","want","to","thi","take","a","look","at","the","flick","i","will","explain","the","storybr","br","a","normal","everydai","to","dai","woman","be","walk","down","a","street","then","find","herself","drive","by","in","her","own","car","she","follow","her","and","mani","event","take","place","dure","that","time","that","includ","her","and","her","familybr","br","i","specif","make","a","account","to","comment","on","thi","film","of","how","horribli","write","thi","be","the","act","be","great","the","event","be","great","but","the","stori","just","bring","it","nowher","it","can","of","be","add","to","tremend","and","be","make","into","a","worldwid","epidem","i","be","not","sure","what","the","writer","be","try","to","accomplish","by","make","thi","usual","at","the","end","of","film","much","of","your","question","get","answer","but","thi","film","have","you","ask","what","just","happen","and","hour","minut","just","pass","for","nothingbr","br","spoiler","startsbr","br","thei","have","thi","area","between","dimens","our","and","behind","the","glass","that","would","come","into","our","world","and","kill","u","it","be","not","elabor","on","all","dure","the","film","and","you","never","know","how","it","be","happen","or","why","it","be","or","when","it","happen","noth","get","explain","dure","the","film","the","main","charact","should","not","of","even","be","the","main","charact","at","the","end","of","the","film","the","gui","who","final","figur","it","all","out","and","run","awai","her","sister","boyfriend","should","of","be","the","main","charact","but","sadli","the","movi","end","second","after","br","br","i","bui","thi","movi","for","throw","it","out","right","after","do","not","wast","your","time","i","realli","hope","noth","like","thi","be","make","again"],"filtered":["nobr","br","basic","watch","someth","doe","make","sens","spoil","film","peopl","actual","want","thi","take","look","flick","explain","storybr","br","normal","everydai","dai","woman","walk","street","find","drive","car","follow","mani","event","take","place","dure","time","includ","familybr","br","specif","make","account","comment","thi","film","horribli","write","thi","act","great","event","great","stori","bring","nowher","add","tremend","make","worldwid","epidem","sure","writer","try","accomplish","make","thi","usual","end","film","much","question","get","answer","thi","film","ask","happen","hour","minut","pass","nothingbr","br","spoiler","startsbr","br","thei","thi","area","dimens","behind","glass","come","world","kill","u","elabor","dure","film","never","know","happen","happen","noth","get","explain","dure","film","main","charact","even","main","charact","end","film","gui","final","figur","run","awai","sister","boyfriend","main","charact","sadli","movi","end","second","br","br","bui","thi","movi","throw","right","wast","time","realli","hope","noth","like","thi","make"],"filtered2":["nobr","basic","watch","someth","doe","make","sens","spoil","peopl","actual","want","take","look","flick","explain","storybr","normal","everydai","dai","woman","walk","street","find","drive","car","follow","mani","event","take","place","dure","time","includ","familybr","specif","make","account","comment","horribli","write","act","great","event","great","stori","bring","nowher","add","tremend","make","worldwid","epidem","sure","writer","try","accomplish","make","usual","end","question","get","answer","ask","happen","hour","minut","pass","nothingbr","spoiler","startsbr","area","dimens","behind","glass","come","world","kill","u","elabor","dure","never","know","happen","happen","noth","get","explain","dure","main","charact","even","main","charact","end","gui","final","figur","run","awai","sister","boyfriend","main","charact","sadli","end","second","bui","throw","right","wast","time","realli","hope","noth","like","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,8,10,13,16,17,18,21,23,24,26,31,34,36,37,38,42,49,50,51,52,53,55,59,65,70,76,89,94,112,119,121,132,137,155,156,164,165,173,174,179,181,239,250,257,260,265,280,284,286,287,294,299,301,306,310,347,378,393,395,415,461,470,487,490,585,664,700,706,799,800,947,1050,1157,1193,1276,1503,1662,1777,1930,2000,2538,3700,3835,3891,5291,5768,6724,7576,8570],"values":[5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,8,10,13,16,17,18,21,23,24,26,31,34,36,37,38,42,49,50,51,52,53,55,59,65,70,76,89,94,112,119,121,132,137,155,156,164,165,173,174,179,181,239,250,257,260,265,280,28

{"value":"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic, and if done the right way could have been handled nicely, but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog, cheap laughs, choppy directing, and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete.<br /><br />The acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture. I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says \"Ah, you all look the same to me.\" I hate to admit it, but I laughed out loud with that line.<br /><br />Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film as well, not a way to end a career), and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me watching.<br /><br />The sets were also nice. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture.<br /><br />In all honesty, my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you're better off settling on chewing aluminum

{"value":"The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman etc. as kings of the B's. Because the folks at Crown International were so key, they haven't been elevated to the status they richly deserve. A film like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteria, but it was a sizable hit when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits).<br /><br />THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie-goers at the time of a film's release. Here, it was sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and the brief \"Custom Van\" fad. As others have noted, it is ironic that the \"hit\" song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself. I had a town Selectman where I was at the time even declare these vans to be \"dens of sin on wheels!\" A perfect ad line for the film!<br /><br />There are the usual assortment of \"good\" and \"bad\" girls, muscle-heads and low-brow hijinks (including a supporting bit by Danny DeVito). In many ways this isn't much different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60's, but now spiced up with Nudity and Drug use. Obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule, the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some, by today's standards certainly, un-PC views of women.<br /><br />The classic touch is a Toaster for Bobby's den of sin on wheels.

{"value":"This film had no huge stars in it, but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors AND Gene Tierney before she became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered. Most of this, I suspect, is because of a second-rate script, as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm.<br /><br />The film is set in East Africa during WWII--just before the Americans entered the war. The Brits are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals. One of the white men in the film is a double-dealer--working for the destruction of the British Empire! But, lovely Tierney, playing a sultan's daughter(!), is out to help save the day for good ol' Britain.<br /><br />American film makers have long sided with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire films. Nowadays, with changed sensibilities, the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for Queen and country seems ridiculous--and it would be hard to root for either side! Still, in its day, this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the British--though when seen today, the film suffers from a long-winded script and silly casting. The one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk--losing some of its punch.","finished_norm":["thi","film","have","no","huge","star","in","it","but","do","have","a","veri","good","cast","fill","with","excel","support","actor","and","gene","tiernei","befor","she","becom","a","big","star","with","georg","sander","reginald","gardner","harri","carei","bruce","cabot","jospeh","calleia","and","ceder","hardwick","you","have","expect","much","from","the","film","than","it","actual","deliv","much","of","thi","i","suspect","be","becaus","of","a","secondr","script","a","director","henri","hathawai","be","a","compet","and","wellestablish","man","at","the","helmbr","br","the","film","be","set","in","east","africa","dure","wwiijust","befor","the","american","enter","the","war","the","brit","be","try","to","control","their","african","coloni","while","subvers","nazi","elem","be","try","to","stir","up","troubl","among","the","local","on","of","the","white","man","in","the","film","be","a","doubledealerwork","for","the","destruct","of","the","british","empir","but","love","tiernei","plai","a","sultan","daughter","be","out","to","help","save","the","dai","for","good","ol","britainbr","br","american","film","maker","have","long","side","with","the","empir","and","the","and","see","a","plethora","of","proempir","film","nowadai","with","chang","sensibl","the","notion","of","see","the","happi","black","nativ","dye","for","queen","and","countri","seem","ridiculousand","it","would","be","hard","to","root","for","either","side","still","in","it","dai","thi","propaganda","piec","be","effect","in","drum","up","support","for","the","britishthough","when","see","todai","the","film","suffer","from","a","longwind","script","and","silli","cast","the","on","bright","moment","in","the","film","be","the","final","showdown","between","georg","sander","and","the","enemi","agent","too","bad","after","such","a","potent","scene","the","film","just","seem","to","talk","and","talklos","some","of","it","punch"],"filtered":["thi","film","huge","star","veri","good","cast","fill","excel","support","actor","gene","tiernei","befor","becom","big","star","georg","sander","reginald","gardner","harri","carei","bruce","cabot","jospeh","calleia","ceder","hardwick","expect","much","film","actual","deliv","much","thi","suspect","becaus","secondr","script","director","henri","hathawai","compet","wellestablish","man","helmbr","br","film","set","east","africa","dure","wwiijust","befor","american","enter","war","brit","try","control","african","coloni","subvers","nazi","elem","try","stir","troubl","among","local","white","man","film","doubledealerwork","destruct","british","empir","love","tiernei","plai","sultan","daughter","help","save","dai","good","ol","britainbr","br","american","film","maker","long","side","empir","see","plethora","proempir","film","nowadai","chang","sensibl","notion","see","happi","black","nativ","dye","queen","countri","seem","ridiculousand","hard","root","either","side","still","dai","thi","propaganda","piec","effect","drum","support","britishthough","see","todai","film","suffer","longwind","script","silli","cast","bright","moment","film","final","showdown","georg","sander","enemi","agent","bad","potent","scene","film","seem","talk","talklos","punch"],"filtered2":["huge","star","veri","good","cast","fill","excel","support","actor","gene","tiernei","befor","becom","big","star","georg","sander","reginald","gardner","harri","carei","bruce","cabot","jospeh","calleia","ceder","hardwick","expect","actual","deliv","suspect","becaus","secondr","script","director","henri","hathawai","compet","wellestablish","man","helmbr","set","east","africa","dure","wwiijust","befor","american","enter","war","brit","try","control","african","coloni","subvers","nazi","elem","try","stir","troubl","among","local","white","man","doubledealerwork","destruct","british","empir","love","tiernei","plai","sultan","daughter","help","save","dai","good","ol","britainbr","american","maker","long","side","empir","see","plethora","proempir","nowadai","chang","sensibl","notion","see","happi","black","nativ","dye","queen","countri","seem","ridiculousand","hard","root","either","side","still","dai","propaganda","piec","effect","drum","support","britishthough","see","todai","suffer","longwind","script","silli","cast","bright","moment","final","showdown","georg","sander","enemi","agent","bad","potent","scene","seem","talk","talklos","punch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,15,19,22,35,36,40,41,45,52,54,58,64,77,79,82,92,99,100,106,109,115,130,132,156,171,185,186,188,189,207,218,223,229,239,278,314,359,385,425,426,444,459,475,479,517,553,580,605,608,633,680,696,752,763,789,824,826,977,1010,1069,1170,1230,1329,1335,1361,1363,1365,1469,1542,1564,1612,1657,1934,2192,2269,2411,2580,2582,2639,2754,3201,3875,4070,4166,4183,4376,4472,5350,5415,6064,6523,7190,7231,7555,8043,8348],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"What do you call a horror story without horror and story? <br /><br />This is the most irritating thing about the film: I get the feeling the writers never really decided what's actually going on in the film! It's a different thing to know it, give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it, but here, you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it, characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows! (Remember \"Cube\"? Even that film knew more about itself.) <br /><br />I've consumed a lot of 80's horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films. But a lot of important things are missing. We really know nothing about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines over and over again. The story isn't really developing - it never goes anywhere. B-acting is OK in this type of horror films, but there's not much to act in the script. We don't care about the characters. There's nothing to remember about them. There's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no thrills, no chills.<br /><br />You only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre. They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story.<br /><br />I honestly believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment. Oh yeah, film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended.

{"value":"The script is so so laughable... this in turn, makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed. There's repetition of phrases -- \"my sweet little god daughter\" and minor variations of that line which comes to mind... and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog.<br /><br />Worse yet, the music is so WRONG! Plus, the main bluesy \"theme\" is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this. And it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes, even when the scene's emotional context does.<br /><br />Subsequently, whenever it appears, it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another.<br /><br />The music's corny, and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom -- a low budget 80's Canadian sitcom at that -- and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial.<br /><br />This is so miscast, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only ONE type of NY accent -- a thick Bronx accent. I don't know if it's a question of the actors' limited capacity in only knowing *one* NY accent -- or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly.<br /><br />In the end, it's the amateur script with it's leaden lines which makes this entire \"movie\"... blow.

{"value":"This was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we're not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools. After the basic version download ( die hard fan here on a dial-up modem ) eventually got here I hit my first snag. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server. Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. Going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it...<br /><br />The Film. Beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, masterful camera work and flawless texturing. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved.... and spoke... And the movie died for me. Everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters ( except for Proog in the dancing scene ) looked fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-scenes that entail less realism than this.<br /><br />Any frame in the movie is fantastic.. as a frame, and the thing is great if neither actors are moving. I'm so glad i haven't actually recommended this to anyone.

{"value":"Ben Stiller doesn't so much act as react. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There's Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When he confronts Mary's other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.<br /><br />In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. Having said that, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed (though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Stiller's characters could have played off each other much, much more. Aniston again reprises her Rachael role, but Stiller is no Ross. It is more of a \"Joey with a crush on Rachael\" scenario.<br /><br />Polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and that is its failing - it lacks heart. You don't root for the characters. With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure comes down to poor writing. Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night, but you'll regret forking out cash to see it.","finished_norm":["ben","still","doe","not","so","much","act","a","react","and","he","doe","it","veri","good","he","be","veri","depend","on","the","comedi","go","on","around","him","in","there","someth","about","mari","the","standup","hair","scene","onli","work","becaus","of","still","try","to","keep","a","straight","face","when","he","confront","mari","other","two","suitor","he","be","the","unfunniest","gui","in","the","room","but","the","scene","be","hilariousbr","br","in","along","come","polli","the","formula","break","down","for","reason","that","be","difficult","to","fathom","still","be","surround","by","a","arrai","of","comic","talent","hank","azaria","and","philip","seymour","hoffman","get","the","well","line","of","which","there","be","too","few","have","sai","that","hoffman","reli","a","littl","too","much","on","bodili","humour","you","know","we","be","in","troubl","when","thei","go","to","the","fart","joke","to","rais","a","laugh","a","basketbal","scene","where","hoffman","ham","it","up","be","complet","overplai","though","it","throw","up","on","predica","in","the","form","of","a","shirtless","oppon","that","doe","rais","a","smile","notic","through","still","reaction","howev","everyon","seem","to","be","act","in","a","bubbl","there","be","veri","littl","reaction","hoffman","and","still","charact","can","have","plai","off","each","other","much","much","much","aniston","again","repris","her","rachael","role","but","still","be","no","ross","it","be","much","of","a","joei","with","a","crush","on","rachael","scenariobr","br","polli","be","a","bythenumb","romcom","and","that","be","it","fail","it","lack","heart","you","do","not","root","for","the","charact","with","a","littl","bite","much","work","we","can","have","have","a","deep","stori","but","in","the","end","the","film","failur","come","down","to","poor","write","worth","watch","if","it","pop","up","on","tv","on","a","slow","night","but","you","will","regret","fork","out","cash","to","see","it"],"filtered":["ben","still","doe","much","act","react","doe","veri","good","veri","depend","comedi","go","around","someth","mari","standup","hair","scene","onli","work","becaus","still","try","keep","straight","face","confront","mari","two","suitor","unfunniest","gui","room","scene","hilariousbr","br","along","come","polli","formula","break","reason","difficult","fathom","still","surround","arrai","comic","talent","hank","azaria","philip","seymour","hoffman","get","well","line","sai","hoffman","reli","littl","much","bodili","humour","know","troubl","thei","go","fart","joke","rais","laugh","basketbal","scene","hoffman","ham","complet","overplai","though","throw","predica","form","shirtless","oppon","doe","rais","smile","notic","still","reaction","howev","everyon","seem","act","bubbl","veri","littl","reaction","hoffman","still","charact","plai","much","much","much","aniston","repris","rachael","role","still","ross","much","joei","crush","rachael","scenariobr","br","polli","bythenumb","romcom","fail","lack","heart","root","charact","littl","bite","much","work","deep","stori","end","film","failur","come","poor","write","worth","watch","pop","tv","slow","night","regret","fork","cash","see"],"filtered2":["ben","still","doe","act","react","doe","veri","good","veri","depend","comedi","go","around","someth","mari","standup","hair","scene","onli","work","becaus","still","try","keep","straight","face","confront","mari","two","suitor","unfunniest","gui","room","scene","hilariousbr","along","come","polli","formula","break","reason","difficult","fathom","still","surround","arrai","comic","talent","hank","azaria","philip","seymour","hoffman","get","well","line","hoffman","reli","littl","bodili","humour","know","troubl","go","fart","joke","rais","laugh","basketbal","scene","hoffman","ham","complet","overplai","though","throw","predica","form","shirtless","oppon","doe","rais","smile","notic","still","reaction","howev","everyon","seem","act","bubbl","veri","littl","reaction","hoffman","still","charact","plai","aniston","repris","rachael","role","still","ross","joei","crush","rachael","scenariobr","polli","bythenumb","romcom","fail","lack","heart","root","charact","littl","bite","work","deep","stori","end","failur","come","poor","write","worth","watch","pop","tv","slow","night","regret","fork","cash","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,10,11,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,24,26,34,35,36,40,47,48,53,55,64,65,86,95,98,103,107,113,127,128,133,134,146,154,172,183,210,214,215,219,246,251,276,310,324,360,390,480,513,548,614,688,689,752,803,813,834,854,921,952,1044,1176,1235,1269,1275,1301,1336,1363,1426,1454,1678,1834,1969,2166,2176,2198,2476,3040,3218,3746,3772,3904,4111,4459,4540,4873,4992,5003,5274,5461,6019,6284,6443,6711,7131,7154,7477,8233,8495,8496],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"Oh-so-familiar comedy story about low-key nice-guy Paul (Jason Lee), who after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he met just the night before. After lying about it to his fiancée Karen (Selma Blair), he's forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks.<br /><br />I'm sure most of us have been witness to a story like this at least once before...on film or on TV. The movie is formulaic and EXTREMELY predictable, with an ending you may see coming a mile away.<br /><br />At least the cast provides some interest and keeps it watchable. Lee is just right in the lead, and Stiles is a lot of fun in a light-hearted comedic role different from the very serious roles she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes.<br /><br />But you know, this isn't exactly well-written. At least one question is left unanswered: for WHAT, exactly, is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend, being investigated by the I.A.?<br /><br />And I didn't like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; he's a super-obnoxious moron who got on my nerves so quickly I was begging for somebody to punch him.<br /><br />Add another debit: a gratuitous, uncredited cameo by comic/actor Larry Miller, once again playing a grouch (in this case, it's a little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister).<br /><br />Not good at all, but as usual for me, I give it a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.","finished_norm":["ohsofamiliar","comedi","stori","about","lowkei","nicegui","paul","jason","lee","who","after","the","night","of","hi","bachelor","parti","wake","up","in","bed","with","becki","julia","stile","a","attract","blond","he","meet","just","the","night","befor","after","lie","about","it","to","hi","fiancé","karen","selma","blair","he","forc","to","tell","much","and","much","lie","to","cover","hi","tracksbr","br","i","be","sure","much","of","u","have","be","wit","to","a","stori","like","thi","at","littl","onc","beforeon","film","or","on","tv","the","movi","be","formula","and","extrem","predict","with","a","end","you","mai","see","come","a","mile","awaybr","br","at","littl","the","cast","provid","some","interest","and","keep","it","watchabl","lee","be","just","right","in","the","lead","and","stile","be","a","lot","of","fun","in","a","lightheart","comed","role","differ","from","the","veri","seriou","role","she","usual","plai","becki","be","a","free","spirit","who","seem","to","chang","job","a","often","a","other","peopl","chang","their","clothesbr","br","but","you","know","thi","be","not","exactli","wellwritten","at","littl","on","question","be","leav","unansw","for","what","exactli","be","rai","lochlyn","munro","becki","brutal","exboyfriend","be","investig","by","the","iabr","br","and","i","do","not","like","the","charact","of","buck","david","koechner","paul","stepfath","he","a","superobnoxi","moron","who","get","on","my","nerv","so","quickli","i","be","beg","for","somebodi","to","punch","himbr","br","add","anoth","debit","a","gratuit","uncredit","cameo","by","comicactor","larri","miller","onc","again","plai","a","grouch","in","thi","case","it","a","littl","justifi","hi","charact","be","a","ultraconserv","ministerbr","br","not","good","at","all","but","a","usual","for","me","i","give","it","a","three","out","of","ten","base","on","the","effort","of","the","cast","alon"],"filtered":["ohsofamiliar","comedi","stori","lowkei","nicegui","paul","jason","lee","night","hi","bachelor","parti","wake","bed","becki","julia","stile","attract","blond","meet","night","befor","lie","hi","fiancé","karen","selma","blair","forc","tell","much","much","lie","cover","hi","tracksbr","br","sure","much","u","wit","stori","like","thi","littl","onc","beforeon","film","tv","movi","formula","extrem","predict","end","mai","see","come","mile","awaybr","br","littl","cast","provid","interest","keep","watchabl","lee","right","lead","stile","lot","fun","lightheart","comed","role","differ","veri","seriou","role","usual","plai","becki","free","spirit","seem","chang","job","often","peopl","chang","clothesbr","br","know","thi","exactli","wellwritten","littl","question","leav","unansw","exactli","rai","lochlyn","munro","becki","brutal","exboyfriend","investig","iabr","br","like","charact","buck","david","koechner","paul","stepfath","superobnoxi","moron","get","nerv","quickli","beg","somebodi","punch","himbr","br","add","anoth","debit","gratuit","uncredit","cameo","comicactor","larri","miller","onc","plai","grouch","thi","case","littl","justifi","hi","charact","ultraconserv","ministerbr","br","good","usual","give","three","ten","base","effort","cast","alon"],"filtered2":["ohsofamiliar","comedi","stori","lowkei","nicegui","paul","jason","lee","night","bachelor","parti","wake","bed","becki","julia","stile","attract","blond","meet","night","befor","lie","fiancé","karen","selma","blair","forc","tell","lie","cover","tracksbr","sure","u","wit","stori","like","littl","onc","beforeon","tv","formula","extrem","predict","end","mai","see","come","mile","awaybr","littl","cast","provid","interest","keep","watchabl","lee","right","lead","stile","lot","fun","lightheart","comed","role","differ","veri","seriou","role","usual","plai","becki","free","spirit","seem","chang","job","often","peopl","chang","clothesbr","know","exactli","wellwritten","littl","question","leav","unansw","exactli","rai","lochlyn","munro","becki","brutal","exboyfriend","investig","iabr","like","charact","buck","david","koechner","paul","stepfath","superobnoxi","moron","get","nerv","quickli","beg","somebodi","punch","himbr","add","anoth","debit","gratuit","uncredit","cameo","comicactor","larri","miller","onc","plai","grouch","case","littl","justifi","charact","ultraconserv","ministerbr","good","usual","give","three","ten","base","effort","cast","alon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,10,14,15,17,23,24,26,30,34,35,40,46,60,72,73,74,79,90,92,112,119,121,127,128,134,157,172,204,210,224,236,259,265,278,288,289,299,329,334,337,338,350,378,400,401,457,462,491,493,545,570,648,650,675,686,695,770,840,850,851,894,985,1065,1082,1113,1176,1178,1191,1199,1206,1321,1339,1368,1387,1407,1463,1542,1682,1724,1855,1906,1966,2236,2579,2687,2869,2946,3053,3757,4623,4838,5324,5636,6252,6370,6777,6876,7110,7145,8450],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

{"value":"The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like.

{"value":"A scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash. He escapes unharmed but she is decapitated. He saves her head, brings it to his house and keeps it alive (!!!!). He then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathetic) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet....<br /><br />As you can see, this is pretty stupid stuff, but I had a certain fondness for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local TV station showed this movie about 20 times each year (no exaggeration). They showed it always on Saturday afternoon TV--uncut. Seeing this on TV back then was great! Explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation--who cares if it was good? Seeing it now I realize how lousy this really is.<br /><br />The acting is perfectly wretched, the production values are nonexistent, the script is pretty dumb and (aside from the still pretty disgusting gore) this is dull stuff. There's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end. Also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends. On one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film. On the other its utter trash. Either way, it's not a good movie but is a must-see (for one time only) for horror and gore fans.<br /><br />Also the head's laugh is pretty creepy.

{"value":"Who is Bettie Page? I certainly didn't find out while watching this movie. From what I have gathered from other sources, Ms. Page was highly in demand in the post-world war II period as the queen of \"naughty\" pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts. I never did get to know Bettie, the woman, though. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at. The film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film, the \"naughty\" pictures. Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras, Bettie in her girdle and stockings, Bettie in bondage...etc. The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet. When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A- rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class. The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms. Page's \"naughty\" photos seem in 2007. It is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit wouldn't even get a hit on My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds. I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd

{"value":"Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a \"Bomb\" rating, a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night. I feared the worst knowing its reputation, and it was as God-awful as I'd anticipated. This is a Mexican-made mess, dubbed into English, and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It's got terrible sets and effects, and features a rather frightening Santa who doesn't operate at the North Pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who doesn't have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is. The opening sequence, where St. Nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, and with no story. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus doesn't observe the child labor laws!<br /><br />Eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn Santa's Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it's bound to frighten little children and turn them off Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Oddly, the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas film, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on. This easily makes my personal list of the \"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen\", but I'm sure that's nothing unique.","finished_norm":["just","when","i","think","i","would","finish","a","whole","year","without","give","a","singl","movi","a","bomb","rate","a","friend","bring","thi","notori","turd","to","my","hous","last","night","i","fear","the","wrong","know","it","reput","and","it","be","a","godaw","a","i","have","anticip","thi","be","a","mexicanmad","mess","dub","into","english","and","produc","by","k","gordon","murrai","it","get","terribl","set","and","effect","and","featur","a","rather","frighten","santa","who","doe","not","oper","at","the","north","pole","but","instead","from","a","cloud","in","outer","space","and","who","doe","not","have","littl","elf","help","him","make","hi","toi","but","rather","all","differ","group","of","child","from","practic","everi","countri","there","be","the","open","sequenc","where","st","nick","chuckl","heartili","a","he","observ","monitor","show","all","thi","kiddi","work","hard","while","sing","terribl","holidai","song","in","a","varieti","of","languag","seem","to","go","on","forev","and","with","no","stori","obvious","thi","santa","clau","doe","not","observ","the","child","labor","lawsbr","br","eventu","we","get","some","nasti","and","slinki","redsuit","apprentic","of","the","devil","himself","travel","from","hell","to","earth","just","to","make","littl","kid","naughti","and","turn","santa","christma","ev","round","into","a","nightmar","watch","thi","movi","be","a","trippi","and","twist","experi","and","it","bind","to","frighten","littl","child","and","turn","them","off","santa","clau","and","the","holidai","forev","oddli","the","name","of","jesu","christ","be","mention","often","in","thi","christma","film","which","somehow","make","it","all","the","creepi","in","the","context","of","all","the","bizarr","thing","that","be","go","on","thi","easili","make","my","person","list","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","but","i","be","sure","that","noth","uniqu"],"filtered":["think","finish","whole","year","without","give","singl","movi","bomb","rate","friend","bring","thi","notori","turd","hous","last","night","fear","wrong","know","reput","godaw","anticip","thi","mexicanmad","mess","dub","english","produc","k","gordon","murrai","get","terribl","set","effect","featur","rather","frighten","santa","doe","oper","north","pole","instead","cloud","outer","space","doe","littl","elf","help","make","hi","toi","rather","differ","group","child","practic","everi","countri","open","sequenc","st","nick","chuckl","heartili","observ","monitor","show","thi","kiddi","work","hard","sing","terribl","holidai","song","varieti","languag","seem","go","forev","stori","obvious","thi","santa","clau","doe","observ","child","labor","lawsbr","br","eventu","get","nasti","slinki","redsuit","apprentic","devil","travel","hell","earth","make","littl","kid","naughti","turn","santa","christma","ev","round","nightmar","watch","thi","movi","trippi","twist","experi","bind","frighten","littl","child","turn","santa","clau","holidai","forev","oddli","name","jesu","christ","mention","often","thi","christma","film","somehow","make","creepi","context","bizarr","thing","go","thi","easili","make","person","list","wrong","movi","ever","see","sure","noth","uniqu"],"filtered2":["think","finish","whole","year","without","give","singl","bomb","rate","friend","bring","notori","turd","hous","last","night","fear","wrong","know","reput","godaw","anticip","mexicanmad","mess","dub","english","produc","k","gordon","murrai","get","terribl","set","effect","featur","rather","frighten","santa","doe","oper","north","pole","instead","cloud","outer","space","doe","littl","elf","help","make","toi","rather","differ","group","child","practic","everi","countri","open","sequenc","st","nick","chuckl","heartili","observ","monitor","show","kiddi","work","hard","sing","terribl","holidai","song","varieti","languag","seem","go","forev","stori","obvious","santa","clau","doe","observ","child","labor","lawsbr","eventu","get","nasti","slinki","redsuit","apprentic","devil","travel","hell","earth","make","littl","kid","naughti","turn","santa","christma","ev","round","nightmar","watch","trippi","twist","experi","bind","frighten","littl","child","turn","santa","clau","holidai","forev","oddli","name","jesu","christ","mention","often","christma","somehow","make","creepi","context","bizarr","thing","go","easili","make","person","list","wrong","ever","see","sure","noth","uniqu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,7,12,14,17,18,25,26,28,29,30,35,44,48,49,57,85,96,106,109,111,114,119,125,143,144,152,153,160,161,166,171,180,185,202,204,210,213,242,250,261,285,305,328,333,341,349,394,400,407,410,435,443,522,549,573,583,588,601,608,637,660,716,748,755,812,823,917,949,1032,1052,1054,1079,1094,1128,1131,1141,1300,1324,1411,1412,1420,1443,1470,1480,1710,1831,1852,1931,2031,2051,2099,2168,2170,2270,2399,2481,2620,2685,2790,2970,3063,3067,3109,3118,3597,3758,3862,4304,4308,4355,5846],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"- A newlywed couple move into the home of the husband's dead former wife. It's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn't want her in the house. She sees skulls all around the house. But when the husband investigates, he can't find anything. Is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from? Or, is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /><br />- This is the first time that I've watched The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3K crew. And, it will in all likelihood be the last time I watch it this way. Can you say dull? I'm not talking ordinary dull - I'm talking watching grass grow dull. There are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten as much entertainment out of it. The characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide.<br /><br />- The actors don't help matters much. Most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play. I haven't looked it up, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value.

{"value":"If he wanted to be accurate, he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about the Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I've lived in SF my entire life, and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here (ie his Warriors jersey). Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear; instead he fitted them in some cheesy made-up SF or Oakland jerseys that aren't even sold around here. HP has no bowling alleys, black and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear head or wristbands with the colors of Africa or China's Olympic team, nor does every Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops. Further, while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission, all that was shown was some white dude and a self-proclaimed \"100% West Coast Boriqua.\" This is NOT New York! Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the Mission are very, very different from the ONE that was shown here, who was without a doubt from NY. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City. An accurate depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs. Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /><br />This film could've been much better if Lee had done

{"value":"No Fireworks Despite Violent Action.<br /><br />Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed, largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both counts, woefully so in the case of the latter. With essentially no budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish, while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found. Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility. The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth, with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic

{"value":"A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this film or then I couldn't reach it properly. It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film.<br /><br />I really can't understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert?! It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are plenty) and they are very intense and directed with skill. The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing.<br /><br />This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. Still I'm glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scott's abilities, but they are very few in this film.<br /><br />A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on..) of this talented director.

{"value":"Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, I find this movie to be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, oh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a \"fish out of water\" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the \"fish\" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.<br /><br />(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the \"in your face\" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) <br /><br />As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges).<br /><br />All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.","finished_norm":["although","i","have","enjoi","bing","crosbi","in","other","movi","i","find","thi","movi","to","be","particularli","grate","mayb","becaus","i","be","from","a","differ","era","and","a","differ","countri","but","i","find","crosbi","continu","refer","to","the","good","old","usa","pleasant","at","trite","after","a","while","and","then","final","annoi","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","be","not","antiamerican","whatsoev","but","it","seem","that","the","english","can","do","no","right","andor","ne","thi","brave","oh","so","smart","american","visitor","to","show","them","the","wai","it","a","fish","out","of","water","stori","but","unlik","much","movi","of","thi","sort","thi","time","it","the","fish","who","have","the","upper","hand","to","be","fair","to","both","myself","and","the","movi","i","have","watch","it","a","few","time","space","over","a","few","year","and","get","the","same","impress","each","timebr","br","i","watch","anoth","crosbi","movi","last","night","the","emperor","waltz","and","that","too","produc","the","same","reaction","in","me","and","to","my","surpris","even","my","wife","who","for","what","it","worth","be","american","find","the","in","your","face","attitud","of","american","crosbi","to","be","irrit","on","too","mani","refer","to","teddi","roosevelt","a","she","put","it","br","br","a","for","the","premis","of","the","movi","it","uniqu","enough","for","it","dai","and","the","support","cast","be","of","cours","veri","good","the","sceneri","and","the","music","be","conjur","good","a","be","the","great","costum","although","i","agre","with","a","previou","review","that","the","wig","on","william","bendix","look","horrid","pictur","moe","of","the","three","stoogesbr","br","all","in","all","for","me","thi","would","be","a","much","much","enjoy","pictur","without","the","attitud","of","bing","crosbi","but","becaus","he","be","in","virtual","everi","shoot","it","pretti","hard","to","sit","through","thi","movi"],"filtered":["although","enjoi","bing","crosbi","movi","find","thi","movi","particularli","grate","mayb","becaus","differ","era","differ","countri","find","crosbi","continu","refer","good","old","usa","pleasant","trite","final","annoi","get","wrong","antiamerican","whatsoev","seem","english","right","andor","ne","thi","brave","oh","smart","american","visitor","show","wai","fish","water","stori","unlik","much","movi","thi","sort","thi","time","fish","upper","hand","fair","movi","watch","time","space","year","get","impress","timebr","br","watch","anoth","crosbi","movi","last","night","emperor","waltz","produc","reaction","surpris","even","wife","worth","american","find","face","attitud","american","crosbi","irrit","mani","refer","teddi","roosevelt","put","br","br","premis","movi","uniqu","enough","dai","support","cast","cours","veri","good","sceneri","music","conjur","good","great","costum","although","agre","previou","review","wig","william","bendix","look","horrid","pictur","moe","three","stoogesbr","br","thi","much","much","enjoy","pictur","without","attitud","bing","crosbi","becaus","virtual","everi","shoot","pretti","hard","sit","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["although","enjoi","bing","crosbi","find","particularli","grate","mayb","becaus","differ","era","differ","countri","find","crosbi","continu","refer","good","old","usa","pleasant","trite","final","annoi","get","wrong","antiamerican","whatsoev","seem","english","right","andor","ne","brave","oh","smart","american","visitor","show","wai","fish","water","stori","unlik","sort","time","fish","upper","hand","fair","watch","time","space","year","get","impress","timebr","watch","anoth","crosbi","last","night","emperor","waltz","produc","reaction","surpris","even","wife","worth","american","find","face","attitud","american","crosbi","irrit","mani","refer","teddi","roosevelt","put","premis","uniqu","enough","dai","support","cast","cours","veri","good","sceneri","music","conjur","good","great","costum","although","agre","previou","review","wig","william","bendix","look","horrid","pictur","moe","three","stoogesbr","enjoy","pictur","without","attitud","bing","crosbi","becaus","virtual","everi","shoot","pretti","hard","sit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,7,8,15,16,17,22,25,28,33,35,38,39,50,51,57,67,73,78,85,92,93,110,117,118,121,125,132,144,156,159,163,171,176,199,200,204,210,219,223,224,234,235,237,244,251,261,263,269,271,311,326,418,433,459,484,497,588,608,615,622,637,715,720,737,776,784,830,877,958,991,1119,1138,1204,1250,1300,1315,1336,1752,1822,1898,2021,2114,2311,2348,2515,2535,3036,3545,3574,3637,5061,5666,6009,6142,7236],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,

{"value":"Absence of a GOOD PLOT, absence of decent ACTING, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of decent looking SPECIAL EFFECTS...need I go on? Review MAY contain SPOILERS. The actors appear to be READING their lines, and not very well at that. Most of the \"actors\" were acting like they were in a SECOND GRADE play. The story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders...it's not really all that convoluted...it's just so SIMPLE and DUMB, that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. Nope it's not, it's EXACTLY as SIMPLE as you think it is. I UNDERSTOOD the \"film\", that's how i KNOW that it STUNK! MOST of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines), TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was ANNOYING. The \"special effects\" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry, and Michael Berrymore...just not in THIS movie...you can tell they weren't getting paid, or weren't getting paid much, because neither their hearts NOR their talents were in it. I LOVE Tony Todd...however, he was only adequate in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1...and Tony was only in it for a whole TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest to fast forward the DVD to the two minute Tony Todd segment. If I had gone to the theater, and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this \"film\" I would have been P.O.'D and demanded my money back. Hopefully the people who made this will do better next time.","finished_norm":["absenc","of","a","good","plot","absenc","of","decent","act","absenc","of","good","cinematographi","absenc","of","decent","look","special","effectsn","i","go","on","review","mai","contain","spoiler","the","actor","appear","to","be","read","their","line","and","not","veri","good","at","that","much","of","the","actor","be","act","like","thei","be","in","a","grade","plai","the","stori","appear","to","have","be","write","by","on","of","the","aforement","gradersit","not","realli","all","that","convolutedit","just","so","simpl","and","dumb","that","a","person","think","thei","must","be","miss","someth","so","thei","think","it","be","convolut","no","it","not","it","exactli","a","simpl","a","you","think","it","be","i","understand","the","film","that","how","i","know","that","it","stink","much","of","the","film","just","have","peopl","sit","around","talkingread","their","line","try","to","look","sinist","the","narrat","be","annoi","the","special","effect","be","laughabl","i","love","low","budget","movi","i","conjur","like","carolyn","munro","tom","savini","jack","scarri","and","michael","berrymorejust","not","in","thi","moviey","can","tell","thei","be","not","get","pai","or","be","not","get","pai","much","becaus","neither","their","heart","nor","their","talent","be","in","it","i","love","toni","toddhowev","he","be","onli","adequ","in","thi","movi","in","fact","toni","todd","perform","be","the","onli","reason","i","give","it","star","instead","of","and","toni","be","onli","in","it","for","a","whole","two","minut","serious","i","would","suggest","to","fast","forward","the","dvd","to","the","two","minut","toni","todd","segment","if","i","have","go","to","the","theater","and","pai","much","than","a","dollar","to","see","thi","film","i","would","have","be","pod","and","demand","my","monei","back","hopefulli","the","peopl","who","make","thi","will","do","well","next","time"],"filtered":["absenc","good","plot","absenc","decent","act","absenc","good","cinematographi","absenc","decent","look","special","effectsn","go","review","mai","contain","spoiler","actor","appear","read","line","veri","good","much","actor","act","like","thei","grade","plai","stori","appear","write","aforement","gradersit","realli","convolutedit","simpl","dumb","person","think","thei","must","miss","someth","thei","think","convolut","exactli","simpl","think","understand","film","know","stink","much","film","peopl","sit","around","talkingread","line","try","look","sinist","narrat","annoi","special","effect","laughabl","love","low","budget","movi","conjur","like","carolyn","munro","tom","savini","jack","scarri","michael","berrymorejust","thi","moviey","tell","thei","get","pai","get","pai","much","becaus","neither","heart","talent","love","toni","toddhowev","onli","adequ","thi","movi","fact","toni","todd","perform","onli","reason","give","star","instead","toni","onli","whole","two","minut","serious","suggest","fast","forward","dvd","two","minut","toni","todd","segment","go","theater","pai","much","dollar","see","thi","film","pod","demand","monei","back","hopefulli","peopl","make","thi","well","next","time"],"filtered2":["absenc","good","plot","absenc","decent","act","absenc","good","cinematographi","absenc","decent","look","special","effectsn","go","review","mai","contain","spoiler","actor","appear","read","line","veri","good","actor","act","like","grade","plai","stori","appear","write","aforement","gradersit","realli","convolutedit","simpl","dumb","person","think","must","miss","someth","think","convolut","exactli","simpl","think","understand","know","stink","peopl","sit","around","talkingread","line","try","look","sinist","narrat","annoi","special","effect","laughabl","love","low","budget","conjur","like","carolyn","munro","tom","savini","jack","scarri","michael","berrymorejust","moviey","tell","get","pai","get","pai","becaus","neither","heart","talent","love","toni","toddhowev","onli","adequ","fact","toni","todd","perform","onli","reason","give","star","instead","toni","onli","whole","two","minut","serious","suggest","fast","forward","dvd","two","minut","toni","todd","segment","go","theater","pai","dollar","see","pod","demand","monei","back","hopefulli","peopl","make","well","next","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,11,12,13,15,16,17,20,21,22,23,26,30,32,36,39,40,41,46,47,53,54,59,63,65,90,95,97,98,100,105,106,107,111,126,141,145,152,153,170,176,203,212,217,244,247,255,256,271,276,297,309,322,371,420,424,462,466,490,542,552,614,629,646,699,711,718,736,759,777,938,1038,1214,1409,1456,1531,1683,1839,2318,2368,2410,2827,3018,4480,4669,4964,6777],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.

{"value":"OK, I admit I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I am a huge fan of), but I am not one of those people who automatically gives an MST3K movie a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies they play, and some are among of the worst movies I've ever seen, I have actually been able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That being said, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (It is no wonder, in fact, that the MST3K writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst. Don't believe me? Check out their site.)<br /><br />To me, this movie is a good example of what NOT to do in filmmaking. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic the direction (while perhaps being the best thing in this movie) is bad.<br /><br />The pacing is the worst part in this movie. A few times in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. While minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time, it can be in a movie, particularly in this one. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was just very bored. It truly felt like ten minutes.<br /><br />If \"suspension of disbelief\" means \"almost falling asleep during a movie\", then this has plenty of that. But THE SCREAMING SKULL is just so horrible, there is no way I could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film, and thus the \"suspension of disbelief\" was indeed non-existant.<br /><br />One of the worst, and probably the most boring movie I've ever seen.<br /><br

{"value":"Well, my goodness, am I disappointed. When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, \"The Haunting\", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects. But, deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now!!?? My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what? As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly. And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that. <br /><br />Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown.

{"value":"Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement? To a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus. Even though such people normally outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issues, the teachings of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism.<br /><br />Here you'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk. You'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon.<br /><br />In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you'll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are. You'll be able to use as much energy as Al Gore yet while having people treat you as if you were Amish.<br /><br />In the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods, holy be thy names, and audit - i.e. judge - their lifestyles. NOTE: This is the only time it's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can wag their finger in other people's faces.<br /><br />What does Ed have in store for us in season three?

{"value":"...well, pop this into the DVD, waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back, and find out.<br /><br />Acting? What acting? <br /><br />Production values? ...Production? ...Values?<br /><br />Story? Don't get me started.<br /><br />After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see a film so bad that I truly wished for a lower rating than one. I always have found at least a reason or two to see merit - if only in the intent or the effort of the writer, the director, the cast, or the producer?<br /><br />In this case, they're all the same guy (!) who really needs to get a handle on the fact, at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape, that he has no talent. I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler's \"production\" for his first cinema class, but the referenced \"artist\" behind this dreck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. <br /><br />Just how did this ever get made? Who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this? Moreover, don't let the box cover fool you: there's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good \"exposure\" of the hunk on that cover.<br /><br />Two final items: there was one second when this \"film\" had redeeming value: the aforementioned \"talent\" gets roundly punched out by his lover. I cheered! And, I did learn one thing from this \"film.\". There are times when something is so very bad that it is, indeed, truly very funny. But not in any comical manner; it's just sadly humorous.

{"value":"Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get

{"value":"I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are with hand throwing distance they can't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it's opening. The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers.

{"value":":::SPOILER ALERT:::<br /><br />Soooo, Arnie's really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders, he's sent to jail (or rather some sort of work camp). He escapes, but after a short while he's caught once again. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arnie-fan and all. However, \"The Running Man\" contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats.<br /><br />There are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.<br /><br />The acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par, with Arnie in the leading role, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad.<br /><br />The special effects are OK, without being impressive.<br /><br />RATING:

{"value":"As someone who has read the book, I can say that this is vastly inferior to the big American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, she has faults, and isn't the easiest person to like - but the viewer shouldn't downright start to despise her. Secondly, Mr Knightly is miscast. His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen, and throw the mood of the whole affair \"off\". Thirdly, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so sickly? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene. Fourthly, the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. At the end, when Emma decides she loves Mr Knightly, it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasn't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film. Fifthly, what was going on, exactly, with Mrs Elton's accent? She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, to all out American half-way through, and then back to English at the end. Finally, this dragged at the end. The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly.

{"value":"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom.) It is hasty, the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous, and illogical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as \"Bigger's\" mom, but is not nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their worst. The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead smothers her. Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom.

{"value":"In my book \"Basic Instinct\" was a perfect film. It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role. It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever. All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get!<br /><br />This sequel is the exact opposite, it cannot possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally inept direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself, because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument. The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-wit responsible for the script even included the \"There is no smoking in this room\" dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney (who is now a solicitor) away! <br /><br />I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made! It does damage to the original, so bad is it. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original.
