{"value":"The plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination. However, there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found. Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man living by himself in a house. During the film I found that I was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit did not engage me; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too long. I feel more could have been made of the relationship, ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.","finished_norm":["the","plot","be","straightforward","a","old","man","live","off","a","main","road","in","woodland","on","dai","wit","a","man","murder","a","child","in","the","wood","soft","for","dig","follow","the","old","man","attempt","to","try","and","convinc","the","polic","that","what","he","see","be","not","a","figment","of","hi","imagin","howev","there","be","a","problem","each","time","the","old","man","guid","the","polic","to","where","the","murder","happen","no","corps","can","be","find","soft","for","dig","have","a","diminut","dialogu","which","reflect","the","major","of","the","scene","of","the","film","a","old","man","live","by","himself","in","a","hous","dure","the","film","i","find","that","i","be","scare","twice","name","when","the","murder","child","abruptli","appear","befor","the","old","man","the","rest","of","the","film","i","have","to","admit","do","not","engag","me","i","find","the","tempo","of","the","film","a","littl","too","slow","the","limit","dialogu","be","not","a","problem","howev","the","develop","of","the","stori","and","it","conclus","after","watch","the","film","take","too","long","i","feel","much","can","have","be","make","of","the","relationship","ghostli","encount","with","the","child","and","the","old","man","alon","in","the","wood","at","night","unsur","of","your","own","mind","can","lead","to","some","eeri","situat","child","be","alwai","scari","a","ghost","see","dark","water"],"filtered":["plot","straightforward","old","man","live","main","road","woodland","dai","wit","man","murder","child","wood","soft","dig","follow","old","man","attempt","try","convinc","polic","see","figment","hi","imagin","howev","problem","time","old","man","guid","polic","murder","happen","corps","find","soft","dig","diminut","dialogu","reflect","major","scene","film","old","man","live","hous","dure","film","find","scare","twice","name","murder","child","abruptli","appear","befor","old","man","rest","film","admit","engag","find","tempo","film","littl","slow","limit","dialogu","problem","howev","develop","stori","conclus","watch","film","take","long","feel","much","make","relationship","ghostli","encount","child","old","man","alon","wood","night","unsur","mind","lead","eeri","situat","child","alwai","scari","ghost","see","dark","water"],"filtered2":["plot","straightforward","old","man","live","main","road","woodland","dai","wit","man","murder","child","wood","soft","dig","follow","old","man","attempt","try","convinc","polic","see","figment","imagin","howev","problem","time","old","man","guid","polic","murder","happen","corps","find","soft","dig","diminut","dialogu","reflect","major","scene","old","man","live","hous","dure","find","scare","twice","name","murder","child","abruptli","appear","befor","old","man","rest","admit","engag","find","tempo","littl","slow","limit","dialogu","problem","howev","develop","stori","conclus","watch","take","long","feel","make","relationship","ghostli","encount","child","old","man","alon","wood","night","unsur","mind","lead","eeri","situat","child","alwai","scari","ghost","see","dark","water"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,14,17,19,31,32,36,38,43,45,67,79,94,99,113,116,132,143,157,167,169,177,179,180,197,210,213,226,238,239,248,260,273,320,340,368,390,396,404,457,471,473,478,577,623,655,691,727,830,851,943,957,1027,1080,1256,1288,1575,1800,1843,1989,2447,3821,4050,4393,4987,5860],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,14,17,19,31,32,36,38,43,45,67,79,94,99,113,116,132,143,157,167,169,177,179,180,197,210,213,226,238,239,248,260,273,320,340,368,390,396,404,457,471,473,478,577,623,655,691,727,830,851,943,957,1027,1080,1256,1288,1575,1800,1843,1989,2447,3821,4050,4393,4987,5860],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,4.557934924044366,1.6608112036218214,12.714072745235516,11.742549233559947,1.9469506069506084,2.08112281984698,2.056430207256609,4.3043565130405606,4.493325799357863,2.253494045787767,2.3409902041158843,2.3360150694757706,4.9219153375776195,2.4214486257841834,2.458149992634611,2.507968722980095,10.838925917077418,2.558331832813986,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.5940874818617203,2.597304642813496,2.6593400337329487,5.379009467558432,2.6754694156628323,8.90225758755883,2.938298364153555,2.948928684455311,3.1346146732346205,3.132778125427319,3.291526514503207,3.1419947805322432,3.3243163373261977,6.992055430016274,3.335489637924323,3.3243163373261977,3.604618302480356,3.607563812710113,7.459562890868725,3.5929222627171646,4.096025840389245,3.9571003681590526,3.85761

{"value":"No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is crap when spoken. Or, to put it another way, no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl.<br /><br />Overall, the movie feels like a badly-adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of backstory and current story, and the ending is wildly (and unpleasantly) different from that of the book. Most of the plots from the book have gotten lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say \"Huh?\" Not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent off to do something far better. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.","finished_norm":["no","on","should","ever","try","to","adapt","a","tom","robbin","book","for","screen","while","the","movi","be","fine","and","the","perform","be","good","the","dialogu","which","work","good","read","it","be","crap","when","speak","or","to","put","it","anoth","wai","no","on","would","be","like","to","suggest","that","hear","someon","els","name","be","like","see","it","write","in","radium","on","a","pearlbr","br","overal","the","movi","feel","like","a","badlyadapt","cliff","note","to","the","book","much","of","the","part","have","be","hack","down","to","a","of","their","size","in","the","book","in","term","of","backstori","and","current","stori","and","the","end","be","wildli","and","unpleasantli","differ","from","that","of","the","book","much","of","the","plot","from","the","book","have","get","lose","includ","the","on","that","make","everyth","make","sens","at","the","end","and","there","much","than","on","refer","that","make","sens","in","the","book","that","make","the","viewer","sai","huh","not","a","worthi","effort","unfortun","the","script","should","have","be","read","compar","to","the","book","burn","and","all","the","actor","send","off","to","do","someth","far","well","i","admir","gu","van","sant","tremend","but","not","even","someon","of","hi","calibr","can","have","make","a","decent","movi","of","such","a","complex","book","without","make","a","miniseri"],"filtered":["ever","try","adapt","tom","robbin","book","screen","movi","fine","perform","good","dialogu","work","good","read","crap","speak","put","anoth","wai","like","suggest","hear","someon","els","name","like","see","write","radium","pearlbr","br","overal","movi","feel","like","badlyadapt","cliff","note","book","much","part","hack","size","book","term","backstori","current","stori","end","wildli","unpleasantli","differ","book","much","plot","book","get","lose","includ","make","everyth","make","sens","end","much","refer","make","sens","book","make","viewer","sai","huh","worthi","effort","unfortun","script","read","compar","book","burn","actor","send","someth","far","well","admir","gu","van","sant","tremend","even","someon","hi","calibr","make","decent","movi","complex","book","without","make","miniseri"],"filtered2":["ever","try","adapt","tom","robbin","book","screen","fine","perform","good","dialogu","work","good","read","crap","speak","put","anoth","wai","like","suggest","hear","someon","els","name","like","see","write","radium","pearlbr","overal","feel","like","badlyadapt","cliff","note","book","part","hack","size","book","term","backstori","current","stori","end","wildli","unpleasantli","differ","book","plot","book","get","lose","includ","make","everyth","make","sens","end","refer","make","sens","book","make","viewer","huh","worthi","effort","unfortun","script","read","compar","book","burn","actor","send","someth","far","well","admir","gu","van","sant","tremend","even","someon","calibr","make","decent","complex","book","without","make","miniseri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,17,20,24,32,33,36,41,43,44,48,53,61,65,73,77,101,105,125,139,143,145,151,159,173,192,193,196,204,216,221,227,248,279,301,309,313,344,401,412,464,482,560,646,701,715,721,759,818,858,862,1273,1337,1359,1470,1902,2134,2183,2874,3114,3358,3660,4196,5027,5662,6987],"values":[6.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,17,20,24,32,33,36,41,43,44,48,53,61,65,73,77,101,105,125,139,143,145,151,159,173,192,193,196,204,216,221,227,248,279,301,309,313,344,401,412,464,482,560,646,701,715,721,759,818,858,862,1273,1337,1359,1470,1902,2134,2183,2874,3114,3358,3660,4196,5027,5662,6987],"values":[3.7198602937231398,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,2.6420723132238515,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.2242236634876535,4.587807168251287,2.3409902041158843,4.69198042906518,22.40196389448149,2.300267965194495,4.8737648638280495,2.5318267134339894,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.624524614047584,2.6070186965339692,2.6423424573643777,2.6005321873043625,2.689504733779216,2.7910771187233068,2.8309760279012264,2.848772527704847,2.907069060519773,2.983093497946387,3.0879275592619675,3.107414446935464,3.2872346624216657,3.3154667220492153,3.4623020803001006,3.5900195030592035,3.8240921249056035,3.68099128126493,3.6841709341823097,3.969732115064953,4.202455303235976,3.8767358583910254,3.944626193933877,4.409683399244287,

{"value":"A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a Mountie husband who she loves...but she loves sex too! In the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bed--including her husband AND brother! Also there's a (tame) lesbian sequence.<br /><br />This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X rated film ever. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, it doesn't date well.<br /><br />It is well-directed and Erica Gavin is just great (whatever happened to her), and it was VERY colorful...but by today's standards it's extremely tame. I'm surprised it has an NC-17 rating now--there's no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all. Also it's (sadly) pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing (and pretty silly). It is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. Purportedly I saw the cut version (which has an R rating) but I've heard only a few seconds here and there are missing. <br /><br />Meyer's next film \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" is much better and dates VERY well.

{"value":"In Bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.<br /><br />The forgettable slash \"Prom Night\" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes.

{"value":"Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book \"McCabe\" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don't merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. It's a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an Altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from

{"value":"This review is based on the dubbed Shock-o-Rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002. How bad is it? It's awful, which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale--but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print might improve matters--the comedic English-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see. The zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence; here, zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director Andreas Schnaas.

{"value":"What a weekend. Two days ago I watched the first half of \"War Games 2: Dead Code\", now \"While she was out\". I am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching. I guess, \"While she was out\" was worse.<br /><br />It has all been said before in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical etc. - the only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin award if she actually died (only watched first half, so I don't know). Soon I was at two Darwin awards (if that's even possible) for her immense stupidity.<br /><br />And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, the people? I consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent, which are idiots, a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are.","finished_norm":["what","a","weekend","two","dai","ago","i","watch","the","half","of","war","game","dead","code","now","while","she","be","out","i","be","try","to","come","to","a","decis","which","on","be","wrong","in","term","of","pain","in","my","mind","while","watch","i","guess","while","she","be","out","be","worsebr","br","it","have","all","be","sai","befor","in","other","comment","unrealist","illog","etc","the","onli","thing","i","realli","have","to","add","be","that","at","some","point","i","start","feel","much","for","the","evil","gui","than","for","the","woman","becaus","i","would","have","recommend","her","for","a","darwin","award","if","she","actual","die","onli","watch","half","so","i","do","not","know","soon","i","be","at","two","darwin","award","if","that","even","possibl","for","her","immens","stupiditybr","br","and","hei","produc","by","kim","basing","so","she","do","not","onli","know","the","script","but","be","conjur","respons","for","bring","thi","wast","of","monei","to","u","the","peopl","i","consid","human","who","wast","consider","amount","of","monei","to","be","evil","becaus","the","monei","can","have","us","to","fee","and","cloth","quit","a","few","peopl","instead","of","hurt","percent","of","that","who","see","it","in","the","cinema","and","give","percent","which","be","idiot","a","good","opportun","to","show","just","how","much","of","a","idiot","thei","be"],"filtered":["weekend","two","dai","ago","watch","half","war","game","dead","code","try","come","decis","wrong","term","pain","mind","watch","guess","worsebr","br","sai","befor","comment","unrealist","illog","etc","onli","thing","realli","add","point","start","feel","much","evil","gui","woman","becaus","recommend","darwin","award","actual","die","onli","watch","half","know","soon","two","darwin","award","even","possibl","immens","stupiditybr","br","hei","produc","kim","basing","onli","know","script","conjur","respons","bring","thi","wast","monei","u","peopl","consid","human","wast","consider","amount","monei","evil","becaus","monei","us","fee","cloth","quit","peopl","instead","hurt","percent","see","cinema","give","percent","idiot","good","opportun","show","much","idiot","thei"],"filtered2":["weekend","two","dai","ago","watch","half","war","game","dead","code","try","come","decis","wrong","term","pain","mind","watch","guess","worsebr","befor","comment","unrealist","illog","etc","onli","thing","realli","add","point","start","feel","evil","gui","woman","becaus","recommend","darwin","award","actual","die","onli","watch","half","know","soon","two","darwin","award","even","possibl","immens","stupiditybr","hei","produc","kim","basing","onli","know","script","conjur","respons","bring","wast","monei","u","peopl","consid","human","wast","consider","amount","monei","evil","becaus","monei","us","fee","cloth","quit","peopl","instead","hurt","percent","see","cinema","give","percent","idiot","good","opportun","show","idiot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,11,13,22,23,25,26,28,29,30,34,36,39,43,47,52,55,56,66,70,71,77,79,89,112,120,126,132,152,206,228,238,243,250,261,280,292,293,298,299,314,317,321,374,402,409,429,449,459,610,706,772,858,863,879,915,974,993,1004,1264,1483,1565,1823,1981,2070,2272,2511,2922,3070,3423,5601],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,11,13,22,23,25,26,28,29,30,34,36,39,43,47,52,55,56,66,70,71,77,79,89,112,120,126,132,152,206,228,238,243,250,261,280,292,293,298,299,314,317,321,374,402,409,429,449,459,610,706,772,858,863,879,915,974,993,1004,1264,1483,1565,1823,1981,2070,2272,2511,2922,3070,3423,5601],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,2.8828493162168796,2.9739294460164585,1.1317941569733974,2.5958480334723544,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,3.412938870621443,1.7122153074726136,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,1.9463902258768238,1.9469506069506084,3.9880092219144876,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,6.7173812069706855,2.253494045787767,2.3131195476980753,5.194609285626992,2.7742700004069256,2.597304642813496,2.627841366673578,2.6812935439488212,2.7085302779237206,2.8028805344481915,2.9752256367457734,2.9012296278682137,2.7819920465008363,2.7949961309240425,3.189397019426827,2.8529247828056143,6.18993968377476,3.4572130107926293,3.084424928710765,3.2209578243390444,3.2872346624216657,3.2597778161886266,3.2829611516442836,3.477726550625732,7.318024749092309,3.7398317812878634,3.8767358583910254,3.944626193933877,3.8962296530720266

{"value":"This film has little to recommend it, though that little being the breathtaking scenery, cinematography and direction of wildlife, it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews. It is precisely these things, however, that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /><br />I watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end. Yes, the pictures were great, the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent, but what was going on in the foreground? The rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told, and we have all seen this before, and, indeed, much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.<br

{"value":"This agonizing comedy-drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979. I remember opening the movie-section of the L.A. Times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for \"Chapter Two\" filled with glowing captions like: \"Better than 'The Goodbye Girl'!\" and \"Neil Simon does it again!\" What does Neil Simon do? He takes an autobiographical situation (remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and--worst of all--unfunny. James Caan plays Neil--er..that is, George--a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife; enter spirited Marsha Mason (real-life Mrs. Simon...soon to be ex-Mrs. Simon) who attempts to love George despite his moods and general melancholy. Mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for Caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-plot concerning painfully-thin, blonde Valerie Harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt).

{"value":"I am compelled to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to SAVE YOUR MONEY. Almost any episode of Desmond Morris' \"The Human Animal\" or David Suzuki's \"The Nature of Things\" could have bested the material presented. Not only does the director fail to make use of IMAX's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen, everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously. Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster, and their niece and nephew. We follow them for an interminable forty-odd minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the trans-Atlantic Heather? Do we care? Avoid this film at all cost. If you do wish to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the beautifully photographed \"India: Kingdom of the Tiger\" or the technically thrilling \"Space Station 3D\".

{"value":"I am so disappointed. This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. Here was the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses.

The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change along with it.<br /><br />There are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again.<br /><br />When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, it does nothing for me - because now I've come to expect his old standby: the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating. Depressing and same old, same old.<br /><br />If Woody wants to win his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted.","finished_norm":["i","be","so","disappoint","thi","movi","leav","me","feel","jip","out","of","my","time","and","mental","energi","here","be","the","quintessenti","woodi","allen","film","all","over","again","the","neurot","upperclass","manhattanit","debat","whether","or","not","thei","will","cheat","on","their","spous","woodi","i","have","see","thi","charact","alreadi","i","have","see","the","storylin","from","you","ten","time","alreadi","where","do","your","creativ","go","you","ne","to","open","your","ey","and","look","around","you","the","world","have","chang","dramat","sinc","anni","hall","and","you","ne","to","chang","along","with","itbr","br","there","be","far","much","interest","and","funni","scenario","to","which","you","can","appli","your","brand","of","angst","and","neurotic","why","not","try","them","out","instead","of","rehash","the","same","old","slop","over","and","over","and","over","againbr","br","when","i","hear","that","woodi","allen","have","a","new","project","come","out","it","doe","noth","for","me","becaus","now","i","have","come","to","expect","hi","old","standbi","the","coupl","who","be","grow","tire","of","each","other","and","end","up","cheat","depress","and","same","old","same","oldbr","br","if","woodi","want","to","win","hi","fan","back","then","he","have","to","understand","that","our","sens","of","humor","and","intellig","have","to","be","stimul","not","insult"],"filtered":["disappoint","thi","movi","leav","feel","jip","time","mental","energi","quintessenti","woodi","allen","film","neurot","upperclass","manhattanit","debat","whether","thei","cheat","spous","woodi","see","thi","charact","alreadi","see","storylin","ten","time","alreadi","creativ","go","ne","open","ey","look","around","world","chang","dramat","sinc","anni","hall","ne","chang","along","itbr","br","far","much","interest","funni","scenario","appli","brand","angst","neurotic","try","instead","rehash","old","slop","againbr","br","hear","woodi","allen","new","project","come","doe","noth","becaus","come","expect","hi","old","standbi","coupl","grow","tire","end","cheat","depress","old","oldbr","br","woodi","want","win","hi","fan","back","understand","sens","humor","intellig","stimul","insult"],"filtered2":["disappoint","leav","feel","jip","time","mental","energi","quintessenti","woodi","allen","neurot","upperclass","manhattanit","debat","whether","cheat","spous","woodi","see","charact","alreadi","see","storylin","ten","time","alreadi","creativ","go","ne","open","ey","look","around","world","chang","dramat","sinc","anni","hall","ne","chang","along","itbr","far","interest","funni","scenario","appli","brand","angst","neurotic","try","instead","rehash","old","slop","againbr","hear","woodi","allen","new","project","come","doe","noth","becaus","come","expect","old","standbi","coupl","grow","tire","end","cheat","depress","old","oldbr","woodi","want","win","fan","back","understand","sens","humor","intellig","stimul","insult"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,8,10,16,18,22,24,34,36,37,43,49,60,62,63,67,74,87,98,101,110,130,140,152,162,165,173,187,212,216,242,253,278,281,324,330,369,431,489,515,545,561,597,603,660,709,756,900,911,1075,1128,1345,1373,1404,1569,1760,2109,2353,2473,2482,2551,2654,2685,4790,4989,5471,5617,6974,7706],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,8,10,16,18,22,24,34,36,37,43,49,60,62,63,67,74,87,98,101,110,130,140,152,162,165,173,187,212,216,242,253,278,281,324,330,369,431,489,515,545,561,597,603,660,709,756,900,911,1075,1128,1345,1373,1404,1569,1760,2109,2353,2473,2482,2551,2654,2685,4790,4989,5471,5617,6974,7706],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.7965700178917925,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,5.871274616779973,1.9486336368009016,2.115024371522662,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,4.2580959472608155,2.2642139034199635,2.317169775997098,2.3131195476980753,2.3586007221245198,2.448847599972298,2.4368824319140248,2.4732161909892554,2.5983793339432615,2.6070186965339692,2.689504733779216,2.7073305177318163,5.667386841755453,2.832333801361687,2.8753661172782943,5.858551493107835,3.121829110937649,3.1419947805322432,3.3956930001684253,3.3956930001684253,3.442099372982581,3.4725585804672896,3.4986697244709752,3.530930586689197,3.6405503117064195,3.6497387377608255,3.7636829971100436,3.9201351739255808,3.969732115064953,4.202455303235976,4.251780369798478,9.521470171257315,4.443131333311827,8.983842994962517,4.597282013139085,20.62759120429803,4.933754249760298,5.089

{"value":"Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved  this move felt like a bad date. Worse, the tedious art-school direction -- with a heavy-handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue, and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in. It gets worse: instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-overs AND quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters. Really loud opera music too. Blame it all on the director.<br /><br />The actors are all quite good. The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom. He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however, and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn job. The stunning college campus architecture as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. How come universities in the US are so bland (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD on this film.

{"value":"I'm so confused. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as \"bizarre.\" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter's voice no less. What I also don't get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone.","finished_norm":["i","be","so","confus","i","have","be","a","huge","seagal","fan","for","year","i","have","see","all","of","hi","film","and","mani","of","that","dozen","of","time","i","can","onli","describ","thi","film","a","bizarr","steven","seagal","share","screenplai","write","and","produc","credit","on","thi","film","but","i","have","a","realli","tough","time","believ","he","would","choos","to","dub","over","hi","own","voic","for","so","mani","of","hi","line","with","a","thin","whini","impost","voic","no","littl","what","i","conjur","do","not","get","be","if","thei","have","to","dub","some","of","hi","line","why","doe","hi","own","voic","appear","on","the","rest","of","them","i","expect","seagal","to","ag","like","the","rest","of","u","but","the","seagal","in","thi","movi","bare","exud","a","fraction","of","the","same","swagger","confid","bravado","charm","and","sexapp","he","so","easili","show","u","in","all","of","hi","previou","movi","what","i","find","myself","miss","much","of","all","be","hi","cocki","selfassur","attitud","and","hi","badass","sneer","that","so","easili","shift","into","that","ador","grin","where","be","that","inyourfac","attitud","and","charm","that","make","him","such","a","huge","star","i","hope","that","thi","film","be","not","a","indic","of","what","seagal","have","leav","to","offer","u","if","so","hi","lifelong","fan","will","have","to","conced","that","the","seagal","we","all","know","and","love","be","go"],"filtered":["confus","huge","seagal","fan","year","see","hi","film","mani","dozen","time","onli","describ","thi","film","bizarr","steven","seagal","share","screenplai","write","produc","credit","thi","film","realli","tough","time","believ","choos","dub","hi","voic","mani","hi","line","thin","whini","impost","voic","littl","conjur","get","thei","dub","hi","line","doe","hi","voic","appear","rest","expect","seagal","ag","like","rest","u","seagal","thi","movi","bare","exud","fraction","swagger","confid","bravado","charm","sexapp","easili","show","u","hi","previou","movi","find","miss","much","hi","cocki","selfassur","attitud","hi","badass","sneer","easili","shift","ador","grin","inyourfac","attitud","charm","make","huge","star","hope","thi","film","indic","seagal","leav","offer","u","hi","lifelong","fan","conced","seagal","know","love","go"],"filtered2":["confus","huge","seagal","fan","year","see","mani","dozen","time","onli","describ","bizarr","steven","seagal","share","screenplai","write","produc","credit","realli","tough","time","believ","choos","dub","voic","mani","line","thin","whini","impost","voic","littl","conjur","get","dub","line","doe","voic","appear","rest","expect","seagal","ag","like","rest","u","seagal","bare","exud","fraction","swagger","confid","bravado","charm","sexapp","easili","show","u","previou","find","miss","cocki","selfassur","attitud","badass","sneer","easili","shift","ador","grin","inyourfac","attitud","charm","make","huge","star","hope","indic","seagal","leav","offer","u","lifelong","fan","conced","seagal","know","love","go"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,11,13,14,18,26,28,38,39,50,54,57,65,74,91,100,107,112,130,140,169,181,226,255,261,356,427,428,442,444,507,583,584,589,668,703,784,797,825,949,980,1108,1124,1194,1323,1401,1419,1821,2720,2981,3177,3319,4163,5909,6094,6460,7189,8069,8359,8392],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,11,13,14,18,26,28,38,39,50,54,57,65,74,91,100,107,112,130,140,169,181,226,255,261,356,427,428,442,444,507,583,584,589,668,703,784,797,825,949,980,1108,1124,1194,1323,1401,1419,1821,2720,2981,3177,3319,4163,5909,6094,6460,7189,8069,8359,8392],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,3.43598877114071,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.9073850067444174,1.9486336368009016,2.0105926690411424,2.1405462403177813,4.287906797278791,6.739988699036795,2.2642139034199635,4.634339551994196,2.4214486257841834,2.4442286541160034,5.188174963723441,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,3.028335462059722,3.233054746047873,10.116321003487638,3.257696649984802,6.507094532875981,3.365138331846453,6.9973394489419505,3.5146700658174166,3.496027715008137,3.5813614403160887,3.6746621462132825,3.7636829971100436,7.597548633842627,3.850067611308864,8.17291277874619,4.081705786614497,4.263079925052412,4.181290492043933,4.499089986959872,4.383707912841026,33.50049791028303,4.436351646326448,9.578346041898381,5.274680836730892,5.482320201509136,5.482320201509136,5.583416318380505,5.878215858601149,6.

{"value":"One would think that a film about a young person's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it's about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the film maker *considered* making a movie, but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random (and randomly BORING) images and go-nowhere scenes, throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting, pretend that good lighting ins't important in the film-making process, and wrap it up under the auspices of an \"arthouse\" film. This is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film-makers to poo-poo the indie film movement, and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films.<br /><br />If you're interested in films covering this subject matter, you'd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at Logo's website or renting Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues.

{"value":"I can't say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. But then again, I can't say it's one of the worst I have ever seen.<br /><br />OK, so it's basically a girl does skating, is good at it, wants to go to an expensive school, can't afford it and has to take a Hockey Scholarship. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't like the actress playing Katelin. She absolutely couldn't cry to save her life, just made wailing sounds, like a toddler pretending to cry to get it's own way.<br /><br />Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people. Also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she 'draws the line' made me cringe.<br /><br />We all knew where it was going to go with her and Spencer. Classically they didn't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you don't mind the main skater being extremely annoying. It's good to kill time

{"value":"the characters at depth-less rip offs. you've seen all the characters in other movies, i promise. the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably. it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field, completely forced, and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked. the hot chick is old and has no personality, shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non-underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing. the attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (the dorky love interest) is barely communicated. the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt- mishap kiss occurs. afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame. the main focus of this movie is not the relationship, but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super-bad-esquire movie with a semi appealing plot. I could compare this to the hangover, in its forced nature. i wont get into that. i could keep going but its just pointless. just don't pay to see this

{"value":"Steve Martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the woeful remake of the Out Of Towners, this movie falls flat on it's face. How anybody ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko part better. Martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over. The line \"The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the United States Army\" was just about the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get hold of the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. Those are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho.

{"value":"I saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as Greendale in the movie, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away. His editorial comment in his forward is a good summary:<br /><br />\"Yuk.\"<br /><br />Unless you're a Neil Young fan or live in/near \"Greendale\" (if the latter you know the real name), skip this movie. It's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker. It has no discernible plot, the music is merely OK, and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be.<br /><br />I don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away.<br /><br />I'd give this a 1.5/10, but that's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie. It wasn't worth the $6.

{"value":"Ok, I like B movies...I know what B movies are supposed to represent. But this is just awful. I am amazed it got such a decent overall score. The only redeeming qualities of this flick are the (mostly) marginal splatter effects. Don't get me wrong, gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me (like the anal \"probe\"...that was great!).<br /><br />I believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder. C'mon - rent a Betacam at least, I've seen porn with better production values (and better acting as well).<br /><br />Acting - sucked! But not in the Troma or Full Moon sort of way.<br /><br />Story - contrived! But thats what you get from films like these. Very loose!<br /><br />Sets & Props - sucked! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween.<br /><br />Dubbing and dialogue - sucked! Horrible voice acting (I shouldn't even call it acting) and every other word is \"S**t\" or \"F**k\".<br /><br />There are tons of good classic and B rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down.

{"value":"As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was looking forward to this movie. I am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. A lot of the story follows Notorious B.I.G.'s real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. as a kid. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is just as unconvincing as Sean \"Puffy\" Combs. In a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing. It was boring, and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans alike did not already know. I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The movie slugs and slugs along thinking that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend tons of money on it. I am unfortunate to say that that happened. It's nowhere close to a good movie. I was expecting so much out of it, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted from this.

{"value":"\"Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms\", informs one dopey would-be victim in \"The Seedpeople\", a silly, flaccid remake of \"Invasion of the Bodysnatchers\", \"Day of the Triffids\", and about a thousand udder moovies. And why are seeds moore dangerous than plants, one might ask? Because, according to the same dolt, \"seeds can chase us\". Yes, I can remember one horrifying incident when the MooCow was just a calf, being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, the \"monsters\" in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets, some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds, others which sail about on strings. There's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here. For reasons left unexplained, the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra-violet lights, even though they can walk about in the daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy. As you can see, not much thought was put into this cow flop.

{"value":"This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking. Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie, thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random \"survival events\" (including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). Furthermore, despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of

{"value":"I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture Oscar. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all, I don't think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She isn't that talented, she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all. It's a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if Leslie Caron hadn't been in this, it might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent, the directing wasn't bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying it because I think that's what the worse part of the movie is. She's probably a good actress but I can't tell because I haven't seen her in anything else but I think she was pretty bad in \"An American in Paris\".

{"value":"Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up posh, upscale rural nervous asylum, where his loose wife battles with self-appointed queen bee Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer Lauren Bacall, who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child. Facetious and muddled, set in an indiscriminate time and place, and with a \"David and Lisa\" love story hidden in the plush morass. Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library (this thread isn't used as symbolism, rather it's a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the roundabout way

{"value":"When we were in junior high school, some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs. It was considered funny then. But the producers, directors and cast of \"Semana Santa\" (\"Angel of Death\" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they are STILL setting them off.<br /><br />Like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home, I doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes.<br /><br />Mira Sorvino, hot in \"Mighty Aphrodite\" and other top-rated films, seems to have undersold herself to this project. Her acting is non-existent, confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how \"sensitive\" she is to the plight of the film's various victims.<br /><br />But let me warn you--do not be the next victim! Step away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere are not many good leg shots of Mira (the only high points I could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality, delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing

{"value":"Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have scammed their way through college. When creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secret, he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful, good-hearted student Angela (James King).<br /><br />Stupid and incompetent \"comedy\" - a lot more groan-inducing than laugh-inducing. Movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags - but NONE OF THEM WORK. What's more, it's full of worthless, unappealing characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive he's a major turn-off. Movie even tries using 50's/60's sexpot/actress Mamie Van Doren in the movie's most outrageous scene. YUCK!!!<br /><br />Further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste (yet again) of veteran comedic actor Joe Flaherty's talent - when's this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile?<br /><br />All in all, the only thing I liked was James (a.k.a.

{"value":"THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst searching for a (literal) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area.<br /><br />An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This isn't a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's movies are 'fun' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

{"value":"The movie is plain bad. Simply awful. The string of bad movies from Bollywood has no end! They must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies (or not).<br /><br />The problem seems to be with mainly the directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance...but they were directed so poorly. The poor script did not help either.<br /><br />This movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half. For instance :<br /><br />After his 1st big concert, Ajay Devgan, meets up with Om Puri (from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again) and all Om Puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with Salman!!! What a load of crap. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy?<br /><br />Ajay Devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar.<br /><br />Only saving grace are the good performances in the second half.

{"value":"By 1941 Columbia was a full-fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM, Paramount or Warners. That's the best thing that could be said about \"Adam Had Four Sons,\" a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman (top-billed for the first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (this was the era in which Hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another) hired as governess to Baxter's four sons and staying on (with one interruption caused by the stock-market crash of 1907) until the boys are grown men serving in World War I. Just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good it's a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous.

{"value":"The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes. Other than that this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min. of the movie, which added nothing. Then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve. They begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her. From there this movie gets worse, way worse. I know its only a movie and you've gotta go with the flow but she's got about a 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her. Instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest. In typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her. But now she turns into one tough mofu. You get the point. Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical you'll be questioning every scene.

{"value":"I'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad, I felt embarrassed for not only the \"actors\", but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock.<br /><br />From the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at LEAST some direction or dialog. Instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. While watching this crap, I turned another TV on and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened.<br /><br />Needless to say, I kept watching Stern.<br /><br />Watching this \"film\" I realize that I could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action. This makes \"KaZaam\" look like a Meryl Streep film.<br /><br />I'm sure Germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence.
