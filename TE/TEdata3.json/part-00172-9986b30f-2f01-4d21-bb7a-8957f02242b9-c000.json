{"value":"Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival. Just before going I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7.4, a pretty nice rate...<br /><br />After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did this), but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening.<br /><br />I did not like at all, the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogs, nothing lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: plenty of Siemens and Organics advertising on the movie. Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and Siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! All of this would be bearable if the plot, characters, romances, anything was good, but was bad, really bad! A \"don't know how to do\" sex-in-the-city.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.","finished_norm":["just","see","it","yesterdai","in","the","sao","paulo","intl","film","festiv","just","befor","go","i","come","here","to","see","how","it","be","rate","and","at","that","time","it","be","a","pretti","nice","ratebr","br","after","minut","i","be","dye","to","get","out","never","do","thi","but","feel","embarrass","to","do","so","a","the","produc","of","the","movi","be","in","the","screeningbr","br","i","do","not","like","at","all","the","dialog","be","shallow","and","lead","nowher","the","charact","be","shallow","than","the","dialog","noth","lead","anywher","and","the","wrong","and","wrong","plenti","of","siemen","and","organ","advertis","on","the","movi","despit","the","fact","that","i","alreadi","pai","to","go","to","the","movi","and","entertain","myself","i","still","have","to","be","bombard","by","the","main","charact","chat","on","the","internet","and","siemen","mobil","poppingup","all","the","time","on","her","laptop","or","anoth","charact","have","a","bath","or","cut","her","hair","just","to","have","organ","shampoo","displai","enorm","on","the","screen","all","of","thi","would","be","bearabl","if","the","plot","charact","romanc","anyth","be","good","but","be","bad","realli","bad","a","do","not","know","how","to","do","sexinthecitybr","br","do","not","wast","your","time","or","monei"],"filtered":["see","yesterdai","sao","paulo","intl","film","festiv","befor","go","come","see","rate","time","pretti","nice","ratebr","br","minut","dye","get","never","thi","feel","embarrass","produc","movi","screeningbr","br","like","dialog","shallow","lead","nowher","charact","shallow","dialog","noth","lead","anywher","wrong","wrong","plenti","siemen","organ","advertis","movi","despit","fact","alreadi","pai","go","movi","entertain","still","bombard","main","charact","chat","internet","siemen","mobil","poppingup","time","laptop","anoth","charact","bath","cut","hair","organ","shampoo","displai","enorm","screen","thi","bearabl","plot","charact","romanc","anyth","good","bad","realli","bad","know","sexinthecitybr","br","wast","time","monei"],"filtered2":["see","yesterdai","sao","paulo","intl","festiv","befor","go","come","see","rate","time","pretti","nice","ratebr","minut","dye","get","never","feel","embarrass","produc","screeningbr","like","dialog","shallow","lead","nowher","charact","shallow","dialog","noth","lead","anywher","wrong","wrong","plenti","siemen","organ","advertis","despit","fact","alreadi","pai","go","entertain","still","bombard","main","charact","chat","internet","siemen","mobil","poppingup","time","laptop","anoth","charact","bath","cut","hair","organ","shampoo","displai","enorm","screen","bearabl","plot","charact","romanc","anyth","good","bad","realli","bad","know","sexinthecitybr","wast","time","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,13,25,26,32,34,42,43,49,59,64,73,78,79,89,97,104,126,157,179,192,195,202,261,262,303,322,330,391,432,557,799,813,887,892,1062,1150,1217,1230,1292,1530,1599,2519,2650,2992,3130,4552,4704,5352,7441],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,13,25,26,32,34,42,43,49,59,64,73,78,79,89,97,104,126,157,179,192,195,202,261,262,303,322,330,391,432,557,799,813,887,892,1062,1150,1217,1230,1292,1530,1599,2519,2650,2992,3130,4552,4704,5352,7441],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,2.825681057716235,2.1367141713444147,4.495548096411346,1.1317941569733974,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,1.9940046109572438,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,2.2391270689902285,4.672030138951541,2.507968722980095,2.5318267134339894,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,2.7085302779237206,2.726701583487816,2.868298950055202,2.885344817328191,2.9292757465539174,3.109204957709252,6.47017040719651,3.43462735814388,3.7636829971100436,3.8204358137024927,3.9323057095458362,3.9825254665248626,4.100845126825194,8.492356228499617,4.477736862489302,4.390138803171316,4.3336974922663645,4.573751515728891,9.377263583454626,5.2288713006995975,5.290429193699031,5.408212229355414,5.463272006538442,6.032366538428407,6.101359409915359,6.214688095222362,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.4976109708834E-5,6.453796061089291E-5,6.503968171452542E-5,6.466388174068796E-5,6.466494118558688E-5,6.45745525203338E-5,6.476660628726139E-5,6.454725365551722E-5,6.46923794119996E-5,7.177266353976619E-5,0.2612411016504036,6.444306015701973E-5,6.564585791772552E-5,6.658231050568199E-5,6.449005136422268E-5,6.431182868708917E-5,6.591600680619172E-5,6.477267442

{"value":"Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of:he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him.<br /><br />The main subject of this Bullock vehicle ,all the ideas,almost everything was already in Hitchcock's classic \" Rope\":the two students who commit a gratuitous crime, Nietsche's philosophy,and the clues that the boys disseminate ,the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen.And with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force.<br /><br />\"Murder by numbers \" does not take place in a single room,like \"the rope\" ,mind you.And ,what a supreme originality,it pits two cops against the evil youngsters;and ,you would never guess it,these two cops are very different:actually,Bullock plays the part of woman living like a man ,and her partner (Chaplin) is as shy as a clueless girlie.The two boys' performances are not really mind-boggling ,not as good ,as

{"value":"That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days.<br /><br />First of all, there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie.<br /><br />I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder...<br /><br />Second, indie films are supposed to be about real people. There's nothing real in this film. None of the characters come across as being even remotely human.<br /><br />What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how \"cool and edgy\" he is.<br /><br />Sorry, but this is not good writing, or good directing.<br /><br />What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance.

{"value":"Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is a so-so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments. Set in Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black 'n' white Porky cartoon and one of the books-come-to-life Merrie Melodies that were popular at that time. Typically of many of the early Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for. Unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they bargained for. As was sometimes the case in the books-come-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non-animated medium. Laughs are scarce and, while the cartoon is just about saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little at all to recommend 'Porky's Poor Fish' over any of the other below-par early Porky

{"value":"Oh Geez... There are so many other films I want to see out there... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted - Yeah...<br /><br />I used to watch this show when I was in college...it was mindless, kinda fun, and somewhat action-oriented. The show had a good heart tho...and the characters were cute; no one ever got killed or even hurt badly... it was like a cartoon come to life. Cut to 2005...What happened? This one doesn't work. As others have said, there simply isn't a cohesive story and the performances are weird...almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters...the whole thing is a like a Mad TV skit and it lasts over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I've been EMBARRASSED watching a film. What were they thinking? As best I can tell, must've been for the product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is, let this one die a quick death. It makes the original Dukes of Hazzard seem like Masterpiece Theater...<br /><br />I think the only remake left to do from TV is Gilligan's Island...

{"value":"A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />If that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is. It's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. Also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). Still, I mostly hated this.<br /><br />The film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace. Three times I considered leaving the theatre because I was so utterly bored. But the director WAS there so I stayed. <br /><br />His talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. I really wish I could like this more (there are VERY few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but I can't.

{"value":"What a load of Leftist Hollywood bilge. This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles. The fairytale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, actually getting promoted for his treason. What is it with these Hollywood tools? Is this still payback for McCarthyism?<br /><br />If I sound cynical it's because I am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. The military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? Gung-ho war mongers. Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. Yet again, Crimson Tide stresses the point. The Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the treasonous Ron Hunter, and repents by retiring from the service. A guy mutinies, takes command of your boat, puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, and you promote him????

{"value":"This movie is ridiculous. Anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel like all the other \"soaring\" comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers. I was not very impressed by the storyline, but just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon countryside, and there was some decent cinematography--but the casting was anything BUT inspired. I think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the Amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is worthwhile, and possible. It places jokes in the wrong and all-too-obvious places, and makes me think it was written by the State Department or something. Back to the drawing board. To even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like Harold and Maude is absolutely retarded, and along the same line of begging and pretension and \"joking\" as is

{"value":"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave \"the performance of his career.\" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one.

{"value":"This is a depressingly shallow, naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks' psychotic film editor and Harold, his vapid girlfriend. The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career; but also because Brooks' character is neither interesting nor likeable. There are 15 static, excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks, having just broke up with Harold, stumbles about his apartment in a depressed, drugged out state - unbearable.<br /><br />Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker's \"You Are So Beautiful\", there simply is not enough material here for a feature film. There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I'm sure Brooks' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and, in a way, deconstruct it; but if you're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it

{"value":"This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a (silly) play by Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor, Burton's half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even fun.

{"value":"There are exactly 2 good things to be said about \"Fantasies\" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny (\"He touched you where you're a woman!\"), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy jerk. Bo overplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name \"Damir\" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks English the whole time.

{"value":"I was very unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this is possibly worse than both titles. First of all, I didn't like the animation, very Saturday-morning-cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was truly villainous in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly. Also her artist companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight. The voice talents were very good though especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined it for me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed bloated for me, and highly suggestive of an extended TV episode. All in all, a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s Disney movies along with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give this a 3/10, it just wasn't my cup of tea.

{"value":"Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked for was it to be cinematic...and it wasn't even that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. Poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film's \"plot\" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the \"Jerry Farrelly Show\" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. There's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African-Americans and working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom.

{"value":"I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie, starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has Carlito's name. There should have been at least a few characters from the original movie, the ending makes no sense in relation to the original. In the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie? And his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original. I would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self, with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it's big brother.

{"value":"I saw this recently on a faded old VHS tape, and remembered it dimly. Looking at it now, it seems charming.<br /><br />When it was first released, it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager. To hammer the point home, the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of \"1 Teenager In 10\", the most popular coming out book of the time. David Warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [= gay-hating evangelist], who is of course a self-loathing closet case. The list of sight gags and in-jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. The producers were having some good-natured fun, and hoping, no doubt, to lighten-up as well as to enlighten.<br /><br />But I have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film, nowadays. In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past.

{"value":"I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it -- budget, script, plot, casting, and acting -- was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, looks nothing like an Indian, and neither do half of the other \"Indians,\" who were played by Italians, Mexicans, and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a superb job in the original, seems to be coasting this time around. I guess he couldn't resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as Horse.<br /><br />To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as Horse's undergoing a painful purification ritual to \"find his vision\" and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the whole, Return is uneven, boring, corny, and predictable -- just like

{"value":"Funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float. Sure they used various actors for Batman, but in that instance Batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape. In this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing Ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for Christmas... Somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original... If I had not known it was a sequel I wouldn't have guessed it from the cast... except of course Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better...<br /><br />In the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better. They should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel. This one is just a cheap imitation.

{"value":"I didn't expect a movie as good as \"In The Line of Fire\" or an episode of \"24\", but it looked like this movie was made for TV and did a mediocre job at best. The (good) cast couldn't disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle (they really try their best I think) through their lines of bad script, giving their rather flat characters any extras. When I watched the movie I got the feeling that I had seen most of this in other (better) movies. In it you had car chases, big shootouts, romance, plot twists etc. etc; This movie has none.<br /><br />** Spoiler** As soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to Cuba's character, you know who's behind all this and all the hints you're being given (\"you stand too close to the president, see it from my perspective..\" ) sound silly. <br /><br />If it were up to me (and maybe it's a

{"value":"This movie feels so EMPTY. IN every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10. Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird.<br /><br />The ACTING was HORRIBLE! It's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor/actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives.. Looking at the floor for their marks...<br /><br />Spoilers: Also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie. At one point at Sky Captain's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip. They have advanced warning an attack is coming... So what do they do? nothing. All of the planes get blown up and yet again the ONLY person fighting back is the Sky Captain...<br /><br />THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he's the ONLY person ever fighting back. At the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally... but what do they do?

{"value":"When 'My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu' aired last season, I was pleased. Scrubs, I thought, is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip-show concept. Instead of replaying footage, they're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner, and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later, they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show...and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid. Dr Cox's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together, as it doesn't appear again until 'My Long Goodbye' some 4 episodes later. I can't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. Who knows why it was slotted there, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of episodes that have aired within the past year.<br /><br />Three second clips jammed together with

{"value":"A female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. She has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker. After a few kills, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie ? That its pacing is over-slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never a bite sounded so strange) and ambiance (new jazz here I come) and that lights don't seem to be included on the set. It looks like an \"auteur\" horror movie with all the self-sufficiency inside.<br /><br />The plot is completely stupid and as you can guess, it's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't have to do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks don't work.<br /><br />It's not even a funny lousy movie. Perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers, it can't have its funny sides (to be honest, it's funny during 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie).

{"value":"Please make me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film. I have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences. What a load of garbage!! And don't get me started about the acting... Someone please help me forget!! \"Weird Science\" -- come back!! Everything is forgiven...<br /><br />I am \"proud\" to give this film the first 1 here at IMDb... And I've voted for hundreds of films... Many of them c**p but this is so bad I can't even believe it. Someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film? Someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film? Someone read the script and auditioned for it? Someone saw the film and decided *not* to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity? *These* are the questions I want answers to.

{"value":"Now, it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title, so i'll wait on that. First, this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles. Then i realized it, this is a movie with a message, that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical \"kill the monster indirectly\" fashion. Now, as promised... Blue Monkey... has nothing Blue in it nor any Simian of any kind. Now it snot like i was cheated or anything. The picture on the cover had a giant bug/crab/idiot/thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses. That kinda happened but i wanted apes! having just enjoyed MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights before(half drunk on Cask and Creame's brandy mind you) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80's style. Not so much. If you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you.

{"value":"for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, heres your chance, and then get back to the real world.<br /><br />The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch, so he gets transferred to another prison, where wrestling champs hang around looking broody. Twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman.<br /><br />Then something happens and someone gets shot, and the film turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is caught up in it all, so he and twitch go to find her and Twitch's woman.<br /><br />As you can imagine, the acting is below par, it features a lot of (really annoying) rap music, and poorly edited fight scenes. On the plus side, it's got that Hispanic bloke in it, who stars in every prison/action/thriller ever made, and he shuts a door in this.<br /><br />It's not very eventful, but at least it's

{"value":"'Flight Of Fury' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring Action Film - I don't expect a lot from a Seagal Film, all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action -unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation, The action scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these Films) is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout, The acting is truly abysmal - bordering on embarrassing with Seagal and his whispering One expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $12M was spent on this dire mess unless $11M of that 12 was Seagal's Salary - I somehow doubt it! The one moment of any interest to Straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that -

{"value":"Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this

{"value":"Okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed? Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her \"proof\". I don't know I was not happy with the ending. This movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy.","finished_norm":["okai","at","thi","movi","seem","pretti","good","even","though","it","be","move","rather","quick","and","even","though","thei","onli","have","a","budget","it","be","good","but","if","you","find","your","sister","dead","in","a","lake","and","find","out","who","mai","have","kill","her","why","would","you","go","chase","him","around","and","pull","a","gun","on","him","with","onli","on","bullet","and","wast","it","and","end","up","run","from","him","all","retard","and","get","yourself","kill","plu","after","you","find","your","sister","dead","in","the","lake","and","find","a","clue","and","figur","out","who","the","killer","be","why","would","not","you","hand","that","clue","over","to","the","polic","who","think","you","kill","her","and","at","the","end","of","the","movi","when","she","act","like","her","sister","who","be","a","waitress","and","she","be","talk","to","the","bad","gui","she","should","of","meet","him","somewher","and","record","him","sai","she","be","dead","and","what","happen","for","her","proof","i","do","not","know","i","be","not","happi","with","the","end","thi","movi","can","of","be","so","much","well","if","it","last","long","and","the","act","be","well","and","if","the","end","do","not","suck","so","bad","do","not","wast","your","monei","on","thi","movi","becaus","if","you","do","you","will","be","write","a","review","on","here","too","and","will","not","be","happi"],"filtered":["okai","thi","movi","seem","pretti","good","even","though","move","rather","quick","even","though","thei","onli","budget","good","find","sister","dead","lake","find","mai","kill","go","chase","around","pull","gun","onli","bullet","wast","end","run","retard","get","kill","plu","find","sister","dead","lake","find","clue","figur","killer","hand","clue","polic","think","kill","end","movi","act","like","sister","waitress","talk","bad","gui","meet","somewher","record","sai","dead","happen","proof","know","happi","end","thi","movi","much","well","last","long","act","well","end","suck","bad","wast","monei","thi","movi","becaus","write","review","happi"],"filtered2":["okai","seem","pretti","good","even","though","move","rather","quick","even","though","onli","budget","good","find","sister","dead","lake","find","mai","kill","go","chase","around","pull","gun","onli","bullet","wast","end","run","retard","get","kill","plu","find","sister","dead","lake","find","clue","figur","killer","hand","clue","polic","think","kill","end","act","like","sister","waitress","talk","bad","gui","meet","somewher","record","dead","happen","proof","know","happi","end","well","last","long","act","well","end","suck","bad","wast","monei","becaus","write","review","happi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,9,11,12,20,21,22,24,26,35,38,46,55,65,76,78,86,89,94,98,99,126,137,144,160,176,186,191,228,235,252,256,275,350,415,421,471,501,530,544,585,605,749,804,1020,1038,1173,1437,1526,1574,1976,5340],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,9,11,12,20,21,22,24,26,35,38,46,55,65,76,78,86,89,94,98,99,126,137,144,160,176,186,191,228,235,252,256,275,350,415,421,471,501,530,544,585,605,749,804,1020,1038,1173,1437,1526,1574,1976,5340],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,5.284144626447703,1.3324924169710188,1.463169012899134,6.077246565392488,1.655771293751733,1.9536997889255368,1.9073850067444174,6.401299659997208,2.0064197866819473,4.062224798544638,3.9880092219144876,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,2.2391270689902285,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.3722295531801256,2.5040471493269134,2.571852579609833,2.5460113484259455,8.322810001220777,2.6457189377809835,3.0433232530252132,2.748952192422636,2.7832848715031413,3.0135689919434205,3.1588018988486244,3.2597778161886266,3.496027715008137,3.5119855004467477,3.5784919978881358,3.4222967456864013,11.149608656053024,7.094919777280815,3.7165362186843414,3.7740817043309423,4.100845126825194,8.33141152205447,4.2574141875167335,9.656787468204943,4.6295428753573065,4.733083554298147,4.956227105612356,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.0670227443221568,6.373465819398663E-5,6.423013438731603E-5,6.385901198655957E-5,6.386005824457376E-5,6.377079464482587E-5,6.39604579232148E-5,6.374383556831184E-5,6.388715494805355E-5,0.09484626054398143,0.7977551372990416,6.364093896374121E-5,6.482876553014402E-5,0.03549840633455231,6.368734527253767E-5,6.351134092870651E-5,6.509555188200423E-5,6.396645053532842E-5,6.376799487172737E-5,6.38208472017196E-5,6.443835133007572E-5,6.402982510125757E-5,6.410273277087141E-5,6.41

{"value":"I have no idea why they made this version of \"Persuasion\" when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.<br /><br />Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this level-headed heroine.<br /><br />Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage.

{"value":"in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci...<br /><br />and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.<br /><br />pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn't even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable.<br /><br />anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently (you know, the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6).<br /><br

{"value":"in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci...<br /><br />and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.<br /><br />pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn't even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable.<br /><br />anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the
