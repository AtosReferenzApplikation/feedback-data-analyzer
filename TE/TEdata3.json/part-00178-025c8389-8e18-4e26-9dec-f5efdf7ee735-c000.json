{"value":"A question for all you girls out there : If a man you`ve never met before accidentally phoned you up on purpose and continued to do so at the most indiscreet moments would you be intrigued by him or so freaked out you`d phone the police ? Yeah that`s what I thought so I couldn`t swallow the idea of Marti Gerrard putting up with the unwarrented attention of Connor Hill<br /><br />***** MILD SPOILERS *****<br /><br />This is a really dumb story . Connor Hill`s wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is Connor phoning Marti so he can have an alibi ? But there`s a massive gap in logic here , couldn`t Connor have employed a hit man ? something the prosecution seem to have ignored . And wasn`t there any forensics at the murder scene ? So why does the whole trial rest on Connor phoning Marti at the time of the murder ? Dumb . Dumb . Dumb . And it`s as predictable as it is brainless .<br /><br />My abiding memory of this film is that for someone who made the winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a really crap downhill

{"value":"This installment of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent, plausible dialog. There were times when I literally shouted at the TV for something to happen. Maybe he thinks he building suspense, but Carpenter needs to trim back that overdone, over-simplified musical score of his (or his son's) and advance the action a little bit. How many times did the girl say, \"Oh no, I can't have this baby!\" and \"Oh, no here it comes\"? Carpenter takes elements from much, much better films (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them in here as if we are supposed to acknowledge and appreciate his trademark style. What is lacking here is genuine suspense and energy. It's as though he's sleepwalking through the process of movie making. <br /><br />For better Carpenter films, stick to the tried and true classics-- The Thing, Halloween, and They Live.

{"value":"Another case of a decent DVD case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film. <br /><br />It wasn't that bad. Rochon does a serviceable job and Damn! the cast is good looking. I've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted to make you think Rochon was the killer, but it was not to be. My biggest problem with the film was that by the end, I didn't much care who was the killer, and the real killer made little sense, since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha, betcha didn't see that one coming, sucker!'. Yeah, there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms. Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but that was just a gimmick. The dialog was overly think and painful at times.<br /><br />Just don't have high expectations going into this, and it won't be that bad.

{"value":"What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean firstly I love Seagal. I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. However, what we get is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera!

{"value":"'Mojo' is a story of fifties London, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion (owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period); I have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies, but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language. It's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems, in consequence, a very distant country indeed; and therefore stresses the particular, rather than the universal, in the story. 'Mojo' features a strong performance from Ian Hart and annoying ones from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting' career; but feels like a period piece, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom.

{"value":"This was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish, I knew I couldn't even watch the damn thing to close. You are almost convinced the actual war didn't even last that long. Other's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this. But flat out, you can't go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - those don't preclude a director from making an intelligent movie. The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names. I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. The character development sequences (the soilders' flashbacks, looking back to their last moments, before being deployed) should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory. To this day, I have yet to watch the ending.

{"value":"Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction.<br /><br />I watched this because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I must have missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless.<br /><br />I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either.<br /><br />Possibly there is something there that I totally missed.

{"value":"I bought this DVD for $1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I might just return to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements, though it really never rises to the level of being interesting. This film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive-in theaters market--ultra-low budget, amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex (for an early 60s film). In fact, I wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck AND because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model--whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes.

{"value":"This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles, \"Grand Canyon\" for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama & not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love to watch white people freak out &

{"value":"Being a fan of the manga and anime of Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to this one. I'd seen neither the manga nor the anime, so I had no preconceived notions going in. Good thing, too. What we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. While it's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers (our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued-on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies. While I have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes, I do dislike amateurishly made movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw.

{"value":"Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel for the tube, yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to quit. Struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy, enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last gathering held there--Ellen's daughter's coming-out party--Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began, nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another! Two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn't bear close scrutiny, one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity. Burstyn's role teeters on camp, while Tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy-eyed-waif routine. Only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and betrayal.

{"value":"I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I hadn't seen in any movies since Rocky IV. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. The acting of all the parties was bad except for Mr. Lundgren, who was okay-ish. Kata Dobó was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make-up.<br /><br />The plot is not at all clever, it's something that's been repeated a million times in different movies. The crooks were utterly stereotypical, and Lundgren's character hadn't any depth in it. I didn't really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately this is not even decent action. Every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over-the-top unrealism and comic-book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon.<br /><br />I would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic-like action, but only if nothing else is available.<br /><br />1/10.

movie)","finished_norm":["i","just","rent","thi","movi","to","see","dolph","lundgren","whom","i","have","not","see","in","ani","movi","sinc","rocki","iv","unfortun","thi","movi","be","a","big","disappoint","the","act","of","all","the","parti","be","bad","except","for","mr","lundgren","who","be","okayish","kata","dobó","be","someth","nice","to","look","at","despit","her","ridicul","outfit","and","makeupbr","br","the","plot","be","not","at","all","clever","it","someth","that","be","repeat","a","million","time","in","differ","movi","the","crook","be","utterli","stereotyp","and","lundgren","charact","have","not","ani","depth","in","it","i","do","not","realli","expect","a","movi","masterpiec","but","unfortun","thi","be","not","even","decent","action","everi","turn","in","the","plot","be","extrem","predict","and","the","unbeliev","amount","of","overthetop","unreal","and","comicbook","like","charact","start","to","annoi","me","strongli","pretti","soonbr","br","i","would","recommend","thi","to","young","kid","want","some","comiclik","action","but","onli","if","noth","els","be","availablebr","br","i","guess","the","current","averag","vote","of","with","vote","must","have","be","influenc","by","somebodi","involv","in","make","thi","movi"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","see","dolph","lundgren","see","ani","movi","sinc","rocki","iv","unfortun","thi","movi","big","disappoint","act","parti","bad","except","mr","lundgren","okayish","kata","dobó","someth","nice","look","despit","ridicul","outfit","makeupbr","br","plot","clever","someth","repeat","million","time","differ","movi","crook","utterli","stereotyp","lundgren","charact","ani","depth","realli","expect","movi","masterpiec","unfortun","thi","even","decent","action","everi","turn","plot","extrem","predict","unbeliev","amount","overthetop","unreal","comicbook","like","charact","start","annoi","strongli","pretti","soonbr","br","recommend","thi","young","kid","want","comiclik","action","onli","noth","els","availablebr","br","guess","current","averag","vote","vote","must","influenc","somebodi","involv","make","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["rent","see","dolph","lundgren","see","ani","sinc","rocki","iv","unfortun","big","disappoint","act","parti","bad","except","mr","lundgren","okayish","kata","dobó","someth","nice","look","despit","ridicul","outfit","makeupbr","plot","clever","someth","repeat","million","time","differ","crook","utterli","stereotyp","lundgren","charact","ani","depth","realli","expect","masterpiec","unfortun","even","decent","action","everi","turn","plot","extrem","predict","unbeliev","amount","overthetop","unreal","comicbook","like","charact","start","annoi","strongli","pretti","soonbr","recommend","young","kid","want","comiclik","action","onli","noth","els","availablebr","guess","current","averag","vote","vote","must","influenc","somebodi","involv","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,9,10,11,13,16,21,27,32,37,49,53,71,78,82,85,96,114,129,130,135,141,162,187,196,204,227,232,241,243,262,271,274,298,309,329,337,357,391,571,604,643,661,771,807,816,850,914,955,986,1082,1174,1189,1360,1792,1921,1943,2217,2325,2813,3035,3043,3766,3941,7527,8119],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,9,10,11,13,16,21,27,32,37,49,53,71,78,82,85,96,114,129,130,135,141,162,187,196,204,227,232,241,243,262,271,274,298,309,329,337,357,391,571,604,643,661,771,807,816,850,914,955,986,1082,1174,1189,1360,1792,1921,1943,2217,2325,2813,3035,3043,3766,3941,7527,8119],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,2.600540117735859,2.742262257014735,1.4876543214774305,1.6920303308087352,3.400636547121535,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0390708128715254,2.4433074195966826,4.821391668015843,2.2642139034199635,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,2.3586007221245198,2.4732161909892554,2.478925055209576,2.624524614047584,5.201064374608725,2.6102777977348763,2.6627744961815836,2.627841366673578,2.726701583487816,2.757740698455715,2.748952192422636,2.7819920465008363,2.848772527704847,2.951986790814132,2.973659465713028,3.2829611516442836,3.109204957709252,3.467417180966871,3.5727776966246974,3.5813614403160887,3.5727776966246974,3.7398317812878634,3.900174431363043,3.7881170224473255,3.9241755834625858,3.9612932464190886,4.017463517886143,4.039936373738201,4.165705761027235,4.235066888824737,8.583800727175806,4.403125998698128,4.798834931860927,4.869215728622727,4.85885294158718,5.00274712124725,18.766530269227854,5.878215858601149,5.482320201509136,5.7199918533

{"value":"Yeah, that about sums it up. This movie was horrifying. Two minutes in I wanted to gouge my eyes out. This has been praised as an \"innovative LDS comedy,\" but it's not even good for members of that church! I don't think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality.<br /><br />First of all, you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie. It seems as if the horribly drab, glib, trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. Then, there's the acting, which is dismal from *everybody* involved. Even the cameos fail to liven anything up.<br /><br />And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change, but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue, appallingly hideous \"gags,\" and a lot of Mormon \"in-jokes\" that anyone in their right mind, LDS or not, should consider purely *stupid*!

{"value":"I haven't seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.<br /><br />I'll give it two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here come the jeers. The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give Cage any straight answers--and he puts up with this!!! How this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /><br />Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone could read this script and think, \"Yes, people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like\" is beyond me.<br /><br />Do not go see this flick.

{"value":"The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.<br /><br />This time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake.

When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back.<br /><br />Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.<br /><br />A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me. That's why sequels are never welcomed; at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.","finished_norm":["the","premis","of","thi","await","sequel","be","realli","good","and","after","the","huge","success","of","the","remak","i","expect","a","lot","sincerelybr","br","the","sad","truth","be","that","thi","movi","be","realli","absurd","and","inept","the","situat","be","dumb","and","beyond","reason","and","the","act","be","truli","awfulbr","br","thi","time","there","be","not","likabl","charact","or","violin","unlik","the","remak","conjur","the","gore","be","not","that","abund","and","when","it","happen","it","truli","badbr","br","the","violenc","be","minim","and","it","a","shame","becaus","there","be","mani","argum","that","make","you","think","that","there","room","for","heavi","violenc","i","mean","there","a","swat","team","that","be","hunt","a","famili","of","cannib","mutant","you","sure","expect","someth","differ","when","i","watch","it","on","the","movi","i","want","my","monei","backbr","br","anywai","thi","be","a","clear","exampl","of","how","rush","out","movi","turn","out","to","be","a","mess","and","demonstr","poor","qualiti","on","all","aspectsbr","br","a","mess","that","let","down","the","fan","of","the","remak","like","me","that","why","sequel","be","never","welcom","at","littl","thi","movi","be","not","a","terribl","a","the","sequel","to","the","origin"],"filtered":["premis","thi","await","sequel","realli","good","huge","success","remak","expect","lot","sincerelybr","br","sad","truth","thi","movi","realli","absurd","inept","situat","dumb","beyond","reason","act","truli","awfulbr","br","thi","time","likabl","charact","violin","unlik","remak","conjur","gore","abund","happen","truli","badbr","br","violenc","minim","shame","becaus","mani","argum","make","think","room","heavi","violenc","mean","swat","team","hunt","famili","cannib","mutant","sure","expect","someth","differ","watch","movi","want","monei","backbr","br","anywai","thi","clear","exampl","rush","movi","turn","mess","demonstr","poor","qualiti","aspectsbr","br","mess","let","fan","remak","like","sequel","never","welcom","littl","thi","movi","terribl","sequel","origin"],"filtered2":["premis","await","sequel","realli","good","huge","success","remak","expect","lot","sincerelybr","sad","truth","realli","absurd","inept","situat","dumb","beyond","reason","act","truli","awfulbr","time","likabl","charact","violin","unlik","remak","conjur","gore","abund","happen","truli","badbr","violenc","minim","shame","becaus","mani","argum","make","think","room","heavi","violenc","mean","swat","team","hunt","famili","cannib","mutant","sure","expect","someth","differ","watch","want","monei","backbr","anywai","clear","exampl","rush","turn","mess","demonstr","poor","qualiti","aspectsbr","mess","let","fan","remak","like","sequel","never","welcom","littl","terribl","sequel","origin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,8,10,12,13,14,21,22,37,39,42,50,53,69,72,88,94,95,96,119,124,126,130,140,146,166,182,204,307,319,342,358,386,387,407,420,444,453,455,473,483,484,502,513,532,574,590,615,723,758,928,1177,1249,1364,1413,1439,1629,1729,1817,1993,2011,2066,2307,3471,3716,4091,4340,5123,6401],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,8,10,12,13,14,21,22,37,39,42,50,53,69,72,88,94,95,96,119,124,126,130,140,146,166,182,204,307,319,342,358,386,387,407,420,444,453,455,473,483,484,502,513,532,574,590,615,723,758,928,1177,1249,1364,1413,1439,1629,1729,1817,1993,2011,2066,2307,3471,3716,4091,4340,5123,6401],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,2.0317223413467334,2.08112281984698,2.0323326556775485,2.0390708128715254,2.1653408989309972,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,4.528427806839927,2.317169775997098,2.326138445979858,2.4423870329693536,2.7365296724240786,2.624524614047584,2.8767855639325206,2.9056060024680126,5.941068926339787,3.2030824725120812,3.0433232530252132,10.081558157970473,6.240031747626936,3.3023374306074227,3.2535472664379905,6.83481352078442,3.2787058260741455,3.335489637924323,10.840442969214603,3.291526514503207,3.3132665011396125,3.454678155189441,3.4446025032006995,3.5039747767006686,3.4986697244709752,3.5013187326425523,3.865219416329466,3.8240921249056035,4.017463517886143,4.263079925052412,4.390138803171316,4.436351646326448,4.449957298382227,4.513582994262438,4.613282354485526,5.0768550934009715,4.838444069955973,4.979216623837056,4.8796870284900224,4.933754249760298,5.3064295350454715,5.604922523601468,

{"value":"I have seen already fantastic stories, but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous. A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... souls? ... maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son. There is no shade of suspense or thrill, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director Joby Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen at his first major role after having taken off the Anakin Skywalker costume, fabulous Jessica Alba and super-gifted Lena Olin.

{"value":"I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this sequel. I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original. Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs); and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious. I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their \"wheels\" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie. Being shamed by that putz character Carrington, I'd hate to see what they would resort to later: maybe Mopeds?<br /><br />I also never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-Australian-boy-can't-fit-into-Outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look. It was Disney story gone horribly awry.<br /><br />So, it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it.","finished_norm":["i","be","sorri","but","even","tj","hooker","adrian","zmed","can","not","save","thi","sequel","i","go","through","half","the","movi","think","that","thi","be","a","spoof","of","the","origin","then","come","that","wild","and","wacki","motorcycl","scene","notic","that","thi","be","the","onli","movi","that","patricia","birch","direct","and","i","sadli","realiz","thei","be","try","to","be","seriou","i","do","get","a","kick","out","of","the","fact","that","the","oppos","gang","have","lose","their","wheel","due","to","their","gambl","habit","in","the","origin","greas","be","forc","to","us","motorcycl","in","the","movi","be","shame","by","that","putz","charact","carrington","i","have","hate","to","see","what","thei","would","resort","to","late","mayb","mopedsbr","br","i","conjur","never","bui","the","hacknei","theme","hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor","toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook","it","be","disnei","stori","go","horribli","awrybr","br","so","it","look","like","you","can","ruin","a","good","thing","by","place","a","bubblegum","smack","michel","pfeiffer","in","a","music","the","onli","thing","i","take","awai","from","thi","movi","be","a","idea","of","how","mani","point","out","of","ten","to","give","it"],"filtered":["sorri","even","tj","hooker","adrian","zmed","save","thi","sequel","go","half","movi","think","thi","spoof","origin","come","wild","wacki","motorcycl","scene","notic","thi","onli","movi","patricia","birch","direct","sadli","realiz","thei","try","seriou","get","kick","fact","oppos","gang","lose","wheel","due","gambl","habit","origin","greas","forc","us","motorcycl","movi","shame","putz","charact","carrington","hate","see","thei","resort","late","mayb","mopedsbr","br","conjur","never","bui","hacknei","theme","hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor","toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook","disnei","stori","go","horribli","awrybr","br","look","like","ruin","good","thing","place","bubblegum","smack","michel","pfeiffer","music","onli","thing","take","awai","thi","movi","idea","mani","point","ten","give"],"filtered2":["sorri","even","tj","hooker","adrian","zmed","save","sequel","go","half","think","spoof","origin","come","wild","wacki","motorcycl","scene","notic","onli","patricia","birch","direct","sadli","realiz","try","seriou","get","kick","fact","oppos","gang","lose","wheel","due","gambl","habit","origin","greas","forc","us","motorcycl","shame","putz","charact","carrington","hate","see","resort","late","mayb","mopedsbr","conjur","never","bui","hacknei","theme","hunkyaustralianboycantfitintooutsidersdominatedschoolergogoesfor","toughguywithstupidbikerhelmetlook","disnei","stori","go","horribli","awrybr","look","like","ruin","good","thing","place","bubblegum","smack","michel","pfeiffer","music","onli","thing","take","awai","idea","mani","point","ten","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,16,17,19,29,30,31,34,36,39,42,50,56,66,69,97,102,118,123,150,155,163,164,189,206,221,338,339,347,387,405,437,493,534,545,568,574,688,706,710,841,869,997,1107,1276,1547,2196,2291,2356,2844,2904,3088,3358,3756,4090,4337,4488,5228,5229,6028],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,16,17,19,29,30,31,34,36,39,42,50,56,66,69,97,102,118,123,150,155,163,164,189,206,221,338,339,347,387,405,437,493,534,545,568,574,688,706,710,841,869,997,1107,1276,1547,2196,2291,2356,2844,2904,3088,3358,3756,4090,4337,4488,5228,5229,6028],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.6390769554676132,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.8610609350701788,1.929723173391612,4.254065042302116,2.0545557924622586,2.087553710177271,2.354379525480895,2.2619070973220485,2.332712011146513,2.3074766467914385,2.4000574358028657,2.3930275298746078,2.498193474075453,2.597304642813496,2.6423424573643777,2.9720957437368454,3.003844442051426,3.0151989841543516,3.360519385990158,3.109204957709252,3.1952392950510555,3.342254038012865,3.4933926673701317,3.442099372982581,3.4471119148061256,3.5039747767006686,3.6016814428070463,3.6284289511740746,3.6528204042982337,4.30366520516749,3.9161110236258554,4.263079925052412,4.268777946167049,4.297765483040301,4.724033718778229,5.129498826886393,5.259176650194926,5.129498826886393,5.339219357868463,5.5623629091826725,5.463272006538442,5.604922523601468,5.878215858601149,5.822646007446338,6.543192162194399,6.1754673820690815,12.

{"value":"When thinking about Captivity many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, unentertaining, unsuspensful, unsexy, unfathomable, and unwatchable.<br /><br />I used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of Scream but these new Saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics. They still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing, but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore AND hip.<br /><br />This movie is a load of boring crap! What the hell has happened to Larry Cohen? His name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! Even so, I was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something THIS bad! Was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did anyone not know it when they first saw him?

{"value":"Wow, here it finally is; the action \"movie\" without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.<br /><br />There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly \"Matrix\" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.<br /><br />And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.<br /><br />Believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get.

{"value":"I thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious. This movie went nowhere fast. What could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, a picture of some dude's swimming pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing its job, and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating \"T minus 10 and counting\" as if something exciting is going to happen. It doesn't so don't get your hopes up. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than there famous TV personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good. And do NOT get me started on the music which was totally composed of a Tympani, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I have given a one yet, but it gets the 2 because I actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn't have to leave in the middle.

{"value":"Wow, here it finally is; the action \"movie\" without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.<br /><br />There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly \"Matrix\" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.<br /><br />And, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.<br /><br />Believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. In fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money.","finished_norm":["wow","here","it","final","be","the","action","movi","without","action","in","a","real","lowbudget","set","do","not","miss","the","hilari","fly","saucer","fly","by","a","few","time","of","a","futur","seattl","we","find","a","nobrain","hardbodi","seek","to","aveng","her","childhoodbr","br","there","be","noth","even","remot","origin","or","interest","about","the","plot","and","the","actor","perform","be","onli","rival","in","stupid","by","the","attempt","to","steal","from","other","movi","mainli","matrix","without","have","the","monei","to","do","it","right","ye","we","do","get","to","see","some","run","on","wall","and","slow","motion","shootout","sec","approx","but","thi","scene","be","about","a","cool","a","the","stupid","hardbodi","attempt","at","make","joke","about","male","incompet","now","and","thenbr","br","and","ye","we","be","conjur","serv","a","numb","of","lead","that","lead","absolut","nowher","a","if","the","script","be","thoughtout","by","the","previous","unseen","cast","while","shoot","the","scenesbr","br","believ","me","it","be","a","bad","a","it","possibli","can","get","in","fact","it","doe","not","deserv","to","be","take","serious","but","perhap","i","can","make","some","of","you","not","rend","it","and","save","your","monei"],"filtered":["wow","final","action","movi","without","action","real","lowbudget","set","miss","hilari","fly","saucer","fly","time","futur","seattl","find","nobrain","hardbodi","seek","aveng","childhoodbr","br","noth","even","remot","origin","interest","plot","actor","perform","onli","rival","stupid","attempt","steal","movi","mainli","matrix","without","monei","right","ye","get","see","run","wall","slow","motion","shootout","sec","approx","thi","scene","cool","stupid","hardbodi","attempt","make","joke","male","incompet","thenbr","br","ye","conjur","serv","numb","lead","lead","absolut","nowher","script","thoughtout","previous","unseen","cast","shoot","scenesbr","br","believ","bad","possibli","get","fact","doe","deserv","take","serious","perhap","make","rend","save","monei"],"filtered2":["wow","final","action","without","action","real","lowbudget","set","miss","hilari","fly","saucer","fly","time","futur","seattl","find","nobrain","hardbodi","seek","aveng","childhoodbr","noth","even","remot","origin","interest","plot","actor","perform","onli","rival","stupid","attempt","steal","mainli","matrix","without","monei","right","ye","get","see","run","wall","slow","motion","shootout","sec","approx","scene","cool","stupid","hardbodi","attempt","make","joke","male","incompet","thenbr","ye","conjur","serv","numb","lead","lead","absolut","nowher","script","thoughtout","previous","unseen","cast","shoot","scenesbr","believ","bad","possibli","get","fact","doe","deserv","take","serious","perhap","make","rend","save","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,8,9,11,18,19,31,32,38,39,41,49,60,69,77,80,91,92,97,105,109,117,121,125,126,129,136,137,156,157,177,189,209,214,222,255,318,371,390,423,481,516,533,558,578,632,649,652,799,815,844,883,1003,1021,1085,1210,1222,1238,1858,1900,2077,2961,3025,3217,3484,4704,5814,6944],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,8,9,11,18,19,31,32,38,39,41,49,60,69,77,80,91,92,97,105,109,117,121,125,126,129,136,137,156,157,177,189,209,214,222,255,318,371,390,423,481,516,533,558,578,632,649,652,799,815,844,883,1003,1021,1085,1210,1222,1238,1858,1900,2077,2961,3025,3217,3484,4704,5814,6944],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,2.127032521151058,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.0545557924622586,2.1765612129984904,2.125691139326857,2.2797301185117202,2.2190595059394194,4.448447326975307,4.478254137980457,4.821391668015843,4.693651971159972,2.2939035841256437,2.3451551414151686,4.672030138951541,4.916299985269222,2.498193474075453,5.2053793708887675,2.7303758068497004,2.5771019354959765,2.6754694156628323,2.902686292364678,3.0466846007279185,3.132778125427319,3.164467636384302,3.353630724994973,3.442099372982581,3.424750734647968,3.4572130107926293,3.575630765607104,3.541919708264792,3.6375061693251913,7.562149479643825,3.7636829971100436,3.7881170224473255,3.8690435127678695,3.8614098879127985,4.035401218572811,4.076977645418551,4.176068548062782,4.274508620876034,4.3336974922663645,4.291900363587903,5.170884043049248,4.828393734102471,4.944927550358424,5.501738287366237,5.521540914662417,5.5623629091826725

{"value":"I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time felt complied to. Night Listener is without doubt one of the dullest films I have ever seen.<br /><br />There was nothing happening in this film what so ever - I didn't care for any of the characters, didn't buy in to the whole mystery type plot, didn't care how it ended....nothing.<br /><br />There is no comedy, no action, no thrills, no suspense, nothing. The highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \"One Hour Photo\" and hoped for a similar eerie role from Williams, but alas was sorely let down. What's more disappointing is that I'm sure there is a good film in there somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just didn't work for me.<br

{"value":"Holy crap! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night. I watched an hour or so before heading to bed. I was pretty intrigued by the whole thing. I finished it last night and couldn't believe where I stopped it the night before. Literally, I stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill.<br /><br />Like I said, I was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when Simon receives the package in the bar. I picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a \"menacing\" game of laser tag. Whew! Then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds. WHEW! You can tell the Spanish industry was definitely behind director Mateo Gil (co-writer of Amenabar's two big previous hits). There is an excellent score and great photography. But this scenario reeks of silliness.

{"value":"I love John Saxon in anything he's in. The one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled \"Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called: Zombie Death House\". The $1000 dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Ray's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70's cheese legend. Ray being the front man at RetroMedia. Ray by the way makes Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Just plain bad now, the both of them- and boring besides. It's great that Ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word \"Zombie\" sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of F.O.R.) THE ONLY WAY TO DO SERVICE TO THIS TRIPE IS TO RELEASE IT ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OF SAXON!!!

{"value":"As Steven Segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel. His best was just fodder for bored teenagers. This one tips the scales, then falls off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is double lame. I can't spoil it by telling you the ending. You already know how all Steven Segal movies end if you have seen one. Here goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide, instead of killing him, to dope his brain until he don't remember squat. He escapes, of course, gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanastan by a rogue Air Force pilot who, surprise, surprise, Segal trained. All the heroes, except Segal's character and his dusky girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby save the whole world in one swell foop, or fell swoop. Whatever. Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy flying film. And a lot of boom-booms.

{"value":"I don't often go out of my way to write comments, but for this I had to, just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy. This doesn't come close. While the premise (change in colour/gender/whatever) is bad enough (and has been done, better, many times before)the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks. However the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you will have guessed by now, they fail completely. I have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide. Its appalling. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low. And I like bad movies!

{"value":"An okay film, with a fine leading lady, but a terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a truly bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the movie's saving grace. She's the best actor of the bunch.<br /><br />NOTE* the first comment, by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie (and, according to his IMDB.com account, has only written ONE review -- and guess for what movie?) is obviously a plant. While the movie is nicely shot, it's by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used.<br /><br />\"Art of Revenge\" is a fair movie, but it's a big tease. It offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it. Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the \"naughty bits\" edited out.<br /><br />The film, as a whole, is a bit unfocused and the ending, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. There's a twist ending, of course, since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending.<br /><br />A 4 out of 10.<br /><br

{"value":"I didn't really expect much from \"The Night Listener\" and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover in the videostore. However, the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension. On occasion it drags a little, but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly: when. As the movie progresses, the character played by Robin Williams gets dragged into some kind of \"cat and mouse\" spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no-one seemed to have ever seen in person. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real. However, in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had.

{"value":"This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I ever saw outside of Star Wars. Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan but I still can't bring myself to forgive this movie's existence.<br /><br />My sister has always been a huge Jane Austen fan and because of that, I have been subjected to various of the classics, Emma being one of them. I've always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible rendition, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming. Ewan McGregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid.<br /><br />My recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in English period drama... go see the originals. If you're a Ewan McGregor fan... believe me, by skipping this film, you haven't missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad

{"value":"After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I gotta be honest...I just didn't like it. I had read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,<br /><br />I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK) but they seemed like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying.<br /><br />It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't! <br /><br />Very frustrating...I only just scraped through this

{"value":"This is a horrid disaster of a film. From beginning to end, it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson's character at his peak or Streisand's character struggling. The first should be seen in decline and the second rising. The final Streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly. The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. Had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout. The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film, and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","horrid","disast","of","a","film","from","begin","to","end","it","fill","with","bad","act","and","even","wrong","direct","and","edit","the","onli","redeem","part","of","the","film","be","a","few","number","by","streisand","becaus","the","kristofferson","part","be","imposs","to","watch","or","listen","to","the","main","problem","of","thi","film","be","that","we","never","see","kristofferson","charact","at","hi","peak","or","streisand","charact","struggl","the","should","be","see","in","declin","and","the","rise","the","final","streisand","numb","can","have","be","on","of","the","great","final","in","film","if","it","be","direct","and","edit","properli","the","singl","frame","shoot","of","her","face","for","the","durat","of","the","song","be","a","terribl","mistak","have","the","band","audienc","and","wide","shot","of","the","stage","be","show","thi","numb","can","have","be","dynam","and","interest","thi","film","must","have","be","direct","and","edit","by","a","nyu","film","school","dropout","the","onli","thing","wrong","mai","be","the","wretch","screenplai","the","final","music","numb","be","the","onli","redeem","part","of","thi","film","and","even","that","be","botch","complet","by","misguid","technic","decis"],"filtered":["thi","horrid","disast","film","begin","end","fill","bad","act","even","wrong","direct","edit","onli","redeem","part","film","number","streisand","becaus","kristofferson","part","imposs","watch","listen","main","problem","thi","film","never","see","kristofferson","charact","hi","peak","streisand","charact","struggl","see","declin","rise","final","streisand","numb","great","final","film","direct","edit","properli","singl","frame","shoot","face","durat","song","terribl","mistak","band","audienc","wide","shot","stage","show","thi","numb","dynam","interest","thi","film","must","direct","edit","nyu","film","school","dropout","onli","thing","wrong","mai","wretch","screenplai","final","music","numb","onli","redeem","part","thi","film","even","botch","complet","misguid","technic","decis"],"filtered2":["horrid","disast","begin","end","fill","bad","act","even","wrong","direct","edit","onli","redeem","part","number","streisand","becaus","kristofferson","part","imposs","watch","listen","main","problem","never","see","kristofferson","charact","peak","streisand","charact","struggl","see","declin","rise","final","streisand","numb","great","final","direct","edit","properli","singl","frame","shoot","face","durat","song","terribl","mistak","band","audienc","wide","shot","stage","show","numb","dynam","interest","must","direct","edit","nyu","school","dropout","onli","thing","wrong","mai","wretch","screenplai","final","music","numb","onli","redeem","part","even","botch","complet","misguid","technic","decis"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,9,10,11,21,22,24,25,28,29,42,46,51,60,61,102,103,117,118,141,147,156,166,167,168,179,251,296,328,348,441,443,516,553,592,634,669,703,842,845,901,922,927,944,1034,1384,1401,1483,1582,1898,2079,2594,2658,2960,3175,3249,3341,3894,4869,5105],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,9,10,11,21,22,24,25,28,29,42,46,51,60,61,102,103,117,118,141,147,156,166,167,168,179,251,296,328,348,441,443,516,553,592,634,669,703,842,845,901,922,927,944,1034,1384,1401,1483,1582,1898,2079,2594,2658,2960,3175,3249,3341,3894,4869,5105],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,2.9739294460164585,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,5.645555114217758,6.2626611305318125,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,2.354379525480895,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,7.035465424245506,2.4423870329693536,2.4609576687888097,2.4894767118610357,2.507968722980095,2.6942272927333892,2.9504565686333644,3.1550424959247185,9.03095086967113,3.293679367864308,3.239158528985891,10.326298118947744,3.454678155189441,3.5227672760500357,7.0239710008934955,3.7099788181381825,3.6746621462132825,3.8883864756110005,3.831445099210862,3.8962296530720266,4.030886538218284,4.251780369798478,3.969732115064953,4.125296222689358,4.520909034354511,4.470719289830655,4.5432147918688095,4.621379564718146,4.848596441419991,4.944927550358424,5.243909178064138,19.167124447101422,5.521540914662417,5.541743621979936,5.541743621979936,5.626901430320244,5.7446844659766265,6.1754673820690815,13.589013180950609]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.4805078238101327E-4,1.4791958709799093E-4,1.4795610958669733E-4,1.4792636567597978E-4,1.4794036515182896E-4,1.4791877151401237E-4,1.4796477630555572E-4,1.47896
