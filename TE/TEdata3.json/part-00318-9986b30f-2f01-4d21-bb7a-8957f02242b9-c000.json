{"value":"Although this isn't a \"great film,\" there's something compelling and memorable about it. Like another commenter on the film, I saw this in childhood. It's been thirty three years since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. See it if you have the opportunity. You'll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades. More than any other film, this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century \"progress.\" It's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. Furthermore, it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time.","finished_norm":["although","thi","be","not","a","great","film","there","someth","compel","and","memor","about","it","like","anoth","comment","on","the","film","i","see","thi","in","childhood","it","be","thirti","three","year","sinc","but","i","have","never","forget","the","stori","or","it","ridicul","cumbersom","titl","see","it","if","you","have","the","opportun","you","will","feel","like","a","voyeur","of","small","town","life","a","it","evolv","through","the","decad","much","than","ani","other","film","thi","on","bring","a","human","face","to","the","histor","drama","of","earli","centuri","progress","it","engag","enough","for","a","young","viewer","and","memor","enough","for","a","old","on","furthermor","it","easi","to","like","the","charact","and","watch","their","passag","through","time"],"filtered":["although","thi","great","film","someth","compel","memor","like","anoth","comment","film","see","thi","childhood","thirti","three","year","sinc","never","forget","stori","ridicul","cumbersom","titl","see","opportun","feel","like","voyeur","small","town","life","evolv","decad","much","ani","film","thi","bring","human","face","histor","drama","earli","centuri","progress","engag","enough","young","viewer","memor","enough","old","furthermor","easi","like","charact","watch","passag","time"],"filtered2":["although","great","someth","compel","memor","like","anoth","comment","see","childhood","thirti","three","year","sinc","never","forget","stori","ridicul","cumbersom","titl","see","opportun","feel","like","voyeur","small","town","life","evolv","decad","ani","bring","human","face","histor","drama","earli","centuri","progress","engag","enough","young","viewer","memor","enough","old","furthermor","easi","like","charact","watch","passag","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,10,17,27,42,43,51,53,57,67,73,75,93,135,162,224,237,250,251,264,266,274,279,280,292,363,373,450,463,744,943,953,993,1074,1163,1196,1254,1502,1885,2066,2776,3889,4320,5839],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,10,17,27,42,43,51,53,57,67,73,75,93,135,162,224,237,250,251,264,266,274,279,280,292,363,373,450,463,744,943,953,993,1074,1163,1196,1254,1502,1885,2066,2776,3889,4320,5839],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.3002700588679295,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,4.070779654240196,2.366244071437088,2.3586007221245198,2.689504733779216,2.640097787510554,2.6812935439488212,2.6942272927333892,2.757740698455715,2.747702973022204,2.748952192422636,2.7910771187233068,2.8028805344481915,2.9752256367457734,3.0349689855553557,3.0316467233633775,3.469984576472117,3.3467891931782563,3.700222643192818,3.9911462095687695,4.1302590120314875,4.026392148630444,8.22110788190431,4.2860694432771105,4.291900363587903,4.34596758485818,4.566029469634981,4.85885294158718,4.956227105612356,5.3064295350454715,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.336266998523303E-5,8.280053601292128E-5,8.34442312260414E-5,8.296208956905617E-5,8.296344880948888E-5,8.284748248731811E-5,8.309388250824192E-5,8.281245874907224E-5,8.299865134506193E-5,9.208247294948837E-5,0.9289952343629503,8.267878118252085E-5,8.422193963312693E-5,8.542338410858802E-5,8.273906968726238E-5,8.251041459719401E-5,8.456853367726101E-5,8.310166777781402E-5,8.284384517726045E-5,8.291250799552753E-5,8.371473513954793E-5,0.06449056640966846,8.327871810603031E-5,8.336844158432236E-5,8.400825154320398E-5,8.35689120377658E-5,8.708199034223491E-5,8.270336082608766E-5,8.27055733346709E-5,8.291510743701297E-5,8.467744863494995E-5,8.30968527457933E-5,8.919743214520086E-5,8.333059193024793E-5,8.279337971507905E-5,8.317552574042197E-5,8.271041867961311E-5,8.275929445165956E-5,8.251000005819983E-5,8.25314069588799E-5,8.271717512565465E-5,8.35896660505979E-5,8.31649118303729E-5,8.28361010168342E-5,8.384264650314513E-5,8.286789396506023E-5,8.562118257561104E-5,8.436209812869362E-5,8.255192052533158E-5,8.273436531808898E-5,8.270566992316534E-5,8.503331836890655E-5,8.273559624771887E-5,8.252408005587512E-5,8.342989993554559E-5,8.275690674097663E-5,8.899595798061393E-5,8.26887042965993E-5,8.255096585972923E-5,8.294512249300143E-5,8.376786839776568E-5,8.293963520134885E-5,8.253569374649224E-5,8.27278654684363E-5,8.251099803125614E-5,8.44201315058695E-5,8.322179154693334E-5,8.304451694619582E-5,8.297189076288982E-5,8.327433649385125E-5,8.250798789918974E-5,8.297363022971188E-5,8.431940743044109E-5,8.26558467964866E-5,8.470153593827161E-5,8.287438045801242E-5,8.352299691527641E-5,8.301254110115184E-5,8.248211921493187E-5,8.258436

{"value":"This Book-based movie is truly awful, and a big disappointment. We've been waiting for this move over a month. Many film reviewer were hopeful for it. Also in newspapers and TV, it made big sense. When 29th April comes, many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful. Why? First of all story was so monotone. It has been many indefinite scenes, sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on. The actresses, out of Hulya Avsar, weren't harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She acts better in comedy films, In this movie, a kind of drama, she couldn't disposed of her previous role. And finally Movie is too short, just 66 minutes.","finished_norm":["thi","bookbas","movi","be","truli","aw","and","a","big","disappoint","we","have","be","wait","for","thi","move","over","a","month","mani","film","review","be","hope","for","it","conjur","in","newspap","and","tv","it","make","big","sens","when","th","april","come","mani","peopl","regretfulli","notic","that","movi","be","realli","aw","why","of","all","stori","be","so","monoton","it","have","be","mani","indefinit","scene","sometim","it","hard","to","realiz","what","go","on","the","actress","out","of","hulya","avsar","be","not","harmon","with","their","role","especi","vildan","atasev","she","act","well","in","comedi","film","in","thi","movi","a","kind","of","drama","she","can","not","dispos","of","her","previou","role","and","final","movi","be","too","short","just","minut"],"filtered":["thi","bookbas","movi","truli","aw","big","disappoint","wait","thi","move","month","mani","film","review","hope","conjur","newspap","tv","make","big","sens","th","april","come","mani","peopl","regretfulli","notic","movi","realli","aw","stori","monoton","mani","indefinit","scene","sometim","hard","realiz","go","actress","hulya","avsar","harmon","role","especi","vildan","atasev","act","well","comedi","film","thi","movi","kind","drama","dispos","previou","role","final","movi","short","minut"],"filtered2":["bookbas","truli","aw","big","disappoint","wait","move","month","mani","review","hope","conjur","newspap","tv","make","big","sens","th","april","come","mani","peopl","regretfulli","notic","realli","aw","stori","monoton","mani","indefinit","scene","sometim","hard","realiz","go","actress","hulya","avsar","harmon","role","especi","vildan","atasev","act","well","comedi","kind","drama","dispos","previou","role","final","short","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,13,17,19,20,21,23,34,39,50,59,82,122,127,128,138,156,171,172,173,176,181,187,267,272,275,331,343,354,405,463,500,688,784,853,1231,2626,2821,3116,5608,5929],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,13,17,19,20,21,23,34,39,50,59,82,122,127,128,138,156,171,172,173,176,181,187,267,272,275,331,343,354,405,463,500,688,784,853,1231,2626,2821,3116,5608,5929],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,5.153983156711065,1.8693254449200722,4.040393168790646,2.2489347673732487,2.4359679371086367,4.681980408231769,4.581473037857885,2.3451551414151686,2.373087554090762,2.5001408943598484,2.4368824319140248,2.5040471493269134,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,2.7085302779237206,2.8028805344481915,2.7832848715031413,2.932274249550174,2.9705344631698933,3.0316467233633775,3.109204957709252,3.3467891931782563,3.3814747511661465,3.6016814428070463,3.7636829971100436,3.8962296530720266,4.327618446189983,5.3064295350454715,5.390512652256013,5.482320201509136,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.741431820466124E-5,9.675743068339872E-5,9.75096274439968E-5,9.694621577782054E-5,9.69478041324168E-5,9.681229047611275E-5,9.710022379264592E-5,9.677136312118514E-5,9.698894042282752E-5,1.0760393498147979E-4,0.31295889473373795,9.661515280537867E-5,9.841842672131949E-5,9.982238720457334E-5,9.668560356692477E-5,9.641840627457579E-5,9.882344280956497E-5,9.710932135067206E-5,9.680804005947627E-5,9.688827671250915E-5,9.782572761581949E-5,9.720553211485812E-5,9.731621535987494E-5,9.742106266702477E-5,9.816871927322567E-5,9.765532450803623E-5,1.0176056883250505E-4,9.664387560444689E-5,9.664646105444742E-5,9.68913143169916E-5,0.6794306149440892,9.710369469474183E-5,1.0423259043370943E-4,9.737683305865694E-5,9.67490681168531E-5,9.719562884385472E-5,9.665212313285848E-5,9.670923742648026E-5,9.641792186070692E-5,9.644293711795566E-5,9.666001844840846E-5,9.767957682637497E-5,9.718322584847204E-5,9.679899053997164E-5,9.797519977497247E-5,9.68361425214965E-5,1.0005352666796132E-4,9.85822103943789E-5,9.646690846016665E-5,9.668010622721995E-5,9.664657392394084E-5,9.936657181271032E-5,9.668154464288818E-5,9.643437518896649E-5,9.749288046488865E-5,9.670644724223726E-5,1.0399715569556385E-4,9.662674856391893E-5,9.646579287571161E-5,9.692638872398346E-5,9.788781703934913E-5,9.691997649204294E-5,9.644794648836833E-5,9.667251076005868E-5,9.641908805253935E-5,9.865002590306755E-5,9.724969323500597E-5,9.704253714980731E-5,9.695766906518604E-5,9.731109518122501E-5,9.641557053129146E-5,9.695970173729865E-5,9.85323237333028E-5,9.658835258917441E-5,9.897886399003246E-5,9.684372238054599E-5,9.760166991235953E-5,9.700517144229662E-5,9.638534141026789E-5,9.650481766074725E-5]}}
{"value":"I really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time. There is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers. This is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world. From the notes, I can see that it's been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision.

{"value":"This very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget. Dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid, chase scenes are uniformly boring, and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five minutes (a briefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film's chief villain--no prop is here without a purpose). The whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera--but without the discipline Corman would impose.","finished_norm":["thi","veri","low","budget","comedi","caper","movi","succ","onli","in","be","low","budget","dialog","be","dumbfoundingli","stupid","chase","scene","be","uniformli","bore","and","much","of","the","onscreen","monei","seem","to","have","be","save","for","a","seri","of","crash","and","explos","in","a","park","lot","dure","the","film","last","five","minut","a","briefli","glimps","portapotti","earli","in","that","scene","be","certain","to","wreck","and","spew","crap","on","the","film","chief","villainno","prop","be","here","without","a","purpos","the","whole","film","be","depressingli","reminisc","of","that","that","occasion","come","out","of","rodger","corman","studio","when","he","have","give","a","time","director","a","few","buck","and","a","camerabut","without","the","disciplin","corman","would","impos"],"filtered":["thi","veri","low","budget","comedi","caper","movi","succ","onli","low","budget","dialog","dumbfoundingli","stupid","chase","scene","uniformli","bore","much","onscreen","monei","seem","save","seri","crash","explos","park","lot","dure","film","last","five","minut","briefli","glimps","portapotti","earli","scene","certain","wreck","spew","crap","film","chief","villainno","prop","without","purpos","whole","film","depressingli","reminisc","occasion","come","rodger","corman","studio","give","time","director","buck","camerabut","without","disciplin","corman","impos"],"filtered2":["veri","low","budget","comedi","caper","succ","onli","low","budget","dialog","dumbfoundingli","stupid","chase","scene","uniformli","bore","onscreen","monei","seem","save","crash","explos","park","lot","dure","last","five","minut","briefli","glimps","portapotti","earli","scene","certain","wreck","spew","crap","chief","villainno","prop","without","purpos","whole","depressingli","reminisc","occasion","come","rodger","corman","studio","give","time","director","buck","camerabut","without","disciplin","corman","impos"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,11,15,19,30,34,35,58,59,72,108,111,125,126,127,136,144,189,217,239,256,266,313,432,505,530,774,794,932,935,1099,1139,1183,1407,1616,1886,2055,2094,2405,2436,2728,3208,3925,4107,4906,5227,5455,5710,8265],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,11,15,19,30,34,35,58,59,72,108,111,125,126,127,136,144,189,217,239,256,266,313,432,505,530,774,794,932,935,1099,1139,1183,1407,1616,1886,2055,2094,2405,2436,2728,3208,3925,4107,4906,5227,5455,5710,8265],"values":[0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.9209463754160525,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,4.448447326975307,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.346825985579986,2.2931108769894046,2.498193474075453,5.222733058940145,2.6593400337329487,5.497904384845272,2.747702973022204,2.907069060519773,3.235085203598255,3.3956930001684253,3.5784919978881358,3.753391311073496,3.7465885637507435,4.058285512406398,4.135246553542527,4.135246553542527,4.186539847930077,4.315570107673808,4.443131333311827,4.688631791727313,4.848596441419991,4.933754249760298,5.129498826886393,5.0768550934009715,5.102830579804232,5.290429193699031,5.521540914662417,12.202718819830718,5.822646007446338,6.137727054086234,6.1754673820690815,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.511266779346423E-5,6.46735978524338E-5,6.517637340628253E-5,6.479978362639386E-5,6.480084529789216E-5,6.471026666584892E-5,6.490272406566057E-5,6.468291042793461E-5,6.482834119029415E-5,7.192350571092294E-5,0.57649721717811,6.457849794949742E-5,6.578382358943662E-5,6.672224428801606E-5,6.462558791652578E-5,6.444699067484022E-5,6.605454024065344E-5,6.490880496099922E-5,6.470742564646353E-5,6.476105659754006E-5,6.538765780324464E-5,0.03384308817889327,6.504709490787728E-5,6.511717585701602E-5,6.561691672797167E-5,0.0814419263775435,6.801774354098804E-5,6.45976965448199E-5,6.459942468448236E-5,6.476308696160974E-5,6.6139611213776E-5,6.490504405002509E-5,6.967006656971696E-5,6.508761236112173E-5,6.466800823247423E-5,6.496649372005704E-5,6.460320927218358E-5,6.464138501570251E-5,6.44466668879483E-5,6.446338732663765E-5,6.46084865770809E-5,6.528996920903961E-5,6.495820343857809E-5,6.470137686053497E-5,6.548756643292731E-5,6.472620960253307E-5,6.687674012980722E-5,6.58932981727469E-5,6.447941000246924E-5,6.462191344176123E-5,6.459950012753801E-5,6.641757289337395E-5,6.462287489263705E-5,6.445766445090216E-5,6.516517956427541E-5,6.463952002970204E-5,6.951269972494053E-5,6.458624866610212E-5,6.447866433508322E-5,6.478653103279562E-5,6.542915897147414E-5,6.478224503525591E-5,6.446673563803115E-5,6.461683655841264E-5,6.444744638179242E-5,6.593862671140393E-5,6.500263087941272

Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember I watched this just to kill time. It didn't really interest me. I just remember thinking, \"Who put Shaq in this movie???\" The whole story seemed stupid too. It made no sense whatsoever. I guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about.

{"value":"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, everything about it is weak and incoherent. The acting is absurd, the costumes even crummier and the story is non-existent. This 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that \"Beastmaster\" and \"Conan\" enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along. The lead character is tepid and dull, he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th Century. All the action sequences are like that, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse. Don't even bother with this crap.","finished_norm":["thi","be","probabl","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","everyth","about","it","be","weak","and","incoher","the","act","be","absurd","the","costum","even","crummi","and","the","stori","be","nonexist","thi","poverti","row","sword","and","adventur","film","be","mean","to","captur","some","of","the","success","that","beastmast","and","conan","enjoi","but","it","doe","not","give","u","ani","reason","to","follow","along","the","lead","charact","be","tepid","and","dull","he","ca","not","even","fight","with","a","sword","and","the","sword","be","from","the","th","centuri","all","the","action","sequenc","be","like","that","slow","and","unrealist","not","to","mention","the","castl","and","the","horribli","date","music","plai","whenev","thei","be","ride","a","hors","do","not","even","bother","with","thi","crap"],"filtered":["thi","probabl","wrong","movi","ever","see","everyth","weak","incoher","act","absurd","costum","even","crummi","stori","nonexist","thi","poverti","row","sword","adventur","film","mean","captur","success","beastmast","conan","enjoi","doe","give","u","ani","reason","follow","along","lead","charact","tepid","dull","ca","even","fight","sword","sword","th","centuri","action","sequenc","like","slow","unrealist","mention","castl","horribli","date","music","plai","whenev","thei","ride","hors","even","bother","thi","crap"],"filtered2":["probabl","wrong","ever","see","everyth","weak","incoher","act","absurd","costum","even","crummi","stori","nonexist","poverti","row","sword","adventur","mean","captur","success","beastmast","conan","enjoi","doe","give","u","ani","reason","follow","along","lead","charact","tepid","dull","ca","even","fight","sword","sword","th","centuri","action","sequenc","like","slow","unrealist","mention","castl","horribli","date","music","plai","whenev","ride","hors","even","bother","crap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,10,17,18,21,25,27,30,40,44,81,88,95,112,118,129,148,157,193,200,232,260,285,313,324,349,367,379,390,496,532,647,776,853,924,928,1002,1076,1126,1163,1264,1277,1484,1498,1537,1941,1960,2602,3309,5030,5435,5875],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,10,17,18,21,25,27,30,40,44,81,88,95,112,118,129,148,157,193,200,232,260,285,313,324,349,367,379,390,496,532,647,776,853,924,928,1002,1076,1126,1163,1264,1277,1484,1498,1537,1941,1960,2602,3309,5030,5435,5875],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.7780513171783934,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.354379525480895,2.4106958340079214,2.3018654096236517,2.3360150694757706,2.517840471459249,2.5308211829319704,2.8377834061292515,2.6754694156628323,2.808171552082607,2.907069060519773,2.8753661172782943,3.0568369721919364,3.0791938792932125,3.1272886331425473,3.132778125427319,3.293679367864308,3.4446025032006995,3.6746621462132825,3.770603439954617,3.8962296530720266,3.969732115064953,4.017463517886143,4.072271754381138,4.202455303235976,4.456830177669989,4.2860694432771105,4.327618446189983,4.297765483040301,4.484804029712395,4.506310234933358,4.550761997504193,15.230565280202914,5.2288713006995975,5.259176650194926,5.626901430320244,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.805121290016137E-5,6.759232766250073E-5,6.81177935574704E-5,6.772420822061218E-5,6.772531780551493E-5,6.76306513453273E-5,6.783179437835949E-5,6.760206051602263E-5,6.775405459193662E-5,7.516942502164349E-5,0.3602215612292126,6.749293588574176E-5,6.875265806449971E-5,6.973342983922584E-5,6.75421510305101E-5,6.735549366675599E-5,6.903559220146383E-5,6.783814970547688E-5,6.762768211028286E-5,6.768373343475514E-5,6.833861325304421E-5,6.79053601455598E-5,6.798268069976515E-5,6.805592441334195E-5,6.857821866969445E-5,6.821957389229803E-5,7.108739518058826E-5,6.751300091674032E-5,6.751480704762201E-5,6.768585542947987E-5,6.912450244120321E-5,6.783421906398925E-5,0.44837502294499076,6.802502671215179E-5,6.75864857820988E-5,6.789844196745334E-5,6.751876243437121E-5,6.755866105529809E-5,6.735515526730988E-5,6.737263030207028E-5,6.75242779048822E-5,6.823651595696581E-5,6.788977754424592E-5,6.762136034167837E-5,6.844303077515626E-5,6.764731378929271E-5,6.989489810305536E-5,6.886707325325585E-5,6.738937608382359E-5,6.753831072611203E-5,6.751488589543483E-5,6.941500857583751E-5,6.753931556741957E-5,6.736664915203796E-5,6.810609453558402E-5,6.755671190218126E-5,0.11084696509638924,6.75010363934259E-5,6.738859676434924E-5,6.771035753534623E-5,6.838198737563044E-5,6.770587811005238E-5,6.737612972329225E-5,6.

{"value":"The cast is OK. The script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. Its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. The shower part...huh? What was that about? Literally, it is I have a client, \"Ok you can use our shower.\" Yawn. The angles are trying way to hard. There was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying. In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring

{"value":"What an awful show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that should have never been

{"value":"If you want to see a retarded homosexual Karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe Mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr, then this is the film for you. if not then choose another DVD from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs. the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end. The cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap, b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g's and a key, bloody streetz and menace.

{"value":"This movie was strange... I watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. Im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high, but mushrooms weren't enough. I couldn't stop laughing.. maybe lsd would work. The movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things, and dancing. Its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit, pop it on you'll get a few laughs.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","strang","i","watch","it","while","ingest","a","quarter","of","psilcyb","cubensi","mushroom","it","be","realli","weird","im","pretti","sure","you","be","suppos","to","watch","it","high","but","mushroom","be","not","enough","i","can","not","stop","laugh","mayb","lsd","would","work","the","movi","be","a","bunch","of","thing","morph","into","other","thing","and","danc","it","realli","cheesi","for","todai","standard","but","when","it","be","releas","im","sure","it","be","good","on","of","a","kind","i","can","see","how","some","peopl","would","think","thi","movi","be","good","but","i","do","not","think","it","be","veri","interest","and","i","be","on","mushroom","at","the","time","if","your","have","a","parti","or","someth","and","everybodi","pretti","light","pop","it","on","you","will","get","a","few","laugh"],"filtered":["thi","movi","strang","watch","ingest","quarter","psilcyb","cubensi","mushroom","realli","weird","im","pretti","sure","suppos","watch","high","mushroom","enough","stop","laugh","mayb","lsd","work","movi","bunch","thing","morph","thing","danc","realli","cheesi","todai","standard","releas","im","sure","good","kind","see","peopl","think","thi","movi","good","think","veri","interest","mushroom","time","parti","someth","everybodi","pretti","light","pop","get","laugh"],"filtered2":["strang","watch","ingest","quarter","psilcyb","cubensi","mushroom","realli","weird","im","pretti","sure","suppos","watch","high","mushroom","enough","stop","laugh","mayb","lsd","work","bunch","thing","morph","thing","danc","realli","cheesi","todai","standard","releas","im","sure","good","kind","see","peopl","think","good","think","veri","interest","mushroom","time","parti","someth","everybodi","pretti","light","pop","get","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,8,12,13,15,23,29,48,53,60,78,93,119,122,133,149,163,211,315,327,353,417,419,492,543,616,625,789,850,952,1215,2348,3323,4631,6366,7664],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,8,12,13,15,23,29,48,53,60,78,93,119,122,133,149,163,211,315,327,353,417,419,492,543,616,625,789,850,952,1215,2348,3323,4631,6366,7664],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,2.6390769554676132,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,4.012839573363895,2.035389827120098,4.3306817978619945,2.2489347673732487,4.642472950759303,2.3253197803590226,2.4000574358028657,2.5687161421197025,2.854312708080462,2.9674191958529437,3.0266839340212486,3.1932880749197934,3.1758963322079246,3.6016814428070463,3.477726550625732,3.5173618574831282,3.6194333882654965,3.8059428063999263,3.9241755834625858,3.9868265484242533,4.291900363587903,10.518353300389853,5.583416318380505,6.101359409915359,20.605843687887077,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.754144422806293E-5,8.695113180411412E-5,8.76270939417137E-5,8.712078365939578E-5,8.712221103534898E-5,8.700043159466594E-5,8.725918306811705E-5,8.69636521989382E-5,8.715917819109268E-5,9.669835037094771E-5,0.546138471354311,8.682327369092166E-5,8.844378703895532E-5,8.970545709535254E-5,8.688658431636539E-5,8.664646728534624E-5,8.88077550259418E-5,8.726735859491059E-5,8.699661195482464E-5,8.706871667840097E-5,8.791115757909356E-5,8.73538184644899E-5,8.745328403894749E-5,0.13642867685296928,8.821938726853646E-5,8.775802470878022E-5,0.2040730902993045,8.684908545411053E-5,8.685140887053633E-5,8.707144642376375E-5,8.892212963385464E-5,0.10669792400053058,9.366868926857474E-5,8.750775817575773E-5,8.694361677792138E-5,8.734491888317376E-5,8.68564971012048E-5,8.6907822900552E-5,8.664603196648894E-5,8.666851194466516E-5,8.686359223196812E-5,8.777981907137886E-5,8.733377292282045E-5,8.698847959788157E-5,8.804548083798706E-5,8.702186625169758E-5,8.991317073351168E-5,8.859097134968956E-5,8.669005380787284E-5,8.688164412824888E-5,8.685151030078443E-5,8.929583827914078E-5,8.688293676148102E-5,8.666081776127504E-5,8.761204425739003E-5,8.6905315499558E-5,9.345711567855282E-5,8.683369422732988E-5,8.668905128713307E-5,8.710296606379306E-5,8.796695428236314E-5,8.709720370713805E-5,8.66730136188408E-5,8.687481845644684E-5,8.664707996558333E-5,8.865191380333576E-5,8.73935038855627E-5,8.720734292675147E-5,8.713107616398456E-5,8.744868278687303E-5,8.664391894268835E-5,8.713290282618021E-5,8.854614066731347E-5,8.679918965814922E-5,8.894742437694182E-5,8.70286778972592E-5,8.770980796937707E-5,8.717376420793093E-5,8.661675352223559E-5,8.672412093711543E-5]}}
{"value":"It has very bad acting. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this show If you see it on. TURN IT OFF. Or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes. It should have never been aired. It's not great. You should never see it. NEVER EVER EVER. So now, if you ever wanna watch this show, please don't. Turn to the THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, Those are much better family shows. So believe me on this, I've watched it before. and It is honestly, and I say Honestly, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV.

{"value":"HORRENDOUS! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by day care students...wait, I have seen programs better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that is it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the roaring of the camera motors. YIKES! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people.

{"value":"Guys who-ever even THINKS about watching this movie has already got some disturbance going through their heads.. This movie has NOTHING to do with Jack the Ripper (incase you thought) its another B, i mean E-Grade movie comprised of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes being watched just before they get their spleens splattered on a nearby tree. Its not scary, funny or amusing. If you really feel like gory stuff with no plot, then watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep midway through directing this crap.only watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life & the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV

{"value":"this is just a terrible 'comedy' -- it really is a bad film. there are no funny elements. no jokes that are funny. i don't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be 'smartest' or 'quality.' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers. but, i have seen thousands of better films: namely leonard part six (now, that's funny)! i don't know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database: its more like a home video than an actual film.<br /><br />jokes aside, just skip this

{"value":"I am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out. We personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to stick with it. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all. :(<br /><br />That said, it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers. That's the beauty of the subjective art form of film. :)","finished_norm":["i","be","veri","surpris","by","the","posit","comment","becaus","there","be","four","of","u","that","see","thi","at","on","screen","and","we","all","walk","out","we","person","feel","that","it","be","painfulli","slow","to","watch","and","can","not","sit","through","the","whole","movi","and","we","realli","try","to","stick","with","it","in","particular","that","in","the","group","who","realli","want","to","like","it","becaus","of","their","person","experi","with","sexual","orient","alien","in","the","school","year","depict","do","not","like","or","identifi","with","it","at","all","br","br","that","sai","it","be","great","to","see","that","thi","film","realli","reson","with","a","lot","of","peopl","here","on","the","board","and","with","review","that","the","beauti","of","the","subject","art","form","of","film"],"filtered":["veri","surpris","posit","comment","becaus","four","u","see","thi","screen","walk","person","feel","painfulli","slow","watch","sit","whole","movi","realli","try","stick","particular","group","realli","want","like","becaus","person","experi","sexual","orient","alien","school","year","depict","like","identifi","br","br","sai","great","see","thi","film","realli","reson","lot","peopl","board","review","beauti","subject","art","form","film"],"filtered2":["veri","surpris","posit","comment","becaus","four","u","see","screen","walk","person","feel","painfulli","slow","watch","sit","whole","realli","try","stick","particular","group","realli","want","like","becaus","person","experi","sexual","orient","alien","school","year","depict","like","identifi","great","see","realli","reson","lot","peopl","board","review","beauti","subject","art","form"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,13,15,22,23,36,37,43,51,57,72,111,112,153,176,192,244,280,294,296,325,326,333,382,390,410,416,509,519,550,565,606,690,832,1011,1240,1333,2451,3519,6032],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,13,15,22,23,36,37,43,51,57,72,111,112,153,176,192,244,280,294,296,325,326,333,382,390,410,416,509,519,550,565,606,690,832,1011,1240,1333,2451,3519,6032],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,3.3953824709201923,1.2000607798565692,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.9209463754160525,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,4.681980408231769,2.5040471493269134,2.5318267134339894,2.634508058031767,2.8028805344481915,2.886778509330039,2.9504565686333644,2.973659465713028,2.942840385588056,2.948928684455311,3.235085203598255,3.132778125427319,3.2070272508030975,3.1401446412440817,3.360519385990158,3.5614461306151473,3.4751392270607813,3.9081109809587793,3.584239140143704,3.607563812710113,3.7987743169213135,4.086456389373095,4.3095999406873045,4.436351646326448,5.143104478942172,5.695894301807195,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.848824228060976E-5,9.782411303824015E-5,9.858460223701308E-5,9.801497935503068E-5,9.801658522011487E-5,9.787957762143347E-5,9.81706851994776E-5,9.783819907131575E-5,9.805817500908185E-5,1.087901923877127E-4,0.9922055678173343,9.768026664707444E-5,9.950342038468366E-5,1.009228585409576E-4,9.775149407852274E-5,9.748135112468816E-5,9.991290148932847E-5,9.817988305165739E-5,9.787528034695472E-5,9.795640155243382E-5,9.890418719003825E-5,9.827715447158614E-5,9.83890579212281E-5,9.84950610959087E-5,9.925096008828794E-5,9.873190550830983E-5,1.0288240725282685E-4,9.770930609472179E-5,9.771192004748305E-5,9.795947264436091E-5,1.0004157830285606E-4,9.817419436581839E-5,1.0538168114674061E-4,9.845034388733825E-5,9.781565828030301E-5,9.826714202401244E-5,9.771764454631072E-5,9.777538848469245E-5,9.748086137049842E-5,9.750615240329556E-5,9.772562690213992E-5,9.875642519133418E-5,9.825460229436316E-5,9.786613106288722E-5,9.905530717420665E-5,9.790369261877614E-5,1.0115654615372658E-4,9.966900965709425E-5,9.753038801262875E-5,9.774593613452922E-5,9.771203416128295E-5,1.0046201810624123E-4,9.774739040771458E-5,9.749749608508469E-5,9.856767063428496E-5,9.777256754063825E-5,1.0514365090684263E-4,9.769199024066507E-5,9.752926012964278E-5,9.799493372192452E-5,9.896696110562224E-5,9.798845079965441E-5,9.751121699848003E-5,9.773825693270552E-5,9.748204041877239E-5,9.973757278388305E-5,9.832180243690236E-5,9.811236260213306E-5,9.802655890680246E-5,9.838388129622379E-5,9.747848411933637E-5,9.802861398768988E-5,9.961857303080375E-5,9.765317097740961E-5,1.0007003607857091E-4,9.791135604041966E-5,9.867765940860021E-5,9.807458496408022E-5,9.744792174359767E-5,9.756871513537884E-5]}}

{"value":"Leslie Sands' stilted play \"Deadlock\" becomes a poor-choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their joint-success in \"All About Eve\". After killing her spouse, a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors from her peak years, is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale (where she thankfully pulls out all the stops). Production and supporting cast strictly second-rate; only for Bette Davis completists. *1/2 from

Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese Water Torture, in the form of endless music montages, shoddy acting, and poor directing choices (Seriously, Mr. Condon, did you HAVE to do the old Billboard countdown shots?

{"value":"Revenge on us the viewing public perhaps. I sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title. But Costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends. I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film. I had a choice of seeing this or Black Rain at the cinema thankfully i saw The other brothers movie at the cinema instead.i caught up with this turkey on video. there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune.

{"value":"First off, I had my doubts just looking at the DVD box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something. Any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably, even as a slasher movie, except for the first Friday the 13th.<br /><br />I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just kept thinking that it had to get a little better. It didn't. Usually, I think every movie has something that you can take from it. This has nothing.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes.

{"value":"I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and would think, what an amazing movie this would make. Sadly enough that screenwriter failed, changing characters, throwing in lame humor, and all out destroying the plot. I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie.

The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson. Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously,the worst thing I've ever seen. I wasn't entertained, it wasn't funny,I wasn't even bored! I wasn't anything. It wasn't even so bad it was good, it's just bad. Ridiculous actually. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Don't even rent this movie.

he?).","finished_norm":["you","have","to","figur","that","when","the","star","name","be","list","wrong","in","the","open","credit","you","be","not","in","for","a","good","time","the","credit","read","cuba","good","jr","some","nice","car","chase","shoot","em","up","blow","em","up","action","if","all","you","want","be","action","becaus","the","relationship","to","what","plot","exist","be","tenuou","at","well","and","complet","unbeliev","the","motiv","of","the","charact","especi","that","of","good","at","the","end","be","wrong","then","unbeliev","thei","be","irrat","when","thei","be","not","hopelessli","muddl","all","i","can","think","be","that","andi","cheng","must","be","a","realli","nice","gui","to","get","thi","mani","good","actor","into","thi","foul","a","project","he","ca","not","have","someth","on","all","of","them","can","he"],"filtered":["figur","star","name","list","wrong","open","credit","good","time","credit","read","cuba","good","jr","nice","car","chase","shoot","em","blow","em","action","want","action","becaus","relationship","plot","exist","tenuou","well","complet","unbeliev","motiv","charact","especi","good","end","wrong","unbeliev","thei","irrat","thei","hopelessli","muddl","think","andi","cheng","must","realli","nice","gui","get","thi","mani","good","actor","thi","foul","project","ca","someth"],"filtered2":["figur","star","name","list","wrong","open","credit","good","time","credit","read","cuba","good","jr","nice","car","chase","shoot","em","blow","em","action","want","action","becaus","relationship","plot","exist","tenuou","well","complet","unbeliev","motiv","charact","especi","good","end","wrong","unbeliev","irrat","hopelessli","muddl","think","andi","cheng","must","realli","nice","gui","get","mani","good","actor","foul","project","ca","someth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,10,12,13,20,22,24,25,32,37,41,50,53,55,81,100,103,117,129,141,143,145,242,262,267,284,356,415,528,530,571,577,602,660,754,902,1648,1845,2530,2867,3006,3332,3719,6671],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,10,12,13,20,22,24,25,32,37,41,50,53,55,81,100,103,117,129,141,143,145,242,262,267,284,356,415,528,530,571,577,602,660,754,902,1648,1845,2530,2867,3006,3332,3719,6671],"values":[2.714457859969082,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,1.949757232424728,2.1405462403177813,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,4.821391668015843,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.34599021453259,2.689504733779216,5.453403166975632,2.7085302779237206,3.110998680163279,6.056670924119444,3.1588018988486244,3.4198487640477615,3.5784919978881358,6.934834361933742,3.604618302480356,3.555828138310924,3.6405503117064195,3.7465885637507435,3.9201351739255808,4.933754249760298,4.9227044135737135,5.156897801074508,10.816424458710827,5.408212229355414,5.695894301807195,6.101359409915359,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.0662851930417548,8.160837915614583E-5,8.224280648648467E-5,8.17676066744438E-5,8.176894634461912E-5,8.165464969818704E-5,8.189750206726464E-5,8.16201302294992E-5,8.180364203632158E-5,9.075667535442882E-5,0.822553613449819,8.148837734405779E-5,8.300931749733673E-5,8.419346365157401E-5,8.15477978187385E-5,8.132243489012931E-5,8.335092130244427E-5,8.190517524502007E-5,8.165106475788849E-5,8.171873897326067E-5,8.250941570183101E-5,8.198632254778682E-5,8.207967641385961E-5,8.21681080592118E-5,8.279870607495582E-5,8.236569215180347E-5,8.582818937804853E-5,8.151260309147821E-5,8.151478374450344E-5,8.172130098815275E-5,8.345826810949232E-5,8.190042953952446E-5,8.791317318434014E-5,8.213080336205195E-5,8.160132589422525E-5,8.197796980537497E-5,8.151955932647701E-5,8.156773138826287E-5,8.132202631964123E-5,8.134312500512539E-5,8.152621849363771E-5,8.238614734967742E-5,8.196750871372843E-5,8.164343209739202E-5,8.263548540574199E-5,8.167476729276947E-5,8.438841422883598E-5,8.314745799978925E-5,8.136334321855064E-5,8.154316118277356E-5,8.151487894232286E-5,8.380901405362962E-5,8.154437438955684E-5,8.133590359440456E-5,8.222868153699887E-5,8.156537805568666E-5,8.771459983197426E-5,8.149815758577021E-5,8.136240229816299E-5,8.175088388927209E-5,8.256178395077277E-5,8.17454756032961E-5,8.134735007184206E-5,8.153675491754322E-5,8.132300992394489E-5,0.10482416606046822,8.202356947974369E-5,8.184884726744443E-5,8.177726675131135E-5,8.207535788785431E-5,8.132004313156872E-5,8.177898117340063E-5,8.31053819594978E-5,8.146577316585653E-5,8.348200860535114E-5,8.168116039360826E-5,8.232043811233046E-5,8.18173318085858E-5,8.129454690298323E-5,8.139531707722627E-5]}}
{"value":"I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me and I don't blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.","finished_norm":["i","want","to","like","magnolia","the","plot","remind","me","of","grand","canyon","which","i","like","differ","livesstori","that","come","togeth","at","the","end","but","magnolia","take","a","wrong","turn","halfwai","through","the","movi","and","i","be","lose","i","almost","turn","it","off","right","then","and","there","but","i","feel","i","should","hang","in","there","until","the","end","littl","do","i","know","it","would","be","anoth","tortur","hour","thank","god","i","rent","instead","of","see","it","in","the","theatr","i","almost","scream","out","in","frustrat","after","hour","the","big","kick","in","the","pant","be","the","end","frog","scene","my","dvd","player","still","have","not","forgiv","me","and","i","do","not","blame","it","on","bite","it","be","a","uniqu","movi","but","a","bad","bore","and","pointless","movi"],"filtered":["want","like","magnolia","plot","remind","grand","canyon","like","differ","livesstori","come","togeth","end","magnolia","take","wrong","turn","halfwai","movi","lose","almost","turn","right","feel","hang","end","littl","know","anoth","tortur","hour","thank","god","rent","instead","see","theatr","almost","scream","frustrat","hour","big","kick","pant","end","frog","scene","dvd","player","still","forgiv","blame","bite","uniqu","movi","bad","bore","pointless","movi"],"filtered2":["want","like","magnolia","plot","remind","grand","canyon","like","differ","livesstori","come","togeth","end","magnolia","take","wrong","turn","halfwai","lose","almost","turn","right","feel","hang","end","littl","know","anoth","tortur","hour","thank","god","rent","instead","see","theatr","almost","scream","frustrat","hour","big","kick","pant","end","frog","scene","dvd","player","still","forgiv","blame","bite","uniqu","bad","bore","pointless"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,14,19,24,25,26,31,32,34,37,43,64,73,82,96,108,121,131,152,154,174,204,221,247,270,352,526,534,644,651,661,802,848,869,898,999,1118,1301,1310,1365,1396,1744,3076,4375,4748,6941],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,14,19,24,25,26,31,32,34,37,43,64,73,82,96,108,121,131,152,154,174,204,221,247,270,352,526,534,644,651,661,802,848,869,898,999,1118,1301,1310,1365,1396,1744,3076,4375,4748,6941],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,3.9631084698357775,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,2.020196584395323,4.078141625743051,2.138507503627933,2.2190595059394194,4.502423616410601,2.3131195476980753,2.348499626138016,4.912565156919632,2.624524614047584,2.6423424573643777,2.7303758068497004,2.731603554088023,3.1236456418640466,3.5119855004467477,3.4272107604888307,3.5670958631572662,3.5474598886404074,3.5727776966246974,3.8883864756110005,3.827761853794566,3.9161110236258554,3.892300374932137,4.1302590120314875,4.34596758485818,4.3773181147422555,4.456830177669989,4.422928625994308,4.409683399244287,4.869215728622727,5.482320201509136,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,13.737229125258052]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.814525697986452E-5,7.761830524317957E-5,7.822171355357667E-5,7.776974765934028E-5,7.777102182909671E-5,7.766231348219936E-5,7.789329208399255E-5,7.76294817719614E-5,7.780402114628733E-5,8.631931430763755E-5,0.8314231148505221,7.750417067297125E-5,7.89507475844908E-5,8.007699734710728E-5,7.756068590571024E-5,7.734634163415186E-5,7.927564937388102E-5,7.79005900974976E-5,7.765890382018611E-5,7.772326924393506E-5,7.847528745948408E-5,7.797776986973346E-5,7.806655939045908E-5,7.815066735232621E-5,7.875043357459257E-5,7.833859097694119E-5,8.163179652016282E-5,7.75272119522794E-5,7.752928598675835E-5,7.772570599437648E-5,7.937774767950224E-5,7.789607642351507E-5,8.361483932994813E-5,7.811518659163596E-5,7.761159683599917E-5,7.79698255174887E-5,7.753382807646988E-5,7.75796448643359E-5,7.734595303987777E-5,7.736602014851384E-5,7.754016165734342E-5,7.835804605997074E-5,7.795987589941034E-5,7.765164434293196E-5,0.11217699605368205,7.768144746835622E-5,8.026241621671014E-5,7.908213399109116E-5,7.738524983396206E-5,7.755627596852794E-5,7.752937653007612E-5,7.971134462183051E-5,7.755742985805989E-5,7.735915181382307E-5,7.820827921445525E-5,0.05037158838367132,8.342597481338169E-5,7.75134727298732E-5,7.738435491794225E-5,7.775384250036769E-5,7.852509527056234E-5,7.774869864141511E-5,7.737003863928008E-5,7.755018292446483E-5,7.734688855287128E-5,7.913653523775964E-5,7.801319568953156E-5,7.784701616057585E-5,7.777893542661038E-5,7.806245200990398E-5,7.734406681570866E-5,7.778056602555644E-5,7.90421151722819E-5,7.74826716795892E-5,7.940032743262624E-5,7.768752799167363E-5,7.82955495406

{"value":"This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie. Jacob Have I Loved is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen. There is no storyline, plots disappear, and the editing is awful. To top it all off, the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible. Bridget Fonda's acting is decent, but everyone else's acting is totally amateur. I would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut-scenes, bad transitions and acting that should have been re-shot! Read the book and don't waste your time with this film.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","perfect","exampl","of","a","excel","book","get","ruin","by","a","movi","jacob","have","i","love","be","quit","possibli","the","wrong","film","that","i","have","ever","see","there","be","no","storylin","plot","disappear","and","the","edit","be","aw","to","top","it","all","off","the","music","be","straight","from","a","synthes","and","sound","unbeliev","terribl","bridget","fonda","act","be","decent","but","everyon","els","act","be","total","amateur","i","would","suggest","thi","movi","to","someon","who","be","studi","to","be","a","produc","a","a","studi","on","how","not","to","produc","a","movi","a","it","be","chock","full","of","bad","cutscen","bad","transit","and","act","that","should","have","be","reshot","read","the","book","and","do","not","wast","your","time","with","thi","film"],"filtered":["thi","movi","perfect","exampl","excel","book","get","ruin","movi","jacob","love","quit","possibli","wrong","film","ever","see","storylin","plot","disappear","edit","aw","top","music","straight","synthes","sound","unbeliev","terribl","bridget","fonda","act","decent","everyon","els","act","total","amateur","suggest","thi","movi","someon","studi","produc","studi","produc","movi","chock","full","bad","cutscen","bad","transit","act","reshot","read","book","wast","time","thi","film"],"filtered2":["perfect","exampl","excel","book","get","ruin","jacob","love","quit","possibli","wrong","ever","see","storylin","plot","disappear","edit","aw","top","music","straight","synthes","sound","unbeliev","terribl","bridget","fonda","act","decent","everyon","els","act","total","amateur","suggest","someon","studi","produc","studi","produc","chock","full","bad","cutscen","bad","transit","act","reshot","read","book","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,9,21,25,32,44,54,89,118,120,138,139,145,151,166,178,184,196,246,261,307,309,336,348,364,515,548,558,571,580,646,677,710,1158,1171,1203,2995,3624,4477,6080,6266,8157],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,9,21,25,32,44,54,89,118,120,138,139,145,151,166,178,184,196,246,261,307,309,336,348,364,515,548,558,571,580,646,677,710,1158,1171,1203,2995,3624,4477,6080,6266,8157],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,3.4860466360051467,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.8113893252729412,1.9940046109572438,2.354379525480895,2.2044500422972613,2.2907365189289424,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,5.6004909736203725,2.4423870329693536,2.532833256045391,2.496249838866882,2.478925055209576,2.673149229007135,5.417060555847441,2.8767855639325206,2.848772527704847,2.9233055795674137,3.0103169565570433,2.9878441007049847,3.3956930001684253,3.459754308221302,3.4572130107926293,3.467417180966871,3.5039747767006686,3.5900195030592035,3.6559115968679063,3.6528204042982337,4.2860694432771105,8.595530966080602,4.3521595551061,5.444579873526289,6.868614562629026,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.201450420194465E-5,8.146146122668504E-5,8.209474641021578E-5,8.162040209087293E-5,8.162173934926688E-5,8.150764846879673E-5,8.175006363562134E-5,8.147319114481655E-5,8.165637257901093E-5,9.059328793066556E-5,0.8145646648439713,8.134167545145431E-5,8.285987748665686E-5,0.17902868865506835,8.140098895264531E-5,8.117603174039995E-5,8.320086630928021E-5,8.175772299950865E-5,8.150406998239435E-5,8.157162236523287E-5,8.236087565433492E-5,8.183872421441252E-5,8.193191001739114E-5,8.202018246102448E-5,8.264964522379873E-5,8.221741084693409E-5,8.567367460881552E-5,8.136585758574716E-5,8.136803431298645E-5,8.157417976778089E-5,8.33080198620229E-5,8.175298583761152E-5,8.775490487839648E-5,8.19829449227633E-5,8.145442066261054E-5,8.183038650927543E-5,8.137280129757551E-5,8.142088663616396E-5,8.117562390545313E-5,8.119668460739665E-5,8.137944847637104E-5,8.223782921972525E-5,8.181994425052254E-5,8.149645106282361E-5,8.248671839748455E-5,8.152772984607681E-5,8.42364914579492E-5,8.299776929753132E-5,8.121686642237748E-5,8.139636066392318E-5,8.136812933942315E-5,8.365813436526637E-5,8.139757168659461E-5,8.118947619723682E-5,8.208064688959347E-5,8.141853754024522E-5,8.755668899580708E-5,8.135143808599359E-5,8.121592719590994E-5,8.160370941139623E-5,8.241314962576764E-5,8.159831086184908E-5,8.120090206781039E-5,8.138996593176374E-5,8.117660573899367E-5,8.30548641417473E-5,8.187590409146426E-5,8.170149642806216E-5,8.16300447768977E-5,8.192759926594167E-5,8.117364428767436E-5,8.163175611254725E-5,8.295576900589195E-5,8.131911196710205E-5,8.333171761834283E-5,8.153411143754429E-5,8.21722382774014E-5,8.167003770585249E-5,8.114819395943822E-5,8.124878271915612E-5]}}
{"value":"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. Don't get me wrong, I love silly, stupid movies just as much as the next gal, but the whole premise, writing and humor stunk. It seemed to me that they were going for a \"Napoleon Dynamite\" feel - strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it ended up being forced, awkward and weird.<br /><br />The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt utterly awful that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing.<br /><br />Thank gosh I didn't pay for it.","finished_norm":["quit","possibli","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","be","readi","to","walk","out","after","the","ten","minut","the","onli","peopl","laugh","in","the","theater","be","the","tweener","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","love","silli","stupid","movi","just","a","much","a","the","next","gal","but","the","whole","premis","write","and","humor","stink","it","seem","to","me","that","thei","be","go","for","a","napoleon","dynamit","feel","strang","and","random","scene","which","would","lead","to","a","cult","audienc","instead","it","end","up","be","forc","awkward","and","weirdbr","br","the","onli","bright","light","be","isla","fisher","and","i","just","feel","utterli","aw","that","she","and","sissi","spacek","have","sign","up","for","thi","horribl","thingbr","br","thank","gosh","i","do","not","pai","for","it"],"filtered":["quit","possibli","wrong","movi","ever","see","readi","walk","ten","minut","onli","peopl","laugh","theater","tweener","get","wrong","love","silli","stupid","movi","much","next","gal","whole","premis","write","humor","stink","seem","thei","go","napoleon","dynamit","feel","strang","random","scene","lead","cult","audienc","instead","end","forc","awkward","weirdbr","br","onli","bright","light","isla","fisher","feel","utterli","aw","sissi","spacek","sign","thi","horribl","thingbr","br","thank","gosh","pai"],"filtered2":["quit","possibli","wrong","ever","see","readi","walk","ten","minut","onli","peopl","laugh","theater","tweener","get","wrong","love","silli","stupid","next","gal","whole","premis","write","humor","stink","seem","go","napoleon","dynamit","feel","strang","random","scene","lead","cult","audienc","instead","end","forc","awkward","weirdbr","onli","bright","light","isla","fisher","feel","utterli","aw","sissi","spacek","sign","horribl","thingbr","thank","gosh","pai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,11,19,23,24,25,35,43,44,54,59,65,111,120,133,136,138,152,157,168,230,294,297,322,338,353,369,385,417,424,484,545,558,651,816,859,876,933,1329,1334,1408,1516,3574,3829,4783,5073,5263,5433,6152],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,11,19,23,24,25,35,43,44,54,59,65,111,120,133,136,138,152,157,168,230,294,297,322,338,353,369,385,417,424,484,545,558,651,816,859,876,933,1329,1334,1408,1516,3574,3829,4783,5073,5263,5433,6152],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.982619630677639,1.312380678011735,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.463169012899134,3.321622407243643,1.604729392502474,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.9073850067444174,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985579986,2.2907365189289424,2.3131195476980753,2.3360150694757706,2.4894767118610357,2.7121382192999195,2.886778509330039,2.813490713560207,2.885344817328191,2.9720957437368454,3.0266839340212486,3.121829110937649,3.09496984188738,3.1932880749197934,3.212973749990824,3.291526514503207,3.442099372982581,3.4572130107926293,3.5474598886404074,3.7881170224473255,3.9405024767500145,3.8844878351953436,4.091229668125752,4.416284083275639,4.383707912841026,4.477736862489302,4.535724120139652,5.649374286172302,5.7446844659766265,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,6.389041482367141,6.255510089742618,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.575942402536364E-5,7.52485605180531E-5,7.58335463228804E-5,7.539537928434497E-5,7.539661455274881E-5,7.529122515272656E-5,7.551515180560767E-5,7.525939581907888E-5,7.542860637618393E-5,8.368392128899092E-5,0.6986680693252889,7.513791056136292E-5,7.654032240132076E-5,7.763218691904208E-5,7.519270034191312E-5,7.49849001607635E-5,0.08722631786896773,7.55222270053196E-5,7.528791959023655E-5,7.535031988961268E-5,7.607937842839585E-5,7.559705042156998E-5,7.568312913203344E-5,7.576466921512052E-5,7.634612412748297E-5,7.594685539137506E-5,7.913951691420927E-5,7.516024837323603E-5,7.516225908589611E-5,7.535268224424648E-5,7.69542858650941E-5,7.551785113716879E-5,8.106201594861242E-5,7.57302717085058E-5,7.524205692354518E-5,7.558934861632194E-5,7.516666250222252E-5,7.521108046939765E-5,7.498452343056231E-5,7.500397787541127E-5,7.517280271415019E-5,7.596571649621554E-5,7.557970276750115E-5,7.528088175023507E-5,7.619562340032561E-5,7.530977496402128E-5,7.781194481232236E-5,7.666769748297633E-5,7.502262046422663E-5,7.518842504340069E-5,7.51623468648589E-5,7.727769784406968E-5,7.518954370382498E-5,7.499731923609909E-5,7.582052214414794E-5,7.520891053426829E-5,8.087891760653914E-5,7.514692861953278E-5,7.502175287066007E-5,7.537995972173342E-5,7.612766556986915E-5,7.537497290862953E-5,7.500787367865855E-5,7.518251802451532E-5,7.498543038164668E-5,7.672043781902677E-5,7.563139466467897E-5,0.0811915222343558,7.540428654223066E-5,7.567914715286881E-5

{"value":"This is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze. Kind of like Billy Jack I guess. However, whereas Billy Jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such. We are introduced to the star who is described as having learned Judo in the marines. I was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing, I really don't remember any emphasis on Judo. As a result the antagonist, James Macarthur, makes reference to the Judo when he offers an excuse for why he, a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated.

{"value":"It's like a bad 80s TV show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god was it bad. The plots of each character had little relevance. The plot itself wasn't anything to speak of. Something about a stalker, I guess. In the end he shoots himself? It's not really clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps around a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it, which were barely watchable at that. Thank god I didn't spend any money on it, but I want that hour of my life back.","finished_norm":["it","like","a","bad","tv","show","get","loos","and","try","to","becom","a","softcor","porn","movi","oh","my","god","be","it","bad","the","plot","of","each","charact","have","littl","relev","the","plot","itself","be","not","anyth","to","speak","of","someth","about","a","stalker","i","guess","in","the","end","he","shoot","himself","it","not","realli","clear","but","somehow","there","a","volleybal","game","involv","and","the","main","charact","randi","sleep","around","a","lot","the","onli","reason","my","friend","rent","thi","movi","be","becaus","casper","van","dien","be","in","it","and","thei","end","up","want","to","fast","forward","to","the","scene","with","him","in","it","which","be","bare","watchabl","at","that","thank","god","i","do","not","spend","ani","monei","on","it","but","i","want","that","hour","of","my","life","back"],"filtered":["like","bad","tv","show","get","loos","try","becom","softcor","porn","movi","oh","god","bad","plot","charact","littl","relev","plot","anyth","speak","someth","stalker","guess","end","shoot","realli","clear","somehow","volleybal","game","involv","main","charact","randi","sleep","around","lot","onli","reason","friend","rent","thi","movi","becaus","casper","van","dien","thei","end","want","fast","forward","scene","bare","watchabl","thank","god","spend","ani","monei","want","hour","life","back"],"filtered2":["like","bad","tv","show","get","loos","try","becom","softcor","porn","oh","god","bad","plot","charact","littl","relev","plot","anyth","speak","someth","stalker","guess","end","shoot","realli","clear","somehow","volleybal","game","involv","main","charact","randi","sleep","around","lot","onli","reason","friend","rent","becaus","casper","van","dien","end","want","fast","forward","scene","bare","watchabl","thank","god","spend","ani","monei","want","hour","life","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,9,10,11,13,14,19,22,24,27,28,32,36,37,53,63,72,75,95,98,104,115,117,126,161,172,174,179,234,241,243,283,344,352,374,542,549,589,590,651,661,699,732,818,940,971,1178,2017,3566,3759,4537,5961,6036],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,9,10,11,13,14,19,22,24,27,28,32,36,37,53,63,72,75,95,98,104,115,117,126,161,172,174,179,234,241,243,283,344,352,374,542,549,589,590,651,661,699,732,818,940,971,1178,2017,3566,3759,4537,5961,6036],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,1.7003182735607676,1.8729627573220065,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,2.0323326556775485,2.0881990796736947,2.0728240170322856,2.201553588425805,2.2797301185117202,2.2391270689902285,2.4323182980210873,2.5001408943598484,2.456282578459816,2.507968722980095,2.673149229007135,2.6627744961815836,2.627841366673578,2.7678802023081546,2.983093497946387,6.247291283728093,3.4572130107926293,3.4471119148061256,3.4471119148061256,3.496027715008137,3.4986697244709752,3.5474598886404074,3.5727776966246974,3.5813614403160887,3.7099788181381825,4.202455303235976,3.952924996748572,4.181290492043933,4.229557233013768,4.979216623837056,5.695894301807195,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,6.794506590475304,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.723929723889713E-5,7.671845460054162E-5,7.731486743024402E-5,7.686814130256921E-5,0.16363235865383077,7.676195263978266E-5,7.699025344227827E-5,7.67295015567107E-5,7.690201744743106E-5,8.531859044219835E-5,0.8303317357574452,7.66056432242117E-5,7.803544956647729E-5,7.914864240174287E-5,7.666150326010841E-5,7.644964394142168E-5,7.835658467888246E-5,7.6997466847879E-5,7.67585825069313E-5,7.682220172438597E-5,7.756550158319661E-5,7.707375185350759E-5,7.71615120125764E-5,7.724464488740316E-5,7.783745785271747E-5,7.743038986106916E-5,8.068541635470805E-5,7.66284173795479E-5,7.663046736916716E-5,7.682461022490044E-5,7.84574993303948E-5,7.699300550217678E-5,8.264546919658345E-5,7.720957546505905E-5,7.671182396579511E-5,7.706589960235225E-5,7.663495680116691E-5,7.668024242224342E-5,7.64492598522293E-5,7.646909431728284E-5,7.664121695507241E-5,7.744961939589957E-5,7.705606533296895E-5,7.675140719081996E-5,7.76840172669537E-5,7.678086480030592E-5,7.933191165871959E-5,7.816531277385237E-5,7.648810106762892E-5,7.665714444855678E-5,7.663055686279102E-5,7.878722879040695E-5,7.665828496072583E-5,7.646230560911015E-5,7.73015888391598E-5,7.667803009992707E-5,8.245879423898857E-5,7.661483743977578E-5,7.648721652661989E-5,7.685242053653688E-5,7.761473195844106E-5,7.684733631177459E-5,7.64730662205658E-5,7.665112204285145E-5,7.645018451955998E-5,7.82190833317081
