{"value":"This movie provided NOTHING new or worthwhile. After seeing it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a \"concept only\" film--they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs KNOW it will make $$ just based on the initial concept.<br /><br />The movie starts with Cruella getting out of prison and going on parole. She no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them--she simply couldn't hurt a flea. This doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways. Period.<br /><br />The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me HATE him--and that is TOUGH considering I am a die-hard Python fan. It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem servant, Tim McInnerny, was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. And it must have cost a few bucks to get Gérard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were, I am trying to block them out of my mind.<br /><br />Overall, you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","provid","noth","new","or","worthwhil","after","see","it","my","wife","and","i","both","agre","that","the","studio","simpli","churn","thi","out","and","can","have","care","littl","if","it","be","entertain","thi","be","a","good","exampl","of","a","concept","onli","filmthei","have","a","concept","about","a","film","and","the","other","detail","be","unimport","becaus","exec","know","it","will","make","just","base","on","the","initi","conceptbr","br","the","movi","start","with","cruella","get","out","of","prison","and","go","on","parol","she","no","long","hate","puppi","but","have","be","programm","to","ador","themsh","simpli","can","not","hurt","a","flea","thi","doe","not","last","too","long","after","her","releas","and","she","back","to","her","old","wai","periodbr","br","the","much","annoi","aspect","of","the","movi","be","the","support","charact","eric","idl","a","the","voic","of","waddlesworth","the","bird","make","me","hate","himand","that","be","tough","consid","i","be","a","diehard","python","fan","it","be","obviou","he","do","thi","becaus","thei","give","him","lot","of","monei","there","ca","not","be","ani","other","reason","cruella","low","selfesteem","servant","tim","mcinnerni","be","funni","in","the","black","adder","show","but","here","he","be","total","wast","and","unfunni","and","it","must","have","cost","a","few","buck","to","get","gérard","depardieu","but","he","be","utterli","wast","a","good","there","be","some","other","support","actor","a","good","but","give","how","poorli","write","the","charact","be","i","be","try","to","block","them","out","of","my","mindbr","br","overal","you","have","be","well","just","to","let","your","kid","watch","televis","than","bother","let","them","see","thi","drivel"],"filtered":["thi","movi","provid","noth","new","worthwhil","see","wife","agre","studio","simpli","churn","thi","care","littl","entertain","thi","good","exampl","concept","onli","filmthei","concept","film","detail","unimport","becaus","exec","know","make","base","initi","conceptbr","br","movi","start","cruella","get","prison","go","parol","long","hate","puppi","programm","ador","themsh","simpli","hurt","flea","thi","doe","last","long","releas","back","old","wai","periodbr","br","much","annoi","aspect","movi","support","charact","eric","idl","voic","waddlesworth","bird","make","hate","himand","tough","consid","diehard","python","fan","obviou","thi","becaus","thei","give","lot","monei","ca","ani","reason","cruella","low","selfesteem","servant","tim","mcinnerni","funni","black","adder","show","total","wast","unfunni","must","cost","buck","get","gérard","depardieu","utterli","wast","good","support","actor","good","give","poorli","write","charact","try","block","mindbr","br","overal","well","let","kid","watch","televis","bother","let","see","thi","drivel"],"filtered2":["provid","noth","new","worthwhil","see","wife","agre","studio","simpli","churn","care","littl","entertain","good","exampl","concept","onli","filmthei","concept","detail","unimport","becaus","exec","know","make","base","initi","conceptbr","start","cruella","get","prison","go","parol","long","hate","puppi","programm","ador","themsh","simpli","hurt","flea","doe","last","long","releas","back","old","wai","periodbr","annoi","aspect","support","charact","eric","idl","voic","waddlesworth","bird","make","hate","himand","tough","consid","diehard","python","fan","obviou","becaus","give","lot","monei","ca","ani","reason","cruella","low","selfesteem","servant","tim","mcinnerni","funni","black","adder","show","total","wast","unfunni","must","cost","buck","get","gérard","depardieu","utterli","wast","good","support","actor","good","give","poorli","write","charact","try","block","mindbr","overal","well","let","kid","watch","televis","bother","let","see","drivel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,7,10,11,14,18,20,22,26,27,28,30,33,36,41,49,62,63,65,67,71,72,81,87,89,95,99,114,124,126,140,141,144,184,195,201,205,217,229,263,271,307,317,327,334,339,383,398,412,428,458,496,622,645,663,694,726,741,816,837,852,863,932,948,1108,1226,1407,1445,1940,1990,2016,2206,2300,2371,2720,3295,3337,3956,4159,5106,5301,5777,7551,7692,7854,8056],"values":[2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,7,10,11,14,18,20,22,26,27,28,30,33,36,41,49,62,63,65,67,71,72,81,87,89,95,99,114,124,126,140,141,144,184,195,201,205,217,229,263,271,307,317,327,334,339,383,398,412,428,458,496,622,645,663,694,726,741,816,837,852,863,932,948,1108,1226,1407,1445,1940,1990,2016,2206,2300,2371,2720,3295,3337,3956,4159,5106,5301,5777,7551,7692,7854,8056],"values":[1.239953431

{"value":"I never heard of this film til it played as part of a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theatre in London. Almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names - in addition to top-billed Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not long off The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of Theatre Set Designer Norman, Walter Brennan, who needed no introduction, Frank Faylen, the sadistic male nurse in The Lost Weekend and the much nicer small-town mensch in It's A Wonderful Life, Robert Preston still a decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter making up the numbers. Alas, most of them were wasting their time. I looked in vain for any 'signature' scenes given that it was Robert Wise on bullhorn. By this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style. The story is our old friend the range war and Mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy oaters on which he'd cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you don't count the unbelievable scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to gain information about her father's plans to move his cattle.

{"value":"An actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />But worse than that, even by 1982 standards this is so bad, it's hysterically funny. Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff, wooden, and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater. Noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly bad, very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. Scenes are contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />I do believe it's possible to make a Christian film that's palatable to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'The Message' or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer/director/editor - and cast member.) <br /><br />Luckily, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. Careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one.","finished_norm":["a","actor","film","be","usual","someth","on","can","afford","to","miss","it","often","that","job","where","the","lack","of","film","experi","by","everyon","involv","be","truli","on","displai","and","thi","film","be","no","exceptionbr","br","but","wrong","than","that","even","by","standard","thi","be","so","bad","it","hyster","funni","film","entir","in","the","chicago","area","on","a","obvious","small","budget","much","of","the","act","by","the","entir","cast","be","stiff","wooden","and","cartoonish","a","cross","between","a","high","school","plai","and","bad","commun","theater","nois","from","nearbi","traffic","often","drown","out","the","dialog","and","the","dialog","be","truli","bad","veri","declar","in","a","wai","that","come","off","a","forc","and","expedi","rather","than","natur","and","organ","scene","be","contriv","and","choppi","and","even","though","the","charact","go","through","a","spin","of","year","neither","the","child","nor","the","adult","ag","at","allbr","br","i","do","believ","it","possibl","to","make","a","christian","film","that","palat","to","a","larg","secular","audienc","but","too","often","the","creator","of","such","film","be","so","focu","on","the","messag","or","in","thi","case","their","own","autobiograph","tie","to","the","project","that","good","film","product","valu","be","toss","asid","i","be","sure","it","no","coincid","that","the","main","charact","have","the","same","name","a","the","producerdirectoreditor","and","cast","member","br","br","luckili","michael","madsen","be","much","much","interest","and","believ","to","watch","in","hi","subsequ","film","career","like","hi","be","certainli","not","build","on","film","like","thi","on"],"filtered":["actor","film","usual","someth","afford","miss","often","job","lack","film","experi","everyon","involv","truli","displai","thi","film","exceptionbr","br","wrong","even","standard","thi","bad","hyster","funni","film","entir","chicago","area","obvious","small","budget","much","act","entir","cast","stiff","wooden","cartoonish","cross","high","school","plai","bad","commun","theater","nois","nearbi","traffic","often","drown","dialog","dialog","truli","bad","veri","declar","wai","come","forc","expedi","rather","natur","organ","scene","contriv","choppi","even","though","charact","go","spin","year","neither","child","adult","ag","allbr","br","believ","possibl","make","christian","film","palat","larg","secular","audienc","often","creator","film","focu","messag","thi","case","autobiograph","tie","project","good","film","product","valu","toss","asid","sure","coincid","main","charact","name","producerdirectoreditor","cast","member","br","br","luckili","michael","madsen","much","much","interest","believ","watch","hi","subsequ","film","career","like","hi","certainli","build","film","like","thi"],"filtered2":["actor","usual","someth","afford","miss","often","job","lack","experi","everyon","involv","truli","displai","exceptionbr","wrong","even","standard","bad","hyster","funni","entir","chicago","area","obvious","small","budget","act","entir","cast","stiff","wooden","cartoonish","cross","high","school","plai","bad","commun","theater","nois","nearbi","traffic","often","drown","dialog","dialog","truli","bad","veri","declar","wai","come","forc","expedi","rather","natur","organ","scene","contriv","choppi","even","though","charact","go","spin","year","neither","child","adult","ag","allbr","believ","possibl","make","christian","palat","larg","secular","audienc","often","creator","focu","messag","case","autobiograph","tie","project","good","product","valu","toss","asid","sure","coincid","main","charact","name","producerdirectoreditor","cast","member","luckili","michael","madsen","interest","believ","watch","subsequ","career","like","certainli","build","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,6,7,9,10,15,19,21,25,33,34,40,41,53,57,60,62,86,91,92,119,143,160,168,179,180,183,190,198,211,241,246,255,256,265,288,289,296,333,338,341,343,363,389,400,402,424,432,442,451,456,466,477,511,564,569,616,618,619,660,684,718,734,890,936,1061,1062,1156,1175,1181,1255,1425,1499,1599,1808,2080,2101,2157,2199,2357,2584,2670,2804,2931,2938,3043,3207,3514,3704,3807,4145,7716],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,6,7,9,10,15,19,21,25,33,34,40,41,53,57,60,62,86,91,92,119,143,160,168,179,180,183,190,198,211,241,246,255,256,265,288,289,296,333,338,341,343,363,389,400,402,424,432,442,451,456,466,477,511,564,569,616,618,619,660,684,718,734,890,936,1061,1062,1156,1175,1181,1255,1425,1499,1599,1808,2080,2101,2157,2199,2357,2584,2670,2804,293

{"value":"Hiya folks,<br /><br />Well, this movie sucks really. Think \"Love Actually\" in reverse. Nothing fits quite right, nothing is coherent, and certainly nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this film.<br /><br />It IS a total flop. As indicated however, there are three redeeming points about this mangled potential of a film.<br /><br />A) With a star billing of Jennifer Love Hewitt, there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the petite Hewitt with form fitting clothing. To tell you now guys....there are some promising scenes....but it's really weak eye candy. The \"possibilities\" here are watered down. Nevertheless, I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what.....titillating!<br /><br />B) The ending is romantic and positive. That it's contrary and \"over the top\" is relevant.....yet for me was still a positive point.<br /><br />C) Dougray Scott plays an amourous friendly guy........REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /><br />2/5, not worthy of your 10 or so dollars.<br /><br />2/3's of the way through, I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend.

{"value":"I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate movies below a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. \"Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you\" I say, quite bored with the cheap thrills.<br /><br />The plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. \"This was good until the end.... Then it just got silly\", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism.

{"value":"First of all I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best batman series by far. We watched it when it used to be on TV. I didn't realize that there was a season four. Actually there wasn't. BTAS ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there.<br /><br />Why did they have to mess with a good thing. Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible grey faces. The Joker looks beyond scary, it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier. He doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is).<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who does the best batman. Although he now looks like superman. There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes.<br /><br />Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred just has pupils from eyes, looks more like a character from the 80's.<br /><br />I have watched three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in every episode).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is no batman season 4. They just included this series as season 4 for marketability.

{"value":"The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in Space near out planet. When it's retrieved, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member.<br /><br />While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug-eyed monsters. Oddly, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest I have seen on film. Plus, in an odd attempt at realism, the production used a process called \"Cinemagic\". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars AND the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed--it was THAT bad!! Despite all the cheese, the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of the genre, it's well worth seeing. For others, you may just find the whole thing rather silly--see for yourself and decide.<br /><br />While by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci-fi film, compared with the films being made at the time, it stacks up pretty well.<br /><br />PS--When you watch the film, pay careful attention to Dr. Tremayne. He looks like the spitting image of Dr. Quest from the \"Jonny Quest\" cartoon!

{"value":"I run a group to stop comedian exploitation and I just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for, \"Last Comic Standing.\" If they don't have a GOOD agent, then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent! If they do make it to an audition, I was told that it's \"pre-determined\" if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees is NOT the best comics in the US.<br /><br />If the comics do make it to the show, then most of them don't get IMDb credits. I know this because I did the credits for all 6 seasons of, \"Last Comic Standing\" and I don't get paid for doing the Producers' job. It's really a disgrace. A month ago, I asked, \"Last Comic Standing 7\" on Facebook why the Producers aren't giving IMDb credits and I was banned from their Facebook Page!!! I am not a comedian so I do not have a personal stake in this. I just want people to know the truth. I don't like seeing ANYONE getting exploited and that's why I've been helping the comedians. Comedians get exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks but NBC is a BIG THREE network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen.<br /><br />Please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized:

{"value":"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br /><br />The Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what action there is to!! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy's.<br /><br />This is a remake and I have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although Bassenger and Baldwin have some nice screen chemistry. But the movie itself didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The Gettaway became really tiresome really quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one fight/chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in. In fact, by the end of the movie they almost look BETTER then in the beginning. I don't think Bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture.<br /><br />This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist I can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here. The Gettaway isn't terribly original either, and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull. It really could have been better I think.<br /><br />Bassenger and Baldwin give OK performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale.

{"value":"I would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful. If there are people who watch this piece and think that \"well then Jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in WW2\", then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why's and 'how's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live. What more can a propaganda movie aim for? The part in which an American movie about the Rothschild family is included is re-used very shrewdly here, for instance. The question of why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata.<br /><br />Besides, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda. The audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up...well done.<br /><br />In the movie, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The movie is kind of history today, so no need to fuss much about it actually. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful watcher can find relevance to today's cultural hatred, violence, decivilization as well as the problems of integration.

{"value":"Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie. My points;<br /><br />Film is based on 2 things;<br /><br />1) Ethnical point of View: As it happens on most of the American Films, the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture. For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that. Lebanese people are Christian (Ok they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries. The main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism. So we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film. <br /><br />2) Sexual revolution of a girl: There is nothing much to say about this. Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong.<br /><br />I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning about the

{"value":"There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.<br /><br />I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the \"My Heart Will Go On\" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.<br /><br />In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into

{"value":"The main reason for writing this review is I found this \"revisioning\" of a great play and worthy 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from watching it, I will have done a good thing.<br /><br />This \"new\" version is loaded with talent, and it all goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OKs an ugly, sterile, one note set. He proceeds to film the movie from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle possible. We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close ups of eyes, chins, and on and on. The screenplay, by a Nobel Laureate, introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter, that is being faked by both parties,.... I think?? Given the character \"twists\" how would I know? The characters themselves,so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. The running time has been cut by an hour, which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the Director did for us. The actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. Jude Law is over the top more than Caine, but as the credited Producer, must have had Branagh's blessing.<br /><br />All in all I found this to be an ugly to look at, unconvincing shell of a former classic. Why was it even made??? The paying public spent less that $4M worldwide to see it!

{"value":"Don't drink the cool-aid.<br /><br />This is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary. And to title it as a \"truth\" is just plain crap. The debate over global warming is far from over, and will only be over when the eco-zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. Just Google \"Global Warming\" and \"Hoax\" or \"Junk Science\" and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that Gore sites. The reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, a little time, and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible. Don't just read articles that support your present opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis to make, really. There is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter-evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so uncredible, in fact, that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence.

{"value":"Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada, I am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film.<br /><br />No one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her endeavors.<br /><br />Likewise, no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained.<br /><br />As a sci-fi film, this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer--with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd.<br /><br />As a drama film, this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the writer/director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing. I doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction.<br /><br />I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances under which I saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that I would have otherwise. I am still angry that I wasted the time that it took to see it.

{"value":"A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. She discovers that right before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them. Patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate, with his wife. In reality, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, by putting the brides in a suspended state, and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who is working with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) try to force Dr. Lorenz's hand by setting up a phony wedding, which eventually leads Patricia into the mad doctor's clutches. This movie had a very good opening reel, but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserved better, but that's life. Russell steals the show (even out hamming Lugosi- who does not give one of his more memorable performances, even considering his Monograms) as Countess Lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today's Hollywood prima donnas. Weak and contrived ending as well.

{"value":"Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, a TV series is turned into a full length film and gets ruined for all the hundreds of people that watched. Basically the Duke cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time driving very fast in \"The General Lee\". But they need to get their act together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the whole town by nasty Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds) to make way for a huge coal mine. They get help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being chased by equally mean Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C. Gainey) and the police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts, and of course the gorgeous body of Simpson (I'll admit her legs aren't quite Catherine Bach, but still!), but besides that it is pretty boring.

{"value":"As some other comments show, this movie might scare you, when you're a little child. (And that is probably all that it is good for.)<br /><br />However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: suck majorly -and thereby I don't mean the acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like that. I'm simply talking about the \"plot\" (if you can call it that). <br /><br />SPOILERS ahead ------------------------<br /><br />I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this, you really still want to watch this movie) but if you graduated from any school, this is just a big insult of your intelligence. When watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just THAT stupid.<br /><br />This includes:<br /><br />-the forming of UNITE (an evil UN-association) <br /><br />--> we are just supposed to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it evil?<br /><br />-the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /><br />--> there is no necessity to impose this on the people, so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? <br /><br />-inviting Christ to your heart merely as lip service <br /><br />-->because there's nothing anybody, who in this movie is considered \"a real Christian\", ever does, besides saying that stupid prayer. so...just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what?! <br /><br />Thus, rating

{"value":"This movie is horrendous. Decent fight scenes or not, the acting is REALLY bad, like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card. With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. Think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (weird pauses between different character's lines, combined with hurried line delivery by others). If the movie were all action, this might be forgivable, but a lot of the movie includes plot set-up and Family Guy style, irreverent cut aways (Oh, wow, are they badly done). I'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these, but it again came off as a bunch of high-schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny Youtube clip. <br /><br />Now to the fight scenes. They're not too bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. Nothing great either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (Nothing like Drunken Master). The fights have an overly staged feel, with LOTS of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved. <br /><br />In sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very, very cheap production. Which guy you may ask?

{"value":"Wimpy stuffed shirt Armand Louque (blandly played by veteran character actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the lovely Claire Duval (fetching blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the meek sap to get Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious over being used and spurned by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Sound exciting? Well, it sure ain't. For starters, Victor Halperin's static (non)direction lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace. Worse yet, Halperin crucially fails to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings. The mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any; only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The drippy stock film library score, the painfully obvious stagebound sets, and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. In fact, this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom.

{"value":"As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter, as AMC billed it as a comedy. I have never been more disappointed with a film! Cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire movie; he comes across as strained, bored, and just not himself. Mississip's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from), and whenever he does deliver a line, it's several decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable, country-bumpkin goofball, but in the end, he manages only to detract from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability, this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with. Ray Walston's character was sugary and ultimately contrived. For four men on shore leave, it was the tamest leave I've ever seen. I watched this nightmare until its very end, and while I won't spoil that for anyone, I will tell you that it's the most absurd you'll ever see. The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men, but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast.

{"value":"Yes there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it's doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour in, the characters who, until this point, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further in, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of sung-through dialog, then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things, such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used, is the composers' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the film is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing out loud. This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film.","finished_norm":["ye","there","be","great","perform","here","unfortun","thei","happen","in","the","context","of","a","movi","that","doe","not","seem","to","have","a","clue","what","it","do","dure","the","minut","of","thi","all","the","music","take","place","a","realist","perform","suddenli","about","a","hour","in","the","charact","who","until","thi","point","have","alwai","speak","to","each","other","suddenli","start","sing","to","each","other","to","far","confus","thing","a","littl","far","in","out","of","nowher","thei","actual","do","about","minut","of","sungthrough","dialog","then","seem","to","drop","that","idea","and","move","on","to","other","thing","such","a","a","numb","that","begin","in","a","jazz","club","with","a","drummer","and","two","electr","guitar","suddenli","turn","into","a","fulli","orchestr","piec","with","a","massiv","unseen","string","section","on","top","of","all","thi","inconsist","in","how","the","music","be","us","be","the","compos","clear","inabl","to","actual","write","music","in","the","styl","that","be","supposedli","be","portrai","while","the","coupl","of","piec","do","sort","of","mimic","the","motown","sound","the","rest","of","the","film","be","just","bad","broadwai","show","music","then","there","the","pure","silli","of","snippet","of","a","group","do","a","bad","jackson","famili","imit","and","eddi","murphi","morph","from","littl","richard","to","jame","brown","to","lionel","richi","when","he","start","channel","stevi","wonder","i","can","not","help","laugh","out","loud","thi","be","clearli","on","of","that","film","that","make","me","appreci","how","littl","time","i","have","on","earth","and","resend","that","i","wast","two","hour","of","it","watch","thi","film"],"filtered":["ye","great","perform","unfortun","thei","happen","context","movi","doe","seem","clue","dure","minut","thi","music","take","place","realist","perform","suddenli","hour","charact","thi","point","alwai","speak","suddenli","start","sing","far","confus","thing","littl","far","nowher","thei","actual","minut","sungthrough","dialog","seem","drop","idea","move","thing","numb","begin","jazz","club","drummer","two","electr","guitar","suddenli","turn","fulli","orchestr","piec","massiv","unseen","string","section","top","thi","inconsist","music","us","compos","clear","inabl","actual","write","music","styl","supposedli","portrai","coupl","piec","sort","mimic","motown","sound","rest","film","bad","broadwai","show","music","pure","silli","snippet","group","bad","jackson","famili","imit","eddi","murphi","morph","littl","richard","jame","brown","lionel","richi","start","channel","stevi","wonder","help","laugh","loud","thi","clearli","film","make","appreci","littl","time","earth","resend","wast","two","hour","watch","thi","film"],"filtered2":["ye","great","perform","unfortun","happen","context","doe","seem","clue","dure","minut","music","take","place","realist","perform","suddenli","hour","charact","point","alwai","speak","suddenli","start","sing","far","confus","thing","littl","far","nowher","actual","minut","sungthrough","dialog","seem","drop","idea","move","thing","numb","begin","jazz","club","drummer","two","electr","guitar","suddenli","turn","fulli","orchestr","piec","massiv","unseen","string","section","top","inconsist","music","us","compos","clear","inabl","actual","write","music","styl","supposedli","portrai","coupl","piec","sort","mimic","motown","sound","rest","bad","broadwai","show","music","pure","silli","snippet","group","bad","jackson","famili","imit","eddi","murphi","morph","littl","richard","jame","brown","lionel","richi","start","channel","stevi","wonder","help","laugh","loud","clearli","make","appreci","littl","time","earth","resend","wast","two","hour","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,9,10,14,18,28,29,31,35,47,51,52,56,59,65,66,71,89,94,96,101,105,118,123,133,147,164,174,175,178,182,185,197,209,218,226,227,239,253,269,275,344,364,380,385,410,427,432,469,494,516,522,590,620,641,659,725,728,785,799,904,946,956,958,961,1035,1038,1366,1472,1618,1657,1684,1701,1729,1879,1943,1955,2138,2251,2268,2384,3804,3961,4221,4631,4691,5469,6013,6514,6661,8354],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,9,10,14,18,28,29,31,35,47,51,52,56,59,65,66,71,89,94,96,101,105,118,123,133,147,164,174,175,178,182,185,197,209,218,226,227,239,253,269,275,344,364,380,385,410,427,432,469,494,516,522,590,620,641,659,725,728,785,799,904,946,956,958,961,1035,1038,1366,1472,1618,1657,1684,1701,1729,1879,1943,1955,2138,2251,2268,2384,3804,3961,4221,4631,4691,5469,6013,6514,6661,8354],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609

{"value":"Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud, boredom and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's ALL there is to this movie. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute. One of the best World War II films, \"Twelve O'Clock High,\" has very little action. But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to \"The Story of G.I. Joe\" is a brief battle segment (titled \"city under siege\" on the DVD) which takes place in Italy. Admittedly it is one of the most fast-paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie. But alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be a \"romeo\" but comes off a pervert. By contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, if flawed, man. As he says to Capt. Walker (Mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: \"Every step forward is a step closer... to home.\" But that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink. Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't do justice to some otherwise fine touches. As for Meredith's portrayal of Pyle... it is practically

{"value":"David Lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families. The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth-hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises, the son and mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series.<br /><br />Lynch is not famous for his comedies (i.e. On the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I am not particularly fond of comedies in general. However, there were a couple of scenes in Dumbland which made me laugh out loud. There are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where Lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in Dumbland).<br /><br />I believe Lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disturbing, animated comedy here. Interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-brow humor (i.e. most Will Farrell films) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross-out humor. While the blend doesn't really work very well here, it is nothing if not Lynchian.<br /><br />Worth seeing by Lynch fans.","finished_norm":["david","lynch","crude","and","crude","draw","take","on","south","park","present","u","with","a","nightmar","of","disturb","cliché","about","suburban","middl","class","famili","the","father","be","a","hideou","monster","with","three","tooth","and","a","disproportion","larg","circular","mouthhol","from","which","be","utter","the","much","horrend","guttur","nois","the","son","and","mother","be","perman","horrifi","incoher","creatur","for","whom","terror","be","a","wai","of","life","a","numb","of","equal","absurd","charact","be","introduc","throughout","the","seriesbr","br","lynch","be","not","famou","for","hi","comedi","ie","on","the","air","aspect","of","wild","at","heart","and","i","be","not","particularli","fond","of","comedi","in","gener","howev","there","be","a","coupl","of","scene","in","dumbland","which","make","me","laugh","out","loud","there","be","some","clever","bit","of","anim","cinematographi","where","lynch","convei","wide","rang","of","reaction","in","hi","charact","through","a","syntact","arrang","of","shot","a","oppos","to","facial","express","which","never","realli","vari","in","dumblandbr","br","i","believ","lynch","be","realli","try","to","give","hi","audienc","a","straightforward","if","disturb","anim","comedi","here","interestingli","he","choos","to","follow","in","the","footstep","of","the","recent","wave","of","ultralowbrow","humor","ie","much","will","farrel","film","while","add","elem","of","viciou","social","critiqu","and","classic","cartoon","violenc","and","grossout","humor","while","the","blend","doe","not","realli","work","veri","good","here","it","be","noth","if","not","lynchianbr","br","worth","see","by","lynch","fan"],"filtered":["david","lynch","crude","crude","draw","take","south","park","present","u","nightmar","disturb","cliché","suburban","middl","class","famili","father","hideou","monster","three","tooth","disproportion","larg","circular","mouthhol","utter","much","horrend","guttur","nois","son","mother","perman","horrifi","incoher","creatur","terror","wai","life","numb","equal","absurd","charact","introduc","throughout","seriesbr","br","lynch","famou","hi","comedi","ie","air","aspect","wild","heart","particularli","fond","comedi","gener","howev","coupl","scene","dumbland","make","laugh","loud","clever","bit","anim","cinematographi","lynch","convei","wide","rang","reaction","hi","charact","syntact","arrang","shot","oppos","facial","express","never","realli","vari","dumblandbr","br","believ","lynch","realli","try","give","hi","audienc","straightforward","disturb","anim","comedi","interestingli","choos","follow","footstep","recent","wave","ultralowbrow","humor","ie","much","farrel","film","add","elem","viciou","social","critiqu","classic","cartoon","violenc","grossout","humor","blend","doe","realli","work","veri","good","noth","lynchianbr","br","worth","see","lynch","fan"],"filtered2":["david","lynch","crude","crude","draw","take","south","park","present","u","nightmar","disturb","cliché","suburban","middl","class","famili","father","hideou","monster","three","tooth","disproportion","larg","circular","mouthhol","utter","horrend","guttur","nois","son","mother","perman","horrifi","incoher","creatur","terror","wai","life","numb","equal","absurd","charact","introduc","throughout","seriesbr","lynch","famou","comedi","ie","air","aspect","wild","heart","particularli","fond","comedi","gener","howev","coupl","scene","dumbland","make","laugh","loud","clever","bit","anim","cinematographi","lynch","convei","wide","rang","reaction","charact","syntact","arrang","shot","oppos","facial","express","never","realli","vari","dumblandbr","believ","lynch","realli","try","give","audienc","straightforward","disturb","anim","comedi","interestingli","choos","follow","footstep","recent","wave","ultralowbrow","humor","ie","farrel","add","elem","viciou","social","critiqu","classic","cartoon","violenc","grossout","humor","blend","doe","realli","work","veri","good","noth","lynchianbr","worth","see","lynch","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,10,13,15,18,19,30,31,33,36,42,48,49,75,91,112,113,127,133,140,168,182,219,224,225,253,260,277,299,332,342,369,397,411,413,434,438,441,452,479,497,516,523,554,562,564,576,584,614,628,629,645,653,675,679,761,839,846,865,906,928,929,935,955,956,975,1024,1054,1106,1212,1299,1336,1381,1416,1449,1499,1537,1553,1582,1613,1686,1798,1805,1807,2228,2298,2355,2563,3050,3209,3344,3664,3673,3770,3924,3980,4687,4987,5333,5801,5838,6009],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,10,13,15,18,19,30,31,33,36

{"value":"Hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a \"religious picture.\" Strange Cargo proves to be no exception. Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast, and produced on a top budget, with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck, the movie fails dismally on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and impossible to accept bathed-in-light Ian Hunter's smug know-it-all as a Christ figure. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few Boston/Detroit/Providence moviegoers, if any, complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a \"message picture.\" It flopped everywhere.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV. A home atmosphere appears to make the movie's allegory more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable, heavily moralistic lines that will have no-one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny.","finished_norm":["hollywood","alwai","have","troubl","come","to","term","with","a","religi","pictur","strang","cargo","prove","to","be","no","except","although","util","the","talent","of","a","superb","cast","and","produc","on","a","top","budget","with","suitabl","moodi","photographi","by","robert","planck","the","movi","fail","dismal","on","the","credibl","score","perhap","the","reason","be","that","the","film","seem","so","realist","that","the","sudden","intrus","of","fantasi","elem","upset","the","viewer","involv","in","the","action","and","with","the","fate","of","the","charact","i","find","it","difficult","to","sit","still","through","all","the","contriv","metaphor","parallel","and","biblic","refer","and","imposs","to","accept","bathedinlight","ian","hunter","smug","knowital","a","a","christ","figur","and","the","censor","in","boston","detroit","and","provid","at","littl","agre","with","me","the","movi","be","ban","few","bostondetroitprovid","moviego","if","ani","complain","or","journei","to","other","citi","becaus","it","be","obviou","from","the","trailer","that","gabl","and","crawford","have","somehow","becom","involv","in","a","messag","pictur","it","flop","everywherebr","br","oddli","enough","the","movi","have","enjoi","someth","of","a","reviv","on","tv","a","home","atmospher","appear","to","make","the","movi","allegori","much","recept","to","viewer","howev","despit","it","grow","reput","a","a","strang","or","unusu","film","the","plot","of","thi","strang","cargo","flow","along","predict","heavili","moralist","line","that","will","have","noon","guess","how","the","princip","charact","will","eventu","come","to","term","with","destini"],"filtered":["hollywood","alwai","troubl","come","term","religi","pictur","strang","cargo","prove","except","although","util","talent","superb","cast","produc","top","budget","suitabl","moodi","photographi","robert","planck","movi","fail","dismal","credibl","score","perhap","reason","film","seem","realist","sudden","intrus","fantasi","elem","upset","viewer","involv","action","fate","charact","find","difficult","sit","still","contriv","metaphor","parallel","biblic","refer","imposs","accept","bathedinlight","ian","hunter","smug","knowital","christ","figur","censor","boston","detroit","provid","littl","agre","movi","ban","bostondetroitprovid","moviego","ani","complain","journei","citi","becaus","obviou","trailer","gabl","crawford","somehow","becom","involv","messag","pictur","flop","everywherebr","br","oddli","enough","movi","enjoi","someth","reviv","tv","home","atmospher","appear","make","movi","allegori","much","recept","viewer","howev","despit","grow","reput","strang","unusu","film","plot","thi","strang","cargo","flow","along","predict","heavili","moralist","line","noon","guess","princip","charact","eventu","come","term","destini"],"filtered2":["hollywood","alwai","troubl","come","term","religi","pictur","strang","cargo","prove","except","although","util","talent","superb","cast","produc","top","budget","suitabl","moodi","photographi","robert","planck","fail","dismal","credibl","score","perhap","reason","seem","realist","sudden","intrus","fantasi","elem","upset","viewer","involv","action","fate","charact","find","difficult","sit","still","contriv","metaphor","parallel","biblic","refer","imposs","accept","bathedinlight","ian","hunter","smug","knowital","christ","figur","censor","boston","detroit","provid","littl","agre","ban","bostondetroitprovid","moviego","ani","complain","journei","citi","becaus","obviou","trailer","gabl","crawford","somehow","becom","involv","messag","pictur","flop","everywherebr","oddli","enough","enjoi","someth","reviv","tv","home","atmospher","appear","make","allegori","recept","viewer","howev","despit","grow","reput","strang","unusu","plot","strang","cargo","flow","along","predict","heavili","moralist","line","noon","guess","princip","charact","eventu","come","term","destini"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,14,22,27,32,34,35,38,53,64,92,93,95,107,113,115,129,169,172,197,200,215,233,237,241,243,244,256,261,276,279,300,302,311,318,324,337,364,383,391,415,417,479,518,539,540,549,561,569,595,622,694,715,716,742,752,803,835,858,901,950,958,996,1181,1208,1260,1317,1371,1697,1786,1826,1830,1831,1899,1931,1952,1956,1966,2060,2099,2171,2319,2575,2730,2767,2870,2911,2917,2949,3129,3152,3488,3976,4239,4712,4863,4866,5086,5417,5753,6136,6437,6936,7279,7432,7899],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,14,22,27,32,34,35,38,53,64,92,93,95,107,113,115,129,169,172,197,200,215,233,237,241,243

{"value":"I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period. I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it's telling you something.....4 of 10. Also, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard (I don't know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. It's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","big","fan","of","old","horror","movi","and","sinc","i","be","middl","ag","old","to","me","be","a","movi","make","befor","with","much","be","make","in","the","to","period","i","be","not","a","big","fan","of","much","modern","horror","movi","with","on","except","be","creepshow","which","i","think","be","great","i","can","reminisc","about","the","stori","there","but","i","realli","realli","enjoi","the","monster","in","the","box","stori","with","hal","holbrook","and","conjur","the","on","about","the","realli","clean","gui","be","a","great","end","all","the","stori","be","great","though","so","why","do","i","like","them","so","much","the","charact","have","some","decent","develop","the","line","be","veri","plain","about","who","be","good","and","who","be","bad","the","horror","bit","be","heighten","with","a","close","up","of","a","face","aghast","with","fear","and","the","funni","bit","be","realli","funni","thi","sequel","be","either","greatli","lack","of","thi","elem","or","thei","be","total","absent","i","be","write","thi","onli","have","watch","it","partial","becaus","the","movi","be","a","complet","wast","of","time","and","i","turn","it","off","to","do","other","thing","like","write","movi","review","on","imdbcom","lol","when","georg","kennedi","and","a","old","dorothi","lamour","get","top","bill","it","tell","you","someth","of","conjur","romero","expertis","be","hard","to","find","here","thei","must","have","tell","him","to","tone","it","down","to","a","pg","standard","i","do","not","know","what","thi","be","rate","at","but","it","look","pg","to","me","and","that","not","a","good","thing","for","a","movi","with","noth","els","go","on","it","show","on","the","encor","cabl","channel","if","your","die","yuck","yuck","to","see","it"],"filtered":["big","fan","old","horror","movi","sinc","middl","ag","old","movi","make","befor","much","make","period","big","fan","much","modern","horror","movi","except","creepshow","think","great","reminisc","stori","realli","realli","enjoi","monster","box","stori","hal","holbrook","conjur","realli","clean","gui","great","end","stori","great","though","like","much","charact","decent","develop","line","veri","plain","good","bad","horror","bit","heighten","close","face","aghast","fear","funni","bit","realli","funni","thi","sequel","either","greatli","lack","thi","elem","thei","total","absent","write","thi","onli","watch","partial","becaus","movi","complet","wast","time","turn","thing","like","write","movi","review","imdbcom","lol","georg","kennedi","old","dorothi","lamour","get","top","bill","tell","someth","conjur","romero","expertis","hard","find","thei","must","tell","tone","pg","standard","know","thi","rate","look","pg","good","thing","movi","noth","els","go","show","encor","cabl","channel","die","yuck","yuck","see"],"filtered2":["big","fan","old","horror","sinc","middl","ag","old","make","befor","make","period","big","fan","modern","horror","except","creepshow","think","great","reminisc","stori","realli","realli","enjoi","monster","box","stori","hal","holbrook","conjur","realli","clean","gui","great","end","stori","great","though","like","charact","decent","develop","line","veri","plain","good","bad","horror","bit","heighten","close","face","aghast","fear","funni","bit","realli","funni","sequel","either","greatli","lack","elem","total","absent","write","onli","watch","partial","becaus","complet","wast","time","turn","thing","like","write","review","imdbcom","lol","georg","kennedi","old","dorothi","lamour","get","top","bill","tell","someth","conjur","romero","expertis","hard","find","must","tell","tone","pg","standard","know","rate","look","pg","good","thing","noth","els","go","show","encor","cabl","channel","die","yuck","yuck","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,22,24,26,28,29,38,39,49,51,53,55,62,65,67,79,82,83,86,89,90,96,103,107,140,141,162,171,176,183,184,196,200,202,207,233,251,293,295,309,320,364,387,413,442,479,554,586,616,654,680,722,728,729,743,812,967,1381,1495,1535,2020,2436,2441,2970,3267,3454,3469,3977,4505,4724,6474,6542,7365,7460,8504],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,22,24,26,28,29,38,39,49,51,53,55,62,65,67,79,82,83,86,89,90,96,103,107,140,141,162,171,176,183,184,196,200,202,207,233,251,293,295,309,320,364,387,413,442,479,554,586,616,654,680,722,728,729,743,812,967,1381,1495,1535,2020,2436,2441,2970,3267,3454,3469,3977,4505,4724,6474,6542,7365,7460,8504],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924

{"value":"This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD.<br /><br />Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers. <br /><br />(Possible spoiler warning) <br /><br />The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic \"caveman meets fluffball\" yarn, where a \"charming\" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises that the script's \"wit\" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writing, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance. <br /><br />I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it. <br /><br />In one sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job. Both features show to what amazing extent Willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country).

{"value":"My God, what an incredible movie it is! Reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's movie \"We were Soldiers\" when \"the Company is not lost, they're just cut off\" And the other scene in Pearl Harbour when the British officer says to Ben Affleck \"If all Americans are like you, then God help the nation that goes to war with America!<br /><br />Put all 3 movies together and you would have enough BULLSHIT to fertilise the entire Sahara Desert.<br /><br />The story of the cut-off Battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that American preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it. There were audible groans in the cinema during the above-mentioned scene in Pearl Harbour (no kidding either) The Lost Battalion however is really in a class of its own .<br /><br />\"Americans think they are unbeatableinspired bravery. \" I actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster (the movie that is) <br /><br />The fighting scenes were well made (3 stars for that) but if the script is manure, then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons, it is still manure. The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote those other screamersHamburger Hill, No Mercy , Heartbreak Ridge.

{"value":"This is the single worst movie I have ever seen. I cannot express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end. I recommend instead of seeing this movie, you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scars.<br /><br />I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD case, and when in the beginning it added that Jesus was following them I was so excited... then by the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema... JUST PAIN! Monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash. At least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage. It would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror.<br /><br />It wasn't that I didn't get the jokes, it's that they were not only not funny, they repeated themselves like twenty times. Apparently, something isn't funny unless you see it like a million times.<br /><br />Do not under any circumstances see this. People have rated 'Manos the Hands of Fate' as the worlds worst movie. I have seen that too and agree that it is bad... but ALAS it is only the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is by far worse.<br /><br />This deserves all kind of harsh language, but I can't write that here so just imagine I swore a whole

{"value":"It's rare that I come across a film this awful, this annoying and this irritating. It is without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The plot, when it's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing, is ludicrous. Why did Domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch? Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this \"traumatic\" event left her emotionally stunted, and hating everyone. When the dialogue is not clichéd or banal, it's littered with laughable lines such as: \"There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich... the poor... and everyone else\". At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number, they blow off his arm with a shotgun. At another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go!? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast. Mickey Rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess.<br /><br />I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance being one, but all I could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot.","finished_norm":["it","rare","that","i","come","across","a","film","thi","aw","thi","annoi","and","thi","irrit","it","be","without","doubt","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","the","plot","when","it","not","a","blur","of","confus","and","pointlessli","over","flashi","edit","be","ludicr","why","do","domino","becom","such","a","badass","tough","bitch","becaus","her","gold","fish","die","when","she","be","a","kid","and","thi","traumat","event","leav","her","emotion","stunt","and","hate","everyon","when","the","dialogu","be","not","clichéd","or","banal","it","litter","with","laughabl","line","such","a","there","be","three","kind","of","peopl","in","thi","world","the","rich","the","poor","and","everyon","els","at","on","point","the","bounti","hunter","have","some","gui","tie","up","in","the","back","of","their","bu","who","have","a","combin","numb","tattoo","on","hi","arm","becaus","of","a","confus","mobil","phone","call","instead","of","roll","hi","sleev","up","and","just","read","the","numb","thei","blow","off","hi","arm","with","a","shotgun","at","anoth","point","the","bounti","hunter","take","a","bomb","to","a","meet","arrang","with","the","mafia","and","threaten","to","set","the","bomb","off","unless","the","mafia","let","them","go","clearli","not","go","to","the","meet","would","have","be","just","too","easybr","br","keira","knightlei","be","unconvinc","and","dreadfulli","miscast","mickei","rourk","doe","manag","to","salvag","some","credibl","from","thi","messbr","br","i","have","enjoi","some","of","toni","scott","previou","film","true","romanc","be","on","but","all","i","can","think","while","suffer","thi","drivel","be","that","it","must","have","be","make","by","a","complet","idiot"],"filtered":["rare","come","across","film","thi","aw","thi","annoi","thi","irrit","without","doubt","wrong","film","ever","seenbr","br","plot","blur","confus","pointlessli","flashi","edit","ludicr","domino","becom","badass","tough","bitch","becaus","gold","fish","die","kid","thi","traumat","event","leav","emotion","stunt","hate","everyon","dialogu","clichéd","banal","litter","laughabl","line","three","kind","peopl","thi","world","rich","poor","everyon","els","point","bounti","hunter","gui","tie","back","bu","combin","numb","tattoo","hi","arm","becaus","confus","mobil","phone","call","instead","roll","hi","sleev","read","numb","thei","blow","hi","arm","shotgun","anoth","point","bounti","hunter","take","bomb","meet","arrang","mafia","threaten","set","bomb","unless","mafia","let","go","clearli","go","meet","easybr","br","keira","knightlei","unconvinc","dreadfulli","miscast","mickei","rourk","doe","manag","salvag","credibl","thi","messbr","br","enjoi","toni","scott","previou","film","true","romanc","think","suffer","thi","drivel","must","make","complet","idiot"],"filtered2":["rare","come","across","aw","annoi","irrit","without","doubt","wrong","ever","seenbr","plot","blur","confus","pointlessli","flashi","edit","ludicr","domino","becom","badass","tough","bitch","becaus","gold","fish","die","kid","traumat","event","leav","emotion","stunt","hate","everyon","dialogu","clichéd","banal","litter","laughabl","line","three","kind","peopl","world","rich","poor","everyon","els","point","bounti","hunter","gui","tie","back","bu","combin","numb","tattoo","arm","becaus","confus","mobil","phone","call","instead","roll","sleev","read","numb","blow","arm","shotgun","anoth","point","bounti","hunter","take","bomb","meet","arrang","mafia","threaten","set","bomb","unless","mafia","let","go","clearli","go","meet","easybr","keira","knightlei","unconvinc","dreadfulli","miscast","mickei","rourk","doe","manag","salvag","credibl","messbr","enjoi","toni","scott","previou","true","romanc","think","suffer","drivel","must","make","complet","idiot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,12,18,22,23,25,31,32,34,44,55,63,66,73,74,103,107,109,114,115,122,124,125,138,141,142,145,146,152,165,196,200,224,246,248,271,293,304,339,345,348,350,427,460,470,494,503,516,552,567,633,706,754,784,795,892,930,937,959,968,983,991,1013,1078,1108,1175,1208,1260,1394,1398,1456,1534,1541,1546,1639,1802,1940,2015,2047,2293,2663,2789,2928,2930,3164,3499,3587,3608,3673,3814,3958,4202,4543,4552,4623,4654,4660,4916,5313,5895,5909,6030,7086],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,12,18,22,23,25,31,32,34,44,55,63,66,73,74,103,107,109,114,115,122,124,125,138,141,142,145,146,152,165,196,200,224,246,248,271,293,304,339,345,348,350,427,460,470,494,503,516,552,567,633,706,754,784,795,892,930,937,959,968,983,991,1013,1

{"value":"There's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, yet the final product is pretty debatable. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think perhaps most would agree with them. (Liberal Democracy good, violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good, racism bad, etc). Unfortunately, we're battered from head to toe with these, and as much subtlety is used as I've described them. <br /><br />Ultimately, we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated \"pro\" wrestling match.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her sister in law. When the camera stays with these folks, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. We don't get to know them, hence we don't get to care for them. The result is boredom. <br /><br />If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters, this film might have worked completely. As it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest.<br /><br />Not recommended.","finished_norm":["there","enough","star","power","in","the","hous","of","spirit","to","creat","anoth","galaxi","yet","the","final","product","be","pretti","debat","the","film","and","it","messag","be","veri","nobl","and","i","think","perhap","much","would","agre","with","them","liber","democraci","good","violent","fascist","regim","bad","openminded","good","racism","bad","etc","unfortun","we","re","batter","from","head","to","toe","with","thi","and","a","much","subtleti","be","us","a","i","have","describ","them","br","br","ultim","we","be","leav","watch","veri","nobl","peopl","without","ani","flaw","squar","off","with","nasti","cretin","who","have","no","redeem","qualiti","it","radiat","with","all","the","suspens","of","a","badli","orchestr","pro","wrestl","matchbr","br","jeremi","iron","plai","the","patron","a","man","of","mani","contradict","meryl","streep","a","hi","gift","bride","and","glenn","close","a","her","sister","in","law","when","the","camera","stai","with","thi","folk","the","movi","tend","to","move","and","be","quit","enjoy","unfortun","the","hous","of","spirit","engag","with","simpli","wai","too","mani","subplot","and","charact","pop","up","and","out","of","the","pictur","like","shoot","galleri","target","we","do","not","get","to","know","them","henc","we","do","not","get","to","care","for","them","the","result","be","boredom","br","br","if","bill","august","the","director","and","screenwrit","from","isabel","allend","book","have","either","lengthen","the","film","or","snip","a","few","charact","thi","film","mai","have","work","complet","a","it","stand","it","be","a","nice","try","with","nice","messag","and","a","bonecrush","yawnfestbr","br","not","recommend"],"filtered":["enough","star","power","hous","spirit","creat","anoth","galaxi","yet","final","product","pretti","debat","film","messag","veri","nobl","think","perhap","much","agre","liber","democraci","good","violent","fascist","regim","bad","openminded","good","racism","bad","etc","unfortun","re","batter","head","toe","thi","much","subtleti","us","describ","br","br","ultim","leav","watch","veri","nobl","peopl","without","ani","flaw","squar","nasti","cretin","redeem","qualiti","radiat","suspens","badli","orchestr","pro","wrestl","matchbr","br","jeremi","iron","plai","patron","man","mani","contradict","meryl","streep","hi","gift","bride","glenn","close","sister","law","camera","stai","thi","folk","movi","tend","move","quit","enjoy","unfortun","hous","spirit","engag","simpli","wai","mani","subplot","charact","pop","pictur","like","shoot","galleri","target","get","know","henc","get","care","result","boredom","br","br","bill","august","director","screenwrit","isabel","allend","book","either","lengthen","film","snip","charact","thi","film","mai","work","complet","stand","nice","try","nice","messag","bonecrush","yawnfestbr","br","recommend"],"filtered2":["enough","star","power","hous","spirit","creat","anoth","galaxi","yet","final","product","pretti","debat","messag","veri","nobl","think","perhap","agre","liber","democraci","good","violent","fascist","regim","bad","openminded","good","racism","bad","etc","unfortun","re","batter","head","toe","subtleti","us","describ","ultim","leav","watch","veri","nobl","peopl","without","ani","flaw","squar","nasti","cretin","redeem","qualiti","radiat","suspens","badli","orchestr","pro","wrestl","matchbr","jeremi","iron","plai","patron","man","mani","contradict","meryl","streep","gift","bride","glenn","close","sister","law","camera","stai","folk","tend","move","quit","enjoy","unfortun","hous","spirit","engag","simpli","wai","mani","subplot","charact","pop","pictur","like","shoot","galleri","target","get","know","henc","get","care","result","boredom","bill","august","director","screenwrit","isabel","allend","book","either","lengthen","snip","charact","mai","work","complet","stand","nice","try","nice","messag","bonecrush","yawnfestbr","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,7,9,10,12,15,23,26,27,33,36,40,45,46,48,50,56,58,68,73,74,78,93,100,103,117,120,125,151,156,190,194,201,205,207,208,213,227,231,262,275,295,298,311,318,319,362,365,366,377,429,447,448,529,569,585,622,634,668,722,735,736,894,921,943,952,966,1005,1029,1052,1246,1271,1409,1503,1709,1766,1887,2151,2174,2273,2274,2475,2654,2741,2903,3131,3159,3246,3403,3906,3970,3985,4016,4167,4220,5196,5419,5454,5469,5711,6315,6933,7244,7437],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,7,9,10,12,15,23,26,27,33,36,40,45,46,48,50,56,58,68,73,74,78,93,100,103,117,120,125,151,156,190,194,201,205

{"value":"........and an extremely bad one at that!!! How long did this train-wreck last?? 14 episodes or something?? I can see why now.<br /><br />I bought the \"Serenity\" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so was free. That is the ONLY good thing about the experience (incident??)<br /><br />I won't comment really on the acting, since these were, I guess, fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet. At least I've never seen them before in any type of major show, theater or TV. If I did, then I have easily forgotten them.<br /><br />But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. True, this isn't exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original Star Trek did better than this & that was THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ago. I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (reapers or something like that) ship as it chased the hilarious looking Firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket. I fully expected to eventually see the Wiley Coyote riding on top, while chasing after the Roadrunner. MODERN jet/rocket engines don't even do it that bad.<br /><br />And that wasn't even the worst of it. The wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if I was actually watching a sci-fi film or a Gene Autry one.<br /><br />Regardless of the hype, don't waste your time...I did...all 80-something minutes
