{"value":"Poor performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Grossly underdeveloped supporting characters. Annoying talky with no real plot. Ending leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels (that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. That penultimate sequence in which the \"Chicago hood\" searches for the Sinatra character is laughable. The music in that sequence also is poor. And in the final scene when Martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a \"pig,\" almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television

{"value":"I really disliked this movie....mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish, and self-centered people. They hurt EVERYBODY around them playing their silly game. The visual effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or a story line that is interesting. Am I supposed to be happy when these two psycho people FINALLY consummate their love for each other? <br /><br />After watching this movie I was thinking \"This is supposed be the #1 smash from France?\"........<br /><br />*spoiler* <br /><br />As for the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /><br />","finished_norm":["i","realli","dislik","thi","moviemainli","becaus","of","the","main","charact","thei","be","both","immatur","selfish","and","selfcent","peopl","thei","hurt","everybodi","around","them","plai","their","silli","game","the","visual","effect","be","good","but","what","good","be","thei","if","there","be","no","charact","that","you","connect","with","or","a","stori","line","that","be","interest","be","i","suppos","to","be","happi","when","thi","two","psycho","peopl","final","consumm","their","love","for","each","other","br","br","after","watch","thi","movi","i","be","think","thi","be","suppos","be","the","smash","from","francebr","br","spoiler","br","br","a","for","the","end","good","riddanc","thei","both","deserv","each","other","br","br"],"filtered":["realli","dislik","thi","moviemainli","becaus","main","charact","thei","immatur","selfish","selfcent","peopl","thei","hurt","everybodi","around","plai","silli","game","visual","effect","good","good","thei","charact","connect","stori","line","interest","suppos","happi","thi","two","psycho","peopl","final","consumm","love","br","br","watch","thi","movi","think","thi","suppos","smash","francebr","br","spoiler","br","br","end","good","riddanc","thei","deserv","br","br"],"filtered2":["realli","dislik","moviemainli","becaus","main","charact","immatur","selfish","selfcent","peopl","hurt","everybodi","around","plai","silli","game","visual","effect","good","good","charact","connect","stori","line","interest","suppos","happi","two","psycho","peopl","final","consumm","love","watch","think","suppos","smash","francebr","spoiler","end","good","riddanc","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,10,12,13,17,22,23,24,40,47,54,60,98,106,107,149,156,179,374,385,423,490,605,635,767,863,1215,1515,1725,2512,2674,3537,5104,7652],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,10,12,13,17,22,23,24,40,47,54,60,98,106,107,149,156,179,374,385,423,490,605,635,767,863,1215,1515,1725,2512,2674,3537,5104,7652],"values":[2.0358433949768115,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.6284968758320737,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.0881990796736947,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,4.650639560718045,2.3451551414151686,2.507968722980095,3.4572130107926293,3.09496984188738,3.164467636384302,3.3490645070153917,3.5474598886404074,3.587125145032839,3.79165684915245,3.944626193933877,4.291900363587903,4.605250182788262,4.789173020949191,5.1994574154933035,5.339219357868463,5.626901430320244,6.137727054086234,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1374350372241657E-4,1.1297650468575587E-4,1.1385478928103814E-4,1.131969350956366E-4,0.22459757100721223,1.1304056041341256E-4,1.1337675887853031E-4,1.1299277256422003E-4,1.1324682150769545E-4,1.256411665623809E-4,0.7665138829502752,1.1281037731714678E-4,1.1491592706743529E-4,1.1655522801822169E-4,1.128926374674599E-4,1.1258065092608653E-4,1.1538883443659845E-4,1.1338738142503356E-4,1.1303559751586913E-4,1.1312928392882278E-4,1.142238761024932E-4,1.1349971962763066E-4,1.1362895627706375E-4,1.1375137873292928E-4,1.1462436212528682E-4,1.140249089805991E-4,1.1881829953865472E-4,1.1284391480796891E-4,1.1284693364695665E-4,1.1313283071520003E-4,1.1553744254736929E-4,1.1338081159452465E-4,1.217046965630403E-4,1.136997350863202E-4,1.1296674033451326E-4,1.1348815630959898E-4,1.1285354483767988E-4,1.1292023297951466E-4,1.1258008531179376E-4,1.1260929377989609E-4,1.1286276361444905E-4,1.1405322662129176E-4,1.1347367424805526E-4,1.13025031060399E-4,1.1439840370176556E-4,1.130684106849424E-4,1.1682511249617936E-4,1.1510716516435617E-4,1.1263728334551906E-4,1.1288621862995528E-4,1.1284706543632685E-4,1.1602300605458611E-4,1.1288789816168049E-4,1.1259929664785431E-4,1.1383523507057264E-4,1.1291697508747498E-4,1.2142979681002466E-4,1.1282391682785727E-4,1.1263598075995512E-4,1.1317378450942417E-4,1.1429637333602646E-4,1.1316629741983574E-4,1.1261514285170279E-4,1.1287734996400089E-4,1.125814469878541E-4,1.1518634832456429E-4,1.1355128330560426E-4,1.133094024467924E-4,1.1321030825328017E-4,1.1362297782266339E-4,1.1257733983811956E-4,1.1321268165435988E-4,1.1504891619516577E-4,1.1277908468432059E-4,1.1557030826862697E-4,1.1307726112645756E-4,1.1396226047249935E-4,1.1326577327020253E-4,1.1254204352641675E-4,1.1268154711882078E-4]}}

Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","disgrac","to","the","major","leagu","franchis","i","live","in","minnesota","and","even","i","ca","not","believ","thei","dump","cleveland","ye","i","realiz","at","the","time","the","real","indian","be","pretti","good","and","the","twin","have","take","over","their","spot","at","the","bottom","of","the","american","leagu","but","still","be","consist","anywai","i","love","the","major","leagu","like","the","and","alwai","look","forward","to","the","when","the","indian","would","final","go","all","the","wai","to","the","seri","you","ca","not","tell","me","thi","be","not","the","plan","after","the","film","be","complet","what","happen","anywai","if","your","a","true","fan","of","the","origin","major","leagu","do","yourself","a","favor","and","do","not","watch","thi","junk"],"filtered":["thi","movi","disgrac","major","leagu","franchis","live","minnesota","even","ca","believ","thei","dump","cleveland","ye","realiz","time","real","indian","pretti","good","twin","take","spot","bottom","american","leagu","still","consist","anywai","love","major","leagu","like","alwai","look","forward","indian","final","go","wai","seri","ca","tell","thi","plan","film","complet","happen","anywai","true","fan","origin","major","leagu","favor","watch","thi","junk"],"filtered2":["disgrac","major","leagu","franchis","live","minnesota","even","ca","believ","dump","cleveland","ye","realiz","time","real","indian","pretti","good","twin","take","spot","bottom","american","leagu","still","consist","anywai","love","major","leagu","like","alwai","look","forward","indian","final","go","wai","ca","tell","plan","complet","happen","anywai","true","fan","origin","major","leagu","favor","watch","junk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,6,7,8,16,31,33,54,64,69,78,80,81,90,91,94,103,116,140,156,197,209,223,304,386,404,405,581,699,828,860,1006,1025,1115,1482,1719,2005,2166,2541,2549,7530],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,6,7,8,16,31,33,54,64,69,78,80,81,90,91,94,103,116,140,156,197,209,223,304,386,404,405,581,699,828,860,1006,1025,1115,1482,1719,2005,2166,2541,2549,7530],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1966138720291084,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.8113893252729412,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,3.899514464849456,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.317169775997098,2.3451551414151686,2.558331832813986,2.6026896854443837,2.825563294794476,2.871119826396843,6.0866465060504265,9.42598434159673,3.109204957709252,3.530930586689197,3.5813614403160887,3.827761853794566,3.8538340941043407,4.062925891962901,8.872703292652895,4.1554492608600455,4.506310234933358,4.9227044135737135,5.051537285416681,5.039114765418124,5.156897801074508,21.632848917421654,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.041276799538703E-5,7.98705259018236E-5,8.049144308023857E-5,8.00263626646169E-5,8.002767380646952E-5,7.991581111107304E-5,8.015349193055874E-5,7.988202673566382E-5,8.00616306522182E-5,8.882400881642073E-5,0.30730497847254906,7.975307953247095E-5,8.124163121262574E-5,8.240056093358724E-5,7.98112346460899E-5,7.959067082883346E-5,8.157596055289848E-5,8.016100170772869E-5,7.991230251220203E-5,7.997853560281919E-5,8.075237484313073E-5,8.024042097587877E-5,8.033178686814745E-5,8.041833535855587E-5,8.103550476776265E-5,8.061171189106776E-5,8.400047511922425E-5,7.977678939176286E-5,7.977892360770656E-5,7.998104305951562E-5,8.16810214059808E-5,8.01563570621956E-5,8.604105912330879E-5,8.038182506621121E-5,7.986362283935936E-5,8.023224610540522E-5,7.978359749349699E-5,7.983074372956239E-5,7.959027095886804E-5,7.961092034711569E-5,7.979011485346286E-5,8.06317314947961E-5,8.022200778306681E-5,7.990483238947461E-5,8.087575988834025E-5,7.993550030078362E-5,8.25913600315694E-5,8.137683000830472E-5,7.963070801298736E-5,7.980669674744807E-5,7.977901677828514E-5,8.202429820311675E-5,7.980788411895097E-5,7.960385271658573E-5,8.04776189220402E-5,7.982844051128471E-5,8.584671439734375E-5,7.976265150359813E-5,7.962978712953188E-5,8.00099959917333E-5,0.6528036862793192,8.000470287539407E-5,7.961505544089062E-5,7.98004269038572E-5,7.959123361728405E-5,0.03368964587858353,8.027687473313245E-5,8.01058732363821E-5,8.00358170298137E-5,8.032756030530268E-5,7.958833000285406E-5,8.003749494322535E-5,8.133564997874533E-5,7.973095671102562E-5,8.170425634715989E-5,7.99417572603191E-5,8.05674215379292E-5,8.007502890030894E-5,7.956337671733739E-5,7.966200098723755E-5]}}

{"value":"Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris

{"value":"Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style, Gabriele Muccino's project is rather mediocre. The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end: hearts human and emotional, eyes physical and metaphorical. Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams, with lots and lots of flashbacks. The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie. That's too bad, because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically \"good\" if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands.","finished_norm":["although","in","some","aspect","seven","pound","be","solid","and","interest","in","some","of","it","narr","styl","gabriel","muccino","project","be","rather","mediocr","the","movi","becom","much","and","much","sappi","and","manipul","a","it","move","toward","the","end","heart","human","and","emot","ey","physic","and","metaphor","seven","pound","be","much","of","a","amateurish","imit","of","alejandro","gonzález","iñárritu","amor","perro","and","gram","with","lot","and","lot","of","flashback","the","problem","be","the","stori","be","quit","predict","from","veri","easili","on","through","the","movi","that","too","bad","becaus","seven","pound","can","have","be","a","authent","good","if","ben","and","emili","have","be","put","in","the","right","hand"],"filtered":["although","aspect","seven","pound","solid","interest","narr","styl","gabriel","muccino","project","rather","mediocr","movi","becom","much","much","sappi","manipul","move","toward","end","heart","human","emot","ey","physic","metaphor","seven","pound","much","amateurish","imit","alejandro","gonzález","iñárritu","amor","perro","gram","lot","lot","flashback","problem","stori","quit","predict","veri","easili","movi","bad","becaus","seven","pound","authent","good","ben","emili","put","right","hand"],"filtered2":["although","aspect","seven","pound","solid","interest","narr","styl","gabriel","muccino","project","rather","mediocr","becom","sappi","manipul","move","toward","end","heart","human","emot","ey","physic","metaphor","seven","pound","amateurish","imit","alejandro","gonzález","iñárritu","amor","perro","gram","lot","lot","flashback","problem","stori","quit","predict","veri","easili","bad","becaus","seven","pound","authent","good","ben","emili","put","right","hand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,15,17,22,24,60,72,115,120,121,159,160,167,235,237,275,281,292,337,380,506,563,583,614,645,660,787,854,970,1051,1188,1198,1508,1520,1684,1799,2389,2432,2784,2870,3196,3303,3683,5566],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,15,17,22,24,60,72,115,120,121,159,160,167,235,237,275,281,292,337,380,506,563,583,614,645,660,787,854,970,1051,1188,1198,1508,1520,1684,1799,2389,2432,2784,2870,3196,3303,3683,5566],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.838176641236591,3.841892750832105,2.201553588425805,2.2044500422972613,2.2190595059394194,2.300267965194495,2.3722295531801256,2.4609576687888097,2.6457189377809835,2.640097787510554,2.7832848715031413,2.832333801361687,2.9752256367457734,2.973659465713028,3.102062070196872,3.449627639403373,3.459754308221302,3.4986697244709752,3.553030933689863,3.558633189238533,3.6405503117064195,3.760240652919071,4.291900363587903,4.086456389373095,4.191816905030921,4.213208095012239,4.34596758485818,14.25429807889903,4.550761997504193,4.724033718778229,4.8085911068062925,5.170884043049248,15.642168644743368,6.0662680901040895,5.408212229355414,7.0356686472921925,5.541743621979936,6.0662680901040895,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.90914391617149E-5,6.862553943518755E-5,6.915903756647165E-5,6.875943591063669E-5,6.876056245657959E-5,6.866444893125119E-5,6.886866662315235E-5,6.863542106445351E-5,6.878973851158497E-5,7.631845979473577E-5,0.5076178309570447,6.852462836241663E-5,6.980360656963844E-5,7.079937035572162E-5,6.857459580657646E-5,6.838508521091927E-5,0.04123696103929633,6.887511909737245E-5,6.866143430867965E-5,6.871834242992639E-5,6.938323269705411E-5,0.0612875448126867,6.902185938271461E-5,6.909622269476892E-5,6.962650070598137E-5,0.052109955017439966,7.217403232019031E-5,6.854500010612895E-5,6.854683384540579E-5,6.87204968613197E-5,7.018113493446461E-5,6.887112837236352E-5,7.392732211591856E-5,6.906485269339734E-5,6.861960825619487E-5,6.89363329828087E-5,6.855084969393068E-5,6.859135820249247E-5,6.838474163872201E-5,6.840248379568795E-5,6.85564494735528E-5,6.927957474857749E-5,6.892753611581113E-5,6.865501590594563E-5,6.948924633838342E-5,6.868136607621391E-5,7.096330681256763E-5,6.991977070127146E-5,6.841948555233438E-5,6.857069679954374E-5,6.854691389848096E-5,0.3325585333637726,6.85717170007879E-5,6.839641121819867E-5,6.914715971412389E-5,6.858937925475225E-5,7.37603392207248E-5,6.853285269391618E-5,6.841869432023498E-5,6.87453735047277E-5,6.942726983355976E-5,6.87408256072402E-5,6.840603670882724E-5,6.856530968841934E-5,6.838556876427734E-5,6.996786908330744E-5,6.897467833758697E-5,6.882775217394631E-5,6.876755919396709E-5,6.901822787845312E-5,6.83830739502728E-5,6.876900087363177E-5,6.98843884158719E-5,6.850562021719196E-5,7.020109862387515E-5,6.868674211723153E-5,6.922431900271614E-5,6.880125041778982E-5,6.836163384254936E-5,6.8446372782814E-5]}}
{"value":"As a Turkish man now living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies. Most if them I never understand. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a film called \"The Polish Wedding\" together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie \" House of Angels\" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the female so called star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so silly nobody can believe it.I think the whole thing is a mess from the start. lots of bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter.

{"value":"Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible. It carries no semblance of a genuine human story, dead and dull. It is a parody of Hollywood, with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a Denzel Washington movie, wobbly camera shots and focusing, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses. It is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot for watching this, save

day.","finished_norm":["movi","like","thi","be","to","the","origin","what","album","orient","rock","station","be","to","what","music","us","to","be","like","repetit","bore","and","drain","of","all","the","origin","energi","by","a","committe","of","corpor","drone","i","be","glad","that","aragorn","be","not","typecast","a","a","expect","psycho","by","thi","po","go","back","and","watch","the","version","count","the","thing","that","would","never","be","includ","in","a","modern","version","and","thank","whatev","deiti","you","worship","that","someon","somewher","in","the","distant","past","have","the","ball","to","write","and","shoot","a","origin","concept","movi","that","be","not","base","on","someon","els","idea","and","be","not","pass","through","a","corpor","board","befor","it","see","the","light","of","dai"],"filtered":["movi","like","thi","origin","album","orient","rock","station","music","us","like","repetit","bore","drain","origin","energi","committe","corpor","drone","glad","aragorn","typecast","expect","psycho","thi","po","go","back","watch","version","count","thing","never","includ","modern","version","thank","whatev","deiti","worship","someon","somewher","distant","past","ball","write","shoot","origin","concept","movi","base","someon","els","idea","pass","corpor","board","befor","see","light","dai"],"filtered2":["like","origin","album","orient","rock","station","music","us","like","repetit","bore","drain","origin","energi","committe","corpor","drone","glad","aragorn","typecast","expect","psycho","po","go","back","watch","version","count","thing","never","includ","modern","version","thank","whatev","deiti","worship","someon","somewher","distant","past","ball","write","shoot","origin","concept","base","someon","els","idea","pass","corpor","board","befor","see","light","dai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,29,42,56,63,65,69,79,108,117,118,123,130,132,139,196,220,301,334,353,440,487,556,582,651,726,729,804,884,1227,1259,1311,1333,1373,1725,1835,2709,2875,3317,3519,3539,3760,4643,5962,5991,6631],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,29,42,56,63,65,69,79,108,117,118,123,130,132,139,196,220,301,334,353,440,487,556,582,651,726,729,804,884,1227,1259,1311,1333,1373,1725,1835,2709,2875,3317,3519,3539,3760,4643,5962,5991,6631],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.3195384777338066,1.6219954307453837,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,6.381097563453174,1.9469506069506084,2.138507503627933,2.2797301185117202,2.354379525480895,2.2619070973220485,2.2642139034199635,2.253494045787767,4.587807168251287,2.478925055209576,5.667386841755453,2.8309760279012264,2.942840385588056,3.0266839340212486,3.212973749990824,3.3220965805878846,3.4471119148061256,3.7099788181381825,3.5474598886404074,3.7034641371169887,3.7952092507568174,3.7740817043309423,3.9323057095458362,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.506310234933358,4.436351646326448,4.443131333311827,4.789173020949191,4.828393734102471,10.852461469716184,5.373120909544144,5.695894301807195,5.695894301807195,5.695894301807195,5.7446844659766265,6.214688095222362,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.655608337073964E-5,6.610728014102863E-5,6.662120120758465E-5,6.623626319726781E-5,6.623734840386658E-5,6.614476182754935E-5,0.058095866393606595,6.611679915741104E-5,6.626545382434887E-5,7.3517903729519E-5,0.65848072004308,6.601007206642692E-5,0.08601038754087943,6.820134090653558E-5,6.60582059223673E-5,6.587564954263007E-5,6.75188352167947E-5,6.634770131339906E-5,6.614185782853534E-5,6.619667766885312E-5,6.683716935043133E-5,6.641343509627969E-5,6.648905686748181E-5,6.656069136890284E-5,6.707151047981061E-5,6.672074536207647E-5,6.95255587463119E-5,6.602969625560832E-5,6.603146270461661E-5,6.61987530419698E-5,6.760579204058104E-5,6.634385703066842E-5,7.121451042011374E-5,6.653047251035887E-5,6.610156661054913E-5,6.640666891505815E-5,6.603533118893928E-5,6.607435321114309E-5,6.58753185780405E-5,6.589240967489024E-5,6.604072548096603E-5,6.673731519853414E-5,6.639819485487942E-5,6.613567495331004E-5,0.05609442289967837,6.616105818675384E-5,6.835926160730154E-5,6.735401873978444E-5,6.590878754089707E-5,6.605444999196145E-5,6.603153982009155E-5,6.788991556597358E-5,6.605543275625011E-5,6.588655993462495E-5,6.660975922083904E-5,6.607244688219146E-5,7.105365507205838E-5,6.60179946006742E-5,6.590802534357983E-5,6.622271682059036E-5,6.687959051525638E-5,6.621833581119163E-5,6.58958322115457E-5,6.604926056442203E-5,6.58761153516797E-5,0.1363192288113465,6.644360716182893E-5,6.630207255037406E-5,6.624408839137495E-5,6.64855586236571E-5,6.587371208651551E-5,6.624547716765635E-5,6.731993483061317E-5,6.599176143759002E

{"value":"I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick, but this is just bad. And not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3K make fun of it. It's just nauseatingly bad like you can't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try. I truly regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap. You can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers. Apparently \"Walking Tall\" has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment. If it's not the worst film I've seen, it's so bad that it's blotted the worse films from my memory.","finished_norm":["i","can","enjoi","a","guilti","pleasur","vigilant","flick","but","thi","be","just","bad","and","not","bad","in","a","wai","you","mai","enjoi","see","mstk","make","fun","of","it","it","just","nauseatingli","bad","like","you","ca","not","find","anyth","to","enjoi","about","thi","no","matt","how","hard","you","try","i","truli","regret","wast","hour","of","preciou","life","on","thi","crap","you","can","tell","by","watch","it","that","no","on","be","ask","to","act","and","everyon","in","it","know","thi","film","would","onli","buri","their","career","appar","walk","tall","have","garner","enough","incom","that","someon","decid","thei","can","make","a","buck","off","their","invest","if","it","not","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","it","so","bad","that","it","blot","the","wrong","film","from","my","memori"],"filtered":["enjoi","guilti","pleasur","vigilant","flick","thi","bad","bad","wai","mai","enjoi","see","mstk","make","fun","nauseatingli","bad","like","ca","find","anyth","enjoi","thi","matt","hard","try","truli","regret","wast","hour","preciou","life","thi","crap","tell","watch","ask","act","everyon","know","thi","film","onli","buri","career","appar","walk","tall","garner","enough","incom","someon","decid","thei","make","buck","invest","wrong","film","see","bad","blot","wrong","film","memori"],"filtered2":["enjoi","guilti","pleasur","vigilant","flick","bad","bad","wai","mai","enjoi","see","mstk","make","fun","nauseatingli","bad","like","ca","find","anyth","enjoi","matt","hard","try","truli","regret","wast","hour","preciou","life","crap","tell","watch","ask","act","everyon","know","onli","buri","career","appar","walk","tall","garner","enough","incom","someon","decid","make","buck","invest","wrong","see","bad","blot","wrong","memori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,9,11,21,25,26,33,36,38,46,75,81,89,90,93,104,139,171,174,200,246,249,257,259,294,306,308,313,343,408,511,1068,1407,1547,1638,1677,1767,2038,2155,2540,2552,3166,5510,7736],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,9,11,21,25,26,33,36,38,46,75,81,89,90,93,104,139,171,174,200,246,249,257,259,294,306,308,313,343,408,511,1068,1407,1547,1638,1677,1767,2038,2155,2540,2552,3166,5510,7736],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,4.273428342688829,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.655771293751733,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.035389827120098,2.0728240170322856,2.2939035841256437,2.373087554090762,2.456282578459816,7.592463548795911,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.7602659523229094,2.7464553122240485,2.886778509330039,2.8739486825973213,2.8753661172782943,2.907069060519773,2.9705344631698933,3.130944944345658,3.3909310864081816,4.1554492608600455,4.443131333311827,4.77960356993304,4.589376833631972,4.679973728984199,4.77960356993304,4.979216623837056,4.9676558014359795,5.156897801074508,5.390512652256013,5.649374286172302,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.406551005333404E-5,8.34986366661325E-5,8.414775894615805E-5,8.366155229851105E-5,8.366292299885307E-5,8.354597895154723E-5,8.379445639882408E-5,8.351065992421599E-5,8.369842233097192E-5,9.28588306593625E-5,0.7473165138835695,8.337585530703155E-5,8.49320243004946E-5,8.614359828976688E-5,8.343665211095288E-5,8.32060692040439E-5,8.528154051808626E-5,8.380230730688156E-5,8.354231097491843E-5,8.361155269714667E-5,8.442054350865319E-5,8.388533418745706E-5,8.398085036637388E-5,8.407133031342592E-5,8.471653458219651E-5,8.427349095586133E-5,8.781618841954397E-5,8.340064218434413E-5,8.340287334683666E-5,8.361417405481631E-5,8.539137375006143E-5,8.379745167878306E-5,8.994946575082402E-5,8.40331615446512E-5,8.349142003273642E-5,8.387678797429825E-5,8.340775954342828E-5,8.345704739261862E-5,8.320565117002474E-5,8.322723855469762E-5,8.341457295382806E-5,8.429441994811521E-5,8.386608457717706E-5,8.353450152260263E-5,0.18228324888188552,8.356656252075916E-5,8.634306441796316E-5,8.507336448813747E-5,8.324792507334055E-5,8.343190807871264E-5,8.340297074967957E-5,8.575024386186214E-5,8.343314938644901E-5,8.321984987774765E-5,8.41333068269365E-5,8.345463955087777E-5,8.974629293484331E-5,8.338586208400343E-5,8.32469623588449E-5,8.36444421711254E-5,8.447412473936068E-5,8.363890861549831E-5,8.323156148469957E-5,8.342535342809482E-5,8.320665755710438E-5,8.51318871512583E-5,8.392344385303986E-5,8.37446746301594E-5,8.36714361273148E-5,8.397643181232861E-5,8.320362204627519E-5,8.367319025977772E-5,8.503031385979546E-5,8.335272755860326E-5,8.541566413615276E-5,8.357310370206466E-5,8.422718871779824E-5,0.06391549268744641,8.317753526022417E-5,

{"value":"I really like slasher movies,but this one is truly awful.The acting is lame,the script is bad,and the atmosphere is non-existent.The plot is as follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town.That's right-this is the plot.Very original,eh!\"The Night Brings Charlie\" isn't even gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be scary,at least they should make

{"value":"Very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that I really didn't care who would fare the best (or was that the purpose of the film, to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted New York city folks?) No romance here, no comedy either. Acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. What annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies. Man, can't you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget is no excuse at all, first-time director neither.

{"value":"This is a low-budget \"Scream\" style movie. \"Maddy\" is a new worker at a conspicuously-unnamed office, where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker \"Chris\". During a hot tub-party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy they belong to a \"Murder Club\" where everyone has killed someone for kicks. When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks ensue.<br /><br />The film looks good, and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast), but, after the credits roll, you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","lowbudget","scream","styl","movi","maddi","be","a","new","worker","at","a","conspicuouslyunnam","offic","where","she","meet","and","start","a","relationship","with","her","cowork","chri","dure","a","hot","tubparti","chri","and","hi","friend","convinc","maddi","thei","belong","to","a","murder","club","where","everyon","have","kill","someon","for","kick","when","maddi","lose","it","and","kill","someon","for","real","hijink","ensuebr","br","the","film","look","good","and","there","be","the","requisit","for","thi","genr","and","budget","level","nuditi","gore","mayb","a","few","cameo","from","slightli","big","star","than","the","cast","but","after","the","credit","roll","you","will","ask","yourself","why","you","spend","minut","of","your","life","watch","it"],"filtered":["thi","lowbudget","scream","styl","movi","maddi","new","worker","conspicuouslyunnam","offic","meet","start","relationship","cowork","chri","dure","hot","tubparti","chri","hi","friend","convinc","maddi","thei","belong","murder","club","everyon","kill","someon","kick","maddi","lose","kill","someon","real","hijink","ensuebr","br","film","look","good","requisit","thi","genr","budget","level","nuditi","gore","mayb","cameo","slightli","big","star","cast","credit","roll","ask","spend","minut","life","watch"],"filtered2":["lowbudget","scream","styl","maddi","new","worker","conspicuouslyunnam","offic","meet","start","relationship","cowork","chri","dure","hot","tubparti","chri","friend","convinc","maddi","belong","murder","club","everyon","kill","someon","kick","maddi","lose","kill","someon","real","hijink","ensuebr","look","good","requisit","genr","budget","level","nuditi","gore","mayb","cameo","slightli","big","star","cast","credit","roll","ask","spend","minut","life","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,16,59,71,75,76,80,82,87,92,100,139,161,163,221,239,246,256,273,283,306,350,356,358,380,445,467,478,526,577,587,612,666,795,869,965,1035,1140,1199,1222,1540,2285,3789,6077],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,16,59,71,75,76,80,82,87,92,100,139,161,163,221,239,246,256,273,283,306,350,356,358,380,445,467,478,526,577,587,612,666,795,869,965,1035,1140,1199,1222,1540,2285,3789,6077],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.8693254449200722,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,4.267533106664805,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.115024371522662,2.0489535369135887,2.1405462403177813,4.587807168251287,2.4323182980210873,2.4000574358028657,2.6423424573643777,2.6593400337329487,2.673149229007135,2.748952192422636,2.9674191958529437,2.7678802023081546,2.8739486825973213,3.0135689919434205,3.028335462059722,3.2030824725120812,3.102062070196872,3.241201430615691,3.342254038012865,3.3243163373261977,3.5119855004467477,3.604618302480356,3.6105180246075443,3.5929222627171646,3.6621227969605474,3.784589681929357,3.9161110236258554,3.9868265484242533,4.2860694432771105,9.116733193778822,4.291900363587903,4.3336974922663645,4.528289141652134,5.064116067623542,5.770002273960917,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.312461426474699E-5,8.256408555781137E-5,8.320594259411015E-5,8.272517777137879E-5,8.272653313027842E-5,8.261089796888238E-5,0.09488237929985815,8.25759742466418E-5,8.27616351392612E-5,9.181951640735736E-5,0.6761938402305047,8.24426784182164E-5,8.398143012780941E-5,8.517944368232854E-5,8.250279475928522E-5,8.227479263117474E-5,8.432703441603828E-5,8.286435739176302E-5,8.26072710457577E-5,8.267573778613194E-5,8.347567403950791E-5,8.294645500131853E-5,8.304090212384793E-5,8.31303693820924E-5,8.376835225913076E-5,8.333026735941147E-5,8.683331349496081E-5,8.246718787059622E-5,8.24693940609998E-5,8.267832980448763E-5,8.443563834927553E-5,8.285955610985271E-5,0.17190937672859194,8.309262781388749E-5,8.255694969594653E-5,8.293800444089487E-5,8.24742255692681E-5,8.252296176856417E-5,8.227437927596436E-5,8.229572504574296E-5,8.248096272117437E-5,8.335096210576999E-5,8.292742084059962E-5,0.05069025927623944,8.360322013131349E-5,8.263125115831583E-5,8.537667730352086E-5,8.412118837789873E-5,8.2316180032355E-5,8.249810382420639E-5,8.246949037367001E-5,8.479049183907955E-5,8.249933123871565E-5,8.228841906590648E-5,8.31916522289552E-5,8.25205808763791E-5,8.874181548612361E-5,8.245257319522179E-5,8.231522809295621E-5,8.270825914758109E-5,8.352865556702812E-5,8.270278752578612E-5,8.229999959173308E-5,8.249162253593607E-5,8.22753743991456E-5,8.417905603128689E-5,8.298413812783876E-5,8.280736976367944E-5,8.273495097630252E-5,8.303653302407813E-5,8.227237286300299E-5,8.273668547579295E-5,8.40786195899081E-5,8.241980952506754E-5,8.445965686736817E-5,8.26377191280279E-5,8.328448335505406E-5,8.277548523088387E-5,8.224657805099837E-5,8.234852833323543E-5]}}

{"value":"The cover on the DVD and disc is freaking awesome, you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea, but this movie's actors are worst then Ben's performance in pearl harbor, porno's have better quality and better actors. i was gonna buy the DVD but luckily i rented it first, the plot and script are also horrible, nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense. The poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80's sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your

There are some great actors here but you would never know it. Thank God it didn't destroy Morgan Freeman's or Judd Hirsh's or Nick Nolte's or Laura Dern's careers.

{"value":"Cheap and mind-blisteringly dull story and acting. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic, and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable. The 'homoerotic' overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying, and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake.","finished_norm":["cheap","and","mindblisteringli","dull","stori","and","act","not","a","singl","good","line","not","even","a","line","bad","enough","to","be","good","and","no","memor","deliveri","even","the","blooper","reel","includ","with","the","dvd","show","how","inept","the","actor","be","and","how","littl","fun","ani","of","them","be","have","the","esoter","and","occult","basi","be","apathet","inauthent","and","the","antagonist","fail","to","be","creepi","or","believ","the","homoerot","overton","be","pointlessli","tame","and","dissatisfi","and","be","limit","to","young","boi","caress","their","chest","while","flaccid","in","their","boxer","i","be","not","gai","enough","to","appreci","it","but","a","littl","action","mai","have","at","littl","keep","me","and","my","girlfriend","awak"],"filtered":["cheap","mindblisteringli","dull","stori","act","singl","good","line","even","line","bad","enough","good","memor","deliveri","even","blooper","reel","includ","dvd","show","inept","actor","littl","fun","ani","esoter","occult","basi","apathet","inauthent","antagonist","fail","creepi","believ","homoerot","overton","pointlessli","tame","dissatisfi","limit","young","boi","caress","chest","flaccid","boxer","gai","enough","appreci","littl","action","mai","littl","keep","girlfriend","awak"],"filtered2":["cheap","mindblisteringli","dull","stori","act","singl","good","line","even","line","bad","enough","good","memor","deliveri","even","blooper","reel","includ","dvd","show","inept","actor","littl","fun","ani","esoter","occult","basi","apathet","inauthent","antagonist","fail","creepi","believ","homoerot","overton","pointlessli","tame","dissatisfi","limit","young","boi","caress","chest","flaccid","boxer","gai","enough","appreci","littl","action","mai","littl","keep","girlfriend","awak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,14,17,21,27,28,41,46,91,93,107,129,134,135,215,247,259,282,301,351,367,443,640,730,755,961,1027,1074,1414,2034,2113,2158,2294,2621,2649,4043,5895,6130,6156,6842,7658,8149,8151,8241],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,14,17,21,27,28,41,46,91,93,107,129,134,135,215,247,259,282,301,351,367,443,640,730,755,961,1027,1074,1414,2034,2113,2158,2294,2621,2649,4043,5895,6130,6156,6842,7658,8149,8151,8241],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.852034211452262,1.0683570856722073,3.3525245991777624,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,2.0105926690411424,4.070779654240196,4.287906797278791,2.4106958340079214,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.605934685587711,2.7303758068497004,2.7464553122240485,2.918851229218033,2.8309760279012264,3.0135689919434205,3.0791938792932125,3.239158528985891,3.9998419165363233,3.767137231978131,3.79165684915245,3.9954846111673676,4.072271754381138,4.110553940952155,4.449957298382227,4.890269137820559,5.00274712124725,5.064116067623542,5.116075806554253,5.259176650194926,5.339219357868463,5.850044981634453,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.015946251054839E-5,6.968636085289639E-5,7.022810585915783E-5,6.982232711533854E-5,6.982347107555717E-5,6.972587181638916E-5,6.993324632866983E-5,6.969639523351488E-5,6.985309813734935E-5,0.0567111314023009,0.41494418645484954,6.958388988525018E-5,7.088263868351099E-5,7.189379509980079E-5,6.963462973186234E-5,6.944218965979723E-5,7.117433821580898E-5,6.993979854597255E-5,6.972281059343797E-5,6.97805984069153E-5,7.045576662364604E-5,7.000909118823937E-5,7.008880715938634E-5,7.01643199880021E-5,7.070279509720844E-5,7.033303938321016E-5,7.328970674574404E-5,6.96045765377009E-5,6.960643862312867E-5,0.06238756017748881,0.11480499732561752,0.03251998327811505,0.1760652509649179,0.024945570583216423,6.968033798906218E-5,7.000195868263344E-5,6.961051654909822E-5,6.965165124280675E-5,6.944184077662175E-5,6.945985719387418E-5,6.961620289075258E-5,0.11257288397462582,6.999302583266223E-5,6.971629297430226E-5,7.056341903593755E-5,6.97430504685087E-5,7.206026570509935E-5,7.100059849354333E-5,6.947712176561449E-5,6.963067045353409E-5,6.960651991367342E-5,7.156550903788988E-5,6.963170642516547E-5,6.945369074578928E-5,7.021604439761339E-5,6.96496417042666E-5,7.490053495932024E-5,6.959224134940432E-5,6.947631830255903E-5,6.980804733115472E-5,7.050048449123177E-5,6.980342913174901E-5,6.946346502835012E-5,6.962520006783133E-5,6.944268068797828E-5,7.10494403858561E-5,7.004089678428049E-5,6.989169941924024E-5,6.983057596930941E-5,7.008511951891769E-5,6.944014730885423E-5,6.983203993462282E-5,7.096466926473949E-5,6.956458790994807E-5,7.128627521526983E-5,6.97485096129817E-5,7.029439642329138E-5,6.986478799591366E-5,6.9418375777

{"value":"Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud. As a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.<br /><br />A 3 out of 10. Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type.<br /><br />I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well, because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - CATCH-22, M.A.S.H., HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others).

No wonder us Australians/New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from the acting to the editing.

{"value":"When I was a kid, I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our \"Uncle\" Phil. We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. The Doctor/Professor villain of this film I think might have been responsible for them being them back, but I don't care about him. The kids might like this, but personally it is just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing.

You'd never know by watching it though. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees were faking. Cinematography? Well, there must've been a camera there. Period.

{"value":"I find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humour is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage. However she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. Can't say the same for her co star Lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system.

{"value":"and not in a fun-to-watch way. it's just bad. it's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it's not scary, the special effects aren't special--oh no! the blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh gee--the mirror turned into water! the hair, clothes and makeup in the '50s scenes aren't accurate, and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high-school version of himself. this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff. i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else,

{"value":"The reason the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film, a modest sea story at best.<br /><br />Distributed for television thru Allied Artists, DVD's (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television print. Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b/w prints, because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway. Striking b/w prints for television was also cheaper, as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated
