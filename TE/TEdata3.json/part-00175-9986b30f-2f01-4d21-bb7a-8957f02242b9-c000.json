{"value":"Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other. We haven't seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like. Always sounds great on paper when you're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to writing it. Great ideas like all vampires are female. Ergo hot, seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way. And all zombies are men. well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right? So it all looks good up to actually making it. Then the rot starts to set in. Mosters have fight. Nothing much happens. Another fight. Philosophical noodling and cods wallop. Eureka we've found how to win. Big fight again and the End. Sounds great doesn't it? If it was made an indie company it would be great. But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks: gloss instead of what the fans want. It all could have been gore soaked beautiful.","finished_norm":["featur","of","earli","centuri","cinema","of","let","pit","differ","evil","creatur","and","bad","gui","against","each","other","we","have","not","see","stuff","like","thi","sinc","godzilla","v","king","kong","and","the","like","alwai","sound","great","on","paper","when","you","re","splice","up","and","in","a","haze","of","the","good","stuff","you","have","a","inspir","idea","and","see","the","whole","plai","out","befor","you","like","beethoven","symphoni","then","you","come","to","write","it","great","idea","like","all","vampir","be","femal","ergo","hot","seduct","deadli","but","in","a","wai","i","want","to","perish","sort","of","wai","and","all","zombi","be","man","good","that","what","man","be","like","to","a","woman","just","after","she","be","dump","or","cheat","on","right","so","it","all","look","good","up","to","actual","make","it","then","the","rot","start","to","set","in","moster","have","fight","noth","much","happen","anoth","fight","philosoph","noodl","and","cod","wallop","eureka","we","have","find","how","to","win","big","fight","again","and","the","end","sound","great","doe","not","it","if","it","be","make","a","indi","compani","it","would","be","great","but","thi","be","hollywood","with","the","ey","on","the","buck","gloss","instead","of","what","the","fan","want","it","all","can","have","be","gore","soak","beauti"],"filtered":["featur","earli","centuri","cinema","let","pit","differ","evil","creatur","bad","gui","see","stuff","like","thi","sinc","godzilla","v","king","kong","like","alwai","sound","great","paper","re","splice","haze","good","stuff","inspir","idea","see","whole","plai","befor","like","beethoven","symphoni","come","write","great","idea","like","vampir","femal","ergo","hot","seduct","deadli","wai","want","perish","sort","wai","zombi","man","good","man","like","woman","dump","cheat","right","look","good","actual","make","rot","start","set","moster","fight","noth","much","happen","anoth","fight","philosoph","noodl","cod","wallop","eureka","find","win","big","fight","end","sound","great","doe","make","indi","compani","great","thi","hollywood","ey","buck","gloss","instead","fan","want","gore","soak","beauti"],"filtered2":["featur","earli","centuri","cinema","let","pit","differ","evil","creatur","bad","gui","see","stuff","like","sinc","godzilla","v","king","kong","like","alwai","sound","great","paper","re","splice","haze","good","stuff","inspir","idea","see","whole","plai","befor","like","beethoven","symphoni","come","write","great","idea","like","vampir","femal","ergo","hot","seduct","deadli","wai","want","perish","sort","wai","zombi","man","good","man","like","woman","dump","cheat","right","look","good","actual","make","rot","start","set","moster","fight","noth","happen","anoth","fight","philosoph","noodl","cod","wallop","eureka","find","win","big","fight","end","sound","great","doe","make","indi","compani","great","hollywood","ey","buck","gloss","instead","fan","want","gore","soak","beauti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,9,16,18,24,33,34,37,38,40,45,49,51,52,55,65,68,70,71,73,79,82,94,109,111,121,123,124,140,152,162,178,197,204,232,266,268,269,281,300,305,321,325,358,361,409,422,485,489,541,666,761,882,909,1163,1399,1404,1407,1417,1834,1944,2072,2166,2226,2878,3033,3163,3467,4434,6439,6550,8067,8558],"values":[2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,9,16,18,24,33,34,37,38,40,45,49,51,52,55,65,68,70,71,73,79,82,94,109,111,121,123,124,140,152,162,178,197,204,232,266,268,269,281,300,305,321,325,358,361,409,422,485,489,541,666,761,882,909,1163,1399,1404,1407,1417,1834,1944,2072,2166,2226,2878,3033,3163,3467,4434,6439,6550,8067,8558],"values":[1.2399534312410465,3.230191472788289,1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,2.803707089537043,1.3982850089458962,2.975308642954861,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,3.632592212924433,1.6920303308087352,6.855959723323929,1.7122153074726136,1.9536997889255368,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,1.9469506069506084,2.020196584395323,2.08112281984698,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.2190595059394194,4.523814194644097,2.2323930368088845,2.317169775997098,2.3131195476980753,2.3586007221245198,5.065666512090782,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,8.513350218387755,2.747702973022204,3.6746621462132825,2.76533567167316,2.832333801361687,2.932274249550174,2.8612813773965557,3.09496984188738,2.973659465713028,3.2030824725120812,6.079946332279863,3.2209578243390444,3.2090054908152035,4.160564361526816,3.3956930001684253,3.8023521382691974,3.6621227969605474,

{"value":"Booted out of heaven, a gang of horny naked female angels (with big plastic fangs) have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by. It's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes An independent low budget horror made in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting, effects and direction I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled 'shock' moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateurish. Throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have one real bad movie on your hands.<br /><br />Some fun may be derived from the film's sheer shoddiness, and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour, but most will find this a chore to sit through.","finished_norm":["boot","out","of","heaven","a","gang","of","horni","nake","femal","angel","with","big","plastic","fang","have","take","up","resid","in","a","spooki","forest","where","thei","fee","upon","ani","hapless","soul","who","should","wander","by","it","not","long","befor","a","group","of","friend","on","a","road","trip","be","fall","victim","to","the","bloodthirsti","babe","a","independ","low","budget","horror","make","in","the","uk","forest","of","the","damn","take","a","interest","premis","and","flush","it","down","the","pan","with","some","of","the","wrong","act","effect","and","direct","i","have","see","in","a","long","timebr","br","director","johann","robert","show","some","occasion","flair","behind","the","camera","the","scene","in","the","delapid","hous","be","fairli","tens","and","there","be","some","deftli","handl","shock","moment","but","for","the","much","part","the","film","be","technic","amateurish","throw","in","some","truli","aw","perform","from","horror","icon","tom","savini","and","shaun","hutson","and","you","have","on","real","bad","movi","on","your","handsbr","br","some","fun","mai","be","deriv","from","the","film","sheer","shoddi","and","there","be","load","of","femal","nuditi","for","the","gui","to","savour","but","much","will","find","thi","a","chore","to","sit","through"],"filtered":["boot","heaven","gang","horni","nake","femal","angel","big","plastic","fang","take","resid","spooki","forest","thei","fee","upon","ani","hapless","soul","wander","long","befor","group","friend","road","trip","fall","victim","bloodthirsti","babe","independ","low","budget","horror","make","uk","forest","damn","take","interest","premis","flush","pan","wrong","act","effect","direct","see","long","timebr","br","director","johann","robert","show","occasion","flair","behind","camera","scene","delapid","hous","fairli","tens","deftli","handl","shock","moment","much","part","film","technic","amateurish","throw","truli","aw","perform","horror","icon","tom","savini","shaun","hutson","real","bad","movi","handsbr","br","fun","mai","deriv","film","sheer","shoddi","load","femal","nuditi","gui","savour","much","find","thi","chore","sit"],"filtered2":["boot","heaven","gang","horni","nake","femal","angel","big","plastic","fang","take","resid","spooki","forest","fee","upon","ani","hapless","soul","wander","long","befor","group","friend","road","trip","fall","victim","bloodthirsti","babe","independ","low","budget","horror","make","uk","forest","damn","take","interest","premis","flush","pan","wrong","act","effect","direct","see","long","timebr","director","johann","robert","show","occasion","flair","behind","camera","scene","delapid","hous","fairli","tens","deftli","handl","shock","moment","part","technic","amateurish","throw","truli","aw","perform","horror","icon","tom","savini","shaun","hutson","real","bad","handsbr","fun","mai","deriv","sheer","shoddi","load","femal","nuditi","gui","savour","find","chore","sit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,19,21,25,27,28,31,38,46,55,58,60,61,79,80,82,83,99,102,105,106,138,161,170,188,213,217,231,244,256,259,310,343,393,410,422,484,508,535,539,612,630,759,819,889,893,944,945,997,1007,1036,1043,1080,1099,1188,1210,1242,1250,1296,1543,1626,1637,1737,1838,1964,2375,2381,2511,2560,2576,2610,2876,3123,3272,3359,4183,4187,4539,4705,4782,5294,6816],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,19,21,25,27,28,31,38,46,55,58,60,61,79,80,82,83,99,102,105,106,138,161,170,188,213,217,231,244,256,259,310,343,393,410,422,484,508,535,539,612,630,759,819,889,893,944,945,997,1007,1036,1043,1080,1099,1188,1210,1242,1250,1296,1543,1626,1637,1737,1838,1964,2375,2381,2511,2560,2576,2610,2876,3123,3272,3359,4183,4187,4539,4705,4782,5294,6816],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,2.814133962290301,1.519311641348122,1.655771293751733,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,4.584637595480144,4.112860414513218,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.159084361316692,2.2907365189289424,2.4323182980210873,2.4071371113909277,2.5378812223426954,2.8432628718938773,2.6113665294700725,2.7049353070058615,2.634508058031767,2.748952192422636,2.7464553122240485,2.854312708080462,2.9705344631698933,3.120015873813468,3.2070272508030975,6.418010981630407,3.291526514503207,3.4149707055943286,3.4986697244709752,3.6105180246075443,3.5929222627171646,3.558633189238533,3.969732115064953,3.835141961092188,3.9571003681590526,4.017463517886143

Not to be mean, but Lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie. Was she the directors daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. She had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame. The movie just loses so much in translation. CS books don't translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books, or even Harry Potter.<br /><br />One thing they did right! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces ( beavers, wolf) look silly, Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around.

{"value":"<br /><br />I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came on right after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I don't know why, stop asking.<br /><br />---SPOILERS--- Okay... It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie. In the first movie, he had a \"reason\" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to \"look real when they died\"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie HAD potential. And the saddest thing of all... the really sad part... I would watch a \"Cabin by the Lake 3\".

{"value":"Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific. It's hard to believe that anybody other than John Cusack would have put money into this. With a string of anti-military/anti-war movies already being destroyed at the box office, it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script.<br /><br />At first, it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack(s) all over again. But only about 90 seconds into the movie, it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at DR STRANGELOVE.<br /><br />I liked so many of Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk seeing the DVD of this one. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for George Bush and the Iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide. Tom Cruise was never close to being this far gone.

{"value":"First of all yes I'm white, so I try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race... anyway... White People Hating Black people = BAD but Black People Hating White people = OK (because apparently we deserved it!!). where do i start? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co. get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking Neo-Nazis and win!!! the neo-Nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! the chase is priceless... This is NOT a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it doesn't deliver... this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotypes, the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead...cmon simply awful I do regret ever seeing it.<br /><br />Save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written ,poorly acted, dull and

{"value":"The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify AS \"plot\" and \"character\". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-focus, and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn't help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d who's just minding his own business!Images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn't really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth a rental if you like gory Italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre.

The characters look like they were drawn by pre-schoolers, no, wait, I've seen pre-schoolers do better! I prefer \"Misadventures of Flapjack\" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I'm probably saying what others have said, two words: RIP OFF!! Remember that episode of Dexter's Lab when they raced go-karts down that volcano? yeah, Mister Fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed! They even ripped off Shadow Lugia in that one episode that parodied Pokemon!(he even cashed in on that franchise!) That one character is a cheap rip off of Mandark from Dexter's Lab! Mister Fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap!! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, your'e just lying to yourselves.

{"value":"Truly one of the most dire films I've ever sat through. I've never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film-making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest. There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense (e.g. when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure? Why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed?). Also, the characterisation - as we've almost come to expect in such films - was awful (e.g. the way the blonde guy - I don't remember his frickin name and don't give a toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her) and I ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends!

{"value":"A famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the female assassin is Sawa. She is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal, Akai, who is sleeping with her. One day Sawa finds out he killed her parents..<br /><br />------- <br /><br />Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest. \"Kite\" has style, but it is still trash. The weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on it's face. One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good/bad heroine Sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director Yasoumi Umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful.

{"value":"John Carradine, John Ireland, and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion.<br /><br />For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in. With that magnificent sonorous voice of his, Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in.<br /><br />He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film. It's even got a graveyard, but with a missing occupant. Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue.<br /><br />In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already. The script is so incoherent I'm still trying to figure out the point.

{"value":"\"Indian burial ground\": If those three words appear anywhere in a real-estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and, after a l-o-o-o-ng hike, an ancient Indian burial ground. Seems the Indian ground can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead--if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet. It can do the same for dead people--if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.<br /><br />Throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speeding big rigs, a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbor, and one kid who really doesn't get enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, does offer up a few scares.<br /><br />Well, there are worse Stephen King adaptations (such as \"Maximum Overdrive,\" which King also directed).

{"value":"I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad.<br /><br />And boy, is it BAD. After viewing this horror-ific movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words, \"...dude....What?\" Yes, i am an enthralling individual.<br /><br />Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none, at all, ever, constantly in \"WTF\" mode. The Characters; No development, forgettable. The Music; Worse than porn. The Vampires; Theirs vampires? The Zombies; Theirs Zombies?<br /><br />In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so bad I yearn to see it again.

{"value":"Three part \"horror\" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go \"out there\" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.<br /><br />The first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. It leads up to two totally predictable twists. Still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. Predictable but enjoyable.<br /><br />The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. His car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. Good acting though.<br /><br />The third is just barely a horror story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it.

{"value":"The 1990's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right. Every network had one, and they all lacked one thing Originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence. Titltes ranging from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage? Has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? The people who appear on this show were Trash. The people who watched this show were Trash. Anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs, its having shows like this tell them Its OK to be 500lbs overweight, and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes.

{"value":"I am a huge Michael Madsen fan, so needless to say, i bought this movie without even renting it or anything... This movie was so horrible, i didn't even take it back to the store, i wouldn't want anyone else to be subjected to this human poison, i just threw it in the trash, never mind the money, it was worth the price to be able to throw it away. The acting wasn't that bad, it wasn't good or anything. The story was horrible, and the ending was something i despise. He was a broken man, alcoholic. his life was a bunch of junk. i thought his horse, peanuts, was an awful device to show his childhood innocence, a dog would have been much much better. i also hate religion, so this ending without a doubt angered me. Jesus heals all... i hate that i know people just like this that are huge Christians and catholics, and time will show that god doesn't heal all, or anything. It was a horrible movie, if u have the option to see it, pass, or better yet buy it, or rent it, and throw it in the garbage, and leave the coffee grounds on it in the

{"value":"There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video. Of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video. This one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (am Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas. The film is also misstated: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that. This was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes.

{"value":"Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble. I must admit i'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movies. He stinks. However when compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas' comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas seems like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J Simpson trial, you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels, you couldn't escape this movie. in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable TV. The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor.

{"value":"Tasteless. I can't even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed the entire movie. It wasn't supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no clue what he is doing. His story is written, it seems, without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the meth problem. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his movie even more puzzling to me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It doesn't make any sense. The acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch. Gratituous violence and sex filled the movie. I am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy, but it came across as unbelievable and offensive. The ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief. As I walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me. The ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears, but it did the exact opposite.

{"value":"This horror movie is really weak...that is if this is the correct movie I am commenting on. Nothing really terrible goes on as a family adopts a cute little German Shepard pup. I had a German Shepard and it is a really good dog. I did not get the idea to get one from this movie though, but rather from the comedy \"K-9\". That is another story all together though. This movie really doesn't have much horror at all as the most horrific scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy. Also, we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower. That is about it. The father suspects something though, as his family seems to be getting rather strange, somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed. All in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards...television movies that do work are out there as \"This House Possessed\" is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good.

{"value":"2 stars, and I'm being generous. (minor spoilers) Look, this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland Oakland. As the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-by.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie: what zombies?! All the \"zombies\" do is growl (which doesn't sound even remotely scary) and drip fake red blood from their mouths! No scary eyes, no decaying flesh, just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiots.<br /><br />The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole film, so it's not like the whole \"hood\" is plagued with zombies or anything, it's just a few, and is contained in no time.<br /><br />The acting actually is so bad it's hilarious. No one can act at all in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together, decided to cast their family, and made a movie one weekend.<br /><br />Final note: since when do Doctors wear tracksuits?!

{"value":"First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film?

{"value":"A schizophrenic has escaped from a NYC mental hospital and soon teachers start getting offed at St. Trinity University. New teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the mess of red herrings. Despite a 78 minute running time, this cheap-o slasher drags on and on until the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from the get go is revealed to be as such. Director Richard Haines barely breaks a sweat with some lame stalk-n-slash staging but delivers the grue the early 80s audience was probably craving. For all of our amateur anthropologists out there, this was filmed in New Yawk in early 80s so you can check out all of the culture, beliefs, and practices of living people from that far away place. The film does get some credit for offing the \"Final Girl.\" You rarely see that. Also, always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Doth thou not trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Thankfully, this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught.

{"value":"This movie sucked. The acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment.

{"value":"I'm not usually one to slate a film . I try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to make something that bad, why bother? Part of the film is take up with shots of Anne's face while she breaths deeply, and violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms. Anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing, which is fine at the beginning, but she stays the same all through the film, and you see no reason for captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall the production lacks any sense of period, with too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as running out of the concert, kissing in the street, running about in the streets with no hat on (why was this scene in the film at all? the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.). To sum it up, a terrible film, very

{"value":"I spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's. This was, by far, the worst film I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great, inspiring film. Even the great Gregory Peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an early non-horror film role, demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but it isn't getting much better).<br /><br />I'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball! Even the shows on Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck.<br /><br />This is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable TV.

{"value":"I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance, whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility, as in The Big Knife.<br /><br />But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors don't care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film. I don't even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! They surely could have come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot High Sierra, but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film.<br /><br />It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir.

{"value":"This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. And I'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently. It lacks also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters \"If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain\". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /><br />Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact, he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said, God become a man) that indeed changed mankind.

{"value":"This is a weak sequel: it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent \"Man Called Horse\" in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre.<br /><br />The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different Indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their homelands, modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time. This takes us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film.<br /><br />The beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism. In the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film.<br /><br />A huge

{"value":"As someone else mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains. First they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at, with increasing irritation to the audience, by Gaffari. Once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?) What happens next I will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because I most assuredly couldn't. Now, I like Eurohorror, and this woulda been better if only Artigot (writer AND director) had made some attempt at logical story telling. The backdrop (Pyrenees?) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences. The verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them. The photography is nice. Just wish the whole thing made sense.
