{"value":"By all accounts, this could have been an interesting film. Featuring a score by the mighty Cradle Of Filth, starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as \"the future of British horror\", I expected Alex Chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Everything about this film is either cliche or inept. The short story anthology setup was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Admittedly, the idea of 'the sick room' did send a chill down my spine, but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting.<br /><br />Chandon cannot write dialogue. Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence (the typical 'cop on the edge' formula. funny, i'm sure i've seen that somewhere else before...) No Chandon, you are not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. It sounds BAD. Add ludicrously OTT acting with very dodgy casting (don't get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but actor he ain't) and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing. Give me Bruce Campbell any day.<br /><br />The visual effects are on the whole poor, with some atrocious CGI, awful gore effects (for goodness sakes, Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters that shriek OVER-USE! As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filth's score... man, they should sue.<br /><br />The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects (eg: maniac, zombie flesh eaters, the beyond, suspiria etc), rendering Cradle of Fear, in my mind, second-rate and obsolete.<br /><br />I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares.<br /><br />Better luck next

{"value":"War, Inc. - Corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their wet-work against rival CEOs. A dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike. It was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There's no reason or method to the madness.<br /><br />It's considered by Cusack to be the \"spiritual successor\" to Grosse Point Blank. I.e., War is more or less a knock-off. We again see Cusack as an assassin protecting *spoiler* the person he's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease. The brief fights look good. The rest of the film does not. It's all quirky often bordering on bizarre. War Inc's not funny enough to be a parody, and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film's message might be, which I suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations, like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens. Interesting, but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart. We're supposed to give a damn about how war affects Cusack's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war.<br /><br />John Cusack gives a decent performance. His character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist. There really isn't a lot of chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself. Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. Blech. Ben Kingsley might have to return the Oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again. Pathetic.<br /><br />It's not a terrible movie, but in the end you gotta ask \"War, what is it good for?\" Absolutely nothing.

{"value":"I just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film I have done on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.<br /><br />1. The actors. I know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average.<br /><br />2. The incredibly lame make up and special effects. Once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse.<br /><br />3. The obvious similarities to Hostel. Whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success. Only problem is Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there...<br /><br />4. The music. Not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.<br /><br />5. The script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought.<br /><br />6. The editing. WTF. How jarring, and not in a good way. nuf said.<br /><br />Seriously I would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (he no doubt frequents his pages on IMDb.) cause buddy... what were you thinking. Surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands... Sorry I don't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better, hopefully practice makes progress.<br /><br />But in the mean time avoid this like the plague. I want my 81 mins back with interest. (At least I didn't pay to watch it.)","finished_norm":["i","just","want","to","start","by","sai","thi","be","the","review","of","a","film","i","have","do","on","the","net","i","feel","the","ne","to","warn","peopl","about","thi","film","becaus","it","truli","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","after","read","interview","with","the","director","he","sai","he","respect","construct","critic","and","so","i","will","try","to","avoid","bash","the","film","just","for","the","sake","of","it","and","offer","my","opinion","a","to","why","i","find","it","to","be","so","catastroph","terriblebr","br","the","actor","i","know","the","budget","mai","not","have","allow","for","great","thespian","but","with","nicholson","work","in","the","industri","for","over","ten","year","sure","he","know","some","actor","who","be","at","littl","averagebr","br","the","incredibli","lame","make","up","and","special","effect","onc","again","budget","obvious","interfer","with","what","be","origin","intend","but","after","work","in","make","up","for","so","mani","year","there","be","realli","no","excusebr","br","the","obviou","similar","to","hostel","whilst","not","be","exactli","a","rip","off","it","sure","doe","try","to","cash","in","on","the","former","film","success","onli","problem","be","roth","know","where","he","be","go","and","exactli","how","to","get","therebr","br","the","music","not","at","all","creepi","or","haunt","not","even","sicken","just","plain","annoyingbr","br","the","script","in","gener","all","dialogu","be","forc","and","terribl","conjur","the","sub","plot","about","the","theatr","and","the","gui","who","come","in","to","save","them","be","weak","a","and","almost","like","a","afterthoughtbr","br","the","edit","wtf","how","jar","and","not","in","a","good","wai","nuf","saidbr","br","serious","i","would","like","to","hear","the","director","thought","on","my","post","he","no","doubt","frequent","hi","page","on","imdb","caus","buddi","what","be","you","think","sure","at","some","point","dure","either","the","shoot","or","edit","you","realis","what","a","turkei","yolu","have","on","your","hand","sorri","i","do","not","want","to","be","harsh","but","you","must","have","much","talent","than","thi","i","hope","your","next","featur","that","gutterbal","movi","or","wahtev","be","well","hopefulli","practic","make","progressbr","br","but","in","the","mean","time","avoid","thi","like","the","plagu","i","want","my","min","back","with","interest","at","littl","i","do","not","pai","to","watch","it"],"filtered":["want","start","sai","thi","review","film","net","feel","ne","warn","peopl","thi","film","becaus","truli","wrong","film","ever","see","read","interview","director","sai","respect","construct","critic","try","avoid","bash","film","sake","offer","opinion","find","catastroph","terriblebr","br","actor","know","budget","mai","allow","great","thespian","nicholson","work","industri","ten","year","sure","know","actor","littl","averagebr","br","incredibli","lame","make","special","effect","onc","budget","obvious","interfer","origin","intend","work","make","mani","year","realli","excusebr","br","obviou","similar","hostel","whilst","exactli","rip","sure","doe","try","cash","former","film","success","onli","problem","roth","know","go","exactli","get","therebr","br","music","creepi","haunt","even","sicken","plain","annoyingbr","br","script","gener","dialogu","forc","terribl","conjur","sub","plot","theatr","gui","come","save","weak","almost","like","afterthoughtbr","br","edit","wtf","jar","good","wai","nuf","saidbr","br","serious","like","hear","director","thought","post","doubt","frequent","hi","page","imdb","caus","buddi","think","sure","point","dure","either","shoot","edit","realis","turkei","yolu","hand","sorri","want","harsh","must","much","talent","thi","hope","next","featur","gutterbal","movi","wahtev","well","hopefulli","practic","make","progressbr","br","mean","time","avoid","thi","like","plagu","want","min","back","interest","littl","pai","watch"],"filtered2":["want","start","review","net","feel","ne","warn","peopl","becaus","truli","wrong","ever","see","read","interview","director","respect","construct","critic","try","avoid","bash","sake","offer","opinion","find","catastroph","terriblebr","actor","know","budget","mai","allow","great","thespian","nicholson","work","industri","ten","year","sure","know","actor","littl","averagebr","incredibli","lame","make","special","effect","onc","budget","obvious","interfer","origin","intend","work","make","mani","year","realli","excusebr","obviou","similar","hostel","whilst","exactli","rip","sure","doe","try","cash","former","success","onli","problem","roth","know","go","exactli","get","therebr","music","creepi","haunt","even","sicken","plain","annoyingbr","script","gener","dialogu","forc","terribl","conjur","sub","plot","theatr","gui","come","save","weak","almost","like","afterthoughtbr","edit","wtf","jar","good","wai","nuf","saidbr","serious","like","hear","director","thought","post","doubt","frequent","

{"value":"Today I found \"They All Laughed\" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in \"Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003\" and  wow  four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching \"They All Laughed\" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in \"Star 80\" and \"Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story\"; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song \"Amigo\", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as \"The King\". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Muito Riso e Muita Alegria\" (\"Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness\")","finished_norm":["todai","i","find","thei","all","laugh","on","vh","on","sale","in","a","rental","it","be","a","realli","old","and","veri","us","vh","i","have","no","inform","about","thi","movi","but","i","like","the","refer","list","on","it","cover","the","name","of","peter","bogdanovich","audrei","hepburn","john","ritter","and","special","dorothi","stratten","attract","me","the","price","be","veri","low","and","i","decid","to","risk","and","bui","it","i","search","imdb","and","the","user","rate","of","be","a","excel","refer","i","look","in","mick","martin","marsha","porter","video","dvd","guid","and","wow","four","star","so","i","decid","that","i","can","not","wast","much","time","and","immedi","see","it","ind","i","have","just","finish","watch","thei","all","laugh","and","i","find","it","a","veri","bore","overr","movi","the","charact","be","badli","develop","and","i","spend","lot","of","minut","to","understand","their","role","in","the","stori","the","plot","be","suppos","to","be","funni","privat","ey","who","fall","in","love","for","the","woman","thei","be","chase","but","i","have","not","laugh","along","the","whole","stori","the","coincid","in","a","huge","citi","like","new","york","be","ridicul","ben","gazarra","a","a","attract","and","veri","seduct","man","with","the","woman","fall","for","him","a","if","her","be","a","brad","pitt","antonio","bandera","or","georg","cloonei","be","quit","ridicul","in","the","end","the","great","attract","certainli","be","the","presenc","of","the","playboi","centerfold","and","playmat","of","the","year","dorothi","stratten","murder","by","her","husband","pretti","after","the","releas","of","thi","movi","and","whose","life","be","show","in","star","and","death","of","a","centerfold","the","dorothi","stratten","stori","the","amaz","beauti","of","the","sexi","patti","hansen","the","futur","mr","keith","richard","the","alwai","wonder","even","be","fiftytwo","year","old","audrei","hepburn","and","the","song","amigo","from","roberto","carlo","although","i","do","not","like","him","roberto","carlo","have","be","the","much","popular","brazilian","singer","sinc","the","end","of","the","and","be","call","by","hi","fan","a","the","king","i","will","keep","thi","movi","in","my","collect","onli","becaus","of","thi","attract","manli","dorothi","stratten","my","vote","be","fourbr","br","titl","brazil","muito","riso","e","muita","alegria","mani","laugh","and","lot","of","happi"],"filtered":["todai","find","thei","laugh","vh","sale","rental","realli","old","veri","us","vh","inform","thi","movi","like","refer","list","cover","name","peter","bogdanovich","audrei","hepburn","john","ritter","special","dorothi","stratten","attract","price","veri","low","decid","risk","bui","search","imdb","user","rate","excel","refer","look","mick","martin","marsha","porter","video","dvd","guid","wow","four","star","decid","wast","much","time","immedi","see","ind","finish","watch","thei","laugh","find","veri","bore","overr","movi","charact","badli","develop","spend","lot","minut","understand","role","stori","plot","suppos","funni","privat","ey","fall","love","woman","thei","chase","laugh","along","whole","stori","coincid","huge","citi","like","new","york","ridicul","ben","gazarra","attract","veri","seduct","man","woman","fall","brad","pitt","antonio","bandera","georg","cloonei","quit","ridicul","end","great","attract","certainli","presenc","playboi","centerfold","playmat","year","dorothi","stratten","murder","husband","pretti","releas","thi","movi","whose","life","show","star","death","centerfold","dorothi","stratten","stori","amaz","beauti","sexi","patti","hansen","futur","mr","keith","richard","alwai","wonder","even","fiftytwo","year","old","audrei","hepburn","song","amigo","roberto","carlo","although","like","roberto","carlo","much","popular","brazilian","singer","sinc","end","call","hi","fan","king","keep","thi","movi","collect","onli","becaus","thi","attract","manli","dorothi","stratten","vote","fourbr","br","titl","brazil","muito","riso","e","muita","alegria","mani","laugh","lot","happi"],"filtered2":["todai","find","laugh","vh","sale","rental","realli","old","veri","us","vh","inform","like","refer","list","cover","name","peter","bogdanovich","audrei","hepburn","john","ritter","special","dorothi","stratten","attract","price","veri","low","decid","risk","bui","search","imdb","user","rate","excel","refer","look","mick","martin","marsha","porter","video","dvd","guid","wow","four","star","decid","wast","time","immedi","see","ind","finish","watch","laugh","find","veri","bore","overr","charact","badli","develop","spend","lot","minut","understand","role","stori","plot","suppos","funni","privat","ey","fall","love","woman","chase","laugh","along","whole","stori","coincid","huge","citi","like","new","york","ridicul","ben","gazarra","attract","veri","seduct","man","woman","fall","brad","pitt","antonio","bandera","georg","cloonei","quit","ridicul","end","great","attract","certainli","presenc","playb

{"value":"Someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to High Noon. Now that is a real stretch! I'm a big Sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been Don Knotts. First off, as someone pointed out, Sinatra just doesn't have the build for a Western bad-guy wannabe. He's just too 'slight' at this point in his life. Maybe he was about the same height as say Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty solid build. Sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously.<br /><br />The story is uninspired and really not credible. I don't want to spoil it but I think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story doesn't make any sense. Another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy'. This is just a little town, so I don't get the attraction nor do I understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way.<br /><br />There is a 'love interest' in the story and if I followed it right, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy wouldn't kill him. Now there's true love for you. 'Stand up for yourself! Tell him your name so he will kill you!' LOL. Stop, you're killing me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the basic premise of the movie isn't good enough and no matter how they tried this story didn't have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket. Want to know why it's not on video and never shown on TV? The critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible.<br /><br />You want to see a good Western where a town stands up against a bad guy? Try Tension at Table Rock, or At Gunpoint - two really, really good Westerns with that theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you didn't belong in a movie like this.","finished_norm":["someon","here","actual","compar","thi","movi","in","some","wai","to","high","noon","now","that","be","a","real","stretch","i","be","a","big","sinatra","fan","includ","some","of","hi","act","role","but","mayb","the","onli","person","who","can","have","plai","thi","part","would","have","be","don","knott","off","a","someon","point","out","sinatra","just","doe","not","have","the","build","for","a","western","badgui","wannab","he","just","too","slight","at","thi","point","in","hi","life","mayb","he","be","about","the","same","height","a","sai","audi","murphi","but","murphi","have","a","pretti","solid","build","sinatra","come","across","a","the","big","talk","littl","kid","who","nobodi","ought","to","take","seriouslybr","br","the","stori","be","uninspir","and","realli","not","credibl","i","do","not","want","to","spoil","it","but","i","think","the","end","and","how","the","townspeopl","react","in","thi","stori","doe","not","make","ani","sens","anoth","thing","thi","peopl","constantli","allow","themselv","to","be","complet","lord","over","by","some","bad","gui","thi","be","just","a","littl","town","so","i","do","not","get","the","attract","nor","do","i","understand","why","the","peopl","would","let","themselv","be","domin","that","waybr","br","there","be","a","love","interest","in","the","stori","and","if","i","follow","it","right","she","be","upset","when","the","main","charact","refus","to","admit","who","he","be","so","some","other","bad","gui","would","not","kill","him","now","there","true","love","for","you","stand","up","for","yourself","tell","him","your","name","so","he","will","kill","you","lol","stop","you","re","kill","mebr","br","unfortun","the","basic","premis","of","the","movi","be","not","good","enough","and","no","matt","how","thei","try","thi","stori","do","not","have","a","logic","path","to","follow","other","than","into","the","wastebasket","want","to","know","why","it","not","on","video","and","never","show","on","tv","the","critic","appar","pan","it","in","and","thei","be","right","thi","movi","be","pretti","bad","i","would","almost","bet","sinatra","pai","someon","to","deep","six","the","thing","a","much","a","possiblebr","br","you","want","to","see","a","good","western","where","a","town","stand","up","against","a","bad","gui","try","tension","at","tabl","rock","or","at","gunpoint","two","realli","realli","good","western","with","that","theme","johnni","concho","be","johnni","stinko","frank","you","be","the","great","singer","ever","but","you","do","not","belong","in","a","movi","like","thi"],"filtered":["someon","actual","compar","thi","movi","wai","high","noon","real","stretch","big","sinatra","fan","includ","hi","act","role","mayb","onli","person","plai","thi","part","knott","someon","point","sinatra","doe","build","western","badgui","wannab","slight","thi","point","hi","life","mayb","height","sai","audi","murphi","murphi","pretti","solid","build","sinatra","come","across","big","talk","littl","kid","nobodi","take","seriouslybr","br","stori","uninspir","realli","credibl","want","spoil","think","end","townspeopl","react","thi","stori","doe","make","ani","sens","anoth","thing","thi","peopl","constantli","allow","themselv","complet","lord","bad","gui","thi","littl","town","get","attract","understand","peopl","let","themselv","domin","waybr","br","love","interest","stori","follow","right","upset","main","charact","refus","admit","bad","gui","kill","true","love","stand","tell","name","kill","lol","stop","re","kill","mebr","br","unfortun","basic","premis","movi","good","enough","matt","thei","try","thi","stori","logic","path","follow","wastebasket","want","know","video","never","show","tv","critic","appar","pan","thei","right","thi","movi","pretti","bad","almost","bet","sinatra","pai","someon","deep","six","thing","much","possiblebr","br","want","see","good","western","town","stand","bad","gui","try","tension","tabl","rock","gunpoint","two","realli","realli","good","western","theme","johnni","concho","johnni","stinko","frank","great","singer","ever","belong","movi","like","thi"],"filtered2":["someon","actual","compar","wai","high","noon","real","stretch","big","sinatra","fan","includ","act","role","mayb","onli","person","plai","part","knott","someon","point","sinatra","doe","build","western","badgui","wannab","slight","point","life","mayb","height","audi","murphi","murphi","pretti","solid","build","sinatra","come","across","big","talk","littl","kid","nobodi","take","seriouslybr","stori","uninspir","realli","credibl","want","spoil","think","end","townspeopl","react","stori","doe","make","ani","sens","anoth","thing","peopl","constantli","allow","themselv","complet","lord","bad","gui","littl","town","get","attract","understand","peopl","let","themselv","domin","waybr","love","interest","stori","follow","right","upset","main","charact","refus","admit","bad","gui","kill","true","love","stand","tell","name","kill","lol","stop","re","kill","mebr","unfortun","basic","premis","go

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he's approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go. His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they don't want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out. All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls at Dial's feet. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him.<br /><br />This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time (I don't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere.) With this in mind and after Snipes's history of duff DVD efforts, this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it's hot. But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway. It doesn't rank among his worst, but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really), either.<br /><br />This is, at best, mildly suspenseful, with a minimal of action, naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role. Likewise, in a main supporting role, it's quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any

{"value":"I have just seen this movie and have not read the book. The good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity and your part in the world.<br /><br />However, the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version. The events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable. A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. <br /><br />Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to. Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha) ? Well, this is nothing like that.<br /><br />Most scenes are poorly executed. There are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.<br /><br />The better actors in this movie, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow cannot save it. The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.<br /><br />Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help him at all. The scene where he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just bad script. The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed. The flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.<br /><br />Overall this movie is a big waist of time, read the book! I have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than this, it has to be.<br /><br />It is so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.","finished_norm":["i","have","just","see","thi","movi","and","have","not","read","the","book","the","good","thing","of","the","movi","be","that","at","some","part","it","get","you","think","for","a","littl","while","on","the","spiritu","subject","evolut","sincron","and","your","part","in","the","worldbr","br","howev","the","movi","immers","be","easili","break","and","there","be","veri","littl","rapport","between","the","viewer","and","the","charact","it","be","veri","clear","that","the","book","loos","a","lot","in","thi","movi","version","the","event","that","be","suppos","to","show","sincron","take","place","be","almost","unrecogniz","a","lot","of","reason","have","to","be","do","for","the","viewer","to","see","that","the","scene","indic","a","coincid","and","even","much","to","imagin","that","it","have","someth","to","do","with","a","great","purpos","br","br","enlighten","scene","be","visual","poor","and","do","not","creat","the","well","feel","that","it","be","suppos","to","do","you","recal","the","enlighten","with","keanu","reev","in","littl","buddha","good","thi","be","noth","like","thatbr","br","much","scene","be","poorli","execut","there","be","a","lot","of","scene","that","realli","do","not","develop","the","stori","and","conjur","do","not","help","in","creat","a","atmospherebr","br","the","well","actor","in","thi","movi","name","hector","elizondo","joaquim","de","almeida","and","jürgen","prochnow","cannot","save","it","the","seem","to","have","get","much","scene","than","their","charact","should","in","a","attempt","to","save","the","movi","and","becaus","thei","be","pai","much","but","thi","doe","not","work","much","of","the","scene","be","not","realli","necessari","and","do","not","help","the","stori","at","allbr","br","jürgen","doe","good","in","hi","scene","and","sell","a","a","evil","gui","a","alwai","but","the","script","doe","not","help","him","at","all","the","scene","where","he","try","to","convinc","john","matthew","settl","to","join","him","be","just","bad","script","the","execut","of","the","scene","when","he","die","in","a","explos","be","absurdli","bad","execut","the","flashback","throughout","the","movi","cannot","even","be","commentedbr","br","overal","thi","movi","be","a","big","waist","of","time","read","the","book","i","have","not","read","it","but","it","be","probabl","a","billion","time","well","than","thi","it","have","to","bebr","br","it","be","so","bad","that","i","have","to","write","my","comment","in","imdb"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","read","book","good","thing","movi","part","get","think","littl","spiritu","subject","evolut","sincron","part","worldbr","br","howev","movi","immers","easili","break","veri","littl","rapport","viewer","charact","veri","clear","book","loos","lot","thi","movi","version","event","suppos","show","sincron","take","place","almost","unrecogniz","lot","reason","viewer","see","scene","indic","coincid","even","much","imagin","someth","great","purpos","br","br","enlighten","scene","visual","poor","creat","well","feel","suppos","recal","enlighten","keanu","reev","littl","buddha","good","thi","noth","like","thatbr","br","much","scene","poorli","execut","lot","scene","realli","develop","stori","conjur","help","creat","atmospherebr","br","well","actor","thi","movi","name","hector","elizondo","joaquim","de","almeida","jürgen","prochnow","save","seem","get","much","scene","charact","attempt","save","movi","becaus","thei","pai","much","thi","doe","work","much","scene","realli","necessari","help","stori","allbr","br","jürgen","doe","good","hi","scene","sell","evil","gui","alwai","script","doe","help","scene","try","convinc","john","matthew","settl","join","bad","script","execut","scene","die","explos","absurdli","bad","execut","flashback","throughout","movi","even","commentedbr","br","overal","thi","movi","big","waist","time","read","book","read","probabl","billion","time","well","thi","bebr","br","bad","write","comment","imdb"],"filtered2":["see","read","book","good","thing","part","get","think","littl","spiritu","subject","evolut","sincron","part","worldbr","howev","immers","easili","break","veri","littl","rapport","viewer","charact","veri","clear","book","loos","lot","version","event","suppos","show","sincron","take","place","almost","unrecogniz","lot","reason","viewer","see","scene","indic","coincid","even","imagin","someth","great","purpos","enlighten","scene","visual","poor","creat","well","feel","suppos","recal","enlighten","keanu","reev","littl","buddha","good","noth","like","thatbr","scene","poorli","execut","lot","scene","realli","develop","stori","conjur","help","creat","atmospherebr","well","actor","name","hector","elizondo","joaquim","de","almeida","jürgen","prochnow","save","seem","get","scene","charact","attempt","save","becaus","pai","doe","work","scene","realli","necessari","help","stori","allbr","jürgen","doe","good","scene","sell","evil","gui","alwai","script","doe","help","scene","try","convinc","john","matthew","settl","join","ba

{"value":"Sarah Silverman is really the \"flavor of the month\" comic right now. Is she really worth all the hype? Yes and no. She is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny). Other times, you're feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer. She is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit. But if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. She reminds me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, even though neither of them are really \"hot\" now in terms of popularity. Sarah doesn't drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially the male ones) can rejoice.<br /><br />As for this show, it's very much like her comedy. When it works, it's hilarious. When it doesn't, it's full blown tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best one. It's consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's hilarious seeing him in a Tab T-shirt. But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome. Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including Sarah's real life sister, Laura, who doesn't look a thing like her) are OK. When the jokes hit, they're brilliant. When they don't, they're awful, and I mean really awful. There's also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today. So should you watch this show?

{"value":"In short:<br /><br />Spike Lee clearly has a lot on his mind. He's thinking about racism color-ism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'hetero-sexism', politics of the drug war etc etc...<br /><br />That level of consciousness on is own is great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making contentious films does not make him a good film-maker.<br /><br />What comes across in \"Jungle Fever\" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two main failures:<br /><br />firstly, Lee is simply trying too hard. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate every political/social statement he can think of into the 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confused and irresolute as he allows himself no time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present. And so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs. The end result is very staged and unrealistic.<br /><br />Secondly, by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions, he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social/political issues presented. What comes across is a puddle of regurgitated non-sense. You feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages.<br /><br />These are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker.

{"value":"I am marking this as a \"spoiler\" only because of some of my comments of the show's content, not to the content itself.<br /><br />As I read the comments it is apparent that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but disdain it, while the Democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness. One reader even (so it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when Bush was in grade school.<br /><br />But as to the content as I see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must actually be really Bush haters. In the Episode that I saw last, s02e03, it showed that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other former front runners are all featured.<br /><br />Another thing that caught my attention, was the use of add in closets. I thought that the series must have been made in Europe of for sure not in the U.S.A., because I know of no home the U.S.A. that does not have built in closets, and most likely in the homes of the artists.<br /><br />As I watch the show, yes I do get caught up in it, I am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our President. Sure there are problems as most American will agree, but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world. Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network, so that IF Obama or Hillary got in, would they continue to produce and air the same sort of \"humor\" about them?<br /><br />Just one more comment on a commentator's remarks. IF there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000, according to that writer, he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. As far as 911 events, I do believe that it was set in motion back when Clinton was president, and I can't see how if Gore was president anything would be much

{"value":"This movie should be called \"plan 9 from joseph smith.\" i think its weirdness is underappreciated. the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich's \"the population bomb (1968),\" and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons. the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of \"heavenly father's\" (god's) plan. and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad. get it?<br /><br />This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. it's utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the play was actually written in 1973, and of course, the theology is part 1840's, part battlestar galactica. some of the action takes place on earth and some in the \"pre-existence, an aimless romper-room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries, losing their shot at celestial glory.<br /><br />it is as stagey as they come, but don't let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the 'cool kids' are all into population control, (presumably) counseling their parents not to have any more children!! having big families was, at the time the play was written, the cultural norm in the lds community, and more importantly, considered part of God's plan. the church has since done a 180, and have made family planning a choice of the parents, and large families are much less the cultural norm now. making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern-day mormon moot!<br /><br />ahhh but it's really only as good as the music. there are some catchy tunes here that just won't let this movie die the 1970's death it was pre-destined for. the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you

{"value":"The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summed up by the opening scene . The CIA want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin James Dial . The terrorist is appearing at the Old Bailey court in London which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail ? He's going to be out of circulation either way . Didn't the CIA have a chance before he was arrested ? If by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him . There's no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison <br /><br />Since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire . Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they're driving in crashes but Dial manages to escape . So the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash ? The film of this type of plot connivance . Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying \" this airport is surrounded by armed coppers \" yet Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation . The whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained . This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day . Why does she help Dial even though he's a wanted fugitive ? Your guess is as good as mine <br /><br />This is a fairly poor thriller and don't be taken in by the \" big name \" cast . Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films . Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to DVD fare these days , and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway . The likes of Lena Headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they'l certainly fail to put THE CONTRACTER on their

In contrast to other reviewers, I found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewer's interest in the characters and the plot. I sat through it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands, but if I were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie, I would have to give it the thumbs down, with a few caveats: Jason Behr is good in the part of John Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear, although we are given hints in Livien's well-acted relationship to his parents, but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer (which it shouldn't be). Nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting, albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film. The allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I confess I'm not a Beatles fan. At any rate, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derivative about them. Another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting - albeit middlebrow and high-school level - philosophical musings of the lead character, but left the threads of his thinking there, only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly, when Livien says, \"before God, there was music\" (ever seen that ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s, \"Before time, there was Tia Maria\"? That's what sprung to mind anyway); it seems an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he reached it, but he's entitled to it. Fortunately his bassist and friend, played ably by Dominic Monaghan, seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds \"You don't know that\".<br /><br />In all, the limited

{"value":"Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. She has also said on her radio show she hates making \"romantic comedies\" because she doesn't believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable \"romantic comedy\" that has no basis in the real world. Whereas there will be some who will say \"suspend your disbelief\", one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes her look unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film). That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, quite beautiful. I haven't read one review where someone said Uma was better looking. Having said that though, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely stay with Uma, not Janeane. Many men don't like really intelligent women (and many women don't like really intelligent men), and sadly, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it doesn't work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway.<br /><br />I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character, and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, as this really isn't that good of a film.","finished_norm":["janean","garofalo","have","be","veri","public","in","her","displeasur","about","thi","film","call","it","among","other","thing","antifeminist","she","have","conjur","sai","on","her","radio","show","she","hate","make","romant","comedi","becaus","she","doe","not","believ","in","them","i","wholeheartedli","agre","with","janean","here","thi","film","be","a","trifl","at","well","she","doe","her","well","but","overal","it","be","just","anoth","bore","unbeliev","romant","comedi","that","have","no","basi","in","the","real","world","wherea","there","will","be","some","who","will","sai","suspend","your","disbelief","on","grow","tire","of","have","to","suspend","it","nearli","everi","time","you","get","a","romant","film","from","hollywood","janean","charact","for","some","reason","be","usual","film","in","shadow","and","dark","which","make","her","look","unattract","while","uma","charact","be","film","in","light","tone","which","probabl","displeas","janean","and","be","probabl","on","of","the","reason","she","detest","thi","film","that","realli","hurt","the","film","if","we","be","to","bui","the","premis","that","janean","be","suppos","to","be","the","well","look","of","the","two","a","mani","have","sai","here","and","on","other","comment","thread","janean","be","not","ugli","but","in","fact","quit","beauti","i","have","not","read","on","review","where","someon","sai","uma","be","well","look","have","sai","that","though","i","believ","that","ben","chaplin","charact","would","much","than","like","stai","with","uma","not","janean","mani","man","do","not","like","realli","intellig","woman","and","mani","woman","do","not","like","realli","intellig","man","and","sadli","ben","probabl","would","have","stai","with","uma","and","despit","the","director","attempt","to","make","janean","unattract","it","doe","not","work","her","natur","beauti","come","through","anywaybr","br","i","think","a","lot","of","janean","male","fan","who","be","obsess","with","her","like","thi","film","becaus","thei","like","to","think","of","themselv","in","the","ben","chaplin","charact","and","actual","score","with","janean","janean","be","a","lot","much","complic","than","the","charact","she","plai","here","real","life","be","alwai","much","much","complex","than","hollywood","can","imagin","so","take","a","cold","shower","gentleman","thi","be","the","role","that","janean","be","well","know","for","and","that","a","shame","a","thi","realli","be","not","that","good","of","a","film"],"filtered":["janean","garofalo","veri","public","displeasur","thi","film","call","among","thing","antifeminist","conjur","sai","radio","show","hate","make","romant","comedi","becaus","doe","believ","wholeheartedli","agre","janean","thi","film","trifl","well","doe","well","overal","anoth","bore","unbeliev","romant","comedi","basi","real","world","wherea","sai","suspend","disbelief","grow","tire","suspend","nearli","everi","time","get","romant","film","hollywood","janean","charact","reason","usual","film","shadow","dark","make","look","unattract","uma","charact","film","light","tone","probabl","displeas","janean","probabl","reason","detest","thi","film","realli","hurt","film","bui","premis","janean","suppos","well","look","two","mani","sai","comment","thread","janean","ugli","fact","quit","beauti","read","review","someon","sai","uma","well","look","sai","though","believ","ben","chaplin","charact","much","like","stai","uma","janean","mani","man","like","realli","intellig","woman","mani","woman","like","realli","intellig","man","sadli","ben","probabl","stai","uma","despit","director","attempt","make","janean","unattract","doe","work","natur","beauti","come","anywaybr","br","think","lot","janean","male","fan","obsess","like","thi","film","becaus","thei","like","think","themselv","ben","chaplin","charact","actual","score","janean","janean","lot","much","complic","charact","plai","real","life","alwai","much","much","complex","hollywood","imagin","take","cold","shower","gentleman","thi","role","janean","well","know","shame","thi","realli","good","film"],"filtered2":["janean","garofalo","veri","public","displeasur","call","among","thing","antifeminist","conjur","radio","show","hate","make","romant","comedi","becaus","doe","believ","wholeheartedli","agre","janean","trifl","well","doe","well","overal","anoth","bore","unbeliev","romant","comedi","basi","real","world","wherea","suspend","disbelief","grow","tire","suspend","nearli","everi","time","get","romant","hollywood","janean","charact","reason","usual","shadow","dark","make","look","unattract","uma","charact","light","tone","probabl","displeas","janean","probabl","reason","detest","realli","hurt","bui","premis","janean","suppos","well","look","two","mani","comment","thread","janean","ugli","fact","quit","beauti","read","review","someon","uma","well","look","though","believ","ben","chaplin","charact","like","stai","uma","janean","mani","man","like","realli","intellig","woman","mani","woman","like","realli","

{"value":"It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers work may be disappointed with this, his last venture. But surely any fan of Sellers will find delight in all of his films, simply because of the man's huge talent. and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately this would prove to be Sellers last film, (it was even released after his death), but it's still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise. And not only do we get one Sellers, but we get to, for Sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old Fu. The story is equally outlandish as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his age-defying elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him. Just like any of Sellers greater films, the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him, as well as many of his familiar-faced co-stars - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few. It's also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoying a cameo with Sellers - albeit playing the same role, but still nice. The story is indeed pretty ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, which classes this as a film strongly under the Goon influence. And, although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy, there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The film failed commercially on it's initial release due to the entire world mourning after Sellers' death (the film was released less than 3 weeks after)and there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was Sellers last film. It's far from a great film - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes the jokes simply aren't there - but it is nevertheless enjoyable - if only for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers.","finished_norm":["it","be","true","that","some","fan","of","peter","seller","work","mai","be","disappoint","with","thi","hi","last","ventur","but","sure","ani","fan","of","seller","will","find","delight","in","all","of","hi","film","simpli","becaus","of","the","man","huge","talent","and","the","fiendish","plot","of","dr","fu","manchu","be","certainli","no","except","unfortun","thi","would","prove","to","be","seller","last","film","it","be","even","releas","after","hi","death","but","it","still","nice","to","see","how","the","man","have","manag","to","keep","hi","irreplac","talent","right","until","hi","untim","demis","and","not","onli","do","we","get","on","seller","but","we","get","to","for","seller","plai","not","onli","the","titl","role","but","conjur","hi","nemesi","the","equal","bizarr","nayland","smith","the","detect","on","the","hunt","for","the","craze","year","old","fu","the","stori","be","equal","outlandish","a","we","follow","fu","outrag","antic","to","make","hi","agedefi","elixir","and","conjur","nayland","and","hi","group","of","associ","try","to","prevent","him","just","like","ani","of","seller","great","film","the","film","come","with","a","guarante","impecc","perform","from","him","a","good","a","mani","of","hi","familiarfac","costar","david","tomlinson","sid","caesar","john","le","mesuri","clive","dunn","and","helen","mirren","to","name","a","few","it","conjur","nice","to","see","pink","panther","stalwart","burt","kwouk","cato","enjoi","a","cameo","with","seller","albeit","plai","the","same","role","but","still","nice","the","stori","be","ind","pretti","ridicul","a","be","mani","of","the","charact","involv","which","class","thi","a","a","film","strongli","under","the","goon","influenc","and","although","it","never","reach","the","height","of","goon","comedi","there","be","plenti","of","amus","joke","that","seem","to","point","in","the","right","direct","the","film","fail","commerci","on","it","initi","releas","due","to","the","entir","world","mourn","after","seller","death","the","film","be","releas","littl","than","week","afterand","there","be","alwai","that","sorrow","think","lurk","in","the","back","of","your","mind","when","view","it","that","thi","be","seller","last","film","it","far","from","a","great","film","it","often","slow","too","ridicul","and","sometim","the","joke","simpli","be","not","there","but","it","be","nevertheless","enjoy","if","onli","for","anoth","top","rate","perform","from","peter","seller"],"filtered":["true","fan","peter","seller","work","mai","disappoint","thi","hi","last","ventur","sure","ani","fan","seller","find","delight","hi","film","simpli","becaus","man","huge","talent","fiendish","plot","dr","fu","manchu","certainli","except","unfortun","thi","prove","seller","last","film","even","releas","hi","death","still","nice","see","man","manag","keep","hi","irreplac","talent","right","hi","untim","demis","onli","get","seller","get","seller","plai","onli","titl","role","conjur","hi","nemesi","equal","bizarr","nayland","smith","detect","hunt","craze","year","old","fu","stori","equal","outlandish","follow","fu","outrag","antic","make","hi","agedefi","elixir","conjur","nayland","hi","group","associ","try","prevent","like","ani","seller","great","film","film","come","guarante","impecc","perform","good","mani","hi","familiarfac","costar","david","tomlinson","sid","caesar","john","le","mesuri","clive","dunn","helen","mirren","name","conjur","nice","see","pink","panther","stalwart","burt","kwouk","cato","enjoi","cameo","seller","albeit","plai","role","still","nice","stori","ind","pretti","ridicul","mani","charact","involv","class","thi","film","strongli","goon","influenc","although","never","reach","height","goon","comedi","plenti","amus","joke","seem","point","right","direct","film","fail","commerci","initi","releas","due","entir","world","mourn","seller","death","film","releas","littl","week","afterand","alwai","sorrow","think","lurk","back","mind","view","thi","seller","last","film","far","great","film","often","slow","ridicul","sometim","joke","simpli","nevertheless","enjoy","onli","anoth","top","rate","perform","peter","seller"],"filtered2":["true","fan","peter","seller","work","mai","disappoint","last","ventur","sure","ani","fan","seller","find","delight","simpli","becaus","man","huge","talent","fiendish","plot","dr","fu","manchu","certainli","except","unfortun","prove","seller","last","even","releas","death","still","nice","see","man","manag","keep","irreplac","talent","right","untim","demis","onli","get","seller","get","seller","plai","onli","titl","role","conjur","nemesi","equal","bizarr","nayland","smith","detect","hunt","craze","year","old","fu","stori","equal","outlandish","follow","fu","outrag","antic","make","agedefi","elixir","conjur","nayland","group","associ","try","prevent","like","ani","seller","great","come","guarante","impecc","perform","good","mani","familiarfac","costar","david","tomlinson","sid","caesar","john","le","mesuri","clive","dun

{"value":"Jean Claude Van Damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of Universal Soldier. But, did that movie saved him? I think he goes to hell, after he dies. <br /><br />In the first minute, we see the inside of a facility, where you can see the bad guy of the film. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the acting (details are following). <br /><br />Then, we see Van Damme with a black girl (do not remember the name....well it doesn't matter anyway), trying to escape from some muscle-men. Of course they are the new Universal-Soldiers. More muscels, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg but then the \"mission\" gets aborted. It was just a test (Is this movie a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme works for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing, that yould Van Dammes character could do). But it is a sequel. And a \"story\" has to come up. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the \"story\".<br /><br />Well, after about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project. Of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the facility BUT the computer sends some soldiers hunting him (It wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the film. <br /><br />After some \"story\", Van Damme tries to rescue his daughter (of his wife - the reporter in the first movie). It comes to a final show down where Van Damme fights the Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see for yourself.

{"value":"Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it. What kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick ( with an obvious black daddy, cousins and auntie)pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day Puerto Ricans,but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken, the food and music. She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does. Also, since she wants to dance around her African-ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness (i.e. Lackawanna Blues). We can find a prideful Black Latina next time (thank you Zoe Saldana,Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa).<br /><br />To the Puerto Rican on here that said they are African and not \"black\"....thank you. We \"blacks\" certainly do not have anything in common with \"you\" so there is no love lost. But, since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood ,sweat and tears from the backs of the \"blacks\" you share nothing with.<br /><br />If I am correct Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media, but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations. However, you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior...you are not. Also, you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET...again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood. Try visiting Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C.

{"value":"\"Unhinged\" is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. It's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. It's plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins. <br /><br />As far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the \"lead\" girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen before. However, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic \"Sleepaway Camp.\" Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act. It may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but I say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 out

{"value":"I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had.<br /><br />First of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (sounds as if it's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors. I've seen some scenes filmed that way in \"North and South\" and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant, it's definitely overdone and simply annoying. Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively.<br /><br />Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced at first. The little boy gave a very good performance, he's very cute and the best feature of the film.<br /><br />SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh, letting no emotion pass through. She doesn't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. I just couldn't believe Markham could have fell for her and I'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given. I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago... Besides, he was the only main actor that sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I found just OK, Helen Graham's brother not very good. <br /><br />Maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty. Besides, what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation: making some scenes both gross and comic, (like when Huntingdon's eye starts bleeding) and others far too sexed up for a period drama!

{"value":"From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and he is struggling to both fill his father's shoes and cut the apron strings mother (and co-executive) keeps too tight. He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry. There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative story lines, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. The only real \"oy vey!\" moment was the name of Lena Olin's character. Overbearing woman named Lilith...subtle!<br /><br />The surgical scenes are not at all censored. I appreciated that, people who find surgery scenes scary might not. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first. You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader. The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.<br /><br />The big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he, like us, initially missed. <br /><br />There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin, which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing. The other is a secret about the family's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless.<br /><br />The initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat, taking the entire movie with

{"value":"This movie is all flash and no soul. The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers, but these numbers often didn't connect with the film and felt like stand-alone music videos. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you, every single one sounds like its coming from a studio, essentially sucking all the life from the songs. Off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry, \"strong\" (she's stubborn and selfish) black woman we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth to her character, nor any of the other female leads. Though I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's character faces hardship because of her weight, it is really her own refusal to do what's best for the team that lands her in trouble, making the end of the film totally meaningless. Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she put forth emotion (though it was often misplaced, but this was the writer/director's fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with an arc, and he did a fine job, but still not Oscar worthy. The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth into, no drama or heart, or even laughs. The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one; the number when Hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long-winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a Family Guy skit. The movie has no idea what it's about, and I felt insulted by the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and really is the worst film I saw in '06, and nothing last year was really stellar to begin

{"value":"I've seen some crappy movies in my life, but this one must be among the very worst. Definately bottom 100 material (imo, that is).<br /><br />We follow two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in one car on a roadtrip to Reno.<br /><br />Apparently, Lonnie isn't too happy with his sex-life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who's despirately trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, isn't too sure if his sperm is OK so he's getting it checked by a doctor.<br /><br />Now, I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend didn't, and she blurted out after about 20 minutes: 'oh yeah, she's gonna end up pregnant but her husband can't have any baby's'. Spot on, as this movie is soooo predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible.<br /><br />An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples set out in their big car towards Nevada, when they are stopped by 2 police-officers, as they didn't stop at a stop-sign. The guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer. Not only is this scene pointless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talk and talk and talk, without ever going somewhere.<br /><br />I still have to puke thinking about the ending though. Apparently, Roy ISN'T having problems down there so he IS the father of the child. How many times does that happen in the movies... try something new! The cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after. Yuck.<br /><br />Best scene of the movie is right at the end, with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon.

{"value":"I really can't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star... How can you like such a retarded film, where all the animal abuse scenes are real? I don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments... Jesus... What kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason, or just for money? I tell you, that director is either mentally retarded, or he's just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone. Or both. He truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive.<br /><br />It contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock, especially to sensitive persons and children: a real frog is skinned alive, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown into the water...<br /><br />This movie is more than awful; it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made, along with another one, called ''Cannibal Holocaust'' or something like that. I'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching it, especially when there are a lot of TRULY great movies out there, in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged.<br /><br />Fortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural, since it's the worst film ever -, so it wasn't successful. I hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will NEVER be praised, and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films. I truly believe that everyone receives but what they give! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ''humans'' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others.<br /><br />This, however, is probably my only ''negative'' review.

{"value":"This \"movie\" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies, he feels like making music, and when he is making music, he feels like making movies. The best thing in \"Promise me this\" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica.<br /><br />Kusturica said in the same interview, that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. \"Promise me this\" has very little \"noise\".<br /><br />I liked \"Life is a miracle\". It was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. \"Promise me this\" has no plot. I was awaiting this movie with big expectations, because I've read, that the script has been written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters, who participated also in \"Life is a miracle\". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are \"noise\", and much to my regret, I saw only two dialogues, which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor.<br /><br />Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for \"Time of the gypsies\" and \"Black cat white cat\") said in an interview, that Kusturica never follows the script. \"Black cat white cat\" was the only script, for which Kusturica said, that he will not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic, after all Kusturica comes back to the script, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. And I think this is the case with \"Promise me this\". He should have followed the script of Ranko Bozic.<br /><br />\"Promise me this\" is billed as a \"comedy\", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. The comedic moments are in the same style as \"Black cat white cat\", but are not that funny at all. I think the difference comes from the fact, that \"Black cat white cat\" was written by Gordan Mihic.<br /><br />However, I know some people, who liked \"Promise me this\", they find it very positive

{"value":"Comedy Central has a habit of putting on great programs at times-Chappelle's Show, The Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then there are those that some people love or hate-Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some shows that have their defenders but are just plain awful- Mencia, and now, Sarah Silverman.<br /><br />This show is based on the fact Silverman is self-Centered, which can be funny (Colbert Report) but can be horrible (Mind of Mencia). It should shock no one that I believe the latter is the case. This show is a parody of a sitcom and society, a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn't funny. A woman farting has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that's common. We don't need 25 minutes of it. When a criminal is disarmed by a queef, it simply loses its appeal-we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike back, except the women were hotter, and the whole scene was more absurd, making it better. But the best comparison of this show is to Stella, except Stella was more subtle, which is what made the absurdist comedy funny. It had better acting, and I suppose, a bit more of a fantastical realist view.<br /><br />Perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative (I'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute fan reaction) to this show is the amount of advertising on it, very obnoxious ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs. Many people are wondering why Sarah Silverman has a career, and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled. This show should've never made it past the unaired pilot stage. Back to Norm showed far more promise, yet this show makes it further. And as far as critics being correct, many things have been universally panned have seen their status rise immensely. Last I checked, Britney Spears gets good reviews too also. Take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychotic on IMDb for not liking this

{"value":"Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That is what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't recollect for now. Now with hideous films like Dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.<br /><br />Dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. <br /><br />Speaking of the acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.<br /><br />The plot was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie.

{"value":"Young and attractive Japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time it involves mobile phones. Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.<br /><br />The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I've been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls, however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo-Cronenberg style of Audition. Despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating Johnny Depp. There's none of that in One Missed Call; there's just very little of credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it's just downright boring.<br /><br />However, there are moments where Miike's glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the TV show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life. But aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Missed Call isn't offensively bad. It's just frustratingly average.<br /><br />Miike obviously loves directing. With his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100% concerned about all his projects.

{"value":"Today, I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood.<br /><br />Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world.<br /><br />However, I can't not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry I am at the careless, blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! How...dare...they? <br /><br />To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks.<br /><br />Ask yourself if you have a soul.<br /><br />Think.

{"value":"I would like to say that curiosity got the best of me. If only I saw a trailer, I'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.<br /><br />The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and \"accidentally\" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to \"laugh\" at the \"funny\" results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes.<br /><br />But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one.

{"value":"The comment by \"eliz7212-1\" hits the proverbial \"nail on the head\" for this turkey of a program. But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner \"cavort\" and \"dance\" (yes, the \" \" marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken \"camp\" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself. But the guy is funny.<br /><br />The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.<br /><br />I watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally \"dumber than a :post,\" yet through sheer luck, walked away with a quarter mil or so. The second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but who'd be lucky to gain $1,000 on Jeopardy!, got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he didn't know, and thereby left with zilch.<br /><br />This plethora of game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums to everyday individuals, are admittedly a cheap effort, overall, to attempt to woo viewers. Even if the host is well-compensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals as well.<br /><br />But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long. This one has already pretty much reached this point. I think his offerings, especially with James Spader, and the others on \"Boston Legal\" should give us a satisfying quantity of Bill Shatner's offerings.<br /><br />Again, the above rating is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance, perhaps one time; that should be sufficient.","finished_norm":["the","comment","by","eliz","hit","the","proverbi","nail","on","the","head","for","thi","turkei","of","a","program","but","it","be","a","hoot","to","watch","william","shatner","cavort","and","danc","ye","the","mark","on","the","word","danc","be","necessari","for","what","bill","doe","thi","show","would","be","a","great","skit","on","snl","or","mad","tv","and","it","doe","rate","a","few","star","for","on","view","or","so","to","see","shatner","who","seem","to","have","take","camp","to","new","height","whether","in","a","role","or","a","himself","but","the","gui","be","funnybr","br","the","girl","who","be","in","the","cubicl","area","with","the","game","datum","scroll","will","be","pretti","much","outofluck","when","thi","turkei","be","cancel","unless","there","be","a","reviv","of","the","whiskeyagogo","genr","with","a","resurrect","demand","for","shape","young","woman","to","danc","in","elev","cage","onc","morebr","br","i","watch","the","contest","who","be","annoi","and","liter","dumb","than","a","post","yet","through","sheer","luck","walk","awai","with","a","quarter","mil","or","so","the","contest","somewhat","much","intellig","but","who","have","be","lucki","to","gain","on","jeopardi","get","zonk","by","the","card","which","requir","answer","a","special","question","which","he","do","not","know","and","therebi","leav","with","zilchbr","br","thi","plethora","of","game","show","which","dangl","and","sometim","award","larg","sum","to","everydai","individu","be","admittedli","a","cheap","effort","overal","to","attempt","to","woo","viewer","even","if","the","host","be","wellcompens","and","thei","give","awai","six","figur","in","a","averag","episod","i","suppos","that","the","revenu","versu","cost","can","be","favor","sinc","you","do","not","have","a","sitcom","cast","where","sever","star","be","get","six","or","seven","figur","per","episod","with","some","big","residu","deal","a","wellbr","br","but","i","suspect","even","the","well","on","will","wear","thin","befor","long","thi","on","have","alreadi","pretti","much","reach","thi","point","i","think","hi","offer","especi","with","jame","spader","and","the","other","on","boston","legal","should","give","u","a","satisfi","quantiti","of","bill","shatner","offeringsbr","br","again","the","abov","rate","be","simpli","appropri","to","view","bill","hoot","and","pranc","perhap","on","time","that","should","be","suffici"],"filtered":["comment","eliz","hit","proverbi","nail","head","thi","turkei","program","hoot","watch","william","shatner","cavort","danc","ye","mark","word","danc","necessari","bill","doe","thi","show","great","skit","snl","mad","tv","doe","rate","star","view","see","shatner","seem","take","camp","new","height","whether","role","gui","funnybr","br","girl","cubicl","area","game","datum","scroll","pretti","much","outofluck","thi","turkei","cancel","unless","reviv","whiskeyagogo","genr","resurrect","demand","shape","young","woman","danc","elev","cage","onc","morebr","br","watch","contest","annoi","liter","dumb","post","yet","sheer","luck","walk","awai","quarter","mil","contest","somewhat","much","intellig","lucki","gain","jeopardi","get","zonk","card","requir","answer","special","question","know","therebi","leav","zilchbr","br","thi","plethora","game","show","dangl","sometim","award","larg","sum","everydai","individu","admittedli","cheap","effort","overal","attempt","woo","viewer","even","host","wellcompens","thei","give","awai","six","figur","averag","episod","suppos","revenu","versu","cost","favor","sinc","sitcom","cast","sever","star","get","six","seven","figur","per","episod","big","residu","deal","wellbr","br","suspect","even","well","wear","thin","befor","long","thi","alreadi","pretti","much","reach","thi","point","think","hi","offer","especi","jame","spader","boston","legal","give","u","satisfi","quantiti","bill","shatner","offeringsbr","br","abov","rate","simpli","appropri","view","bill","hoot","pranc","perhap","time","suffici"],"filtered2":["comment","eliz","hit","proverbi","nail","head","turkei","program","hoot","watch","william","shatner","cavort","danc","ye","mark","word","danc","necessari","bill","doe","show","great","skit","snl","mad","tv","doe","rate","star","view","see","shatner","seem","take","camp","new","height","whether","role","gui","funnybr","girl","cubicl","area","game","datum","scroll","pretti","outofluck","turkei","cancel","unless","reviv","whiskeyagogo","genr","resurrect","demand","shape","young","woman","danc","elev","cage","onc","morebr","watch","contest","annoi","liter","dumb","post","yet","sheer","luck","walk","awai","quarter","mil","contest","somewhat","intellig","lucki","gain","jeopardi","get","zonk","card","requir","answer","special","question","know","therebi","leav","zilchbr","plethora","game","show","dangl","sometim","award","larg","sum","everydai","individu","admittedli","cheap","effort","overal","attempt","woo","viewer","even","host","wellcompens","give","awai","six","figur","averag","suppo

{"value":"\"John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!\" I thought as I checked the flick's info here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night, having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2.<br /><br />I've just finished watching it, and sadly it was downhill from there on. Arguably you can't spoil a film this poor, but I'll leave the spoilers out of this review... <br /><br />There's an awful lot of style over very little substance: unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release. As for the substance, the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school-life; but beneath the shiny veneer, a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise. Characters are painted in childishly broad strokes, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer's father sought to question in Breakfast Club. <br /><br />Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up (perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information, which soon becomes a tiresome device, but at least pushes the story along), but his efforts don't sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting (how anyone is supposed to side with 'Maddox', when Blake Shields gurns and glowers his way through the part, I just can't understand), not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes (I'm all for creative license, but when the \"bad guys\" know the identities of the \"good guys\" making their lives a misery, but fail to act in any way to stop them, you really have to wonder why this script didn't undergo another few re-drafts before production - did Daddy even read it?).<br /><br />I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film (and all power to them), but they're really better off sticking with Hughes Sr.'s high school output, and if the idea of school-time rebellion is what really appeals, the 1968 classic \"If...\" is a much more satisfying examination of the subject.","finished_norm":["john","hugh","son","write","a","high","school","drama","wow","i","think","a","i","check","the","flick","info","here","on","imdb","late","on","a","saturdai","night","have","find","myself","watch","the","open","credit","on","bbcbr","br","i","have","just","finish","watch","it","and","sadli","it","be","downhil","from","there","on","arguabl","you","ca","not","spoil","a","film","thi","poor","but","i","will","leav","the","spoiler","out","of","thi","review","br","br","there","a","aw","lot","of","styl","over","veri","littl","substanc","unfortun","the","styl","have","not","date","too","good","in","the","eight","year","sinc","it","releas","a","for","the","substanc","the","film","try","to","pose","a","interest","look","at","the","natur","of","control","in","societi","through","the","microcosm","of","schoollif","but","beneath","the","shini","veneer","a","remot","meaning","or","relev","argum","fail","to","materialis","charact","be","paint","in","childishli","broad","stroke","fall","into","the","kind","of","gener","stereotyp","the","writer","father","seek","to","question","in","breakfast","club","br","br","director","kyl","cooper","doe","a","decent","job","keep","the","pace","up","perhap","reli","a","littl","too","much","on","montag","of","inform","which","soon","becom","a","tiresom","devic","but","at","littl","push","the","stori","along","but","hi","effort","do","not","suffici","detract","from","the","poor","script","and","bizarr","cast","how","anyon","be","suppos","to","side","with","maddox","when","blake","shield","gurn","and","glower","hi","wai","through","the","part","i","just","ca","not","understand","not","to","mention","the","numer","gape","plot","hole","i","be","all","for","creativ","licens","but","when","the","bad","gui","know","the","ident","of","the","good","gui","make","their","live","a","miseri","but","fail","to","act","in","ani","wai","to","stop","them","you","realli","have","to","wonder","why","thi","script","do","not","undergo","anoth","few","redraft","befor","product","do","daddi","even","read","itbr","br","i","be","sure","a","young","audienc","mai","get","some","enjoy","from","thi","film","and","all","power","to","them","but","thei","re","realli","well","off","stick","with","hugh","sr","high","school","output","and","if","the","idea","of","schooltim","rebellion","be","what","realli","appeal","the","classic","if","be","a","much","much","satisfi","examin","of","the","subject"],"filtered":["john","hugh","son","write","high","school","drama","wow","think","check","flick","info","imdb","late","saturdai","night","find","watch","open","credit","bbcbr","br","finish","watch","sadli","downhil","arguabl","ca","spoil","film","thi","poor","leav","spoiler","thi","review","br","br","aw","lot","styl","veri","littl","substanc","unfortun","styl","date","good","eight","year","sinc","releas","substanc","film","try","pose","interest","look","natur","control","societi","microcosm","schoollif","beneath","shini","veneer","remot","meaning","relev","argum","fail","materialis","charact","paint","childishli","broad","stroke","fall","kind","gener","stereotyp","writer","father","seek","question","breakfast","club","br","br","director","kyl","cooper","doe","decent","job","keep","pace","perhap","reli","littl","much","montag","inform","soon","becom","tiresom","devic","littl","push","stori","along","hi","effort","suffici","detract","poor","script","bizarr","cast","anyon","suppos","side","maddox","blake","shield","gurn","glower","hi","wai","part","ca","understand","mention","numer","gape","plot","hole","creativ","licens","bad","gui","know","ident","good","gui","make","live","miseri","fail","act","ani","wai","stop","realli","wonder","thi","script","undergo","anoth","redraft","befor","product","daddi","even","read","itbr","br","sure","young","audienc","mai","get","enjoy","thi","film","power","thei","re","realli","well","stick","hugh","sr","high","school","output","idea","schooltim","rebellion","realli","appeal","classic","much","much","satisfi","examin","subject"],"filtered2":["john","hugh","son","write","high","school","drama","wow","think","check","flick","info","imdb","late","saturdai","night","find","watch","open","credit","bbcbr","finish","watch","sadli","downhil","arguabl","ca","spoil","poor","leav","spoiler","review","aw","lot","styl","veri","littl","substanc","unfortun","styl","date","good","eight","year","sinc","releas","substanc","try","pose","interest","look","natur","control","societi","microcosm","schoollif","beneath","shini","veneer","remot","meaning","relev","argum","fail","materialis","charact","paint","childishli","broad","stroke","fall","kind","gener","stereotyp","writer","father","seek","question","breakfast","club","director","kyl","cooper","doe","decent","job","keep","pace","perhap","reli","littl","montag","inform","soon","becom","tiresom","devic","littl","push","stori","along","effort","suffici","detract","poor","script","bizarr","cast","anyon","suppos","side","maddox","blake","shield","gur

{"value":"\"Don't Drink the Water\" is an unbelievably bad film. It's based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. It stars Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind \"The Honeymooners\". The director, Howard Morris, has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie)and has made a mark in animation (characters he has voiced include Gopher from \"Pooh\", Jughead (Archie)and Beetle Bailey) What went wrong?<br /><br />I think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively. Allen's original play was tongue-in-cheek, which is why it worked on Broadway and in Allen's 1994 remake. The screenplay by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play. Making Gleason's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn't work.<br /><br />The acting isn't much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can't save this. Gleason was a comic genius , but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in \"The Hustler\" and \"Soldier in the Rain\". His abrasive personality could have worked here, but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance. Too bad. Estelle Parsons' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes. See how soon it'll take for YOU to want to strangle her. That is also a shame because she is also a fine actress, having turned in two exceptional performances in \"Bonnie and Clyde\" and \"Rachel, Rachel\" None of the other actors do particularly well either.<br /><br />Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the leads. They manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. It's finally on video after a long battle over rights. Do go out and find that version. All the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4
