{"value":"The plot of this film is not strong at all, lots of holes. If you approach it as a car movie its not bad, lots of great cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud.","finished_norm":["the","plot","of","thi","film","be","not","strong","at","all","lot","of","hole","if","you","approach","it","a","a","car","movi","it","not","bad","lot","of","great","car","in","thi","on","the","reason","i","like","it","be","becaus","i","be","from","the","area","where","thi","be","film","i","get","the","much","enjoy","look","at","the","recogniz","place","in","st","cloud","mn","and","see","how","the","town","have","chang","sinc","it","a","interest","histor","piec","for","u","local","seem","like","whenev","a","film","be","make","here","everyon","want","some","relationship","to","it","it","be","imposs","to","find","a","copi","in","ani","of","the","local","video","store","a","thei","be","all","steal","onc","it","come","out","on","vh","have","to","get","a","copi","from","japan","on","ebai","i","find","it","interest","how","the","path","of","the","drag","race","be","all","over","town","i","do","not","know","the","director","be","from","stcloud"],"filtered":["plot","thi","film","strong","lot","hole","approach","car","movi","bad","lot","great","car","thi","reason","like","becaus","area","thi","film","get","much","enjoy","look","recogniz","place","st","cloud","mn","see","town","chang","sinc","interest","histor","piec","u","local","seem","like","whenev","film","make","everyon","want","relationship","imposs","find","copi","ani","local","video","store","thei","steal","onc","come","vh","get","copi","japan","ebai","find","interest","path","drag","race","town","know","director","stcloud"],"filtered2":["plot","strong","lot","hole","approach","car","bad","lot","great","car","reason","like","becaus","area","get","enjoy","look","recogniz","place","st","cloud","mn","see","town","chang","sinc","interest","histor","piec","u","local","seem","like","whenev","make","everyon","want","relationship","imposs","find","copi","ani","local","video","store","steal","onc","come","vh","get","copi","japan","ebai","find","interest","path","drag","race","town","know","director","stcloud"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,9,16,22,26,27,32,34,35,37,38,51,58,60,72,95,112,162,164,218,236,240,246,278,284,450,475,577,578,631,736,747,764,793,810,901,953,1079,1123,1127,1156,1498,1841,2097,2178,4309,4460,8294],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,9,16,22,26,27,32,34,35,37,38,51,58,60,72,95,112,162,164,218,236,240,246,278,284,450,475,577,578,631,736,747,764,793,810,901,953,1079,1123,1127,1156,1498,1841,2097,2178,4309,4460,8294],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,3.038623282696244,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,3.676353282473182,3.841892750832105,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.3586007221245198,2.3930275298746078,2.5940874818617203,2.617923930016232,2.7666071276613566,2.673149229007135,2.8336934208777267,6.221997360326558,6.939969152944234,6.7442140023250925,3.604618302480356,3.575630765607104,3.607563812710113,3.68099128126493,7.493177127501487,3.7465885637507435,3.770603439954617,3.8425769395797067,3.8962296530720266,4.1302590120314875,4.186539847930077,4.390138803171316,4.315570107673808,4.2860694432771105,4.506310234933358,5.156897801074508,5.00274712124725,5.039114765418124,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.237591507905528E-5,7.188786736356952E-5,7.244672698370679E-5,7.20281290233941E-5,7.202930912319353E-5,7.192862654324558E-5,7.214255235671844E-5,7.189821874674047E-5,7.205987215249254E-5,7.99464945597609E-5,0.8624132526409514,7.178215916987696E-5,7.312193757422001E-5,7.416503808124042E-5,7.183450197151935E-5,7.163598240173933E-5,7.342285237348926E-5,7.214931156931943E-5,7.192546861123722E-5,7.198508203658537E-5,7.268157992538882E-5,7.222079327988062E-5,7.230302760938834E-5,7.238092601219398E-5,7.293641243386153E-5,7.255497553000396E-5,7.560504886709079E-5,7.180349934763016E-5,7.18054202593927E-5,7.198733888555909E-5,7.351741292115322E-5,7.214513113281594E-5,7.744168673285575E-5,7.23480647404815E-5,7.188165422758188E-5,7.221343544671651E-5,7.180962701373644E-5,7.18520612199307E-5,7.163562249677173E-5,7.165420808221424E-5,7.181549299625625E-5,7.257299427473168E-5,7.220422039335385E-5,7.191874508981608E-5,7.279263325406694E-5,7.194634789717971E-5,7.433676776617689E-5,7.324362392825043E-5,7.167201807011096E-5,7.183041761309063E-5,7.180550411803916E-5,7.38263809238409E-5,7.183148631276611E-5,7.16478468259138E-5,7.243428448079652E-5,7.184998819676996E-5,0.13193613078892766,7.17907744704904E-5,7.167118922433891E-5,7.20133981173915E-5,7.272771050380386E-5,7.200863402148704E-5,7.165792989

{"value":"I've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about \"teenagers seduce and kill man in his house\" and such. I think I first saw parts of this film when I was about 10 years old when it was running on cable. It made quite an impression! It's the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching, and switch the channel when their parents come in. When I saw who the cast was, I couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. Then again, if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered, then this is an interesting film. Also, if I recall, there's some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the dumbest ending of all time, but still...memorable.","finished_norm":["i","have","be","try","to","track","down","thi","film","just","by","googl","bad","phrase","about","teenag","seduc","and","kill","man","in","hi","hous","and","such","i","think","i","see","part","of","thi","film","when","i","be","about","year","old","when","it","be","run","on","cabl","it","make","quit","a","impress","it","the","kind","of","film","that","kid","know","thei","should","not","be","watch","and","switch","the","channel","when","their","parent","come","in","when","i","see","who","the","cast","be","i","can","not","believ","that","some","of","thi","good","actor","be","in","such","a","horribl","movi","then","again","if","you","like","to","see","man","who","cheat","on","their","wife","get","murder","then","thi","be","a","interest","film","conjur","if","i","recal","there","some","pretti","interest","pseudolesbian","moment","probabl","the","dumb","end","of","all","time","but","stillmemor"],"filtered":["try","track","thi","film","googl","bad","phrase","teenag","seduc","kill","man","hi","hous","think","see","part","thi","film","year","old","run","cabl","make","quit","impress","kind","film","kid","know","thei","watch","switch","channel","parent","come","see","cast","believ","thi","good","actor","horribl","movi","like","see","man","cheat","wife","get","murder","thi","interest","film","conjur","recal","pretti","interest","pseudolesbian","moment","probabl","dumb","end","time","stillmemor"],"filtered2":["try","track","googl","bad","phrase","teenag","seduc","kill","man","hous","think","see","part","year","old","run","cabl","make","quit","impress","kind","kid","know","watch","switch","channel","parent","come","see","cast","believ","good","actor","horribl","like","see","man","cheat","wife","get","murder","interest","conjur","recal","pretti","interest","pseudolesbian","moment","probabl","dumb","end","time","stillmemor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,12,24,26,34,36,39,41,45,57,60,61,67,76,78,91,92,114,120,122,137,148,188,213,230,263,273,418,420,670,692,728,867,1404,1535,1579,1700,2614,2660,7219],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,12,24,26,34,36,39,41,45,57,60,61,67,76,78,91,92,114,120,122,137,148,188,213,230,263,273,418,420,670,692,728,867,1404,1535,1579,1700,2614,2660,7219],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,3.632592212924433,1.834162586674748,3.676353282473182,1.8818517047392527,1.9570915389266579,2.1337665533324026,2.0064197866819473,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.4433074195966826,2.2044500422972613,2.2489347673732487,2.2939035841256437,2.3018654096236517,2.5378812223426954,2.8432628718938773,2.7121382192999195,2.902686292364678,2.9674191958529437,3.164467636384302,3.3023374306074227,3.7264536553416874,3.753391311073496,3.7740817043309423,3.8844878351953436,4.4919214974812585,4.558366596889411,4.605250182788262,4.6973654716960676,5.274680836730892,5.3064295350454715,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.010729090882769E-4,1.0039135083337743E-4,1.0117179785802014E-4,1.0058722613217725E-4,1.0058887414062885E-4,1.0044827099607813E-4,1.0074701822812569E-4,1.004058065319207E-4,1.0063155538726217E-4,1.1164521744200392E-4,0.757882454098517,1.0024372942314304E-4,1.021147289222539E-4,1.0357141796861485E-4,1.0031682610490587E-4,1.0003959368018692E-4,1.025349562052753E-4,1.0075645746326328E-4,1.004438609464858E-4,1.0052711104859605E-4,1.0149976980832728E-4,1.0085628161643819E-4,1.0097112179360472E-4,1.0107990685250582E-4,1.0185564320811045E-4,1.013229668686901E-4,0.13255707698388863,1.0027353096476943E-4,1.0027621351655107E-4,1.0053026273643168E-4,1.0266700993650531E-4,1.0075061948693917E-4,1.0814725526085766E-4,1.0103401611213048E-4,1.0038267419380548E-4,1.0084600640815003E-4,1.002820882457186E-4,1.0034134758164853E-4,1.0003909107317973E-4,1.0006504582878774E-4,1.0029028008574288E-4,1.0134813003168099E-4,1.0083313759329979E-4,1.0043447155405312E-4,1.0165485569540968E-4,1.0047301885305718E-4,1.0381123833999643E-4,1.0228466382096663E-4,1.000899174630266E-4,1.0031112230153843E-4,1.002763306250856E-4,1.030984835118339E-4,1.0031261473980363E-4,1.000561623393142E-4,1.0115442191238815E-4,1.0033845260641768E-4,1.0790297829702555E-4,1.0025576068374568E-4,1.000887599805509E-4,1.0056665443340753E-4,1.015641911251872E-4,1.0056000137718416E-4,1.0007024333619364E-4,1.0030324157131291E-4,1.000403010636948E-4,1.0235502627764432E-4,1.0090210129638055E-4,1.0068716504725156E-4,0.10176766579765527,1.0096580931633507E-4,1.0003665143485319E-4,1.0060121858402026E-4,1.02232

{"value":"Watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. Even when you thought, \"That mackerel surely can't be coming around again,\" *slap* there it was. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the sort of pilot I watched and wondered, \"Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series?\" Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones as well. And while \"Blazing Saddles\" made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness, these stereotypes were just downright offensive. There was no plot line, the ending was slapped on, and the jokes aren't. Still, if you are a student of comedy, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't

{"value":"Hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day, you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot, though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well (what is he doing still making these movies anyway? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie?). It was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length, and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or, Abbott and Costello if that's your thing) -- basically just bad puns. Still, I found this movie fascinating to watch, and for more than 2 reasons. Good job, but still a fundamentally flimsy production.","finished_norm":["hard","to","describ","thi","on","if","you","be","a","fan","of","russ","meyer","film","back","in","the","dai","you","will","sure","be","pleas","to","see","that","haji","be","still","look","realli","hot","though","forri","ackerman","have","not","fare","so","good","what","be","he","do","still","make","thi","movi","anywai","if","i","go","up","to","him","with","a","camera","will","he","be","in","my","movi","it","be","a","pretti","fun","premis","a","superhero","whose","giant","mammari","be","her","secret","weapon","but","sometim","it","do","not","pan","out","for","the","whole","length","and","the","joke","be","on","a","level","with","your","averag","joe","e","brown","comedi","or","abbott","and","costello","if","that","your","thing","basic","just","bad","pun","still","i","find","thi","movi","fascin","to","watch","and","for","much","than","reason","good","job","but","still","a","fundament","flimsi","product"],"filtered":["hard","describ","thi","fan","russ","meyer","film","back","dai","sure","pleas","see","haji","still","look","realli","hot","though","forri","ackerman","fare","good","still","make","thi","movi","anywai","go","camera","movi","pretti","fun","premis","superhero","whose","giant","mammari","secret","weapon","sometim","pan","whole","length","joke","level","averag","joe","e","brown","comedi","abbott","costello","thing","basic","bad","pun","still","find","thi","movi","fascin","watch","much","reason","good","job","still","fundament","flimsi","product"],"filtered2":["hard","describ","fan","russ","meyer","back","dai","sure","pleas","see","haji","still","look","realli","hot","though","forri","ackerman","fare","good","still","make","anywai","go","camera","pretti","fun","premis","superhero","whose","giant","mammari","secret","weapon","sometim","pan","whole","length","joke","level","averag","joe","e","brown","comedi","abbott","costello","thing","basic","bad","pun","still","find","fascin","watch","reason","good","job","still","fundament","flimsi","product"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,9,13,16,29,38,63,64,78,86,95,111,119,127,132,140,171,190,214,231,259,286,289,346,386,445,484,500,598,643,666,668,798,821,907,1258,1278,1650,1774,1955,2381,2865,2883,2889,3276,3394,3502,5230,7876,8147],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,9,13,16,29,38,63,64,78,86,95,111,119,127,132,140,171,190,214,231,259,286,289,346,386,445,484,500,598,643,666,668,798,821,907,1258,1278,1650,1774,1955,2381,2865,2883,2889,3276,3394,3502,5230,7876,8147],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.3195384777338066,1.519311641348122,1.8729627573220065,7.533714310408536,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,2.0323326556775485,2.1183455303375887,2.1653408989309972,2.4359679371086367,2.253494045787767,2.317169775997098,2.373087554090762,2.558331832813986,2.7303758068497004,2.7049353070058615,2.7464553122240485,2.780700890737216,2.8282659991423613,3.023389038124396,3.0433232530252132,3.241201430615691,3.291526514503207,3.3814747511661465,3.5642670069567886,3.5813614403160887,3.6621227969605474,3.5813614403160887,3.9282323841582003,4.339813719283801,4.181290492043933,4.34596758485818,4.470719289830655,4.6295428753573065,4.760735085628657,5.014723312293965,5.116075806554253,5.770002273960917,5.408212229355414,5.373120909544144,6.137727054086234,5.649374286172302,5.672363804397,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.759683103803626E-5,6.714100980349772E-5,6.76629671324674E-5,0.05186441675539873,6.727311196367882E-5,6.717907759689008E-5,6.737887758632309E-5,6.715067767019693E-5,6.730165687292493E-5,7.466751444781846E-5,0.6054245439639677,6.704228167134815E-5,6.829359261267255E-5,6.926781571785513E-5,6.709116820376454E-5,6.690575716196278E-5,6.857463758213276E-5,6.738519047855583E-5,6.71761281875988E-5,6.723180525415411E-5,6.788231240223464E-5,6.745195215066506E-5,6.752875643108332E-5,6.760151109217236E-5,6.812031795973832E-5,6.776406787414605E-5,7.061274055476743E-5,6.70622127269808E-5,6.706400679822273E-5,6.723391308019801E-5,6.866295416308822E-5,6.738128608218745E-5,7.232810262451902E-5,6.757081969670997E-5,6.713520692966721E-5,6.744508016563168E-5,6.706793577462713E-5,6.710756799016752E-5,6.690542102202924E-5,6.692277937497755E-5,6.707341441802432E-5,0.07996609231026618,6.743647359527631E-5,6.716984862980684E-5,6.798603272254655E-5,0.04101508164245483,6.942820584880113E-5,6.840724384463341E-5,6.693941334418305E-5,6.708735354129977E-5,6.706408511956415E-5,6.89515205715547E-5,6.708835167322412E-5,6.691683816142798E-5,6.765134622562297E-5,6.710563185165816E-5,0.14632850849685655,6.705032809

{"value":"The world may have ended. Unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to Canada's inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable. Maybe it's because all our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short et al) go to Hollywood.) In fact it's too bad Short wasn't cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film. He might have given it some credibility. The Canadian government should realize --- and this movie is a magnificent example --- that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema.

{"value":"Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would ever like to see. I also did not like the movie when some Aussie man smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I would not go to that country no matter what after I saw this movie. In fact this movie stinks. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women. Germany is the country I tolerate. I also would rather stick to the United States instead. After I saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theatre and had my money refunded because I cannot tolerate this movie.

{"value":"I had suspicions the movie was going to be bad. I'm a Duke's fan from way back. Have three years of the TV series on DVD. Well I was right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good. But to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the TV show.<br /><br />Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy's outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful.

{"value":"I was raised in a \"very Christian\" household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs. If I didn't hear her footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.","finished_norm":["i","be","rais","in","a","veri","christian","household","sinc","birth","i","be","save","befor","i","see","thi","movi","and","the","rest","of","the","seri","and","be","forc","to","watch","it","in","a","youth","group","at","my","church","thi","movi","be","highli","disturb","i","see","it","when","i","be","about","year","old","and","liter","have","nightmar","about","it","for","year","i","us","to","lie","awak","in","bed","and","listen","for","the","sound","of","my","mom","footstep","upstair","if","i","do","not","hear","her","footstep","i","would","sneak","upstair","to","make","sure","she","have","not","be","raptur","i","us","to","prai","so","hard","everi","night","for","salvat","becaus","i","be","terrifi","of","jesu","forget","me","thi","be","definit","not","someth","i","will","show","to","my","kid","until","thei","be","much","old","if","at","all","it","take","me","year","to","shake","the","fear","that","thi","movi","give","me"],"filtered":["rais","veri","christian","household","sinc","birth","save","befor","see","thi","movi","rest","seri","forc","watch","youth","group","church","thi","movi","highli","disturb","see","year","old","liter","nightmar","year","us","lie","awak","bed","listen","sound","mom","footstep","upstair","hear","footstep","sneak","upstair","make","sure","raptur","us","prai","hard","everi","night","salvat","becaus","terrifi","jesu","forget","thi","definit","someth","show","kid","thei","much","old","take","year","shake","fear","thi","movi","give"],"filtered2":["rais","veri","christian","household","sinc","birth","save","befor","see","rest","forc","watch","youth","group","church","highli","disturb","see","year","old","liter","nightmar","year","us","lie","awak","bed","listen","sound","mom","footstep","upstair","hear","footstep","sneak","upstair","make","sure","raptur","us","prai","hard","everi","night","salvat","becaus","terrifi","jesu","forget","definit","someth","show","kid","old","take","year","shake","fear","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,15,22,28,30,31,53,56,57,67,79,85,114,119,162,171,178,189,210,216,226,338,373,392,410,650,684,812,839,845,896,897,1045,1054,1065,1121,1130,1141,1640,1643,2158,2380,2493,2513,2701,4715,4754,4875,5666,6009],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,15,22,28,30,31,53,56,57,67,79,85,114,119,162,171,178,189,210,216,226,338,373,392,410,650,684,812,839,845,896,897,1045,1054,1065,1121,1130,1141,1640,1643,2158,2380,2493,2513,2701,4715,4754,4875,5666,6009],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.7003182735607676,3.7221218701403576,5.502487760024244,3.9141830778533158,1.9469506069506084,2.011190219103739,2.4433074195966826,2.1653408989309972,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,2.532833256045391,2.498193474075453,2.687151791517189,2.6070186965339692,2.5940874818617203,2.9720957437368454,3.0316467233633775,3.0670934723591254,3.2070272508030975,3.6621227969605474,4.1302590120314875,3.952924996748572,3.965503778955432,3.831445099210862,3.8844878351953436,3.8844878351953436,4.1554492608600455,4.3095999406873045,4.1302590120314875,4.403125998698128,4.416284083275639,4.770124825978496,4.688631791727313,4.671389985292807,5.064116067623542,5.170884043049248,5.170884043049248,5.259176650194926,5.274680836730892,6.032366538428407,6.342521466732247,12.685042933464494,6.489124940924123,12.875663293073144]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.26670528848289E-5,6.224447429686549E-5,6.272836573135835E-5,6.23659205658949E-5,6.23669423612872E-5,6.227976583916259E-5,6.246499458897099E-5,6.225343709444667E-5,6.239340551510446E-5,6.922207749720125E-5,0.39586224818042826,6.215294632160942E-5,6.331300024323804E-5,6.421617410385507E-5,0.038484630259905034,6.202637842606837E-5,6.357354884727347E-5,6.247084708745842E-5,6.227703152772818E-5,6.232864811419701E-5,6.293171434118898E-5,6.253273988882947E-5,6.26039428998115E-5,6.267139162668332E-5,6.315236236018521E-5,0.06609060419403177,6.546301474100679E-5,6.217142382267273E-5,6.217308705385785E-5,0.09880023173673423,6.365542457671748E-5,6.246722743532471E-5,6.705327694547707E-5,6.264293852802446E-5,6.223909462158136E-5,6.252636907169355E-5,6.217672949342692E-5,6.221347136592411E-5,6.202606680052811E-5,6.204215922387847E-5,6.218180858412153E-5,6.283769490523669E-5,6.251839017103601E-5,6.227120993262973E-5,6.302787042866238E-5,0.10235556174927497,6.436486712191298E-5,6.341836298960273E-5,6.205758009216294E-5,6.21947311392481E-5,6.21731596632919E-5,6.392294608774776E-5,6.219565647827847E-5,6.203665129787078E-5,6.271759232715276E-5,6.221167642831395E-5,0.2937637549571538,6.216040592330941E-5,6.205686243185048E-5,6.235316573627379E-5,6.297165673630739E-5

Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV-version. P.S.The spectator cannot see at all Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith relationship's development as it was in the motion version, so one cannot understand where was all Emma's trying of make a Elton-Smith match (besides of the portrait).","finished_norm":["the","script","be","nicethough","the","cast","be","absolut","nonwatchableno","styl","the","costum","do","not","look","like","some","from","the","high","highburi","societi","compar","gwyneth","paltrow","with","kate","beckinsal","i","can","onli","sai","that","m","beckinsal","speak","british","english","well","than","m","paltrow","though","in","m","paltrow","act","lie","the","veri","natur","of","emma","woodhous","mr","northam","undoubtedli","be","the","well","mr","knightlei","of","all","version","he","be","romant","and","not","at","all","sharplook","and","unfeel","like","mr","knightlei","in","the","tvversion","psthe","spectat","cannot","see","at","all","mr","eltonm","smith","relationship","develop","a","it","be","in","the","motion","version","so","on","cannot","understand","where","be","all","emma","try","of","make","a","eltonsmith","match","besid","of","the","portrait"],"filtered":["script","nicethough","cast","absolut","nonwatchableno","styl","costum","look","like","high","highburi","societi","compar","gwyneth","paltrow","kate","beckinsal","onli","sai","m","beckinsal","speak","british","english","well","m","paltrow","though","m","paltrow","act","lie","veri","natur","emma","woodhous","mr","northam","undoubtedli","well","mr","knightlei","version","romant","sharplook","unfeel","like","mr","knightlei","tvversion","psthe","spectat","see","mr","eltonm","smith","relationship","develop","motion","version","understand","emma","try","make","eltonsmith","match","besid","portrait"],"filtered2":["script","nicethough","cast","absolut","nonwatchableno","styl","costum","look","like","high","highburi","societi","compar","gwyneth","paltrow","kate","beckinsal","onli","m","beckinsal","speak","british","english","well","m","paltrow","though","m","paltrow","act","lie","veri","natur","emma","woodhous","mr","northam","undoubtedli","well","mr","knightlei","version","romant","sharplook","unfeel","like","mr","knightlei","tvversion","psthe","spectat","see","mr","eltonm","smith","relationship","develop","motion","version","understand","emma","try","make","eltonsmith","match","besid","portrait"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,11,15,16,20,21,36,77,86,92,211,212,220,222,320,344,357,380,456,482,577,588,650,696,776,864,919,972,1021,1049,1221,1528,1593,3345,3367,3699,4158,5720,6030,7062],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,11,15,16,20,21,36,77,86,92,211,212,220,222,320,344,357,380,456,482,577,588,650,696,776,864,919,972,1021,1049,1221,1528,1593,3345,3367,3699,4158,5720,6030,7062],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.4680183469605717,1.9463902258768238,2.031112399272319,2.0489535369135887,2.5687161421197025,2.5983793339432615,5.667386841755453,2.5771019354959765,2.938298364153555,2.983093497946387,13.131844606577134,3.102062070196872,3.3001658770939146,3.3154667220492153,3.604618302480356,3.6375061693251913,3.6621227969605474,3.8095464139032247,3.770603439954617,3.9782428047328615,4.235066888824737,3.9911462095687695,4.076977645418551,4.176068548062782,13.412157869491967,4.848596441419991,5.00274712124725,17.63464757580345,12.350934764138163,5.672363804397,5.878215858601149,6.489124940924123,13.737229125258052,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.9948551796502707,6.43372473910161E-5,6.483740814075398E-5,6.446277690578067E-5,6.446383305580329E-5,6.437372549952657E-5,6.456518197875581E-5,6.434651153424824E-5,6.449118594926284E-5,7.154945037557813E-5,8.332953911161076E-5,6.424264207779322E-5,6.5441699134437E-5,6.637523935248881E-5,6.428948714222355E-5,6.411181873806433E-5,6.571100785918037E-5,6.457123124894878E-5,6.437089925553968E-5,6.442425128607152E-5,6.504759370284734E-5,6.463520499952687E-5,6.470880198599491E-5,6.477851846245295E-5,6.527566031188952E-5,6.493428698496308E-5,6.766400105279676E-5,6.426174082624449E-5,6.426345997830473E-5,6.442627109074888E-5,6.579563640042945E-5,6.456748989748863E-5,6.930773078176227E-5,6.474910871856589E-5,6.433168684120749E-5,6.462861998386425E-5,6.42672248833555E-5,6.430520208482059E-5,6.411149663510333E-5,6.412813011516575E-5,6.427247474237079E-5,6.495041316146182E-5,6.462037281797022E-5,6.436488192776414E-5,6.514698273388684E-5,6.438958552116829E-5,6.652893170182867E-5,6.55506043690821E-5,6.414406946125245E-5,6.428583177744088E-5,6.426353502900078E-5,6.60721524740569E-5,6.428678822806225E-5,6.412243700260963E-5,6.482627251499044E-5,6.430334679812435E-5,6.915118236077251E-5,6.425035248494874E-5,6.414332767188741E-5,6.444959323545436E-5,6.508887903435912E-5,6.444532952826647E-5,6.413146101286773E-5,6.428078129763428E-5,6.411227207500391E-5,6.559569716586921E-5,6.466456920330895E-5,6.45268242031798E-5,6.447039257909351E-

{"value":"I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago, I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it, I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs. Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. Towards the end we all got bored however, as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten \"Learn to Read\" book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","movi","with","some","friend","a","coupl","month","ago","i","still","laugh","todai","think","about","some","of","the","utter","stupid","the","few","scene","alon","be","hilari","i","wo","not","spoil","anyth","for","that","who","wish","to","see","it","i","would","not","want","to","ruin","the","laugh","needless","to","sai","the","entir","time","i","watch","thi","movi","i","be","try","to","figur","out","exactli","what","the","point","of","anyth","the","charact","in","thi","movi","be","do","toward","the","end","we","all","get","bore","howev","a","the","initi","hilar","and","shock","of","a","movi","be","thi","random","wear","off","there","be","no","plot","and","not","a","trace","of","decent","act","the","charact","be","about","a","good","develop","a","that","in","a","kindergarten","learn","to","read","book","thei","even","manag","to","make","a","lesbian","sex","scene","uninterest"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","friend","coupl","month","ago","still","laugh","todai","think","utter","stupid","scene","alon","hilari","wo","spoil","anyth","wish","see","want","ruin","laugh","needless","sai","entir","time","watch","thi","movi","try","figur","exactli","point","anyth","charact","thi","movi","toward","end","get","bore","howev","initi","hilar","shock","movi","thi","random","wear","plot","trace","decent","act","charact","good","develop","kindergarten","learn","read","book","thei","even","manag","make","lesbian","sex","scene","uninterest"],"filtered2":["watch","friend","coupl","month","ago","still","laugh","todai","think","utter","stupid","scene","alon","hilari","wo","spoil","anyth","wish","see","want","ruin","laugh","needless","entir","time","watch","try","figur","exactli","point","anyth","charact","toward","end","get","bore","howev","initi","hilar","shock","random","wear","plot","trace","decent","act","charact","good","develop","kindergarten","learn","read","book","even","manag","make","lesbian","sex","scene","uninterest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,12,19,21,24,32,36,37,64,66,104,108,113,133,136,145,151,161,198,253,254,309,320,345,399,406,415,430,457,462,508,514,563,610,632,710,789,859,1024,1193,1226,1231,1239,1248,2205,3108,4326,6899],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,12,19,21,24,32,36,37,64,66,104,108,113,133,136,145,151,161,198,253,254,309,320,345,399,406,415,430,457,462,508,514,563,610,632,710,789,859,1024,1193,1226,1231,1239,1248,2205,3108,4326,6899],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,4.145648034064571,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,4.642472950759303,2.346825985579986,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.4323182980210873,2.5439726117360975,2.7073305177318163,2.889652074525771,2.848772527704847,2.938298364153555,3.0022328381570844,3.129115117668582,3.121829110937649,3.1588018988486244,3.2189558216683714,3.3243163373261977,3.2639531875991072,3.4149707055943286,3.405285399859865,3.459754308221302,3.477726550625732,3.541919708264792,3.6528204042982337,3.8059428063999263,3.9405024767500145,4.072271754381138,4.240607069200353,4.3095999406873045,4.327618446189983,4.573751515728891,4.327618446189983,5.0768550934009715,5.501738287366237,5.9370563586240825,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.680907618806096E-5,7.629113463082872E-5,7.688422545523718E-5,7.643998758148174E-5,7.644123996461645E-5,7.633439038702444E-5,7.656141955947333E-5,7.630212005571435E-5,7.647367503702144E-5,8.484336792013974E-5,0.8220351337396054,7.617895161118517E-5,7.760079396608873E-5,7.870778634370527E-5,7.623450050800886E-5,7.602382124069459E-5,7.792014036354624E-5,7.656859278657623E-5,7.633103902573301E-5,7.63943038856577E-5,7.713346358191153E-5,7.664445288653559E-5,7.673172422360308E-5,7.681439405029184E-5,7.740390506147136E-5,7.699910442886681E-5,8.023600050225782E-5,7.620159891501712E-5,7.620363748624291E-5,7.639669897088155E-5,7.802049292284683E-5,7.65641562904636E-5,0.17196832441835144,7.677951996379713E-5,7.628454092856022E-5,7.663664437223266E-5,7.620810191221307E-5,7.625313529345591E-5,7.60234392908699E-5,7.604316327842425E-5,7.621432719721001E-5,7.701822685564501E-5,7.662686487949621E-5,7.632390367596198E-5,7.725131913612537E-5,7.635319720726284E-5,7.889003479527411E-5,7.772993383848358E-5,7.606206416162239E-5,7.623016597493403E-5,7.620372648138941E-5,7.834838579759929E-5,7.62313001344774E-5,7.60364123831948E-5,7.687102082558987E-5,7.625093529372231E-5,8.199950071384868E-5,7.61880946151

{"value":"After Harry Reems' teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries a cane and dresses like a magician, rapes some more women. Eventually, Reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree. Despite being shot on film and marginally nasty, it looks like any other 70's porno and is ineptly executed. The rape/abuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on \"Death Wish\" is laughable. R. Bolla (\"Cannibal Holocaust\") plays a cop. Colt, who is usually over-the-top, wigs out in a couple of scenes, but he's too well behaved for my money.

{"value":"I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing that I can tell you right away, there is NO comparison. This film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. A martian that took different shapes. Special effects that looked like something that a little child would create. In contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this film, yes, actually there was one, occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end. He wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the TV series.

{"value":"I don't know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York, and as far as I am concerned, this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat!<br /><br />As magical as Jerry's exploration of the 'Big Apple' might be for the other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb, I couldn't wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end, so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD.<br /><br />In fact, the only part of the whole episode that I genuinely enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'buys the farm', hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy

{"value":"This movie is one of the most awful movies ever made.How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He is a singer not an actor, What?Is he killing vampires with his guitar? And what about the dreadful plot? O my God this movie really sucks. In the end is the Queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the \"fantastic\" slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left!! What happened with the other 10-15 vampires? They run out in the sun??? And what about the \"Grand Finally\" when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun??? That's really a \"NOT\" . In \"Buffy the vampire Slayer\" in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN???

{"value":"I had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and I have to say I thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of Bachelor Party starring Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good...I was right...In all honesty I thought it could have been better...Sure there were some funny moments but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me...The acting was OK and the storyline pretty well follows the original but I think it could have been so much better...This movie I'd say is for teens and the young of heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex...It's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this one.","finished_norm":["i","have","the","pleasur","of","view","thi","movi","earli","and","i","have","to","sai","i","think","that","it","be","go","to","be","bore","and","wonder","how","can","thei","ever","improv","upon","the","version","of","bachelor","parti","star","tom","hank","which","i","think","be","pretti","goodi","be","rightin","all","honesti","i","think","it","can","have","be","bettersur","there","be","some","funni","moment","but","it","just","do","not","seem","to","hit","the","mark","with","meth","act","be","okai","and","the","storylin","pretti","good","follow","the","origin","but","i","think","it","can","have","be","so","much","betterthi","movi","i","have","sai","be","for","teen","and","the","young","of","heart","full","of","femal","bodi","alcohol","and","sexit","just","anoth","typic","run","of","the","mill","parti","movi","that","have","be","do","over","and","over","again","be","my","vote","for","thi","on"],"filtered":["pleasur","view","thi","movi","earli","sai","think","go","bore","wonder","thei","ever","improv","upon","version","bachelor","parti","star","tom","hank","think","pretti","goodi","rightin","honesti","think","bettersur","funni","moment","seem","hit","mark","meth","act","okai","storylin","pretti","good","follow","origin","think","much","betterthi","movi","sai","teen","young","heart","full","femal","bodi","alcohol","sexit","anoth","typic","run","mill","parti","movi","vote","thi"],"filtered2":["pleasur","view","earli","think","go","bore","wonder","ever","improv","upon","version","bachelor","parti","star","tom","hank","think","pretti","goodi","rightin","honesti","think","bettersur","funni","moment","seem","hit","mark","meth","act","okai","storylin","pretti","good","follow","origin","think","betterthi","teen","young","heart","full","femal","bodi","alcohol","sexit","anoth","typic","run","mill","parti","vote"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,12,21,35,44,62,69,73,78,100,108,135,137,175,188,191,220,260,266,312,336,376,388,422,515,613,614,630,717,759,850,881,1116,1190,1638,1905,2167,3327,3755,3785,5314,6267],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,12,21,35,44,62,69,73,78,100,108,135,137,175,188,191,220,260,266,312,336,376,388,422,515,613,614,630,717,759,850,881,1116,1190,1638,1905,2167,3327,3755,3785,5314,6267],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,4.266914441051552,1.162015545335049,1.463169012899134,1.604729392502474,2.0226120445069267,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,4.012839573363895,2.1405462403177813,2.138507503627933,2.366244071437088,2.2939035841256437,2.3791142619576227,2.5378812223426954,2.5460113484259455,2.8336934208777267,2.6754694156628323,2.747702973022204,2.8824835850471584,2.9233055795674137,3.1569204307489187,3.0914425013694116,3.2090054908152035,3.3956930001684253,3.5364100524538222,3.553030933689863,3.558633189238533,3.7398317812878634,3.969732115064953,7.8483511669251715,4.086456389373095,4.181290492043933,4.291900363587903,4.589376833631972,5.00274712124725,5.390512652256013,5.583416318380505,5.907203395474402,5.7446844659766265,6.255510089742618,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.320277775716423E-5,8.264172197552611E-5,8.328418256094248E-5,8.280296566684923E-5,8.280432230021595E-5,8.26885784051056E-5,8.29345058230244E-5,8.26536218434934E-5,8.283945731621643E-5,9.190585586454392E-5,0.6270725996966459,8.252020067472729E-5,8.4060399298795E-5,8.525953936589062E-5,8.258037354421684E-5,8.23521570218169E-5,8.44063285646301E-5,8.294227616020411E-5,8.268494807152325E-5,8.27534791923411E-5,8.35541676394184E-5,8.302445096754199E-5,8.311898690031143E-5,8.320853828614463E-5,8.384712106936256E-5,8.340862423094088E-5,8.691496434051314E-5,8.254473317376314E-5,8.254694143868521E-5,8.275607364801586E-5,0.11656288556702274,8.293747036356653E-5,0.2159727744935826,8.317076122889949E-5,8.263457940368865E-5,8.301599246091227E-5,8.255177749010312E-5,8.260055951687855E-5,8.235174327792158E-5,8.237310911949152E-5,8.255852097706823E-5,8.342933843692232E-5,8.300539890867716E-5,8.267721876464074E-5,8.368183366498931E-5,8.270895073299017E-5,0.03406600934553117,8.420028896595034E-5,8.23935833402763E-5,8.257567819817175E-5,8.254703784191986E-5,8.487022178459014E-5,8.257690676683981E-5,8.236579626971762E-5,8.326987875831345E-5,8.259817638589996E-5,8.882526092864621E-5,8.253010475596022E-5,8.239263050575268E-5,8.278603113418105E-5,8.360719898637249E-5,8.278055436732679E-5,8.237738768491015E-5,8.256919081543554E-5,8.235273933683412E-5,8.425821103327987E-5,8.306216952814876E-5,8.288523494568197E-5,8.281274806168423E-5,8.311461369220261E-5,8.234973497829587E-5,8.281448419215413E-5,8.415768014980238E-5,8.249731027756818E-5,8.453907572311274E-5,8.271542478464447E-5,8.336279717510336E-5,8.285332043131644E-5,8.232391591098962E-5,8.242596205881575E-5]}}
{"value":"I paid one dollar for this DVD and at first I was feeling ripped off, but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful. I have found a holy grail, a real touchstone of bad cinema. If you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with Evel's awkward camera address monologue, then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeur's butt. The script seems to be pasted together from press clippings, and ESL textbooks. But..... I just can't believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is \"gosh I bet they think I am cute. really cute!\". This is an epiphany!

get.","finished_norm":["i","pai","on","dollar","for","thi","dvd","and","at","i","be","feel","rip","off","but","then","i","start","think","about","it","and","i","should","be","grate","i","have","find","a","holi","grail","a","real","touchston","of","bad","cinema","if","you","think","the","open","dramat","shot","of","a","empti","stadium","successfulli","fizzl","with","evel","awkward","camera","address","monologu","then","wait","until","the","open","credit","roll","on","the","chauffeur","butt","the","script","seem","to","be","past","togeth","from","press","clip","and","esl","textbook","but","i","just","ca","not","believ","how","bad","georg","hamilton","be","he","seem","to","have","absolut","no","connect","to","anyth","he","sai","the","onli","intern","monologu","i","can","detect","be","gosh","i","bet","thei","think","i","be","cute","realli","cute","thi","be","a","epiphani","i","now","know","how","bad","it","can","get"],"filtered":["pai","dollar","thi","dvd","feel","rip","start","think","grate","find","holi","grail","real","touchston","bad","cinema","think","open","dramat","shot","empti","stadium","successfulli","fizzl","evel","awkward","camera","address","monologu","wait","open","credit","roll","chauffeur","butt","script","seem","past","togeth","press","clip","esl","textbook","ca","believ","bad","georg","hamilton","seem","absolut","connect","anyth","sai","onli","intern","monologu","detect","gosh","bet","thei","think","cute","realli","cute","thi","epiphani","know","bad","get"],"filtered2":["pai","dollar","dvd","feel","rip","start","think","grate","find","holi","grail","real","touchston","bad","cinema","think","open","dramat","shot","empti","stadium","successfulli","fizzl","evel","awkward","camera","address","monologu","wait","open","credit","roll","chauffeur","butt","script","seem","past","togeth","press","clip","esl","textbook","ca","believ","bad","georg","hamilton","seem","absolut","connect","anyth","onli","intern","monologu","detect","gosh","bet","think","cute","realli","cute","epiphani","know","bad","get"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,9,11,12,13,26,35,38,43,71,77,80,81,91,104,222,231,242,247,270,322,331,356,409,440,441,680,756,767,795,824,855,1039,1063,1144,1382,1451,1516,1563,1954,2229,2396,2434,2517,2544,3054,3382,5433,5828,6568,7411,7839],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,9,11,12,13,26,35,38,43,71,77,80,81,91,104,222,231,242,247,270,322,331,356,409,440,441,680,756,767,795,824,855,1039,1063,1144,1382,1451,1516,1563,1954,2229,2396,2434,2517,2544,3054,3382,5433,5828,6568,7411,7839],"values":[0.7966340470719924,3.205071257016622,0.9913098153388195,3.200185830788664,1.1317941569733974,1.3324924169710188,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.9214926742550966,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0728240170322856,2.5771019354959765,2.7049353070058615,5.379009467558432,2.7303758068497004,2.731603554088023,2.885344817328191,2.932274249550174,3.028335462059722,3.2209578243390444,3.212973749990824,3.293679367864308,3.8095464139032247,3.7636829971100436,3.79165684915245,3.784589681929357,3.8767358583910254,7.8402703478511615,4.145296889396028,4.327618446189983,4.229557233013768,4.449957298382227,4.499089986959872,4.535724120139652,4.74221603786142,4.900964426937307,5.102830579804232,5.170884043049248,5.116075806554253,5.156897801074508,5.170884043049248,5.907203395474402,11.344727608794,6.255510089742618,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.092423477832445E-5,6.0513408420290814E-5,6.09838424682497E-5,6.063147717678552E-5,6.063247055527564E-5,6.054771847812213E-5,6.072779587639652E-5,6.0522121955696885E-5,6.0658197748783536E-5,0.19736393281958373,0.38795769135654157,6.042442590720641E-5,6.155221785246842E-5,6.243027376537377E-5,6.046848676823639E-5,6.0301377960504444E-5,6.180552040289457E-5,6.0733485612477506E-5,6.054506020995541E-5,0.08503737521210554,6.11815357995435E-5,6.079365712826186E-5,6.086287992969095E-5,6.092845285648853E-5,6.139604743035857E-5,6.107496338660793E-5,0.12872565686347487,6.0442389534999256E-5,6.0444006510467986E-5,6.0597141059150454E-5,6.188511910641843E-5,6.0729966625605474E-5,0.062242485623610934,6.0900791060009154E-5,6.050817835784246E-5,6.0787463488365756E-5,6.044754765103958E-5,6.0483267704291924E-5,6.0301075001506E-5,6.03167198823998E-5,6.045248548838302E-5,6.109013111516796E-5,6.077970648696621E-5,6.053940051781679E-5,6.12750177135464E-5,6.0562635870551546E-5,6.257483151821254E-5,6.165465038122013E-5,6.03317118846817E-5,6.046504865748424E-5,6.0444077100578796E-5,6.21452006420256E-5,6.046594826213678E-5,6.0311365135977456E-5,6.097336868055794E-5,6.048152268525337E-5,6.50412305567142E-5,6.043167805174491E-5,6

{"value":"from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing I've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with Pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch

The same thing over and over, no intrigue, and WHERE did they find the leading man?. The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasibly good-looking, especially for this role he is given. Also, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, rent Michael Crichton's \"Disclosure\". At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90's. <br /><br />Alexandra Paul, who is usually watchable, plays an embarrassing scene here.

{"value":"Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The acting, the dialog, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot line. I actually can't say anything positive about this, although I enjoy Swedish movies. The fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously. And when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke, or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film?! Regina Lund is the only half descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions.

{"value":"I never much liked the Myra movie, tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image, though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about -<br /><br />I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years. There's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books, where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However, IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too silly to be a turn-on, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage, OR entertain

{"value":"This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film. You've got future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken,Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse, uninspired fart and racist jokes. The concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes, but instead right out the gate, makes a lame, juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way.Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie.

{"value":"It's not a terrible movie, really, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. Further, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Further, I umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professionals and they get paid for it. But I do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences? Even if a film is a box-office flop, surely it makes some money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or catch it on TV, as did I.

{"value":"An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting, if only you could bring yourself to care. This \"twisting and turning\" I speak of refers not to the story (which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole) but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear.<br /><br />The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it. When you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all-star cast, you might be inclined to think something stinks.<br /><br />And indeed, it does.","finished_norm":["a","ensembl","of","uninterest","and","unlik","charact","twist","and","turn","their","wai","through","a","flimsi","plot","that","mai","be","interest","if","onli","you","can","bring","yourself","to","care","thi","twist","and","turn","i","speak","of","refer","not","to","the","stori","which","contain","all","the","suspens","of","a","recip","for","tuna","casserol","but","to","the","director","inabl","to","keep","the","charact","face","even","remot","center","in","the","frame","on","the","other","hand","angi","harmon","have","veri","nice","nostril","and","leav","earbr","br","the","onli","real","surpris","in","the","movi","be","the","big","name","thei","convinc","to","do","it","when","you","consid","thi","movi","be","never","releas","in","theater","despit","have","a","allstar","cast","you","mai","be","inclin","to","think","someth","stinksbr","br","and","ind","it","doe"],"filtered":["ensembl","uninterest","unlik","charact","twist","turn","wai","flimsi","plot","mai","interest","onli","bring","care","thi","twist","turn","speak","refer","stori","contain","suspens","recip","tuna","casserol","director","inabl","keep","charact","face","even","remot","center","frame","hand","angi","harmon","veri","nice","nostril","leav","earbr","br","onli","real","surpris","movi","big","name","thei","convinc","consid","thi","movi","never","releas","theater","despit","allstar","cast","mai","inclin","think","someth","stinksbr","br","ind","doe"],"filtered2":["ensembl","uninterest","unlik","charact","twist","turn","wai","flimsi","plot","mai","interest","onli","bring","care","twist","turn","speak","refer","stori","contain","suspens","recip","tuna","casserol","director","inabl","keep","charact","face","even","remot","center","frame","hand","angi","harmon","veri","nice","nostril","leav","earbr","onli","real","surpris","big","name","convinc","consid","never","releas","theater","despit","allstar","cast","mai","inclin","think","someth","stinksbr","ind","doe"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,11,12,15,17,18,32,33,42,46,53,58,60,74,80,82,92,96,134,143,205,235,250,251,262,317,326,327,344,391,424,435,478,529,615,711,715,829,883,1248,1315,1400,2883,3961,4491,5575,5653,5929,6088,6837],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,11,12,15,17,18,32,33,42,46,53,58,60,74,80,82,92,96,134,143,205,235,250,251,262,317,326,327,344,391,424,435,478,529,615,711,715,829,883,1248,1315,1400,2883,3961,4491,5575,5653,5929,6088,6837],"values":[0.926017105726131,2.247774048205673,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.6219954307453837,3.311542587503466,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.0489535369135887,4.078141625743051,2.2443961816702407,2.3409902041158843,2.571852579609833,2.6457189377809835,2.6812935439488212,2.6942272927333892,2.726701583487816,2.8529247828056143,2.942840385588056,2.9674191958529437,2.983093497946387,3.109204957709252,3.212973749990824,6.565922303288567,3.3243163373261977,3.4648563601051974,3.5013187326425523,3.6375061693251913,3.68099128126493,3.8240921249056035,3.8614098879127985,4.327618446189983,4.4637506205145625,4.470719289830655,5.408212229355414,5.7959777603641776,6.0662680901040895,6.660975197850782,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.3923167454711E-5,0.1464644931277675,7.399549317632188E-5,7.356794642844871E-5,7.356915175642267E-5,7.346631678419284E-5,7.36848159038926E-5,7.343525892978753E-5,7.360036816218868E-5,8.1655590790155E-5,0.7704932248223646,7.331671823118865E-5,7.468513841942774E-5,7.575053832999659E-5,7.337018001729017E-5,7.316741649597433E-5,7.499248617553809E-5,7.369171961494649E-5,7.346309134191123E-5,7.352397918311845E-5,7.423536680439592E-5,7.376472946157836E-5,7.3848721796654E-5,7.39282855115827E-5,7.449564712245694E-5,7.410605586013616E-5,7.722133366768221E-5,0.04524044747063804,7.334047659629634E-5,7.35262842790115E-5,7.508906823867244E-5,7.368744980906777E-5,7.909723517934264E-5,7.389472173157492E-5,7.341834029432392E-5,7.375721433265044E-5,7.33447732826381E-5,7.338811464732937E-5,7.316704889695803E-5,7.318603180506233E-5,7.335076466813733E-5,0.032172388209056525,7.374780227986896E-5,7.34562240850433E-5,7.434879423123135E-5,7.34844169852468E-5,7.592593925228733E-5,7.48094261844407E-5,7.320422253489584E-5,7.336600834344341E-5,7.334056224767302E-5,7.540464135959094E-5,7.336709988978148E-5,7.317953455781914E-5,7.398278467757355E-5,7.338599730707769E-5,7.891857477404137E-5,7.332551770970611E-5,7.320337597005814E-5,7.355290060512474E-5,7.428248356235654E-5,7.354803466237389E-5,7.318983318184845E-5,7.336024449885457E-5,7.

{"value":"A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive.The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement.Of course B-horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature.The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard.And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch.The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful.Better watch \"Scalps\" or \"Alien Dead\" again.Of course I ain't expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray,but \"Haunting Fear\" is too dull to be

{"value":"I couldn't relate to this film. It failed to engage me either intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and uninvolving. I couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and I'm finding it hard to find much that's positive to say about it.<br /><br />I've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology. I'll admit that, as an atheist, I probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their

{"value":"A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class \"artist\" with a comfortable upbringing... It is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks, boyish jokes. They do never look for work, the do almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school... Ridiculous.

{"value":"This obvious pilot for an unproduced TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man-turned-flying demon is let loose on the world. The CGI is par for a TV job, and Appleby is OK as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine. Familiar TV face Richard Burgi is along for the ride as Appleby's mentor, but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level. We see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start, a bad sign. Also, the scenes where Burgi is training Appleby for battle are actually laughable. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies, most notably REMO

{"value":"Stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal and boring Western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and justifiably so; they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who \"liked the world better as it used to be before\" and Coburn is an outlaw who \"owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt\". Additionally, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains.

{"value":"I'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film, really scary. How disappointed was I?? VERY!!!! Apart from that one scene (we all know which bit) NOTHING happened!!! I was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes, like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something.<br /><br />Nearly all the reviews here say what a scary, gripping, atmospheric movie this is. I just didn't see it I'm afraid. Maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the US to here in Britain.<br /><br />A big let down after all the hyped reviews

{"value":"Non existent plot, tons of poorly directed / super-cheesy scenes (Snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can't even hit their targets a few feet away? plus what's up with the ending?---> a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival's shooting gallery? WTH?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock? 100+? These people fire their guns without the need of reloading). The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, terminator) can't save this junk.<br /><br />DO not watch this movie (I realized that I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one).
