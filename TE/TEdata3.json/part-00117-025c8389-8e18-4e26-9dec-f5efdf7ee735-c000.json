{"value":"The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.","finished_norm":["the","writer","probabl","have","no","experi","in","the","armi","and","probabl","never","glanc","at","a","histori","book","but","i","still","give","thi","cheapli","produc","war","film","some","credit","for","take","a","longneed","look","at","the","role","of","black","soldier","in","the","world","warbr","br","the","action","be","confus","and","unbelievableani","episod","of","combat","have","well","product","valu","but","the","cast","be","interest","see","new","york","giant","rosi","greer","be","worth","the","buck","i","pai","for","thi","the","art","direct","be","rateth","man","wear","korean","war","uniform","and","it","be","pretti","lousi","weather","by","the","time","the","u","armi","reach","germani","in","not","sunni","a","thei","show","here","and","i","do","not","think","the","terrain","resembl","northern","california","the","script","never","doe","make","clear","why","the","black","support","troop","be","us","a","combat","soldier","there","be","a","nice","touch","that","show","some","of","the","man","carri","springfield","rifl","instead","of","m","which","rate","troop","probabl","would","have","be","issu","withbr","br","thi","basic","stori","idearacist","southern","offic","command","black","troop","should","have","be","expand","into","a","big","budget","product","back","then","and","it","not","too","late","to","try","it","now","you","have","to","take","thi","for","what","it","be","and","i","admir","the","creator","of","thi","film","for","make","the","effortbr","br","i","rememb","see","thi","a","while","ago","and","think","it","be","set","in","itali","which","would","have","make","much","sens","becaus","there","be","black","combat","troop","oper","there","in"],"filtered":["writer","probabl","experi","armi","probabl","never","glanc","histori","book","still","give","thi","cheapli","produc","war","film","credit","take","longneed","look","role","black","soldier","world","warbr","br","action","confus","unbelievableani","episod","combat","well","product","valu","cast","interest","see","new","york","giant","rosi","greer","worth","buck","pai","thi","art","direct","rateth","man","wear","korean","war","uniform","pretti","lousi","weather","time","u","armi","reach","germani","sunni","thei","show","think","terrain","resembl","northern","california","script","never","doe","make","clear","black","support","troop","us","combat","soldier","nice","touch","show","man","carri","springfield","rifl","instead","m","rate","troop","probabl","issu","withbr","br","thi","basic","stori","idearacist","southern","offic","command","black","troop","expand","big","budget","product","back","late","try","take","thi","admir","creator","thi","film","make","effortbr","br","rememb","see","thi","ago","think","set","itali","make","much","sens","becaus","black","combat","troop","oper"],"filtered2":["writer","probabl","experi","armi","probabl","never","glanc","histori","book","still","give","cheapli","produc","war","credit","take","longneed","look","role","black","soldier","world","warbr","action","confus","unbelievableani","combat","well","product","valu","cast","interest","see","new","york","giant","rosi","greer","worth","buck","pai","art","direct","rateth","man","wear","korean","war","uniform","pretti","lousi","weather","time","u","armi","reach","germani","sunni","show","think","terrain","resembl","northern","california","script","never","doe","make","clear","black","support","troop","us","combat","soldier","nice","touch","show","man","carri","springfield","rifl","instead","m","rate","troop","probabl","issu","withbr","basic","stori","idearacist","southern","offic","command","black","troop","expand","big","budget","product","back","late","try","take","admir","creator","make","effortbr","rememb","see","ago","think","set","itali","make","sens","becaus","black","combat","troop","oper"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,12,16,17,18,20,22,28,30,31,36,42,45,56,60,63,64,77,78,82,87,92,102,109,112,128,129,148,150,151,152,165,173,190,202,219,229,256,261,262,286,287,290,314,322,333,356,382,427,451,459,499,514,587,590,610,621,657,745,806,827,907,934,982,1053,1116,1221,1273,1407,1420,1772,2004,2088,2404,2546,2669,2713,2979,3107,3247,3600,3819,3908,3935,4204,4491,4579,4688,5658,6104,6930],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,12,16,17,18,20,22,28,30,31,36,42,45,56,60,63,64,77,78,82,87,92,102,109,112,128,129,148,150,151,152,165,173,190,202,219,229,256,261,262,286,287,290,314,322,333,356,382,427,451,459,499,514,587,590,610,621,657,745,806,827,907,934,982,1053,1116,1221,1273,1407,1420,1772,2004,2088,2404,2546,2669,2713,2979,3107,32

{"value":"Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a little alternative/revisionist history, and you get \"Aztec Rex.\" Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, had to first conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate. That's the thrust of this movie. Given the plot it could have really sucked; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers. There are a few problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be played by an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Casting aside, the T-Rex(es) look reasonably good, though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose if a T-Rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary, 16th-century weaponry. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex-swallowing-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked OK. There's plenty of action, and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but doesn't overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent SciFi Original dinosaur movie \"Warbirds.\" Overall, a mediocre (but decent by SciFi Original standards) movie that rates a modest

{"value":"A warning to potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story \"The Most Dangerous Game,\" look elsewhere. \"Seven Women for Satan\"<br /><br />only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of Zaroff and having said character murder people.<br /><br />Some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not.<br /><br />Boris Zaroff is played by writer/director Michel Lemoine. Whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging, Boris' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves. The film rambles from scene to scene with a near-total lack of clarity. The director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film. A few individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torture rack sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to entertain. Viewers who are more<br /><br />interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable. Most will probably find their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials.<br /><br />In a side note, the DVD extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history. Apparently, it was banned for several years in its native France which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution.","finished_norm":["a","warn","to","potenti","viewer","if","you","be","look","for","a","adapt","of","the","classic","stori","the","much","danger","game","look","elsewher","seven","woman","for","satanbr","br","onli","superfici","address","the","origin","work","by","us","the","name","of","zaroff","and","have","sai","charact","murder","peoplebr","br","some","of","what","follow","mai","be","consid","by","some","to","be","spoiler","or","notbr","br","bori","zaroff","be","plai","by","writerdirector","michel","lemoin","wherea","hi","ancestor","hunt","man","becaus","thei","be","the","onli","prei","that","be","truli","challeng","bori","victim","be","usual","in","a","posit","where","thei","cannot","defend","themselv","the","film","rambl","from","scene","to","scene","with","a","neartot","lack","of","clariti","the","director","seem","to","have","total","disregard","pace","and","leav","the","viewer","with","a","suffocatingli","dull","film","a","few","individu","scene","be","mildli","interest","such","a","a","tortur","rack","sequenc","but","a","a","unit","the","film","fail","to","entertain","viewer","who","be","morebr","br","interest","in","a","assort","of","attract","and","semiattract","actress","in","variou","stage","of","undress","mai","find","the","film","watchabl","much","will","probabl","find","their","time","be","well","spend","watch","mento","commercialsbr","br","in","a","side","note","the","dvd","extra","includ","a","fair","amount","of","inform","on","the","film","histori","appar","it","be","ban","for","sever","year","in","it","nativ","franc","which","pretti","much","ruin","ani","chanc","it","have","for","widespread","distribut"],"filtered":["warn","potenti","viewer","look","adapt","classic","stori","much","danger","game","look","elsewher","seven","woman","satanbr","br","onli","superfici","address","origin","work","us","name","zaroff","sai","charact","murder","peoplebr","br","follow","mai","consid","spoiler","notbr","br","bori","zaroff","plai","writerdirector","michel","lemoin","wherea","hi","ancestor","hunt","man","becaus","thei","onli","prei","truli","challeng","bori","victim","usual","posit","thei","defend","themselv","film","rambl","scene","scene","neartot","lack","clariti","director","seem","total","disregard","pace","leav","viewer","suffocatingli","dull","film","individu","scene","mildli","interest","tortur","rack","sequenc","unit","film","fail","entertain","viewer","morebr","br","interest","assort","attract","semiattract","actress","variou","stage","undress","mai","find","film","watchabl","much","probabl","find","time","well","spend","watch","mento","commercialsbr","br","side","note","dvd","extra","includ","fair","amount","inform","film","histori","appar","ban","sever","year","nativ","franc","pretti","much","ruin","ani","chanc","widespread","distribut"],"filtered2":["warn","potenti","viewer","look","adapt","classic","stori","danger","game","look","elsewher","seven","woman","satanbr","onli","superfici","address","origin","work","us","name","zaroff","charact","murder","peoplebr","follow","mai","consid","spoiler","notbr","bori","zaroff","plai","writerdirector","michel","lemoin","wherea","ancestor","hunt","man","becaus","onli","prei","truli","challeng","bori","victim","usual","posit","defend","themselv","rambl","scene","scene","neartot","lack","clariti","director","seem","total","disregard","pace","leav","viewer","suffocatingli","dull","individu","scene","mildli","interest","tortur","rack","sequenc","unit","fail","entertain","viewer","morebr","interest","assort","attract","semiattract","actress","variou","stage","undress","mai","find","watchabl","probabl","find","time","well","spend","watch","mento","commercialsbr","side","note","dvd","extra","includ","fair","amount","inform","histori","appar","ban","sever","year","nativ","franc","pretti","ruin","ani","chanc","widespread","distribut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,8,10,11,16,17,19,20,22,27,35,38,40,45,46,48,56,57,58,60,69,70,74,78,143,148,183,184,195,215,247,260,265,273,279,283,301,308,316,317,332,342,349,355,367,374,425,436,486,490,499,509,527,535,546,547,560,648,669,701,710,771,802,877,942,978,1001,1043,1178,1249,1365,1462,1481,1509,1537,1560,2057,2160,2186,2220,2291,2332,2350,2454,2457,2470,2517,2655,3467,3559,3933,4058,4289,4325,4609,5338,5501,6114],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,8,10,11,16,17,19,20,22,27,35,38,40,45,46,48,56,57,58,60,69,70,74,78,143,148,183,184,195,215,247,260,265,273,279,283,301,308,316,317,332,342,349,355,367,374,425,436,486,490,499,509,527,535,546,547,560,648,669,701,710,771,802,877,942,978,10

{"value":"Though Frank Loesser's songs are some of the finest that Broadway has to offer, they're bollixed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation--when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical. Mankiewicz doesn't seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the showstopping `Adelaide's Lament', concludes by having Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kaye's faux-spiritual `Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrows' stage book) has none of the wit that his films like `All About Eve' have. Part of the blame has to go to the leads, just about all of whom are miscast: Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why he's in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential (the songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might. Only Blaine, as the lovelorn showgirl Adelaide, commands our attention like a Broadway pro should. The colorful art direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy

{"value":"We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay, so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of \"comic relief\". We also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to. Aw crap, we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! No worries, let's introduce some guy with a moustache, have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy, then have him pop up somewhere near the lake, have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food. That should work.<br /><br />A complete, clumsy mess, this film. Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The first film to feature Dave Allen as a \"stop motion supervisor\". After this one, he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the the mid-nineties, when Band ran out of money to pay him, I guess. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing that can be said for it.<br /><br />Good Badness? Yes. The mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list.

{"value":"My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVD's for our daughter and I have to say, I don't let her watch the new episodes on TV, because I find ALL of the characters annoying. Baby Bear AND Telly? OMgosh, How ANNOYING and useless blabber can someone think of for their 'skits'? Elmo? Give it a rest not every kid likes him, once again, annoying and doesn't teach my child ANYTHING. Mr. Noodle? what a reject. I think the one time I turned the 'new' show on for her, she and I were left dumber than before. The show has Definitely taken a wrong turn. I remember the Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the GREAT EDUCATIONAL skits of OLD SCHOOL S.S. Sesame Street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since Jim Henson's passing in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, funny and interactive skits it used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber. Way to go S.S. producers/writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non-creative, non-exercised kids in front of so they'll get out of their hair.

{"value":"Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a raft of fine character actors, can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy, as his patented timing has little which which to work. The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, filmed in the Malibu, California, hills. Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario. A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. Oddly, Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them. Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio, but there is little they can do

{"value":"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for \"different\" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film \"To the Left of the Father\" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it.

{"value":"The worlds largest inside joke. The world's largest, most exclusive inside joke.<br /><br />Emulating the brash and 'everyman' humor of office space, this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books. The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary, and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist.<br /><br />The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time, listening to music and writing a novel while working. These are his goals. You can't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when (around halfway through) they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria, but then gives it UP! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof.<br /><br />Apart from that major stumbling block, the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen. Without these asides, the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange. Humor is only effective if it doesn't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is

{"value":"I LOVE Don Knotts, let me just say that up-front! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does, which is portray a nervous, lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority. He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the Reluctant Astronaut, but the film is pretty dull, really, even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films. It's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children. I'd categorize it as 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.<br /><br />As with all of Knotts' films, there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky, open-mouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you are.<br /><br />From an adult perspective, one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then. Only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who can't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if you're like me, you'll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end. Beware -- you'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching, it's that catchy.","finished_norm":["i","love","don","knott","let","me","just","sai","that","upfront","he","be","a","enorm","talent","and","the","well","at","what","he","doe","which","be","portrai","a","nervou","lovabl","befuddl","loser","throw","into","a","posit","of","author","he","be","fabul","in","thi","role","a","roi","fleme","the","reluct","astronaut","but","the","film","be","pretti","dull","realli","even","though","a","a","kid","my","brother","and","i","delight","in","watch","thi","and","hi","other","film","it","still","worth","watch","but","realli","it","a","film","that","be","well","enjoi","by","child","i","have","categor","it","a","familyfriendli","and","someth","you","can","sit","down","and","watch","with","your","kid","on","a","famili","nightbr","br","a","with","all","of","knott","film","there","a","great","cast","of","belov","charact","actor","and","you","ca","not","help","but","smile","when","knott","give","on","of","hi","shaki","openmouth","stare","no","matt","how","old","and","jade","you","arebr","br","from","a","adult","perspect","on","thing","i","think","that","be","great","about","thi","film","be","how","it","captur","nasa","in","the","all","the","new","modern","build","the","hope","the","optim","the","futur","and","i","be","surpris","at","how","suav","and","studli","lesli","neilsen","be","back","then","onli","complaint","about","the","stori","be","roi","love","interest","a","rather","threadbar","unlik","woman","who","ca","not","give","him","the","time","of","dai","until","he","becom","a","big","shoot","if","you","re","like","me","you","will","be","hope","that","he","give","her","the","shoveoff","at","the","end","bewar","you","will","be","whistl","the","theme","tune","for","dai","after","watch","it","that","catchi"],"filtered":["love","knott","let","sai","upfront","enorm","talent","well","doe","portrai","nervou","lovabl","befuddl","loser","throw","posit","author","fabul","thi","role","roi","fleme","reluct","astronaut","film","pretti","dull","realli","even","though","kid","brother","delight","watch","thi","hi","film","still","worth","watch","realli","film","well","enjoi","child","categor","familyfriendli","someth","sit","watch","kid","famili","nightbr","br","knott","film","great","cast","belov","charact","actor","ca","help","smile","knott","give","hi","shaki","openmouth","stare","matt","old","jade","arebr","br","adult","perspect","thing","think","great","thi","film","captur","nasa","new","modern","build","hope","optim","futur","surpris","suav","studli","lesli","neilsen","back","onli","complaint","stori","roi","love","interest","rather","threadbar","unlik","woman","ca","give","time","dai","becom","big","shoot","re","like","hope","give","shoveoff","end","bewar","whistl","theme","tune","dai","watch","catchi"],"filtered2":["love","knott","let","upfront","enorm","talent","well","doe","portrai","nervou","lovabl","befuddl","loser","throw","posit","author","fabul","role","roi","fleme","reluct","astronaut","pretti","dull","realli","even","though","kid","brother","delight","watch","still","worth","watch","realli","well","enjoi","child","categor","familyfriendli","someth","sit","watch","kid","famili","nightbr","knott","great","cast","belov","charact","actor","ca","help","smile","knott","give","shaki","openmouth","stare","matt","old","jade","arebr","adult","perspect","thing","think","great","captur","nasa","new","modern","build","hope","optim","futur","surpris","suav","studli","lesli","neilsen","back","onli","complaint","stori","roi","love","interest","rather","threadbar","unlik","woman","ca","give","time","dai","becom","big","shoot","re","like","hope","give","shoveoff","end","bewar","whistl","theme","tune","dai","watch","catchi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,17,18,20,24,29,30,41,51,53,54,60,63,64,67,68,70,78,81,82,86,87,92,114,115,117,124,128,132,160,180,181,182,185,200,219,244,276,310,326,367,381,408,469,477,509,534,615,729,734,844,925,1111,1301,1389,1524,1558,1980,2162,2343,2489,2560,3014,3150,3265,3402,3500,3564,3610,3896,4339,4716,4719,5489,5667,5803,6501,6641,7444,7543,8237,8340],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,17,18,20,24,29,30,41,51,53,54,60,63,64,67,68,70,78,81,82,86,87,92,114,115,117,124,128,132,160,180,181,182,185,200,219,244,276,310,326,367,381,408,469,477,509,534,615,729,734,844,925,1111,1301,1389,1524,1558,1980,2162,2343,2489,2560,3014,3150,3265,3402,3500,3564,3610,3896,4339,4716,4719,5489,5667,5803,6501,6641,7444,7543,8237,8340],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,3.8437990882891726,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888

{"value":"I am so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny... And I thought \"Mulan\" was unbelievable! However low my expectations of Disney have become, I never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off. There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts.<br /><br />I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy into a normal teenage girl... But, fortunately, most normal teenage girls--particularly Asian teenage girls--are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. And from a cultural stand point, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion, but they're pretty rare. And even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars. Another stereotype, maybe, but a fairly true one. Because that's how Chinese parents work. That's how Chinese values work. If they wanted to go for authenticity, they would've made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family.<br /><br />This just adds to my frustration with American movies. Asian culture isn't about meditation and vague, nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. We don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time, and we don't all know some form of martial arts. We're a PEOPLE, and I'd appreciate it if someone would write an Asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature.","finished_norm":["i","be","so","insult","by","thi","movi","it","not","even","funni","and","i","think","mulan","be","unbeliev","howev","low","my","expect","of","disnei","have","becom","i","never","figur","thei","have","do","someth","so","stereotyp","yet","so","off","there","be","no","respect","here","for","ani","true","chines","cultur","just","the","hollywood","tradit","of","random","martial","artsbr","br","i","appreci","that","thei","try","to","make","wendi","into","a","normal","teenag","girl","but","fortun","much","normal","teenag","girlsparticularli","asian","teenag","girlsar","much","littl","obsess","with","such","shallow","aspect","of","life","and","from","a","cultur","stand","point","it","almost","imposs","ye","there","be","girl","who","be","wrap","up","in","popular","and","fashion","but","thei","re","pretti","rare","and","even","the","on","who","be","be","still","fairli","decent","scholar","anoth","stereotyp","mayb","but","a","fairli","true","on","becaus","that","how","chines","parent","work","that","how","chines","valu","work","if","thei","want","to","go","for","authent","thei","would","have","make","wendi","a","iron","girl","with","glass","and","a","loveh","relationship","with","her","familybr","br","thi","just","add","to","my","frustrat","with","american","movi","asian","cultur","be","not","about","medit","and","vagu","natureori","phrase","that","sound","wise","we","do","not","walk","around","smile","enigmat","all","the","time","and","we","do","not","all","know","some","form","of","martial","art","we","re","a","peopl","and","i","have","appreci","it","if","someon","would","write","a","asian","part","that","doe","not","portrai","u","a","some","sad","caricatur"],"filtered":["insult","thi","movi","even","funni","think","mulan","unbeliev","howev","low","expect","disnei","becom","never","figur","thei","someth","stereotyp","yet","respect","ani","true","chines","cultur","hollywood","tradit","random","martial","artsbr","br","appreci","thei","try","make","wendi","normal","teenag","girl","fortun","much","normal","teenag","girlsparticularli","asian","teenag","girlsar","much","littl","obsess","shallow","aspect","life","cultur","stand","point","almost","imposs","ye","girl","wrap","popular","fashion","thei","re","pretti","rare","even","still","fairli","decent","scholar","anoth","stereotyp","mayb","fairli","true","becaus","chines","parent","work","chines","valu","work","thei","want","go","authent","thei","make","wendi","iron","girl","glass","loveh","relationship","familybr","br","thi","add","frustrat","american","movi","asian","cultur","medit","vagu","natureori","phrase","sound","wise","walk","around","smile","enigmat","time","know","form","martial","art","re","peopl","appreci","someon","write","asian","part","doe","portrai","u","sad","caricatur"],"filtered2":["insult","even","funni","think","mulan","unbeliev","howev","low","expect","disnei","becom","never","figur","someth","stereotyp","yet","respect","ani","true","chines","cultur","hollywood","tradit","random","martial","artsbr","appreci","try","make","wendi","normal","teenag","girl","fortun","normal","teenag","girlsparticularli","asian","teenag","girlsar","littl","obsess","shallow","aspect","life","cultur","stand","point","almost","imposs","ye","girl","wrap","popular","fashion","re","pretti","rare","even","still","fairli","decent","scholar","anoth","stereotyp","mayb","fairli","true","becaus","chines","parent","work","chines","valu","work","want","go","authent","make","wendi","iron","girl","glass","loveh","relationship","familybr","add","frustrat","american","asian","cultur","medit","vagu","natureori","phrase","sound","wise","walk","around","smile","enigmat","time","know","form","martial","art","re","peopl","appreci","someon","write","asian","part","doe","portrai","u","sad","caricatur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,12,14,18,22,23,26,27,36,37,42,48,53,61,62,64,65,66,68,73,75,78,84,98,112,113,115,130,131,139,163,178,194,209,217,223,294,299,300,304,309,377,382,415,451,455,469,571,577,604,645,670,689,693,694,700,709,819,841,859,880,901,951,961,1013,1037,1122,1150,1246,1301,1366,1386,1421,1450,1465,1508,1635,1672,1777,1989,2137,2389,2618,2900,5291,5711,6395,6454],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,12,14,18,22,23,26,27,36,37,42,48,53,61,62,64,65,66,68,73,75,78,84,98,112,113,115,130,131,139,163,178,194,209,217,223,294,299,300,304,309,377,382,415,451,455,469,571,577,604,645,670,689,693,694,700,709,819,841,859,880,901,951,961,1013,1037,1122,1150,1246,1301,1366,1386,1421,1450,1465,1508,1635,1672,1777,1989,2137,2389,2618,2900,5291,5711,6395,6454],"va

{"value":"Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting.<br /><br />There isn't all that much else here that's interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious. There's an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who's also in love with the \"femme fatale\", but the Burr character is pretty straightforward. It's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films I've seen him in. There's no mystery at all really, and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that Burr's character is setting up the Lansbury character to implicate herself (double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder, presumably). He does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn't notice when she comes into the room I guess.<br /><br />A few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could

{"value":"There is nothing unique in either the TV Series nor the Movie. Which is a prequel to the TV Show, that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment. Both before David Lynches disgusting style of story telling, and after. <br /><br />From the Moment the body of a poor misguided girl washed up on the beach. And being introduced to some of the most mind numbing shady immoral character of the Twin Peaks.<br /><br />To the Mind numbing almost pedophilia disgusting way the movie seems to romantically tell of the destruction of a Human Life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the Movie Twin Peak:Fire Come Walk with me. <br /><br />I watched it all just to make sure I wasn't missing anything. I didn't. It's is simply one mans obvious sexual fetish extended over long series fallowed by a ridiculous overly pornographic movie. Save your self the agony the suspense and watch anything else that at least has the ability to tell a story, rather then seduce you into some kind mental porn movie.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of reviews, rants and raves about how great David Lynch. Because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing.

{"value":"Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.","finished_norm":["mayb","you","should","not","compar","but","wild","styl","and","styl","war","be","origin","hip","hop","beat","street","doe","have","a","lot","of","the","origin","artist","of","earli","hip","hop","but","thei","have","be","obvious","make","clear","that","thi","can","be","their","big","break","of","cours","for","some","it","be","and","that","nice","but","if","you","view","thi","a","origin","hip","hop","cultur","you","re","wrong","it","overproduc","and","have","a","hollywood","sauc","rather","look","for","the","two","movi","i","mention","thei","have","convei","the","gritti","that","come","with","life","in","the","ghetto","ye","the","rate","for","thi","movi","be","low","but","the","review","be","mostli","posit","or","even","rave","thi","be","probabl","becaus","although","the","stori","the","act","the","dialogu","and","the","direct","all","be","dread","the","music","and","danc","be","what","the","peopl","love","about","it","me","i","do","love","the","danc","but","at","the","time","think","that","electro","be","the","death","of","hip","hop","i","be","so","glad","when","round","a","new","gener","of","now","classic","hip","hop","artist","appear","like","kr","on","public","enemi","ultramagnet","mc","jungl","brother","bizmarki","to","name","a","few","and","i","still","do","not","like","much","of","the","beat","in","thi","movi","and","that","be","why","it","doe","not","work","for","me","i","mean","wild","styl","have","not","much","of","a","stori","but","the","music","there","be","great","and","authent","of","cours","tast","differ","and","that","alright","but","a","far","a","i","be","concern","thi","movi","be","trash","except","for","the","break","danc","and","some","of","the","music","and","so","i","ca","not","rate","it","high","than","a","out","of","ten"],"filtered":["mayb","compar","wild","styl","styl","war","origin","hip","hop","beat","street","doe","lot","origin","artist","earli","hip","hop","thei","obvious","make","clear","thi","big","break","cours","nice","view","thi","origin","hip","hop","cultur","re","wrong","overproduc","hollywood","sauc","rather","look","two","movi","mention","thei","convei","gritti","come","life","ghetto","ye","rate","thi","movi","low","review","mostli","posit","even","rave","thi","probabl","becaus","although","stori","act","dialogu","direct","dread","music","danc","peopl","love","love","danc","time","think","electro","death","hip","hop","glad","round","new","gener","classic","hip","hop","artist","appear","like","kr","public","enemi","ultramagnet","mc","jungl","brother","bizmarki","name","still","like","much","beat","thi","movi","doe","work","mean","wild","styl","much","stori","music","great","authent","cours","tast","differ","alright","far","concern","thi","movi","trash","except","break","danc","music","ca","rate","high","ten"],"filtered2":["mayb","compar","wild","styl","styl","war","origin","hip","hop","beat","street","doe","lot","origin","artist","earli","hip","hop","obvious","make","clear","big","break","cours","nice","view","origin","hip","hop","cultur","re","wrong","overproduc","hollywood","sauc","rather","look","two","mention","convei","gritti","come","life","ghetto","ye","rate","low","review","mostli","posit","even","rave","probabl","becaus","although","stori","act","dialogu","direct","dread","music","danc","peopl","love","love","danc","time","think","electro","death","hip","hop","glad","round","new","gener","classic","hip","hop","artist","appear","like","kr","public","enemi","ultramagnet","mc","jungl","brother","bizmarki","name","still","like","beat","doe","work","mean","wild","styl","stori","music","great","authent","cours","tast","differ","alright","far","concern","trash","except","break","danc","music","ca","rate","high","ten"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,8,12,16,17,18,21,22,23,25,34,47,48,51,54,64,68,69,72,75,81,82,87,88,101,102,118,143,148,160,163,170,176,199,202,204,209,211,217,225,232,237,245,248,262,266,285,300,312,314,332,341,360,380,381,482,492,509,510,545,590,664,671,678,724,780,872,874,880,995,1107,1227,1480,1551,1564,1613,1936,2154,2227,2389,3595,4477,5045,6611],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,8,12,16,17,18,21,22,23,25,34,47,48,51,54,64,68,69,72,75,81,82,87,88,101,102,118,143,148,160,163,170,176,199,202,204,209,211,217,225,232,237,245,248,262,266,285,300,312,314,332,341,360,380,381,482,492,509,510,545,590,664,671,678,724,780,872,874,880,995,1107,1227,1480,1551,1564,1613,1936,2154,2227,2389,3595,4477,5045,6611],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,2.43063

{"value":"The first ten minutes of \"Just Looking\" really dictates the direction most of this movie takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the '50s. He has a burning desire to see two people have sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his own mom and stepfather of course! How pleasant. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife.<br /><br />Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and they aren't currently sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. Him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls. They have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex. The problem is...it's not done in an innocent, charming 1950's sort of way. I am no prude by ANY means, but I found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. That kind of rawness may work in a movie like \"Kids\" (1995) but in this film it just seems perverted.<br /><br />Gretchen Mol is utterly wasted here as Hedy, a former bra model who becomes the object of Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible. \"For Better Or Worse\" (1996) was awful and now this.

{"value":"Ever since I was eight years old I have been a big wrestling fan. It didn't matter what federation I watched. WWE,WCW,USWA. To me the action is all I watched it for.<br /><br />May 23rd 1999. That was my 19 birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and I was just expecting another pay per view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of Canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong. Not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened affter Owens death made me very mad.<br /><br />Rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if Owens death never happened.<br /><br />I gotta tell you. Vince Mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made.<br /><br />And this crap with saying Owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going. Give me a break. When someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it. Thats like a police officer shooting a robber or a mugger with a run and then just leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the mans life never mattered.<br /><br />But no matter what happens.

{"value":"I had to give this film a 1 because it's that bad, but don't make this think that I didn't enjoy watching, because I laughed and laughed, and I even had a few questions. So half of the time I was laughing, half of the time I was saying \"what in the hell is going on?\" or \"why would someone do this?\" et cetera. I mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects, the 80's style nude scene/battle/dialogue/nude scene, and the way that the warrior's swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses. And there's some crappy model effects (those aren't supposed to be real trees, are they?) and I still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave, what in the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I would give em a try, and I basically liked the film as people like Ed Wood films, I have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be, I look at it in my own hilarious way. So don't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie, it is, I just liked it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it (which came into my mind a few times). I guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks, have some friends around, and laugh at this film. Maybe this is a bit harsh, but I don't think so, rent it and you'll see.

{"value":"Without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity, all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling, unoriginal elements. 'Party of Five' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there's little rooting interest because the singular non-homicidal element is a second-rate bland awful-acting 'Wes Bentley' mopester. In fact, all of the acting is skin deep. Even though the dark-haired women appeal, the salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a teasing, safe distance...an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher.' Only the soundtrack, the droning angsty alt-country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension. Sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low-angles that adds to the malaise...but for a film that calls itself horror, I did not even get close to flinching once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake, scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start to my excursion through

{"value":"If this guy can make a movie, then I sure as hell can make one too.<br /><br />In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following:<br /><br />1) I will add more naked women. This movie had none. I think cheesy B-class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I wouldn't want to let my viewers down.<br /><br />2) I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And, considering the movie was only like an hour long, the dream-to-movie-length ratio was quite high. And, if I do decide to do a dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants??<br /><br />3) I will not rip off any movies like Star Wars or the Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big-budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine. <br /><br />4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned it into an evil rolly-polly monster before the screen blew up or something.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director

{"value":"You believe in God or you don't. You believe in Jesus or you don't. You believe He is the Son of God or you don't. The choice is up to you.<br /><br />Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring back Jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary, Who opened Heaven again for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian bringing some \"modern findings\" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, who happily incorporates them in his play.<br /><br />The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. More often than not the director's abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.<br /><br />The director has tried to make a parallel between Jesus' life and the Passion Play actor's life. This is an admirable attempt, but depicting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about Jesus.<br /><br />My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus'

{"value":"this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched.<br /><br />this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause. THAT IS WHY HE WENT INSANE? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like EVER? and that's not the only thing. i'm being serious when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMN MOVIE. nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by.<br /><br />there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him. IT'S A FRIGGIN MINUTE LONG. WHO THE HELL WANTS TO SEE THAT? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it. so if you see this movie on TV or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history. and i'm serious about that.<br /><br />it's not even so good its bad, it's tedious, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the vcr. it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but The actress who played the mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second. YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS?

{"value":"I get it the Diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good-will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well-made, amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialog and plotting. Better luck on your next flick. Another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of LA being there for reasons of hunger, these people don't get enough to eat. Truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-worth, dignity which you can't give a man. Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available. Less the center for hunger in America, I would say it's more the center for alcoholism, drug-abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band-aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem of homelessness.

{"value":"First and foremost, Zorie Barber (Zeke), might be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. As a character that's supposed to be a hip, Village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why is he so hyper, over-dramatic, and plain horrible? Did he know anything about his character before they started filming? Did the director? Don't the martial arts teach discipline? Aside from that, this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen-it-already gross-out humor. Hand in toilet? <i>Trainspotting</i>. Masturbation? Hmm. <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, <i>American Pie</i>, the list goes on.. .Bad dialogue: In one sequence, Eric says \"it's none of my business <i>but</i> . ...\" and 30 seconds later Mia says \"why is this any of your business?\" Bad editing: At least five minutes worth of film are wasted on NYC traffic shots. <hr>It's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight-knit group of friends in any world. I can't comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you enjoy low-brow, basic bathroom humor and insults, by all means, enjoy. If you want something a little smarter but on the same lines, see <i>Boomerang</i>. If you want a solid what-goes-around romantic comedy, go for <i>The Tao Of Steve</i>. But anyone who thinks <i>Whipped</i> is witty and an accurate portrayal dating, well, I cannot agree at

{"value":"Before I start...let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in Heaven and in Hell. Kay now that thats out of the way, I just wanna say that What in the world do these morons that call themselves \"hosts\" think they are doing?? The last time I checked a host doesn't discriminate, spew hatred filled rants on TV, or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel. ALl of these that crazy, idiotic, conservitive, bible thumping, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson does daily. I am all for free speech, but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of SOOOO many problems. One day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some TV since the teach didn't give us any work. And we (against many of us's will) watched 700's Club, and of course that jerk Pat was on ranting and raving about the bible, and he said Simon along the lines of \"God says Homosexuality is a sin\" and I actually heard a kid go \"Hmm I guess he's right.\" WTF??? Seriously, if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin, then they seriously need to take that host, duct tape them, and throw them off of a cruise

{"value":"I have a high tolerance level for crap, so I was looking forward to this. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who, luckily, happens to be travelling with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the General, as he likes to be called here) running over random zombies. Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak? The dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned. We have construction worker zombies, soldier zombies and even St.Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire. Oh wait there are no vampires, the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa's mad. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing. When are we going to see vampires fight zombies? Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the St.Trinian zombies. Chainsaw time!! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires.

{"value":"If there is one film which is the worst of this year- it's TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style film, and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe Because of it being a Yashraj film Or maybe seeing the cheesy promo But this film gave me a shock, it was even worst then Dhoom 2 and what i expected First Saif's introduction which is boring Then Saif- Kareena meet, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what he is doing in such a weird film? What kinda role it is? What acting is he doing? His first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff Childhood romance, overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The ending is another joke<br /><br />Vijay Krishna Acharya would have got 3 films more to direct, if this film had worked, thats the strategy of yashraj, only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers Music( Vishal Shekhar) is ordinary<br /><br />Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air, he actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even

{"value":"There's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the \"cop side\" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial

{"value":"In the U.S., very few films have been made about Rome that were not set in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood's sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it).<br /><br />It's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic.<br /><br />However, this is not a historical film; it's peplum, and while the production values aren't rock bottom, the acting and characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with wooden English dubbing it's very campy. I got a few good laughs out of it at first.<br /><br />I haven't seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the Hercules movies of the 60s. It's amusing up to a point, but as the film goes on, it gets somewhat boring.<br /><br />One thing's for sure: if I'd seen this movie when I was ten years old, I would have loved it. At that age, I went for anything with Romans and swordfights in it. So at least, this flick brought back some childhood

{"value":"If you read my review of SyFy's \"Dinoshark\", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these made-for-television movies can provide. They're stupid...they're silly...but they're still pretty fun in a \"so bad, it's good\" kind of way. So, still smacking with guilt for liking (and recommending) the undeniably hokey \"Dinoshark\", I sat down to watch \"Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy\", a SyFy Original Movie about a half-man, half-hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island. With the SyFy Channel's sure-fire recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it possibly go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the mark...not by much, but enough to make me not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, its titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs who really become the movie's primary villain. Though the hammerhead does rack up the body count, he (or it or whatever you call the thing) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after. The rest of the movie is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers.

{"value":"I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped \"Stop-loss\" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY bad. <br /><br />I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the \"credit\" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF????<br /><br />I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.","finished_norm":["i","just","rent","thi","todayheard","lot","of","good","review","beforehand","wow","what","a","pile","of","steam","poo","thi","movi","be","doe","anyon","know","the","address","of","the","director","so","i","can","get","my","five","dollar","back","final","someon","bump","stoploss","from","the","wrong","iraq","war","movi","ever","numb","on","spot","to","be","fair","i","do","not","think","there","be","ani","good","iraq","war","movi","anywai","but","thi","be","realli","bad","br","br","i","wo","not","get","into","ani","technic","inaccuraci","there","a","hundr","review","from","other","gwot","vet","that","detail","them","all","if","the","director","bother","to","consult","even","the","lowli","enoth","about","technic","accuraci","howev","thei","can","have","make","the","movi","somewhat","realisticmayb","i","guess","the","writer","should","be","give","the","credit","for","thi","wast","of","a","film","he","or","she","obvious","hatch","the","plot","for","thi","movi","from","some","vivid","imagin","not","afflict","with","the","restraint","of","realiti","doe","anybodi","but","me","wonder","what","the","point","of","thi","movi","be","be","there","a","messag","serious","thoughwtfbr","br","i","be","pretti","amaz","at","all","the","posit","review","realli","thi","film","be","hard","to","watch","a","a","vet","becaus","of","all","the","glare","inaccuraci","but","even","if","on","can","overlook","that","the","plot","suck","charact","be","shallow","to","sai","the","littl","and","the","act","be","poor","at","well","it","iron","i","suppos","that","thi","movi","be","suppos","to","be","about","explos","ordin","dispos","becaus","it","the","big","bomb","i","have","see","thi","year"],"filtered":["rent","thi","todayheard","lot","good","review","beforehand","wow","pile","steam","poo","thi","movi","doe","anyon","know","address","director","get","five","dollar","back","final","someon","bump","stoploss","wrong","iraq","war","movi","ever","numb","spot","fair","think","ani","good","iraq","war","movi","anywai","thi","realli","bad","br","br","wo","get","ani","technic","inaccuraci","hundr","review","gwot","vet","detail","director","bother","consult","even","lowli","enoth","technic","accuraci","howev","thei","make","movi","somewhat","realisticmayb","guess","writer","give","credit","thi","wast","film","obvious","hatch","plot","thi","movi","vivid","imagin","afflict","restraint","realiti","doe","anybodi","wonder","point","thi","movi","messag","serious","thoughwtfbr","br","pretti","amaz","posit","review","realli","thi","film","hard","watch","vet","becaus","glare","inaccuraci","even","overlook","plot","suck","charact","shallow","sai","littl","act","poor","well","iron","suppos","thi","movi","suppos","explos","ordin","dispos","becaus","big","bomb","see","thi","year"],"filtered2":["rent","todayheard","lot","good","review","beforehand","wow","pile","steam","poo","doe","anyon","know","address","director","get","five","dollar","back","final","someon","bump","stoploss","wrong","iraq","war","ever","numb","spot","fair","think","ani","good","iraq","war","anywai","realli","bad","wo","get","ani","technic","inaccuraci","hundr","review","gwot","vet","detail","director","bother","consult","even","lowli","enoth","technic","accuraci","howev","make","somewhat","realisticmayb","guess","writer","give","credit","wast","obvious","hatch","plot","vivid","imagin","afflict","restraint","realiti","doe","anybodi","wonder","point","messag","serious","thoughwtfbr","pretti","amaz","posit","review","realli","hard","watch","vet","becaus","glare","inaccuraci","even","overlook","plot","suck","charact","shallow","littl","act","poor","well","iron","suppos","suppos","explos","ordin","dispos","becaus","big","bomb","see","year"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,12,13,14,18,20,21,22,25,26,27,30,32,44,57,58,63,66,72,78,82,89,113,139,146,149,156,158,171,175,176,243,287,314,340,341,356,371,386,406,421,496,504,509,516,569,596,656,661,685,740,877,944,1003,1005,1038,1079,1133,1150,1209,1246,1328,1616,2220,2437,2670,3135,3543,3584,3679,3744,3806,4270,5370,5479,6463,7090,7136,7474,7972,8214],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,12,13,14,18,20,21,22,25,26,27,30,32,44,57,58,63,66,72,78,82,89,113,139,146,149,156,158,171,175,176,243,287,314,340,341,356,371,386,406,421,496,504,509,516,569,596,656,661,685,740,877,944,1003,1005,1038,1079,1133,1150,1209,1246,1328,1616,2220,2437,2670,3135,3543,3584,3679,3744,3806,4270,5370,5479,6463,7090,7136,7474,7972,8214],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720

{"value":"One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen, like it's the case with this movie. \"The Wedding Date\" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been let alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.<br /><br />Alas, that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London, when basically, this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!<br /><br />Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. It's clear that Kat will fall for Nick, and vice-versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in \"Junebug\", comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.<br

{"value":"I think this is almost all I need to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions though. I've basically never seen such an armateur production, and I mean that in all senses of the word. Although the physical camera work, boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately its not the only areas.<br /><br />Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has an awful script, awful acting and worst of all, awful annoying characters.<br /><br />It's a crime that for the every independent film that gets, distribution like Haiku Tunnel, there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony, but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution. I'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up.<br /><br />The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for that is even a let down. I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it. I've seen a lot of films in my time, and I'm very forgiving when in the cinema, but this was too much. I'll never forget 'tunnel', for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema.
