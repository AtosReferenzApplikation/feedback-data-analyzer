{"value":"Yes, this is one of THOSE movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses.<br /><br />But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often the 'big one' isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. I surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry.<br /><br />The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After figuring out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. If you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. Really, you need to rent it and see for yourself.<br /><br />But not for more than 99Â¢,

{"value":"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. \"Wanders\" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being \"turned off\" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just weird. Too make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her. He does so. Which was really creepy. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he \"drops in\" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend.

{"value":"This movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. However, I did not care for his mission to settle down, because I didn't care for his character. I don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class, or charisma. He should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame what-so-ever? Had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring.<br /><br />Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She could've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie.<br /><br />The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog.

{"value":"Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to be divided up equally. One condition--they must spend one week in his estate to get the money. And if any of them die, the others get more. Guess what happens next.... <br /><br />I saw a brand new print of this film on cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful. That's about all the good things I can say about it.<br /><br />Let's list just some of the problems this film has: the killer is screamingly obvious; the servants are called Igor and Elga--come on!; some of the sound recording was so bad I couldn't make out the dialogue (no great loss I'm sure); the gore was sparse and very poorly done; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting--so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief. Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only fairly good acting was from trouper Faith Domergue (who deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and frail here). I do have to admit though--the closing line in this movie is a gem!<br /><br />Why this was renamed \"Legacy of Blood\" is beyond me--there's another 1978 horror film with that name!<br /><br />Whatever its name is, it's a bad movie.

{"value":"This is the single worst movie I have ever seen. Let me say that again: THIS IS THE SINGLE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.<br /><br />It had all of the ear-marks of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music. I thought that there were a couple points to horror movies. The first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you. This movie gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we are supposed to care. This movie gets an F in this regard as well. <br /><br />The first story, a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her. The next story, an OCD guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his. Oh, and then there is the horrific, nail-biting story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house, being anal-retentive, and having a roommate? Turns out all of these stories where hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a Doctor who in turn uses it himself. Wow, stupid.<br /><br />Let me explain something, I enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. I couldn't do that with this one. It was utter pain to sit and watch.

{"value":"No matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.<br /><br />If you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.<br /><br />If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.<br /><br />If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a B**ch!<br /><br />If you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.<br /><br />As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining. As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie. This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. Critters looked pretty good, so did the Ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these. The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21.

{"value":"Hi, Everyone, If you saw \"Singing in the Rain,\" you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor, \"Make 'em Laugh.\" If you saw \"Royal Wedding,\" you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you saw \"Jailhouse Rock,\" you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by The King himself.<br /><br />That is what is missing here. There could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan's \"I Can Do That.\" the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing.<br /><br />Yelling at people auditioning for a part in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a Western or a comedy. He is OK when he is in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at. It does not work here.<br /><br />The cast was good except for Michael, of course. A good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it.<br /><br />Next time they do one of these I hope they

{"value":"I heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had directed before, the problem is, it is possibly too stylistic. Basically Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary,and within two years he gambles loads of his money. He is ready to seek revenge against the violence-prone casino owner who got Jake sent to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D' Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha puts hit men on him. Loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (AndrÃ© Benjamin) are demanding Jake pays their cash back, and do some odd jobs for them. The film is filled with Jake narrating through some flashbacks, and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about Zach and Avi, and Macha, well, I assume that's what it was. Also starring Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. The are sequences involving a little bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speeds for moments, and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom, making it a silly crime drama.

{"value":"Hello. this is my first review for any movie i have seen. i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most disgusting movie i have ever seen. I feel like the movie was porely made, which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it. I felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. Which i can agree, saw as well is also very graphic, but, i did like the movie saw.<br /><br />The scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well actually, it was probably around 5 min but still. i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good. this director uwe boll, and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one. one final note haha!! FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY WATCHING ANIMALS BEATIN TO DEATH, LETTING ROT, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS WELL AND A FIVE MINUTE SCENE OF SOMEONE GETTING THERE HEAD SMASHED IN WITH A HAMMER then you will enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a higher budget film, like saw for example. I cant believe people actually make movies like this. anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the

{"value":"The film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened. The crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around. You can fill in the rest.<br /><br />This is a paycheck picture all around. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, nor in anyone behind the camera. This is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else. On some level this should have worked, it could have been a more horrific Southern Comfort (where National Guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps), but instead its not much of anything. In large part you can blame the script, written unbelievably in part by Wes Craven, which hits the same old targets again and again. Add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene.<br /><br />Its not bad as such, but badly made and dull. Let me put my feelings into context: The reason I saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the out cry(I mean the films have so much in common-he says sarcastically).

{"value":"1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint, in my opinion, from this much-heralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal, at times, of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner -- but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings. I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations. I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing, but even this part didn't stand out a lot for me. The basic storyline is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things. We find out later that the King is actually the biggest pupil. There is a side forbidden romance between the King's newest wife, played by Rita Moreno(a latino as an Arab--come on!!) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie -- is OK but not that convincing either. The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does. This is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really.","finished_norm":["st","watch","out","of","dirwalt","lang","disappoint","music","from","a","charact","develop","standpoint","in","my","opinion","from","thi","muchherald","rodger","and","hammerstein","piec","there","a","coupl","of","good","song","and","a","decent","comic","portray","at","time","of","the","king","of","siam","by","yul","brynner","but","the","movi","doe","not","realli","do","a","good","job","of","present","the","situat","and","the","set","i","can","onli","blame","the","screenplai","and","possibli","some","of","the","act","a","to","why","we","do","not","fulli","understand","the","charact","and","their","situat","i","know","it","mai","be","a","littl","too","much","to","ask","of","a","music","mean","for","the","enjoy","of","the","song","and","the","danc","but","even","thi","part","do","not","stand","out","a","lot","for","me","the","basic","storylin","be","about","a","english","woman","come","to","siam","to","teach","the","child","about","upscal","european","thing","we","find","out","late","that","the","king","be","actual","the","big","pupil","there","be","a","side","forbid","romanc","between","the","king","new","wife","plai","by","rita","morenoa","latino","a","a","arabcom","on","and","a","former","lover","that","caus","some","complic","but","noth","realli","mesmer","add","though","deborah","kerr","a","the","main","femal","charact","anni","be","okai","but","not","that","convinc","either","the","king","learn","some","thing","becaus","of","her","presenc","and","then","the","movi","fade","awai","a","he","doe","thi","be","realli","a","miniscul","stori","with","some","song","and","danc","but","not","that","great","of","a","experi","for","a","viewer","realli"],"filtered":["st","watch","dirwalt","lang","disappoint","music","charact","develop","standpoint","opinion","thi","muchherald","rodger","hammerstein","piec","coupl","good","song","decent","comic","portray","time","king","siam","yul","brynner","movi","doe","realli","good","job","present","situat","set","onli","blame","screenplai","possibli","act","fulli","understand","charact","situat","know","mai","littl","much","ask","music","mean","enjoy","song","danc","even","thi","part","stand","lot","basic","storylin","english","woman","come","siam","teach","child","upscal","european","thing","find","late","king","actual","big","pupil","side","forbid","romanc","king","new","wife","plai","rita","morenoa","latino","arabcom","former","lover","caus","complic","noth","realli","mesmer","add","though","deborah","kerr","main","femal","charact","anni","okai","convinc","either","king","learn","thing","becaus","presenc","movi","fade","awai","doe","thi","realli","miniscul","stori","song","danc","great","experi","viewer","realli"],"filtered2":["st","watch","dirwalt","lang","disappoint","music","charact","develop","standpoint","opinion","muchherald","rodger","hammerstein","piec","coupl","good","song","decent","comic","portray","time","king","siam","yul","brynner","doe","realli","good","job","present","situat","set","onli","blame","screenplai","possibli","act","fulli","understand","charact","situat","know","mai","littl","ask","music","mean","enjoy","song","danc","even","part","stand","lot","basic","storylin","english","woman","come","siam","teach","child","upscal","european","thing","find","late","king","actual","big","pupil","side","forbid","romanc","king","new","wife","plai","rita","morenoa","latino","arabcom","former","lover","caus","complic","noth","realli","mesmer","add","though","deborah","kerr","main","femal","charact","anni","okai","convinc","either","king","learn","thing","becaus","presenc","fade","awai","doe","realli","miniscul","stori","song","danc","great","experi","viewer","realli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,17,18,21,22,26,29,34,38,40,46,49,51,52,61,70,72,82,86,87,88,109,118,150,155,179,180,187,191,207,212,218,253,263,279,286,289,299,306,309,320,328,333,377,411,422,425,431,452,473,478,480,492,515,538,541,558,588,703,737,892,898,954,1039,1112,1128,1159,1367,1406,1422,2101,2164,2482,2974,4150,4766,5146,5521,5530,5757,6315,6393],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,10,11,13,14,17,18,21,22,26,29,34,38,40,46,49,51,52,61,70,72,82,86,87,88,109,118,150,155,179,180,187,191,207,212,218,253,263,279,286,289,299,306,309,320,328,333,377,411,422,425,431,452,473,478,480,492,515,538,541,558,588,703,737,892,898,954,1039,1112,1128,1159,1367,1406,1422,2101,2164,2482,2974,4150,4766,5146,5521,5530,5757,6315,6393],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,3.3716610723085094,0.9913098153388195,4.527176627893589,1.117508199

{"value":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of many of Woody's movies, obviously his late 70's masterpieces (Annie Hall,Interiors, Manhattan)and most of his late 80's/early 90's dramas (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners,Husbands and Wives) in fact I even liked some of his more recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks) but this was abysmal, I though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years Match Point but how wrong I was.<br /><br />It was lazily plotted - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks,with all the jokes taken out - Woody seems to be on the way out as well, slurring most of his lines and delivering 'hilarious' catchphrases 'I mean that with all due respect...' over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare.<br /><br />I know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than this - and Woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future, if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great Woody films to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke.<br /><br />Embarrassingly

{"value":"REALLY? REALLY???? I know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage. Horrible in every sense. Terribly inaccurate in so many ways. I have an easier time believing the president of the United States suiting up, flying a jet fighter, and shooting down aliens. It is easier to note the few things that were right. My jaw dropped when I saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was overacted, seemingly pointless plot diversions, and had questionable cinematography at times.<br /><br />X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilitiesÂ did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you had to do extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am an Iraq war Veteran and if you spent ONE day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad you would realize how B.S. this movie is. To compare this to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ludicrous. Why don't you just throw Commando and Red Dawn in there too; I think those might be more accurate. <br /><br />If for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot, the historical and factual discrepancies, then this movie might just be OK. Nothing more. If you keep on hearing \"Oscar buzz\", and have to add your own pompous review, go right ahead.

{"value":"Something that really does not go down right with Al Gore (and his supporters)'s theory is the whole thing about \"concensus\".<br /><br />If there were such a consensus, why is it that the \"believers\" in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them.<br /><br />Why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies (apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you're on anyone's payroll in that wondrous world...) Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled, when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to those questions, read Prey by the well-know oil-stooge Michael Crichton... oh wait, he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. He just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it. By the way did you know that abiding to the Kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures, according to its own backers?

{"value":"I caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club. We were forewarned that this would be the \"reefer madness\" of gaming, and this movie more than delivered.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man re-starting his college career after \"resting\" for a semester. What we, the viewer, find out as the movie progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called \"Mazes and Monsters,\" a game that he gets re-acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign.<br /><br />This movie is laughable on many, many levels. One scene features the group \"gaming by candlelight,\" which is probably the best way I can describe it. While I'm sure that this was meant to be \"cultish\" in some way, as most gamers know, it's horribly inaccurate. Most role-play sessions are done in well-lit rooms, usually over some chee-tohs and a can of soda.<br /><br />The acting, while not Oscar-caliber, isn't gut-wrenchingly awful either. This is one of Tom Hanks's first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon. The supporting cast, while not very memorable, still hand forth decent performances.<br /><br />Mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made-for-TV movie that shows the \"dangers of gaming\"

{"value":"I watched this movie last night and already I am struggling to recollect very much about it. The story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony. They fly to the Moon in a space-age dustbin carrier; when there, they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the Moonbase.<br /><br />It strikes me that rubbish low-budget sci-fi films often involve either desert planets or, like this movie, criminals escaping from penal colonies. Why this is I have no idea. But I can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical. This one is really no exception. It begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half-way alright dance music soundtrack. It then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. So little of consequence actually happens in this movie that I am literally struggling to write a helpful review, so if you're reading this I apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film's subtleties and nuances. For the record, I recall a tedious bunch of baddies, a tedious bunch of goodies, some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Other than that, I'm struggling.<br /><br />If you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then I would not hesitate to recommend this film.

{"value":"When watching little man , you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes . And thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy ! Your supposed to be laughing at it !! But will you ? Probably not. <br /><br />The main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoonish comedy ), so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is.<br /><br />\"But its a comedy \" some of you might be screaming. Thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot.I mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with A GROWN MANS FACE , wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious? And if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognise that calvin is a grown man ? i mean seriously...what ? <br /><br />\"Its not about the plot , its about the laughs\" you might be screaming . Well heres the thing see, there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more. <br /><br />If you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a

{"value":"I just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just watched. Mainly I think it's a film about an internet S&M \"star\" of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. She's murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of Big City, USA is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic \"as the real thing\". I know. Wow.<br /><br />Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him. He's in the film for about 15 minutes, and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason. I won't even explain the ending, because quite frankly I can't make it out myself. But before the final scene, we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. Honestly, they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.<br /><br />All in all, stay away from this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied.

{"value":"The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent. Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage, appropriately enough for a production that's more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good but don't have to try very hard: Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, but struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is embarrassingly mannered and Polly is atrocious. The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein's bowdlerised Broadway version, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap, shoddy and thoughtlessly made.

{"value":"Sadly, Marry Harron decided to do a fictional account of Bettie Page's life to go along with her own issues with men. As typical in all her work, every major male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling, or twisted. To add to her fiction, she projects ideas and issues that are not true, according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues (though she became a born-again later in life, through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister). She left it, because she was in her late 30's, her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Bettie's own words and are the director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots (not handed to her by \"sick\" fetishists). Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager, who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie, also did many \"naughty\" shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.<br /><br />The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it.","finished_norm":["sadli","marri","harron","decid","to","do","a","fiction","account","of","betti","page","life","to","go","along","with","her","own","issu","with","man","a","typic","in","all","her","work","everi","major","male","charact","be","portrai","a","weak","bumbl","or","twist","to","add","to","her","fiction","she","project","idea","and","issu","that","be","not","true","accord","to","betti","page","herself","betti","do","not","leav","the","biz","becaus","she","think","it","be","moral","wrong","or","have","religi","issu","though","she","becom","a","bornagain","late","in","life","through","the","influenc","of","her","rd","husband","a","minist","she","leav","it","becaus","she","be","in","her","late","her","act","career","have","go","nowher","and","she","feel","she","be","lose","her","look","the","hint","of","molest","and","rape","be","unvalid","and","deni","in","betti","own","word","and","be","the","director","attempt","to","claim","that","ani","woman","who","do","what","betti","do","must","have","be","victim","by","man","harron","fail","to","point","out","that","betti","design","her","own","cloth","in","almost","all","her","shoot","not","hand","to","her","by","sick","fetishist","harron","conjur","fail","to","make","a","point","that","bunni","yeager","who","do","mani","famou","photo","shoot","of","betti","conjur","do","mani","naughti","shoot","with","betti","and","be","not","the","moral","upright","profession","photograph","portrai","in","the","filmbr","br","the","onli","save","grace","be","gretchen","mol","look","veri","much","like","betti","otherwis","there","be","other","movi","and","documentari","much","accur","and","honest","to","her","life","and","the","peopl","in","it"],"filtered":["sadli","marri","harron","decid","fiction","account","betti","page","life","go","along","issu","man","typic","work","everi","major","male","charact","portrai","weak","bumbl","twist","add","fiction","project","idea","issu","true","accord","betti","page","betti","leav","biz","becaus","think","moral","wrong","religi","issu","though","becom","bornagain","late","life","influenc","rd","husband","minist","leav","becaus","late","act","career","go","nowher","feel","lose","look","hint","molest","rape","unvalid","deni","betti","word","director","attempt","claim","ani","woman","betti","must","victim","man","harron","fail","point","betti","design","cloth","almost","shoot","hand","sick","fetishist","harron","conjur","fail","make","point","bunni","yeager","mani","famou","photo","shoot","betti","conjur","mani","naughti","shoot","betti","moral","upright","profession","photograph","portrai","filmbr","br","onli","save","grace","gretchen","mol","look","veri","much","like","betti","otherwis","movi","documentari","much","accur","honest","life","peopl"],"filtered2":["sadli","marri","harron","decid","fiction","account","betti","page","life","go","along","issu","man","typic","work","everi","major","male","charact","portrai","weak","bumbl","twist","add","fiction","project","idea","issu","true","accord","betti","page","betti","leav","biz","becaus","think","moral","wrong","religi","issu","though","becom","bornagain","late","life","influenc","rd","husband","minist","leav","becaus","late","act","career","go","nowher","feel","lose","look","hint","molest","rape","unvalid","deni","betti","word","director","attempt","claim","ani","woman","betti","must","victim","man","harron","fail","point","betti","design","cloth","almost","shoot","hand","sick","fetishist","harron","conjur","fail","make","point","bunni","yeager","mani","famou","photo","shoot","betti","conjur","mani","naughti","shoot","betti","moral","upright","profession","photograph","portrai","filmbr","onli","save","grace","gretchen","mol","look","veri","like","betti","otherwis","documentari","accur","honest","life","peopl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,10,11,12,15,16,21,22,23,25,27,39,43,45,48,50,58,66,70,74,75,85,86,115,117,123,131,141,150,177,189,215,221,235,249,258,299,304,324,379,404,435,469,511,535,536,566,613,624,627,649,659,681,706,733,746,751,778,799,806,865,878,879,916,1102,1149,1160,1303,1312,1316,1338,1379,1503,1601,1792,2409,2491,2565,2628,3063,3620,4008,4149,4794],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,10,11,12,15,16,21,22,23,25,27,39,43,45,48,50,58,66,70,74,75,85,86,115,117,123,131,141,150,177,189,215,221,235,249,258,299,304,324,379,404,435,469,511,535,536,566,613,624,627,649,659,681,706,733,746,751,778,799,806,865,878,879,916,1102,1149,1160,1303,1312,1316,1338,1379,1503,1601,1792,2409,2491,2565,2628,3063,3620,4008,4149,4794],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.9416538289407692,1.1238

{"value":"No, this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's, but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain special effects pre-dating \"An American Werewolf in London,\" disco still being considered cool, and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it, let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's. I've seen more of that here than in \"Happy Days\" & \"Laverne & Shirley\" combined.<br /><br />The one woman who elevates this movie to the \"so bad, it's good\" category was the late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but just barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by Hollywood today, but even as a \"hot chick\" she retains her mousey qualities. Her call for help is evidence of this. She also looks much better as Miss Wimp. \"Seven bucks at the beauty parlor, shot to hell.\" She wasn't kidding.<br /><br />This isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere, they're just few and far between, and I'm not just saying that because I like Hartman. Incidentally, \"Teen Wolf\" was better than this. \"Teen Wolf Too\" was better than this, and that wasn't even so good.<br /><br

{"value":"Sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. You begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichÃ©s and still be entertained?<br /><br />Of course, it is still a Hollywood mainstay to make the GUN the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. Character needs a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do that because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do!? He has a gun! He waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. He pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /><br />It's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from YOU. it will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space that you do. Really, who needs that!? So yes, I'll say it: I think this may well be the worst film I have ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us

{"value":"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of \"Beowulf & Grendel,\" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard \"Viking\" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from \"Beowulf & Grendel\"! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows!

{"value":"Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />The problem is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to \"do something about it.\" I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper. The motivations of the characters are missing: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film doesn't say. Who's she doing it with? Don't expect any answers on that either. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? Where is this film going? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief)are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be American Beauty or a family film. A root canal is more interesting.

{"value":"This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the \"rubber gun squad\" years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a \"race traitor\" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.<br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers.","finished_norm":["thi","program","be","realli","overr","a","detect","like","danni","pino","hothead","charact","would","have","be","transfer","to","the","rubber","gun","squad","year","ago","the","whole","squad","be","make","up","of","sanctimoni","egomaniac","who","judg","peopl","whose","action","go","back","decad","by","the","standard","of","everi","vietnam","veteran","charact","thei","have","ever","have","have","turn","out","to","be","the","killer","unless","it","be","anoth","vietnam","veteran","there","have","onli","be","on","black","murder","and","he","be","put","up","to","it","by","hi","white","boss","the","onli","hispan","killer","be","a","race","traitor","who","kill","anoth","hispan","to","frame","a","hispan","street","kid","for","a","crime","that","natur","two","rich","white","kid","commit","what","a","bunch","of","propaganda","heyscreenwrit","minor","and","poor","peopl","commit","murder","too","onli","on","thi","show","be","much","murder","upperclass","whitesbr","br","what","much","the","arrest","of","peopl","in","their","and","for","crime","thei","commit","year","ago","be","a","joke","no","reallif","da","will","push","for","murder","on","becaus","it","mean","the","state","will","be","stick","with","their","humong","medic","bill","until","thei","final","kick","the","state","would","be","do","their","famili","and","insur","compani","a","favor","the","prosecutor","will","just","plead","them","to","involuntari","manslaught","and","thei","wo","not","serv","a","dai","the","onli","realli","old","crimin","who","go","to","prison","be","either","organ","crime","figur","or","exnazi","whose","highprofil","convict","boost","da","career"],"filtered":["thi","program","realli","overr","detect","like","danni","pino","hothead","charact","transfer","rubber","gun","squad","year","ago","whole","squad","make","sanctimoni","egomaniac","judg","peopl","whose","action","go","back","decad","standard","everi","vietnam","veteran","charact","thei","ever","turn","killer","unless","anoth","vietnam","veteran","onli","black","murder","put","hi","white","boss","onli","hispan","killer","race","traitor","kill","anoth","hispan","frame","hispan","street","kid","crime","natur","two","rich","white","kid","commit","bunch","propaganda","heyscreenwrit","minor","poor","peopl","commit","murder","onli","thi","show","much","murder","upperclass","whitesbr","br","much","arrest","peopl","crime","thei","commit","year","ago","joke","reallif","da","push","murder","becaus","mean","state","stick","humong","medic","bill","thei","final","kick","state","famili","insur","compani","favor","prosecutor","plead","involuntari","manslaught","thei","wo","serv","dai","onli","realli","old","crimin","go","prison","either","organ","crime","figur","exnazi","whose","highprofil","convict","boost","da","career"],"filtered2":["program","realli","overr","detect","like","danni","pino","hothead","charact","transfer","rubber","gun","squad","year","ago","whole","squad","make","sanctimoni","egomaniac","judg","peopl","whose","action","go","back","decad","standard","everi","vietnam","veteran","charact","ever","turn","killer","unless","anoth","vietnam","veteran","onli","black","murder","put","white","boss","onli","hispan","killer","race","traitor","kill","anoth","hispan","frame","hispan","street","kid","crime","natur","two","rich","white","kid","commit","bunch","propaganda","heyscreenwrit","minor","poor","peopl","commit","murder","onli","show","murder","upperclass","whitesbr","arrest","peopl","crime","commit","year","ago","joke","reallif","da","push","murder","becaus","mean","state","stick","humong","medic","bill","final","kick","state","famili","insur","compani","favor","prosecutor","plead","involuntari","manslaught","wo","serv","dai","onli","realli","old","crimin","go","prison","either","organ","crime","figur","exnazi","whose","highprofil","convict","boost","da","career"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,10,11,13,22,23,28,44,47,57,63,67,73,76,85,88,96,111,114,129,132,146,156,159,182,207,214,229,252,273,359,406,415,416,419,456,460,498,501,511,598,610,616,664,722,753,815,852,869,882,937,969,1023,1033,1062,1097,1110,1123,1196,1251,1256,1401,1428,1591,1657,1810,1901,1995,2053,2081,2112,2187,2357,2626,3268,3536,3659,4107,5234,5492,6553,6977,7440],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,10,11,13,22,23,28,44,47,57,63,67,73,76,85,88,96,111,114,129,132,146,156,159,182,207,214,229,252,273,359,406,415,416,419,456,460,498,501,511,598,610,616,664,722,753,815,852,869,882,937,969,1023,1033,1062,1097,1110,1123,1196,1251,1256,1401,1428,1591,1657,1810,1901,1995,2053,2081,2112,2187,2357,2626,3268,3536,3659,4107,523

{"value":"The film-school intellects can drool all they want about the important (imagined) meaning of this film, but it's just that: intellectual drool. This film is creatively bankrupt, and some mistake it's endless self-indulgent wanking as substance. Yeah. <br /><br />Obviously Godard wasn't a Stones fan. Too bad, because this could have been great. He's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a True Detective mag or some such crap. <br /><br />Then there's the endless shots of what looks like 60's librarians spray-painting words on people's cars. And then there's the seemingly neverending \"interview\" where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions. There's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book, which goes on for, oh, only about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a junkyard.<br /><br />It almost sounds intriguing? Well, it's not.<br /><br />But for unwashed film-school hipsters who don't care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the Stones bringing Sympathy for the Devil into the world and would rather hear some English guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag's, this film's a real winner!<br /><br />More accurately...maybe Godard just

{"value":"A lot of other reviewers here, including many whose opinions I respect, hold this slice of European sleaze horror in high regard. Personally, I didn't like it at all. Its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well. Unfortunately, the infamous exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's most well known films are infamous for their high gross-out quotient. This, an early film by him, doesn't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious \"Anthropophagous\" and \"Beyond the Darkness\" did. Ultimately, its an incoherent film that doesn't manage to involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. As I said, others have enjoyed this film, but I just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing.<br /><br />There are a few pluses for the film. Ewa Aulin (from \"Candy\") is in it, and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. However, cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film. He seems bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does at his finest. The music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore. Still, this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring.

{"value":"Getting lost in space frozen for 15 years, that's unlikely. Falling into a star... improbable. Falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes... ludicrous. Getting rescued by a ship just then... priceless.<br /><br />No, it's not Zaphod Beeblebrox's Heart of Gold to the rescue. It's also not the Parent of the Year awardees. After sentencing her daughter to two years' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship, the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they've picked up. This foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat, which makes up most of the film's action. Combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away, who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.<br /><br />In the end, the family of three abandons the metropolis-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave, instead using the psycho's fighter ship which they've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile. You have to love those hard sci-fi statistics! <br /><br />As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the Sci fi channel.","finished_norm":["get","lose","in","space","freez","for","year","that","unlik","fall","into","a","star","improb","fall","into","it","the","dai","it","go","supernova","and","explod","ludicr","get","rescu","by","a","ship","just","then","pricelessbr","br","no","it","not","zaphod","beeblebrox","heart","of","gold","to","the","rescu","it","conjur","not","the","parent","of","the","year","awarde","after","sentenc","her","daughter","to","two","year","solitari","confin","on","a","abandon","spaceship","the","mother","encourag","her","to","get","drink","and","wander","off","alon","with","the","strang","man","thei","have","pick","up","thi","foreshadow","their","prowess","in","hand","to","hand","combat","which","make","up","much","of","the","film","action","combat","highlight","includ","for","exampl","the","psycho","talk","close","up","face","to","face","with","on","woman","while","blindli","point","the","gun","behind","him","at","the","other","about","six","inch","awai","who","obligingli","simper","in","the","line","of","firebr","br","in","the","end","the","famili","of","three","abandon","the","metropoliss","ship","thei","be","plan","to","us","to","observ","the","supernova","until","the","last","instant","becaus","it","be","too","slow","to","escap","the","blast","wave","instead","us","the","psycho","fighter","ship","which","thei","have","refuel","in","on","minut","with","pound","of","ga","propel","from","a","kiloton","missil","you","have","to","love","that","hard","scifi","statist","br","br","a","long","a","hollywood","treat","write","a","a","irrelev","frill","thei","will","continu","make","movi","not","fit","to","run","at","be","on","the","sci","fi","channel"],"filtered":["get","lose","space","freez","year","unlik","fall","star","improb","fall","dai","go","supernova","explod","ludicr","get","rescu","ship","pricelessbr","br","zaphod","beeblebrox","heart","gold","rescu","conjur","parent","year","awarde","sentenc","daughter","two","year","solitari","confin","abandon","spaceship","mother","encourag","get","drink","wander","alon","strang","man","thei","pick","thi","foreshadow","prowess","hand","hand","combat","make","much","film","action","combat","highlight","includ","exampl","psycho","talk","close","face","face","woman","blindli","point","gun","behind","six","inch","awai","obligingli","simper","line","firebr","br","end","famili","three","abandon","metropoliss","ship","thei","plan","us","observ","supernova","last","instant","becaus","slow","escap","blast","wave","instead","us","psycho","fighter","ship","thei","refuel","minut","pound","ga","propel","kiloton","missil","love","hard","scifi","statist","br","br","long","hollywood","treat","write","irrelev","frill","thei","continu","make","movi","fit","run","sci","fi","channel"],"filtered2":["get","lose","space","freez","year","unlik","fall","star","improb","fall","dai","go","supernova","explod","ludicr","get","rescu","ship","pricelessbr","zaphod","beeblebrox","heart","gold","rescu","conjur","parent","year","awarde","sentenc","daughter","two","year","solitari","confin","abandon","spaceship","mother","encourag","get","drink","wander","alon","strang","man","pick","foreshadow","prowess","hand","hand","combat","make","action","combat","highlight","includ","exampl","psycho","talk","close","face","face","woman","blindli","point","gun","behind","six","inch","awai","obligingli","simper","line","firebr","end","famili","three","abandon","metropoliss","ship","plan","us","observ","supernova","last","instant","becaus","slow","escap","blast","wave","instead","us","psycho","fighter","ship","refuel","minut","pound","ga","propel","kiloton","missil","love","hard","scifi","statist","long","hollywood","treat","write","irrelev","frill","continu","make","fit","run","sci","fi","channel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,22,24,39,45,47,54,56,57,59,65,66,70,99,100,107,129,132,137,144,152,155,169,171,182,186,221,224,235,251,295,300,301,307,390,393,397,417,426,433,446,457,501,581,614,615,637,638,667,670,676,728,781,849,987,1190,1242,1348,1385,1394,1486,1725,1800,1804,1852,1864,1924,1992,2257,2355,2391,2434,2619,2856,2934,2979,3832,3843,4071,4195,4347,4386,4663,5740,6439,7364,7590,8425],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,22,24,39,45,47,54,56,57,59,65,66,70,99,100,107,129,132,137,144,152,155,169,171,182,186,221,224,235,251,295,300,301,307,390,393,397,417,426,433,446,457,501,581,614,615,637,638,667,670,676,728,781,849,987,1190,1242,1348,1385,1394,1486,1725,1800,1804,1852,1864,1924,1992,2257,2355,2391,2434,2619,2856,2934,2979,3832,3843,4071,4195,4347,4386,4663,5740,6439,7364,7590,8425],"values":[1.23

{"value":"I think this is almost all I need to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions though. I've basically never seen such an armature production, and I mean that in all senses of the word. Although he physical camera work, boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately its not the only areas. <br /><br />Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has an awful script, awful acting and worst of all, awful annoying characters. <br /><br />It's a crime that for the every independent film that gets, distribution like Haiku Tunnel, there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony, but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution. I'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up.<br /><br />The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title. However, the reason for that is even a let down. I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it. I've seen a lot of films in my time, and I'm very forgiving when in the cinema, but this was too much. I'll never forget 'tunnel', for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema. Shame it's such a low point.","finished_norm":["i","think","thi","be","almost","all","i","ne","to","sai","i","feel","oblig","to","explain","my","action","though","i","have","basic","never","see","such","a","armatur","product","and","i","mean","that","in","all","sens","of","the","word","although","he","physic","camera","work","boom","mic","oper","and","other","technic","aspect","of","thi","film","be","laughabl","unfortun","it","not","the","onli","area","br","br","unlik","some","classic","independ","film","that","have","be","save","by","their","script","great","character","and","plot","thi","unfortun","have","a","aw","script","aw","act","and","wrong","of","all","aw","annoi","charact","br","br","it","a","crime","that","for","the","everi","independ","film","that","get","distribut","like","haiku","tunnel","there","a","other","indi","film","that","die","silent","death","i","do","not","know","who","the","kornbluth","brother","know","at","soni","but","that","can","be","my","onli","explan","a","to","how","thi","amateur","famili","product","ever","get","distribut","i","be","quit","bemus","a","to","why","thei","pick","thi","upbr","br","the","onli","part","of","thi","film","that","hold","out","ani","intrigu","be","it","titl","howev","the","reason","for","that","be","even","a","let","down","i","hope","thi","review","will","save","a","few","peopl","that","mai","be","intrigu","by","thi","film","titl","from","go","to","watch","it","i","have","see","a","lot","of","film","in","my","time","and","i","be","veri","forgiv","when","in","the","cinema","but","thi","be","too","much","i","will","never","forget","tunnel","for","mark","a","import","point","in","my","life","experi","of","cinema","shame","it","such","a","low","point"],"filtered":["think","thi","almost","ne","sai","feel","oblig","explain","action","though","basic","never","see","armatur","product","mean","sens","word","although","physic","camera","work","boom","mic","oper","technic","aspect","thi","film","laughabl","unfortun","onli","area","br","br","unlik","classic","independ","film","save","script","great","character","plot","thi","unfortun","aw","script","aw","act","wrong","aw","annoi","charact","br","br","crime","everi","independ","film","get","distribut","like","haiku","tunnel","indi","film","die","silent","death","know","kornbluth","brother","know","soni","onli","explan","thi","amateur","famili","product","ever","get","distribut","quit","bemus","thei","pick","thi","upbr","br","onli","part","thi","film","hold","ani","intrigu","titl","howev","reason","even","let","hope","thi","review","save","peopl","mai","intrigu","thi","film","titl","go","watch","see","lot","film","time","veri","forgiv","cinema","thi","much","never","forget","tunnel","mark","import","point","life","experi","cinema","shame","low","point"],"filtered2":["think","almost","ne","feel","oblig","explain","action","though","basic","never","see","armatur","product","mean","sens","word","although","physic","camera","work","boom","mic","oper","technic","aspect","laughabl","unfortun","onli","area","unlik","classic","independ","save","script","great","character","plot","unfortun","aw","script","aw","act","wrong","aw","annoi","charact","crime","everi","independ","get","distribut","like","haiku","tunnel","indi","die","silent","death","know","kornbluth","brother","know","soni","onli","explan","amateur","famili","product","ever","get","distribut","quit","bemus","pick","upbr","onli","part","hold","ani","intrigu","titl","howev","reason","even","let","hope","review","save","peopl","mai","intrigu","titl","go","watch","see","lot","time","veri","forgiv","cinema","never","forget","tunnel","mark","import","point","life","experi","cinema","shame","low","point"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,15,21,23,25,26,27,32,42,43,44,46,48,51,61,66,72,75,77,85,86,88,95,110,113,120,124,129,131,138,173,176,181,182,189,190,217,227,231,237,245,258,264,271,286,293,332,333,372,381,395,409,414,446,552,574,600,615,645,717,753,944,970,1000,1017,1157,1158,1211,1225,1311,1420,2037,2074,2470,2635,2795,2993,3375,7598,7940],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,15,21,23,25,26,27,32,42,43,44,46,48,51,61,66,72,75,77,85,86,88,95,110,113,120,124,129,131,138,173,176,181,182,189,190,217,227,231,237,245,258,264,271,286,293,332,333,372,381,395,409,414,446,552,574,600,615,645,717,753,944,970,1000,1017,1157,1158,1211,1225,1311,1420,2037,2074,2470,2635,2795,2993,3375,7598,7940],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.9739294460164585,1.0

{"value":"Boy this movie had me fooled. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever, boy I got the cold shoulder that time. This movie was, and I'm truthful, pretty damn good. It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting. Some to the horrible acting and clichÃ© killings were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The POV camera angles were awesome.<br /><br />The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He than takes his revenge, as the snowman, on the police officer who convicted him.<br /><br />This movie had such bad acting, with the exception of Christopher Allport, that is was funny. I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror, but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right. All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying. But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel.","finished_norm":["boi","thi","movi","have","me","fool","i","honestli","think","it","would","be","a","campi","horror","film","with","absolut","no","humor","in","it","whatsoev","boi","i","get","the","cold","shoulder","that","time","thi","movi","be","and","i","be","truth","pretti","damn","good","it","be","not","scari","at","all","but","the","campi","and","the","sly","humor","realli","mad","thi","movi","interest","some","to","the","horribl","act","and","clichÃ©","kill","be","so","pain","to","watch","i","almost","laugh","at","how","bad","it","be","but","to","some","extent","i","enjoi","it","the","kill","all","vagu","relat","to","snow","sport","and","christma","which","make","thing","much","intrigu","the","pov","camera","angl","be","awesomebr","br","the","movi","be","about","a","viscou","killer","who","die","in","a","car","accid","collis","with","a","chemic","truck","while","be","transport","to","prison","he","be","late","resurrect","in","that","veri","same","chemic","with","snow","splice","into","the","mixtur","thi","be","the","ingredi","choos","to","make","the","perfect","killer","snowman","he","than","take","hi","reveng","a","the","snowman","on","the","polic","offic","who","convict","himbr","br","thi","movi","have","such","bad","act","with","the","except","of","christoph","allport","that","be","be","funni","i","will","sai","that","i","be","conjur","pretti","disappoint","that","thi","movi","be","not","a","horror","but","in","fact","a","dark","sitcom","thei","have","a","great","stori","with","a","good","plot","but","it","be","not","execut","right","all","in","all","i","like","the","movi","at","but","now","it","be","realli","annoi","but","thi","movi","be","wai","well","and","dark","than","the","sequel"],"filtered":["boi","thi","movi","fool","honestli","think","campi","horror","film","absolut","humor","whatsoev","boi","get","cold","shoulder","time","thi","movi","truth","pretti","damn","good","scari","campi","sly","humor","realli","mad","thi","movi","interest","horribl","act","clichÃ©","kill","pain","watch","almost","laugh","bad","extent","enjoi","kill","vagu","relat","snow","sport","christma","make","thing","much","intrigu","pov","camera","angl","awesomebr","br","movi","viscou","killer","die","car","accid","collis","chemic","truck","transport","prison","late","resurrect","veri","chemic","snow","splice","mixtur","thi","ingredi","choos","make","perfect","killer","snowman","take","hi","reveng","snowman","polic","offic","convict","himbr","br","thi","movi","bad","act","except","christoph","allport","funni","sai","conjur","pretti","disappoint","thi","movi","horror","fact","dark","sitcom","thei","great","stori","good","plot","execut","right","like","movi","realli","annoi","thi","movi","wai","well","dark","sequel"],"filtered2":["boi","fool","honestli","think","campi","horror","absolut","humor","whatsoev","boi","get","cold","shoulder","time","truth","pretti","damn","good","scari","campi","sly","humor","realli","mad","interest","horribl","act","clichÃ©","kill","pain","watch","almost","laugh","bad","extent","enjoi","kill","vagu","relat","snow","sport","christma","make","thing","intrigu","pov","camera","angl","awesomebr","viscou","killer","die","car","accid","collis","chemic","truck","transport","prison","late","resurrect","veri","chemic","snow","splice","mixtur","ingredi","choos","make","perfect","killer","snowman","take","reveng","snowman","polic","offic","convict","himbr","bad","act","except","christoph","allport","funni","conjur","pretti","disappoint","horror","fact","dark","sitcom","great","stori","good","plot","execut","right","like","realli","annoi","wai","well","dark","sequel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,9,12,13,15,17,20,21,29,31,32,33,39,51,60,62,76,78,83,97,121,131,133,150,187,200,222,230,231,232,252,271,282,284,293,368,369,387,396,458,471,523,584,587,662,677,748,757,758,831,852,871,889,903,991,1017,1057,1106,1162,1293,1325,1508,1677,1717,1734,1882,1906,2336,2353,2357,2587,2793,3138,3493,3546,3769,4398,5095,6153,7177],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,9,12,13,15,17,20,21,29,31,32,33,39,51,60,62,76,78,83,97,121,131,133,150,187,200,222,230,231,232,252,271,282,284,293,368,369,387,396,458,471,523,584,587,662,677,748,757,758,831,852,871,889,903,991,1017,1057,1106,1162,1293,1325,1508,1677,1717,1734,1882,1906,2336,2353,2357,2587,2793,3138,3493,3546,3769,4398,5095,6153,7177],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,2.324031090

{"value":"i was intrigued to see how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker. sadly, all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off-the-screen reasons.<br /><br />the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see. when it's not busy being yet another Bourne Identity homage with dire, annoying \"shaky cam\" visuals, it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing.<br /><br />the \"plot\" is threadbare, the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue - on the instances where the film gives up on being \"minimalist\" and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes - is some of the worst ever recorded. in fairness, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.<br /><br />the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of \"mockumentary\" that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re-edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.<br /><br />if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back, and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life.","finished_norm":["i","be","intrigu","to","see","how","a","littleseen","film","have","somehow","win","the","oscar","for","well","pictur","of","and","thu","go","to","see","the","hurt","locker","sadli","all","i","get","for","the","two","hour","invest","be","the","grim","confirm","that","thi","film","have","win","award","pure","for","offthescreen","reasonsbr","br","the","direct","and","visual","styl","of","thi","film","be","some","of","the","weak","you","will","ever","see","when","it","not","busi","be","yet","anoth","bourn","ident","homag","with","dire","annoi","shaki","cam","visual","it","show","off","all","the","hallmark","of","a","rate","daytim","soap","opu","in","term","of","lensingbr","br","the","plot","be","threadbar","the","character","be","about","a","good","develop","a","reject","beetl","bailei","comic","strip","idea","and","the","dialogu","on","the","instanc","where","the","film","give","up","on","be","minimalist","and","for","no","appar","reason","turn","on","or","two","soldier","into","right","chatterbox","be","some","of","the","wrong","ever","record","in","fair","the","actor","do","the","well","thei","can","in","the","circumst","just","not","enough","to","obscur","how","bad","the","project","isbr","br","the","whole","film","have","the","feel","of","it","be","intend","a","some","kind","of","mockumentari","that","thei","clock","be","bereav","of","humour","and","thu","reedit","a","well","thei","can","so","a","to","pass","it","off","a","a","seriou","dramabr","br","if","you","spend","two","hour","on","thi","film","thei","be","two","hour","you","will","never","get","back","and","two","hour","wast","that","you","will","regret","for","the","rest","of","your","life"],"filtered":["intrigu","see","littleseen","film","somehow","win","oscar","well","pictur","thu","go","see","hurt","locker","sadli","get","two","hour","invest","grim","confirm","thi","film","win","award","pure","offthescreen","reasonsbr","br","direct","visual","styl","thi","film","weak","ever","see","busi","yet","anoth","bourn","ident","homag","dire","annoi","shaki","cam","visual","show","hallmark","rate","daytim","soap","opu","term","lensingbr","br","plot","threadbar","character","good","develop","reject","beetl","bailei","comic","strip","idea","dialogu","instanc","film","give","minimalist","appar","reason","turn","two","soldier","right","chatterbox","wrong","ever","record","fair","actor","well","thei","circumst","enough","obscur","bad","project","isbr","br","whole","film","feel","intend","kind","mockumentari","thei","clock","bereav","humour","thu","reedit","well","thei","pass","seriou","dramabr","br","spend","two","hour","thi","film","thei","two","hour","never","get","back","two","hour","wast","regret","rest","life"],"filtered2":["intrigu","see","littleseen","somehow","win","oscar","well","pictur","thu","go","see","hurt","locker","sadli","get","two","hour","invest","grim","confirm","win","award","pure","offthescreen","reasonsbr","direct","visual","styl","weak","ever","see","busi","yet","anoth","bourn","ident","homag","dire","annoi","shaki","cam","visual","show","hallmark","rate","daytim","soap","opu","term","lensingbr","plot","threadbar","character","good","develop","reject","beetl","bailei","comic","strip","idea","dialogu","instanc","give","minimalist","appar","reason","turn","two","soldier","right","chatterbox","wrong","ever","record","fair","actor","well","circumst","enough","obscur","bad","project","isbr","whole","feel","intend","kind","mockumentari","clock","bereav","humour","thu","reedit","well","pass","seriou","dramabr","spend","two","hour","two","hour","never","get","back","two","hour","wast","regret","rest","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,9,20,25,28,30,32,41,42,43,44,47,63,73,75,89,93,95,96,102,111,121,122,123,174,194,202,226,248,271,283,308,311,320,379,380,480,487,489,493,549,635,657,659,706,726,790,858,863,877,926,979,1004,1017,1020,1192,1200,1216,1235,1343,1608,1678,1859,1881,1895,1909,1932,2037,2084,2156,2385,2792,2988,3083,3265,4601,5676,6072,6256,6354,6501,6601,7137,7743,7815,8085,8410],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,9,20,25,28,30,32,41,42,43,44,47,63,73,75,89,93,95,96,102,111,121,122,123,174,194,202,226,248,271,283,308,311,320,379,380,480,487,489,493,549,635,657,659,706,726,790,858,863,877,926,979,1004,1017,1020,1192,1200,1216,1235,1343,1608,1678,1859,1881,1895,1909,1932,2037,2084,2156,2385,2792,2988,3083,3265,4601,5676,6072,6256,6354,6501,6601,7137,7743,7815,8085,8410],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,3.4960351200691706,1.27963878808270

{"value":"\"Cavemen\" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: The Cavemen are an alternate race, they face prejudice, etc. Quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created; almost being worthy of jail time for the writers. One show featured the cavemen going into a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute Andy Rooney dialog, followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here's an example of the dialog: \"You're sure you're okay with going out with a caveman.\" \"Yeah, that's fine. I've had like 10 - thousand!\" Hilarious... Possibly the best writing I've ever witnessed.<br /><br />22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup, tackling tough social issues... Sounds like an entertaining night. I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they're resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials. I wonder if they'll do the Gecko next, so that I can have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen.
