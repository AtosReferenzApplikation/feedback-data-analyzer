{"value":"i love bad shark movies. i really do. i laugh hysterically at them. and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them, culminating in the premier of their new original picture, hammerhead: shark frenzy. based on the previews, it looked like it was going to be HIGHLY amusing. essentially a remake of benchley's creature, really. it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is shark movie hilarity at its best. i was in the mood; i was ready to go. bring it on, hammerhead-mad-scientist-man! oh, god, was that movie wrong.<br /><br />wrong, wrong, wrong.<br /><br />sick. twisted. MESSED UP.<br /><br />this is theoretical reproduction at its very worst, my friends. when a drugged-out girl is brought out of suspended animation and strapped to a table screaming her head off because the shark-human hybrid fetus the absolutely insane \"scientist\" deliberately implanted in her womb wants OUT... Jesus monkeys. that's what i call disturbing.<br /><br />that's really how the plot works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. my son died of cancer, but i brought him back to life by combining his dna with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks don't succumb to cancer and further hammerheads reproduce via placenta. oh, look! a perfect amphibious being! i've created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let's make him reproduce! but darned if all those shark genes have't made my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping the hot babes i keep sending into his little jungle paradise, he keeps eating him. but check this out! among the random people who have, by way of some unimportant plot twist, ended up on my research island, is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died! i bet he'll do HER! all this leads up to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion: woman: you're going to impregnate me? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicates thrashing shark-person in tank) how sweet.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.

{"value":"The title above is used to introduce the film \"Gen\" to its audience. Gen is about a young doctor(Doga Rutkay) with an ill mother. The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days.<br /><br />Two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with outside world is cut off too. There is no way out!! In those few days, there will be more nasty murders. Now everybody suspects from each other.<br /><br />In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive sides of the movie of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actings are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. What I am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it altogether which I think didn't work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I have recently found out that he is only 21 years old. That made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.","finished_norm":["the","titl","abov","be","us","to","introduc","the","film","gen","to","it","audienc","gen","be","about","a","young","doctordoga","rutkai","with","a","ill","mother","the","film","start","with","her","leav","her","mother","behind","to","start","her","new","job","while","she","drive","we","realis","that","she","be","not","that","close","home","a","the","hospit","be","in","a","remot","area","a","soon","a","she","step","into","the","garden","of","the","hospit","she","see","the","death","bodi","of","a","patient","thi","be","the","begin","of","a","nightmar","for","the","next","few","daysbr","br","two","policeman","come","to","the","hospit","so","a","to","investig","the","suicid","in","fact","thei","will","have","to","stai","in","the","hospit","becaus","all","road","be","cut","off","due","to","bad","weather","condit","all","their","commun","with","outsid","world","be","cut","off","too","there","be","no","wai","out","in","that","few","dai","there","will","be","much","nasti","murder","now","everybodi","suspect","from","each","otherbr","br","in","my","opinion","the","idea","be","brilliant","it","can","have","be","veri","scari","ind","there","be","posit","side","of","the","movi","of","cours","i","realli","like","the","begin","of","the","movi","especi","when","she","drive","to","the","hospit","and","her","moment","in","the","hospit","act","be","okai","some","of","them","be","try","too","hard","to","be","mysteri","and","scari","though","i","think","the","final","shock","should","have","be","spread","into","the","through","out","of","the","movi","what","i","be","sai","be","it","be","a","good","twist","but","instead","of","show","it","a","a","parodi","in","the","end","we","should","have","realis","that","be","come","when","we","see","what","be","happen","the","director","ne","to","explain","it","altogeth","which","i","think","do","not","work","good","conjur","the","much","danger","patient","in","the","movi","be","suppos","to","be","at","littl","year","old","but","hi","bodi","look","so","young","and","fit","for","someon","who","spend","much","of","hi","life","in","thi","hospit","lastli","i","would","like","to","sai","a","few","thing","about","the","director","i","be","sure","he","will","improv","thi","be","hi","attempt","i","have","recent","find","out","that","he","be","onli","year","old","that","make","me","feel","much","posit","about","him","and","hi","futur","film","i","be","not","go","to","rate","thi","film","out","of","though"],"filtered":["titl","abov","us","introduc","film","gen","audienc","gen","young","doctordoga","rutkai","ill","mother","film","start","leav","mother","behind","start","new","job","drive","realis","close","home","hospit","remot","area","soon","step","garden","hospit","see","death","bodi","patient","thi","begin","nightmar","next","daysbr","br","two","policeman","come","hospit","investig","suicid","fact","thei","stai","hospit","becaus","road","cut","due","bad","weather","condit","commun","outsid","world","cut","wai","dai","much","nasti","murder","everybodi","suspect","otherbr","br","opinion","idea","brilliant","veri","scari","ind","posit","side","movi","cours","realli","like","begin","movi","especi","drive","hospit","moment","hospit","act","okai","try","hard","mysteri","scari","though","think","final","shock","spread","movi","sai","good","twist","instead","show","parodi","end","realis","come","see","happen","director","ne","explain","altogeth","think","work","good","conjur","much","danger","patient","movi","suppos","littl","year","old","hi","bodi","look","young","fit","someon","spend","much","hi","life","thi","hospit","lastli","like","sai","thing","director","sure","improv","thi","hi","attempt","recent","find","onli","year","old","make","feel","much","posit","hi","futur","film","go","rate","thi","film","though"],"filtered2":["titl","abov","us","introduc","gen","audienc","gen","young","doctordoga","rutkai","ill","mother","start","leav","mother","behind","start","new","job","drive","realis","close","home","hospit","remot","area","soon","step","garden","hospit","see","death","bodi","patient","begin","nightmar","next","daysbr","two","policeman","come","hospit","investig","suicid","fact","stai","hospit","becaus","road","cut","due","bad","weather","condit","commun","outsid","world","cut","wai","dai","nasti","murder","everybodi","suspect","otherbr","opinion","idea","brilliant","veri","scari","ind","posit","side","cours","realli","like","begin","especi","drive","hospit","moment","hospit","act","okai","try","hard","mysteri","scari","though","think","final","shock","spread","good","twist","instead","show","parodi","end","realis","come","see","happen","director","ne","explain","altogeth","think","work","good","conjur","danger","patient","suppos","littl","year","old","bodi","look","young","fit","someon","spend","life","hospit","lastli","like","thing","director","sure","improv","attempt","recent","find","onli","year","old","make","feel","posit","futur","go","rate","though"],"features":{"t

{"value":"Visually stunning? Most definitely. I have seen few films look this good in some time. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography, computer graphics, and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh. The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s. The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. Also, mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Alright, it doesn't take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead, and in the wings his trusty, thoroughly competent sidekick. What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization. The plot for this film is ridiculous. That being said, the film is going for a serial-like feeling of film serials of yesteryear. They had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and big names this film had. Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat, one would think, but Sky Captain sinks miserably. Despite its fantastic dark look, I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life. I had little interest in a story that generated little interest. I didn't care at all for any of the glib portrayals. Paltrow was just awful. Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance. Law cannot carry the one-liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little. I was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came.","finished_norm":["visual","stun","much","definit","i","have","see","few","film","look","thi","good","in","some","time","sky","captain","and","the","world","of","tomorrow","us","strike","cinematographi","comput","graphic","and","creativ","futurist","design","to","creat","a","world","that","be","histor","familiar","yet","someth","quit","fresh","the","time","period","seem","to","be","the","or","earli","the","movi","tell","of","recent","attack","on","new","york","citi","by","mechan","armi","steal","gener","and","the","like","for","some","inexplic","reason","conjur","mysteri","disappear","of","relev","scientif","mind","coincid","who","can","stop","them","and","save","the","world","alright","it","doe","not","take","a","leap","of","faith","to","know","it","be","the","sky","captain","himself","with","hi","wisecrack","report","girlfriend","alwai","hot","for","a","lead","and","in","the","wing","hi","trusti","thoroughli","compet","sidekick","what","sky","captain","have","in","atmospher","and","graphic","it","lack","in","storytel","and","character","the","plot","for","thi","film","be","ridicul","that","be","sai","the","film","be","go","for","a","seriallik","feel","of","film","serial","of","yesteryear","thei","have","pretti","far","out","stori","and","bad","act","but","none","of","them","and","i","mean","none","of","them","have","the","budget","and","big","name","thi","film","have","two","academi","award","win","perform","and","jude","law","can","keep","a","film","afloat","on","would","think","but","sky","captain","sink","miser","despit","it","fantast","dark","look","i","find","myself","wish","the","film","would","just","end","and","i","can","get","on","with","my","life","i","have","littl","interest","in","a","stori","that","gener","littl","interest","i","do","not","care","at","all","for","ani","of","the","glib","portray","paltrow","be","just","aw","joli","be","a","joke","with","a","role","with","virtual","no","substanc","law","cannot","carri","the","onelin","tradit","all","too","squar","on","hi","limit","shoulder","i","mean","let","face","it","he","not","will","smith","mel","gibson","or","even","weslei","snipe","the","sad","thing","about","sky","captain","at","littl","for","me","be","that","it","hold","so","much","promis","yet","deliv","so","littl","i","be","bore","ten","minut","into","the","film","wait","for","someth","to","hook","my","interest","and","it","never","come"],"filtered":["visual","stun","much","definit","see","film","look","thi","good","time","sky","captain","world","tomorrow","us","strike","cinematographi","comput","graphic","creativ","futurist","design","creat","world","histor","familiar","yet","someth","quit","fresh","time","period","seem","earli","movi","tell","recent","attack","new","york","citi","mechan","armi","steal","gener","like","inexplic","reason","conjur","mysteri","disappear","relev","scientif","mind","coincid","stop","save","world","alright","doe","take","leap","faith","know","sky","captain","hi","wisecrack","report","girlfriend","alwai","hot","lead","wing","hi","trusti","thoroughli","compet","sidekick","sky","captain","atmospher","graphic","lack","storytel","character","plot","thi","film","ridicul","sai","film","go","seriallik","feel","film","serial","yesteryear","thei","pretti","far","stori","bad","act","none","mean","none","budget","big","name","thi","film","two","academi","award","win","perform","jude","law","keep","film","afloat","think","sky","captain","sink","miser","despit","fantast","dark","look","find","wish","film","end","get","life","littl","interest","stori","gener","littl","interest","care","ani","glib","portray","paltrow","aw","joli","joke","role","virtual","substanc","law","carri","onelin","tradit","squar","hi","limit","shoulder","mean","let","face","smith","mel","gibson","even","weslei","snipe","sad","thing","sky","captain","littl","hold","much","promis","yet","deliv","littl","bore","ten","minut","film","wait","someth","hook","interest","never","come"],"filtered2":["visual","stun","definit","see","look","good","time","sky","captain","world","tomorrow","us","strike","cinematographi","comput","graphic","creativ","futurist","design","creat","world","histor","familiar","yet","someth","quit","fresh","time","period","seem","earli","tell","recent","attack","new","york","citi","mechan","armi","steal","gener","like","inexplic","reason","conjur","mysteri","disappear","relev","scientif","mind","coincid","stop","save","world","alright","doe","take","leap","faith","know","sky","captain","wisecrack","report","girlfriend","alwai","hot","lead","wing","trusti","thoroughli","compet","sidekick","sky","captain","atmospher","graphic","lack","storytel","character","plot","ridicul","go","seriallik","feel","serial","yesteryear","pretti","far","stori","bad","act","none","mean","none","budget","big","name","two","academi","award","win","perform","jude","law","keep","afloat","think","sky","captain","sink","miser","despit","fantast","dark","look","find","wish","end","get","life","littl","intere

{"value":"In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands. But it fails at making them laugh...<br /><br />Les Visiteurs has had its success, because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis's Back to the future, here comes the old France, the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel.<br /><br />Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.<br /><br />The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation : it's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid... and fails.<br /><br />Let's have a look at the characters : Montmirail doesn't change, he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy.<br /><br />Forget about the time travels, about the digital effects, concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.<br /><br />The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters, let's say up to 13 years old.","finished_norm":["in","a","wai","corridor","of","time","be","a","success","stori","becaus","the","movi","reach","it","goal","be","see","by","thousand","but","it","fail","at","make","them","laughbr","br","le","visiteur","have","have","it","success","becaus","the","subject","be","a","origin","wai","of","consid","the","time","travel","forget","about","zemecki","back","to","the","futur","here","come","the","old","franc","the","middleag","knight","and","it","nearli","barbar","wai","of","life","full","of","pride","funni","thank","to","the","ancient","word","he","us","montmirail","can","sometim","be","disgust","but","he","keep","hi","honor","then","come","the","sequelbr","br","nobodi","have","forese","the","tremend","success","of","le","visiteur","the","and","it","no","us","be","a","movi","expert","to","realiz","that","the","corridor","of","time","have","be","make","for","moneybr","br","the","gener","stori","begin","after","the","end","of","le","visiteur","and","immedi","try","to","justifi","the","sequel","with","a","time","paradox","that","would","have","ne","some","tought","explan","it","no","us","try","to","get","back","the","jewelri","jacquouil","have","steal","do","not","you","rememb","thi","nice","red","shini","and","expens","car","he","bui","at","the","end","of","the","st","episod","where","do","you","think","he","find","the","monei","sell","the","jewelri","and","that","onli","on","of","mani","hole","poiré","try","to","avoid","and","failsbr","br","let","have","a","look","at","the","charact","montmirail","doe","not","chang","he","just","a","littl","much","bore","regard","frenegond","that","anoth","stori","valéri","lemerci","decid","not","to","compromis","herself","in","thi","sequel","to","avoid","get","stick","in","the","bourgeois","role","and","muriel","robin","try","to","imit","her","in","a","wai","that","i","find","so","piti","i","nearli","feel","pain","for","her","and","poiré","doe","not","realiz","that","a","cast","of","humorist","be","not","enough","to","make","a","good","comedybr","br","forget","about","the","time","travel","about","the","digit","effect","concentr","on","the","stori","and","you","will","see","that","there","enough","room","on","a","mail","stamp","to","write","it","timesbr","br","the","main","interest","of","thi","film","be","the","landscap","a","movi","for","youngster","let","sai","up","to","year","old"],"filtered":["wai","corridor","time","success","stori","becaus","movi","reach","goal","see","thousand","fail","make","laughbr","br","le","visiteur","success","becaus","subject","origin","wai","consid","time","travel","forget","zemecki","back","futur","come","old","franc","middleag","knight","nearli","barbar","wai","life","full","pride","funni","thank","ancient","word","us","montmirail","sometim","disgust","keep","hi","honor","come","sequelbr","br","nobodi","forese","tremend","success","le","visiteur","us","movi","expert","realiz","corridor","time","make","moneybr","br","gener","stori","begin","end","le","visiteur","immedi","try","justifi","sequel","time","paradox","ne","tought","explan","us","try","get","back","jewelri","jacquouil","steal","rememb","thi","nice","red","shini","expens","car","bui","end","st","episod","think","find","monei","sell","jewelri","onli","mani","hole","poiré","try","avoid","failsbr","br","let","look","charact","montmirail","doe","chang","littl","much","bore","regard","frenegond","anoth","stori","valéri","lemerci","decid","compromis","thi","sequel","avoid","get","stick","bourgeois","role","muriel","robin","try","imit","wai","find","piti","nearli","feel","pain","poiré","doe","realiz","cast","humorist","enough","make","good","comedybr","br","forget","time","travel","digit","effect","concentr","stori","see","enough","room","mail","stamp","write","timesbr","br","main","interest","thi","film","landscap","movi","youngster","let","sai","year","old"],"filtered2":["wai","corridor","time","success","stori","becaus","reach","goal","see","thousand","fail","make","laughbr","le","visiteur","success","becaus","subject","origin","wai","consid","time","travel","forget","zemecki","back","futur","come","old","franc","middleag","knight","nearli","barbar","wai","life","full","pride","funni","thank","ancient","word","us","montmirail","sometim","disgust","keep","honor","come","sequelbr","nobodi","forese","tremend","success","le","visiteur","us","expert","realiz","corridor","time","make","moneybr","gener","stori","begin","end","le","visiteur","immedi","try","justifi","sequel","time","paradox","ne","tought","explan","us","try","get","back","jewelri","jacquouil","steal","rememb","nice","red","shini","expens","car","bui","end","st","think","find","monei","sell","jewelri","onli","mani","hole","poiré","try","avoid","failsbr","let","look","charact","montmirail","doe","chang","littl","bore","regard","frenegond","anoth","stori","valéri","lemerci","decid","compromis","sequel","avoid","get","stick","bourgeois","role","muriel","robin","try","imit","wai","find","piti","nearli","feel","pain","

{"value":"Woody Allen, when at his best, has one of the sharpest pens around. He can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else. However, when he's at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness. Unfortunately, \"Melinda and Melinda\" has this stench from opening to closing. The set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while. Four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help settle the argument, one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing (one a comic playwright, the other a dramatic playwright) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave. Now, when I first heard about this film, my understanding was that they tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) only changes by how you look at it. Now that would have been interesting. However, the stories only share one main element and a few side elements. They are entirely different stories with major plot differences. The drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self-parody. If this was the point, then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Will Farrell is obviously meant to be the stand-in for Woody, but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding Woody's stutters and hand-ticks. Woody is the best at being Woody. When someone else tries, they're not playing a character, they are modeling a recognizable actor. This type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story.<br /><br />My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than I walked in.

{"value":"I'm sorry to report that I have seen this film several times. When it bombed at the box office, it was repeated nightly for about a month on HBO. And I watched it over and over because television in general is so bad--or was at that time. I no longer watch, so it might be wonderful now--like Samuel L Jackson says about swine, \"It might taste like sweet potato pie, but I'll never know because I wouldn't eat the filthy mfer.\" Let's see. Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out right after Life of Bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from. The few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth. There's one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both of them dragged out and dessicated, dying of thirst. Then they meet like old acquaintances who didn't really know each other very well, promise to do lunch. It could have been funny.<br /><br />But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full King Tut regalia. He must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release, they overdubbed his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or it might have been Jimmy Walker--who knows? Who cares. They managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, very unfunny, very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that just won't flush, no matter how many times you try, so you leave it there for someone else to deal with.<br /><br />Well that's my review. If you rent this movie (DON'T BUY IT, WHATEVER YOU DO!) prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of Corona.<br /><br />Now that they've remade the Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably high on the list for remakes. Maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time.","finished_norm":["i","be","sorri","to","report","that","i","have","see","thi","film","sever","time","when","it","bomb","at","the","box","offic","it","be","repeat","nightli","for","about","a","month","on","hbo","and","i","watch","it","over","and","over","becaus","televis","in","gener","be","so","bador","be","at","that","time","i","no","long","watch","so","it","mai","be","wonder","nowlik","samuel","l","jackson","sai","about","swine","it","mai","tast","like","sweet","potato","pie","but","i","will","never","know","becaus","i","would","not","eat","the","filthi","mfer","let","see","dudlei","plai","arthur","wander","in","the","desert","alwai","a","few","step","behind","mose","it","come","out","right","after","life","of","bryan","so","you","can","guess","where","the","inspir","for","thi","come","from","the","few","mildli","funni","bit","go","on","wai","too","long","until","you","just","close","your","ey","and","grit","your","tooth","there","on","scene","where","arthur","and","dom","deluis","meet","in","the","desert","both","of","them","drag","out","and","dessic","dye","of","thirst","then","thei","meet","like","old","acquaint","who","do","not","realli","know","each","other","veri","good","promis","to","do","lunch","it","can","have","be","funnybr","br","but","the","scene","that","i","rememb","much","clearli","be","a","meet","with","pharaoh","in","which","pharaoh","be","a","black","street","kid","do","up","in","full","king","tut","regal","he","must","have","read","the","line","straight","becaus","at","some","point","befor","the","releas","thei","overdub","hi","scene","with","the","hollywood","equival","of","black","street","lingo","voic","by","a","jimmi","walker","wannab","kid","dynowannab","or","it","mai","have","be","jimmi","walkerwho","know","who","care","thei","manag","to","turn","a","essenti","bore","scene","into","a","veri","racist","veri","unfunni","veri","long","piec","of","excrem","on","of","that","legendari","thing","that","just","wo","not","flush","no","matt","how","mani","time","you","try","so","you","leav","it","there","for","someon","els","to","deal","withbr","br","good","that","my","review","if","you","rend","thi","movi","don","t","bui","it","whatev","you","do","prepar","yourself","with","a","bottl","of","tequila","and","a","six","pack","of","coronabr","br","now","that","thei","have","remak","the","poseiden","adventur","thi","on","be","probabl","high","on","the","list","for","remak","mayb","thei","will","hire","a","comedi","writer","thi","time"],"filtered":["sorri","report","see","thi","film","sever","time","bomb","box","offic","repeat","nightli","month","hbo","watch","becaus","televis","gener","bador","time","long","watch","mai","wonder","nowlik","samuel","l","jackson","sai","swine","mai","tast","like","sweet","potato","pie","never","know","becaus","eat","filthi","mfer","let","see","dudlei","plai","arthur","wander","desert","alwai","step","behind","mose","come","right","life","bryan","guess","inspir","thi","come","mildli","funni","bit","go","wai","long","close","ey","grit","tooth","scene","arthur","dom","deluis","meet","desert","drag","dessic","dye","thirst","thei","meet","like","old","acquaint","realli","know","veri","good","promis","lunch","funnybr","br","scene","rememb","much","clearli","meet","pharaoh","pharaoh","black","street","kid","full","king","tut","regal","must","read","line","straight","becaus","point","befor","releas","thei","overdub","hi","scene","hollywood","equival","black","street","lingo","voic","jimmi","walker","wannab","kid","dynowannab","mai","jimmi","walkerwho","know","care","thei","manag","turn","essenti","bore","scene","veri","racist","veri","unfunni","veri","long","piec","excrem","legendari","thing","wo","flush","matt","mani","time","try","leav","someon","els","deal","withbr","br","good","review","rend","thi","movi","bui","whatev","prepar","bottl","tequila","six","pack","coronabr","br","thei","remak","poseiden","adventur","thi","probabl","high","list","remak","mayb","thei","hire","comedi","writer","thi","time"],"filtered2":["sorri","report","see","sever","time","bomb","box","offic","repeat","nightli","month","hbo","watch","becaus","televis","gener","bador","time","long","watch","mai","wonder","nowlik","samuel","l","jackson","swine","mai","tast","like","sweet","potato","pie","never","know","becaus","eat","filthi","mfer","let","see","dudlei","plai","arthur","wander","desert","alwai","step","behind","mose","come","right","life","bryan","guess","inspir","come","mildli","funni","bit","go","wai","long","close","ey","grit","tooth","scene","arthur","dom","deluis","meet","desert","drag","dessic","dye","thirst","meet","like","old","acquaint","realli","know","veri","good","promis","lunch","funnybr","scene","rememb","clearli","meet","pharaoh","pharaoh","black","street","kid","full","king","tut","regal","must","read","line","straight","becaus","point","befor","releas","overdub","scene","hollywood","equival","black","street","lingo","voic","jimmi","walker","wannab","kid","dynowannab",

{"value":"In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands. But it fails at making them laugh...<br /><br />Les Visiteurs has had its success, because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis's Back to the future, here comes the old France, the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel.<br /><br />Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.<br /><br />The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation : it's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid... and fails.<br /><br />Let's have a look at the characters : Montmirail doesn't change, he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy.<br /><br />Forget about the time travels, about the digital effects, concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.<br /><br />The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters, let's say up to 13 years old.","finished_norm":["in","a","wai","corridor","of","time","be","a","success","stori","becaus","the","movi","reach","it","goal","be","see","by","thousand","but","it","fail","at","make","them","laughbr","br","le","visiteur","have","have","it","success","becaus","the","subject","be","a","origin","wai","of","consid","the","time","travel","forget","about","zemecki","back","to","the","futur","here","come","the","old","franc","the","middleag","knight","and","it","nearli","barbar","wai","of","life","full","of","pride","funni","thank","to","the","ancient","word","he","us","montmirail","can","sometim","be","disgust","but","he","keep","hi","honor","then","come","the","sequelbr","br","nobodi","have","forese","the","tremend","success","of","le","visiteur","the","and","it","no","us","be","a","movi","expert","to","realiz","that","the","corridor","of","time","have","be","make","for","moneybr","br","the","gener","stori","begin","after","the","end","of","le","visiteur","and","immedi","try","to","justifi","the","sequel","with","a","time","paradox","that","would","have","ne","some","tought","explan","it","no","us","try","to","get","back","the","jewelri","jacquouil","have","steal","do","not","you","rememb","thi","nice","red","shini","and","expens","car","he","bui","at","the","end","of","the","st","episod","where","do","you","think","he","find","the","monei","sell","the","jewelri","and","that","onli","on","of","mani","hole","poiré","try","to","avoid","and","failsbr","br","let","have","a","look","at","the","charact","montmirail","doe","not","chang","he","just","a","littl","much","bore","regard","frenegond","that","anoth","stori","valéri","lemerci","decid","not","to","compromis","herself","in","thi","sequel","to","avoid","get","stick","in","the","bourgeois","role","and","muriel","robin","try","to","imit","her","in","a","wai","that","i","find","so","piti","i","nearli","feel","pain","for","her","and","poiré","doe","not","realiz","that","a","cast","of","humorist","be","not","enough","to","make","a","good","comedybr","br","forget","about","the","time","travel","about","the","digit","effect","concentr","on","the","stori","and","you","will","see","that","there","enough","room","on","a","mail","stamp","to","write","it","timesbr","br","the","main","interest","of","thi","film","be","the","landscap","a","movi","for","youngster","let","sai","up","to","year","old"],"filtered":["wai","corridor","time","success","stori","becaus","movi","reach","goal","see","thousand","fail","make","laughbr","br","le","visiteur","success","becaus","subject","origin","wai","consid","time","travel","forget","zemecki","back","futur","come","old","franc","middleag","knight","nearli","barbar","wai","life","full","pride","funni","thank","ancient","word","us","montmirail","sometim","disgust","keep","hi","honor","come","sequelbr","br","nobodi","forese","tremend","success","le","visiteur","us","movi","expert","realiz","corridor","time","make","moneybr","br","gener","stori","begin","end","le","visiteur","immedi","try","justifi","sequel","time","paradox","ne","tought","explan","us","try","get","back","jewelri","jacquouil","steal","rememb","thi","nice","red","shini","expens","car","bui","end","st","episod","think","find","monei","sell","jewelri","onli","mani","hole","poiré","try","avoid","failsbr","br","let","look","charact","montmirail","doe","chang","littl","much","bore","regard","frenegond","anoth","stori","valéri","lemerci","decid","compromis","thi","sequel","avoid","get","stick","bourgeois","role","muriel","robin","try","imit","wai","find","piti","nearli","feel","pain","poiré","doe","realiz","cast","humorist","enough","make","good","comedybr","br","forget","time","travel","digit","effect","concentr","stori","see","enough","room","mail","stamp","write","timesbr","br","main","interest","thi","film","landscap","movi","youngster","let","sai","year","old"],"filtered2":["wai","corridor","time","success","stori","becaus","reach","goal","see","thousand","fail","make","laughbr","le","visiteur","success","becaus","subject","origin","wai","consid","time","travel","forget","zemecki","back","futur","come","old","franc","middleag","knight","nearli","barbar","wai","life","full","pride","funni","thank","ancient","word","us","montmirail","sometim","disgust","keep","honor","come","sequelbr","nobodi","forese","tremend","success","le","visiteur","us","expert","realiz","corridor","time","make","moneybr","gener","stori","begin","end","le","visiteur","immedi","try","justifi","sequel","time","paradox","ne","tought","explan","us","try","get","back","jewelri","jacquouil","steal","rememb","nice","red","shini","expens","car","bui","end","st","think","find","monei","sell","jewelri","onli","mani","hole","poiré","try","avoid","failsbr","let","look","charact","montmirail","doe","chang","littl","bore","regard","frenegond","anoth","stori","valéri","lemerci","decid","compromis","sequel","avoid","get","stick","bourgeois","role","muriel","robin","try","imit","wai","find","piti","nearli","feel","pain","

{"value":"This is the first Guinea Pig film from Japan and this is the sickest, in my opinion. A bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! They are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.<br /><br />The scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! And how stupid this looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. Other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the ripping off of fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that. Very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish Guinea Pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible.<br /><br />Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is. This is still (of course) faked s(n/t)uff, the only difference to genuine \"snuff film\" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film. I cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive. They who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it. I watched this as a curiosity (as the other parts in the series) and now I know how insignificant trash these are. They work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I've seen and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film I've seen. So these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they

{"value":"A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. John Livien's suicida mother's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man. I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another \"crazy\" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer , Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.","finished_norm":["a","great","opportun","for","and","indi","director","to","make","a","interest","film","about","a","rock","musician","on","the","brink","of","stardom","it","can","have","be","a","decent","film","if","it","would","have","deal","with","john","livien","traumat","past","and","how","it","be","tortur","hi","psych","instead","it","be","a","ridicul","attempt","to","identifi","john","livien","life","with","john","lennon","john","livien","suicida","mother","hero","be","john","lennon","and","she","wish","for","him","to","becom","a","power","and","prolif","a","lennon","himself","instead","of","focu","on","john","lennon","music","brillianc","and","hi","wonder","abil","to","bare","himself","for","other","to","learn","someth","about","their","own","life","it","show","lennon","legaci","to","be","that","of","a","confus","drug","addict","soul","who","should","look","upon","a","a","god","instead","a","man","i","be","a","huge","john","lennon","fan","and","thi","movi","remind","me","of","anoth","crazi","person","obsess","with","lennon","lennon","killer","mark","david","chapman","lennon","be","a","man","who","be","brutal","murder","by","someon","els","who","have","a","ident","crisi","with","lennon","do","we","ne","to","be","remind","of","that","john","lennon","give","so","much","to","the","world","with","hi","music","and","honesti","and","i","be","repuls","to","see","anoth","disturb","person","a","the","main","charact","in","thi","movi","obsess","by","lennon","and","not","show","hi","beauti","contribut","to","the","world","yoko","ono","gracious","honor","john","lennon","memorybi","make","the","memori","in","central","park","to","give","hi","fan","a","chanc","to","pai","their","respect","and","rememb","john","instead","the","director","of","thi","movi","choos","to","us","that","site","to","have","the","killer","attempt","to","commit","suicid","i","find","thi","so","disturb","and","disrespect","to","lennon","memori","he","be","a","man","of","peac","who","die","a","brutal","senseless","death","and","to","see","such","violenc","near","thi","site","feel","like","a","revisit","a","terribl","wind","for","ani","lennon","fan","it","ruin","the","movi","complet","for","me","it","can","have","be","a","decent","movi","but","it","leav","me","with","a","bitter","tast","in","my","mouth","let","john","lennon","and","hi","famili","rest","in","peac","and","not","be","remind","of","hi","viciou","murder","by","thi","irrespons","movi"],"filtered":["great","opportun","indi","director","make","interest","film","rock","musician","brink","stardom","decent","film","deal","john","livien","traumat","past","tortur","hi","psych","instead","ridicul","attempt","identifi","john","livien","life","john","lennon","john","livien","suicida","mother","hero","john","lennon","wish","becom","power","prolif","lennon","instead","focu","john","lennon","music","brillianc","hi","wonder","abil","bare","learn","someth","life","show","lennon","legaci","confus","drug","addict","soul","look","upon","god","instead","man","huge","john","lennon","fan","thi","movi","remind","anoth","crazi","person","obsess","lennon","lennon","killer","mark","david","chapman","lennon","man","brutal","murder","someon","els","ident","crisi","lennon","ne","remind","john","lennon","give","much","world","hi","music","honesti","repuls","see","anoth","disturb","person","main","charact","thi","movi","obsess","lennon","show","hi","beauti","contribut","world","yoko","ono","gracious","honor","john","lennon","memorybi","make","memori","central","park","give","hi","fan","chanc","pai","respect","rememb","john","instead","director","thi","movi","choos","us","site","killer","attempt","commit","suicid","find","thi","disturb","disrespect","lennon","memori","man","peac","die","brutal","senseless","death","see","violenc","near","thi","site","feel","like","revisit","terribl","wind","ani","lennon","fan","ruin","movi","complet","decent","movi","leav","bitter","tast","mouth","let","john","lennon","hi","famili","rest","peac","remind","hi","viciou","murder","thi","irrespons","movi"],"filtered2":["great","opportun","indi","director","make","interest","rock","musician","brink","stardom","decent","deal","john","livien","traumat","past","tortur","psych","instead","ridicul","attempt","identifi","john","livien","life","john","lennon","john","livien","suicida","mother","hero","john","lennon","wish","becom","power","prolif","lennon","instead","focu","john","lennon","music","brillianc","wonder","abil","bare","learn","someth","life","show","lennon","legaci","confus","drug","addict","soul","look","upon","god","instead","man","huge","john","lennon","fan","remind","anoth","crazi","person","obsess","lennon","lennon","killer","mark","david","chapman","lennon","man","brutal","murder","someon","els","ident","crisi","lennon","ne","remind","john","lennon","give","world","music","honesti","repuls","see","anoth","disturb","person","main","charact","obsess","lennon","show","beauti","contribut","world","yoko","ono","gracious"

{"value":"Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-for-TV but isn't. Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things), it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things. Like... remembering to lock your front door when you go out. Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower.<br /><br />Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a cop with personal issues (don't they all). Together with her new partner (a wet-looking Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling).<br /><br />The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless. Bullock, though she is very nice to look at, is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield (actually, he'd be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as the conniving sneering suspects, acquit themselves adequately. As if dodgy leads weren't bad enough, a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run.<br /><br />\"Murder By Numbers\" has absolutely nothing going for it, even a pointless nude scene by Bullock wouldn't redeem it. Well, just a little but still not enough to save it. Forgettable, predictable and redundant - this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward.

{"value":"The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.<br /><br />This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the \"whole Earth\" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.<br /><br />I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.<br /><br />Ah, a response: \"Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I'd say is a charming, but weak and gullible argument. What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U.S. government that the moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. Things are nearly never quite what they seem.. Just watch the movie, and I dear say you'll see things a bit different than before.\"<br /><br />First off, weather data doesn't come from NASA, it comes for met agencies around the world. Second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. Third, far from being \"packed with irrefutable evidence\", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked. Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his

{"value":"Italian horror/suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know he must have really loved his wife, because he brings them to his home - a huge, rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them, whips them, and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film. Anyway, soon, under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera, De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally, well, just look at the title if you are still curious. Also, family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course, there is a whole explanation as to why/how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldn't be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding, the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry, red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; however, which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons.

{"value":"I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian based. The director had a good idea/intentions when making this movie but it could have been better. I can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life. However, I didn't understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him. They weren't understanding at all and they used God as a reason to explain their behaviors. The main character, nor anyone else didn't know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with. His friends were suppose to be Christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not. So many times we do things in life where we don't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him. The ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend, when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name, address and phone number...she seemed to be the stalker!. she didn't seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself. God is love...and I think God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like God doesn't care about true love...only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with. We all make mistakes...it's all about what steps you take to make amends. Like I said the movie had potential but I was tired of the one-sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so-called...well-meaning friends. This movie didn't hold true to the Christian belief of love but i give it a C for its effort.","finished_norm":["i","be","interest","in","see","thi","movi","becaus","i","know","it","be","christian","base","the","director","have","a","good","ideaintent","when","make","thi","movi","but","it","can","have","be","well","i","can","understand","why","someon","would","still","have","feel","for","who","thei","believ","be","the","great","love","of","their","life","howev","i","do","not","understand","why","the","director","make","hi","friend","so","insensit","mean","and","rude","the","main","charact","keep","apolog","to","hi","friend","when","thei","be","the","on","mean","to","him","thei","be","not","understand","at","all","and","thei","us","god","a","a","reason","to","explain","their","behavior","the","main","charact","nor","anyon","els","do","not","know","if","the","exgirlfriend","be","divorc","still","marri","etc","but","thei","be","against","him","resolv","old","feel","that","ne","to","be","deal","with","hi","friend","be","suppos","to","be","christian","and","should","have","be","portrai","a","be","support","whether","thei","agre","with","hi","decis","or","not","so","mani","time","we","do","thing","in","life","where","we","do","not","apolog","to","that","we","have","hurt","in","the","past","and","when","he","be","try","to","do","thi","thei","be","all","against","him","the","iron","part","be","hi","new","femal","friend","accus","him","of","have","stalk","behavior","for","simpli","look","up","a","old","friend","when","she","do","a","realli","odd","thing","to","get","a","hold","of","hi","name","address","and","phone","numbersh","seem","to","be","the","stalker","she","do","not","seem","like","a","friend","at","all","but","be","onli","look","out","for","herself","god","be","loveand","i","think","god","want","peopl","to","be","with","the","person","thei","be","mean","to","be","with","and","i","feel","the","movi","do","a","terribl","injustic","by","make","it","seem","like","god","doe","not","care","about","true","loveonli","that","you","stai","with","someon","you","make","a","bad","choic","with","we","all","make","mistakesit","all","about","what","step","you","take","to","make","amend","like","i","sai","the","movi","have","potenti","but","i","be","tire","of","the","onesid","point","of","view","be","constantli","repeat","and","jam","down","the","viewer","throat","by","hi","socalledwellmean","friend","thi","movi","do","not","hold","true","to","the","christian","belief","of","love","but","i","give","it","a","c","for","it","effort"],"filtered":["interest","see","thi","movi","becaus","know","christian","base","director","good","ideaintent","make","thi","movi","well","understand","someon","still","feel","thei","believ","great","love","life","howev","understand","director","make","hi","friend","insensit","mean","rude","main","charact","keep","apolog","hi","friend","thei","mean","thei","understand","thei","us","god","reason","explain","behavior","main","charact","anyon","els","know","exgirlfriend","divorc","still","marri","etc","thei","resolv","old","feel","ne","deal","hi","friend","suppos","christian","portrai","support","whether","thei","agre","hi","decis","mani","time","thing","life","apolog","hurt","past","try","thi","thei","iron","part","hi","new","femal","friend","accus","stalk","behavior","simpli","look","old","friend","realli","odd","thing","get","hold","hi","name","address","phone","numbersh","seem","stalker","seem","like","friend","onli","look","god","loveand","think","god","want","peopl","person","thei","mean","feel","movi","terribl","injustic","make","seem","like","god","doe","care","true","loveonli","stai","someon","make","bad","choic","make","mistakesit","step","take","make","amend","like","sai","movi","potenti","tire","onesid","point","view","constantli","repeat","jam","viewer","throat","hi","socalledwellmean","friend","thi","movi","hold","true","christian","belief","love","give","c","effort"],"filtered2":["interest","see","becaus","know","christian","base","director","good","ideaintent","make","well","understand","someon","still","feel","believ","great","love","life","howev","understand","director","make","friend","insensit","mean","rude","main","charact","keep","apolog","friend","mean","understand","us","god","reason","explain","behavior","main","charact","anyon","els","know","exgirlfriend","divorc","still","marri","etc","resolv","old","feel","ne","deal","friend","suppos","christian","portrai","support","whether","agre","decis","mani","time","thing","life","apolog","hurt","past","try","iron","part","new","femal","friend","accus","stalk","behavior","simpli","look","old","friend","realli","odd","thing","get","hold","name","address","phone","numbersh","seem","stalker","seem","like","friend","onli","look","god","loveand","think","god","want","peopl","person","mean","feel","terribl","injustic","make","seem","like","god","doe","care","true","loveonli","stai","someon","make","bad","choic","make","mistakesit","step","take","make","amend","like","potenti","tire","onesid","point","view","constantli","repea

{"value":"Couldn't go to sleep the other night. So I got up, flipped on the tube & this movie was on.<br /><br />Film makers bit off more than they could chew. Just as ambitious in scope as \"Forrest Gump\" was. But Gump read like an fairy-tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era. TGMB just relies on tired clichés to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to ham it up. Every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's archetype.<br /><br />Take how we're introduced to Finnegan: Hugging his black maid & receiving a framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about heavy-handed. Why not just give him a t-shirt saying \"I Heart Black People\"?<br /><br />Sunshine: \"Isn't free love groovay, man? Oh no, I didn't have my period.\" <br /><br />Mary Beth: \"I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA.\" Uh, excuse me? There was nothing square about LA in the 60s. Rather than take the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat whine about not going there.<br /><br />Can't even remember the black kid's name. He was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are.<br /><br />Thing is, period pieces don't have to be this cheesy. Take \"Dazed & Confused.\" Look how we're introduced to the football hero, Randall Floyd. We don't first see him on the football field. In fact, we never see him play football. We're introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.<br /><br />In \"Dazed\" feminism isn't a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings. But real life is like that.<br /><br />Some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. I agree! Which is why I feel so disappointed by this piece of Baby-Boomer

{"value":"I will admit that I did not give this movie much of a chance. I decided pretty early on that this just wasn't my kind of movie.<br /><br />For the most part, it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography. The scenes of early 70's Manhattan look very good, as does the lead actress. It is a very crisp black and white, which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell. The disjointed editing is VERY late-60's, somewhere between surrealism and new wave. The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation.<br /><br />The film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with. As she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs. The movie seems to be meant as an off-the-wall, irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde feel. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies, you would be very excited to discover The Telephone Book.<br /><br />Some problems I had: Near the end of the movie, one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes-brutal to sit through. Also, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found gross and juvenile that serves as the film's climax. I did laugh out loud four or five times, and I liked the ending (minus the flat-out disgusting animation). And when the film switched to color for the final phone-booth-at-night sequence, I actually liked the way it looked even better. It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt like I could have really liked it if it been a little different. But this is what the filmmakers gave us. It is obscure, artsy, and way left of the dial, but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own. I didn't find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and

{"value":"Okay, what the hell kind of TRASH have I been watching now? \"The Witches' Mountain\" has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane Spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet, at the same time, it's also strangely compelling. There's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt there ever was a script to work with, but somehow I couldn't turn it off. The scratching your head with confusion starts right away, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat. So you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces? Heck no, because after this intro, the girl and her wickedness simply aren't mentioned anymore. Then cut to a guy, with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way. When she asks him to spend his vacation with her, he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment! Great move. The movie finally starts now, as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks. Though not before he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographs her topless! Throughout their journey, all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, car jacking witches? Apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers. That's as close as I get describing the plot, but there's a good chance I'm way off More important here is the atmosphere! \"The Witches' Mountain\" is occasionally very creepy, with its spooky music and interesting cinematography. The supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the type of European horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay.","finished_norm":["okai","what","the","hell","kind","of","trash","have","i","be","watch","now","the","witch","mountain","have","get","to","be","on","of","the","much","incoher","and","insan","spanish","exploit","flick","ever","and","yet","at","the","same","time","it","conjur","strang","compel","there","absolut","noth","that","make","sens","here","and","i","even","doubt","there","ever","be","a","script","to","work","with","but","somehow","i","can","not","turn","it","off","the","scratch","your","head","with","confus","start","right","awai","with","a","open","sequenc","about","a","angri","littl","girl","that","kill","her","mother","cat","so","you","think","thi","film","revolv","on","child","possess","by","evil","forc","heck","no","becaus","after","thi","intro","the","girl","and","her","wicked","simpli","be","not","mention","anymor","then","cut","to","a","gui","with","the","much","impress","trim","mustach","you","will","ever","see","who","break","up","with","hi","girlfriend","in","a","rather","unsubtl","wai","when","she","ask","him","to","spend","hi","vacat","with","her","he","promptli","phone","hi","employ","request","him","ani","typ","of","assign","great","move","the","movi","final","start","now","a","he","travel","to","a","isol","mountain","area","to","photograph","some","peak","though","not","befor","he","pick","up","a","new","girl","patti","shepard","and","photograph","her","topless","throughout","their","journei","all","kind","of","strang","event","occur","that","you","guess","it","be","never","explain","the","girl","wake","up","in","the","middl","of","the","forest","loud","petrifi","music","plai","everywher","and","someon","even","steal","the","jeep","realli","car","jack","witch","appar","a","coven","of","silent","witch","own","the","mountain","and","thei","practic","voodoo","on","trespass","that","a","close","a","i","get","describ","the","plot","but","there","a","good","chanc","i","be","wai","off","much","import","here","be","the","atmospher","the","witch","mountain","be","occasion","veri","creepi","with","it","spooki","music","and","interest","cinematographi","the","support","charact","all","look","uncanni","and","the","ravish","patti","shepard","plai","a","good","heroin","thi","be","the","typ","of","european","horror","film","that","can","have","be","legendari","if","onli","someon","have","bother","to","write","a","structur","screenplai"],"filtered":["okai","hell","kind","trash","watch","witch","mountain","get","much","incoher","insan","spanish","exploit","flick","ever","yet","time","conjur","strang","compel","absolut","noth","make","sens","even","doubt","ever","script","work","somehow","turn","scratch","head","confus","start","right","awai","open","sequenc","angri","littl","girl","kill","mother","cat","think","thi","film","revolv","child","possess","evil","forc","heck","becaus","thi","intro","girl","wicked","simpli","mention","anymor","cut","gui","much","impress","trim","mustach","ever","see","break","hi","girlfriend","rather","unsubtl","wai","ask","spend","hi","vacat","promptli","phone","hi","employ","request","ani","typ","assign","great","move","movi","final","start","travel","isol","mountain","area","photograph","peak","though","befor","pick","new","girl","patti","shepard","photograph","topless","throughout","journei","kind","strang","event","occur","guess","never","explain","girl","wake","middl","forest","loud","petrifi","music","plai","everywher","someon","even","steal","jeep","realli","car","jack","witch","appar","coven","silent","witch","mountain","thei","practic","voodoo","trespass","close","get","describ","plot","good","chanc","wai","much","import","atmospher","witch","mountain","occasion","veri","creepi","spooki","music","interest","cinematographi","support","charact","look","uncanni","ravish","patti","shepard","plai","good","heroin","thi","typ","european","horror","film","legendari","onli","someon","bother","write","structur","screenplai"],"filtered2":["okai","hell","kind","trash","watch","witch","mountain","get","incoher","insan","spanish","exploit","flick","ever","yet","time","conjur","strang","compel","absolut","noth","make","sens","even","doubt","ever","script","work","somehow","turn","scratch","head","confus","start","right","awai","open","sequenc","angri","littl","girl","kill","mother","cat","think","revolv","child","possess","evil","forc","heck","becaus","intro","girl","wicked","simpli","mention","anymor","cut","gui","impress","trim","mustach","ever","see","break","girlfriend","rather","unsubtl","wai","ask","spend","vacat","promptli","phone","employ","request","ani","typ","assign","great","move","final","start","travel","isol","mountain","area","photograph","peak","though","befor","pick","new","girl","patti","shepard","photograph","topless","throughout","journei","kind","strang","event","occur","guess","never","explain","girl","wake","middl","forest","loud","petrifi","music","plai","everywher","someon","even","steal","jeep","realli","car","jack","witch","appar","coven","s

{"value":"There's a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission. <br /><br />'How about aiming for something like 24 or The West Wing?' says one of them, but they all agree it would be too expensive, and cheap TV is less likely to harm the station if it flops. <br /><br />'Well, how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom?' offers another and is fired on the spot. 'Don't you know good writers cost lots of money!' the big chief barks. 'That's why we invented reality TV.'<br /><br />'We could do yet another crime drama...' suggests a man in a bland suit. 'I'm listening...' the boss replies, suddenly interested. 'People like CSI, so let's do another copy of that,' Blandman adds.<br /><br />'But there are already far too many CSI clones out there, what can we do to make ours stand out?' a naive junior enquires and is sacked instantly. 'Stand out! If we do that people may be confused! Let's give them more of what they already like!' the big chief screams. <br /><br />'Let's just add more violence and make it really grisly, we are Fox after all,' another suit suggests to a hearty reply of 'now you're getting it', from the big chief. 'We could make them the Deviant Crimes Unit,' he goes on to add, clearly on a roll. <br /><br />'By Jove, he's got it!' the big chief laughs, 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen.' 'Well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts,' Blandman points out. <br /><br />'Then it's settled, we just need a name,' the big chief announces.

{"value":"Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast tries to imagine (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way), what actually happened between Beauty and the Beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie. I would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticizing of the catholic Religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.<br /><br />The long (way too long) scene between an Aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable I've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive...well anatomy, is set to the clavichord music of Scarlatti and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic picture, it is too verbose; for an art movie - it's got too many jaw-dropping scenes of sheer madness and I'd say an abrupt ending. IMO, the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama. As a parody of art house/horror/erotica, it is funny and certainly original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of the curious Beauties and the lustful Beasts certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the children.

{"value":"The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.Yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are.I suppose that the A-List actors (Liam Neeson,Catherine Zeta Jones,Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot,ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all.Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.Lily Taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all.The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine.There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else.I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.","finished_norm":["the","haunt","be","yet","anoth","bad","horror","remak","with","phoni","overdo","special","effect","and","a","big","cast","of","on","screen","favorit","and","have","no","redeem","qualiti","whatsoev","except","mayb","for","the","cinematographyy","remak","be","not","all","bad","but","remak","direct","by","jion","da","bont","definit","arei","suppos","that","the","alist","actor","liam","neesoncatherin","zeta","jonesowen","wilsonar","there","to","distract","u","from","the","bore","plotridicul","special","effect","and","terribl","attempt","at","scare","it","audienc","howev","thi","be","a","movi","not","a","tabloid","magazin","we","do","not","care","whose","in","it","we","care","about","the","charact","and","stori","two","thing","thi","film","missedth","storylin","be","like","take","the","classic","novel","the","haunt","of","hill","hous","and","rip","out","four","chapter","and","then","us","whatev","leav","for","the","film","it","be","so","bore","and","a","lot","of","it","be","unexplainedth","charact","be","pretti","thin","and","while","the","act","be","good","you","do","not","realli","care","about","ani","of","the","charact","at","alllili","taylor","give","a","horrend","perform","and","sound","like","she","year","old","when","deliv","her","line","not","to","mention","what","a","horribl","screamer","she","islili","taylor","be","not","make","for","the","horror","genr","at","allth","ghost","be","stupid","and","cheesi","thei","look","like","a","bunch","of","casper","the","friendli","ghost","and","the","ghost","of","hugh","cain","look","like","a","fat","gui","dress","a","the","grim","reaper","for","halloween","with","a","smoke","machinether","be","thi","creatur","on","the","roof","of","on","of","the","room","that","be","a","giant","purpl","mouth","and","it","not","even","funni","unintention","just","plain","sadth","hous","be","pretti","and","good","design","that","be","probabl","the","onli","posit","thing","about","thi","movi","it","look","nice","but","that","doe","not","save","it","from","it","brutal","everyth","elsei","can","honestli","sai","i","feel","like","i","be","wast","my","time","watch","the","haunt","on","tv","for","no","price","so","i","would","have","be","even","much","pi","if","i","have","pai","to","see","it","but","luckili","it","be","on","scream","channeloveral","the","haunt","be","a","bore","remak","that","try","to","overwhelm","you","with","bad","special","effect","a","poor","attempt","at","horror"],"filtered":["haunt","yet","anoth","bad","horror","remak","phoni","overdo","special","effect","big","cast","screen","favorit","redeem","qualiti","whatsoev","except","mayb","cinematographyy","remak","bad","remak","direct","jion","da","bont","definit","arei","suppos","alist","actor","liam","neesoncatherin","zeta","jonesowen","wilsonar","distract","u","bore","plotridicul","special","effect","terribl","attempt","scare","audienc","howev","thi","movi","tabloid","magazin","care","whose","care","charact","stori","two","thing","thi","film","missedth","storylin","like","take","classic","novel","haunt","hill","hous","rip","four","chapter","us","whatev","leav","film","bore","lot","unexplainedth","charact","pretti","thin","act","good","realli","care","ani","charact","alllili","taylor","give","horrend","perform","sound","like","year","old","deliv","line","mention","horribl","screamer","islili","taylor","make","horror","genr","allth","ghost","stupid","cheesi","thei","look","like","bunch","casper","friendli","ghost","ghost","hugh","cain","look","like","fat","gui","dress","grim","reaper","halloween","smoke","machinether","thi","creatur","roof","room","giant","purpl","mouth","even","funni","unintention","plain","sadth","hous","pretti","good","design","probabl","onli","posit","thing","thi","movi","look","nice","doe","save","brutal","everyth","elsei","honestli","sai","feel","like","wast","time","watch","haunt","tv","price","even","much","pi","pai","see","luckili","scream","channeloveral","haunt","bore","remak","try","overwhelm","bad","special","effect","poor","attempt","horror"],"filtered2":["haunt","yet","anoth","bad","horror","remak","phoni","overdo","special","effect","big","cast","screen","favorit","redeem","qualiti","whatsoev","except","mayb","cinematographyy","remak","bad","remak","direct","jion","da","bont","definit","arei","suppos","alist","actor","liam","neesoncatherin","zeta","jonesowen","wilsonar","distract","u","bore","plotridicul","special","effect","terribl","attempt","scare","audienc","howev","tabloid","magazin","care","whose","care","charact","stori","two","thing","missedth","storylin","like","take","classic","novel","haunt","hill","hous","rip","four","chapter","us","whatev","leav","bore","lot","unexplainedth","charact","pretti","thin","act","good","realli","care","ani","charact","alllili","taylor","give","horrend","perform","sound","like","year","old","deliv","line","mention","horribl","screamer","islili","taylor","make","horror","genr","allth","ghost","stupid","cheesi","look","like",

{"value":"I sometimes enjoy really lousy movies....those that occasionally result when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. Movies like \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\", \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", \"Manos-Hands of Fate\", and \"Heavens Gate\", etc.<br /><br />So, when I heard that this movie, \"Rachel's Attic\", was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade, naturally I just HAD to see it.<br /><br />Boy, do I regret that decision. This movie is beyond bad....it is SO bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie. The acting, filming, script, etc. are even worse than a low budget porno film: the sound is utterly horrible, the \"plot\" is completely incomprehensible, the \"acting\" is laughable....it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money. At least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a \"mad hatter's\" tea party.<br /><br />The lighting is non-existent...many \"scenes\" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as well. The \"writer-director\" (I use the terms loosely), David Tybor, tries to get kinky with bondage scenes...but the results would be laughable, if they weren't so pathetic. There is some nudity, but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film.<br /><br />For the love of god, avoid this train wreck. I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as I claim it to be....but trust me on this....it's even worse than I have said, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and expense, if you waste your money on a purchase or rental).","finished_norm":["i","sometim","enjoi","realli","lousi","moviesthos","that","occasion","result","when","peopl","even","talent","peopl","get","togeth","with","good","intent","to","produc","a","movi","and","for","whatev","reason","it","turn","out","to","be","a","disast","movi","like","attack","of","the","killer","tomato","plan","from","outer","space","manoshand","of","fate","and","heaven","gate","etcbr","br","so","when","i","hear","that","thi","movi","rachel","attic","be","consid","by","mani","peopl","to","be","the","singl","wrong","film","of","the","decad","natur","i","just","have","to","see","itbr","br","boi","do","i","regret","that","decis","thi","movi","be","beyond","badit","be","so","bad","that","it","be","not","even","a","enjoy","a","the","usual","bad","movi","the","act","film","script","etc","be","even","wrong","than","a","low","budget","porno","film","the","sound","be","utterli","horribl","the","plot","be","complet","incomprehens","the","act","be","laughableit","be","a","complet","wast","of","everyon","time","and","monei","at","littl","the","porno","film","have","porno","to","break","up","the","monotoni","while","thi","ridicul","nightmar","have","a","gui","squeez","a","rotten","appl","and","a","mad","hatter","tea","partybr","br","the","light","be","nonexistentmani","scene","take","place","in","semi","or","complet","dark","which","be","probabl","just","a","good","the","writerdirector","i","us","the","term","loos","david","tybor","try","to","get","kinki","with","bondag","scenesbut","the","result","would","be","laughabl","if","thei","be","not","so","pathet","there","be","some","nuditi","but","it","be","of","such","abysm","qualiti","that","it","actual","act","a","a","sexual","suppress","i","can","go","on","forev","and","not","do","justic","to","all","the","flaw","and","shortcom","of","thi","truli","aw","wast","of","filmbr","br","for","the","love","of","god","avoid","thi","train","wreck","i","know","that","despit","or","perhap","becaus","of","my","neg","comment","you","mai","still","be","tempt","to","see","if","thi","piec","of","trash","be","realli","a","bad","a","i","claim","it","to","bebut","trust","me","on","thisit","even","wrong","than","i","have","sai","and","you","will","absolut","posit","regret","the","experi","and","expens","if","you","wast","your","monei","on","a","purchas","or","rental"],"filtered":["sometim","enjoi","realli","lousi","moviesthos","occasion","result","peopl","even","talent","peopl","get","togeth","good","intent","produc","movi","whatev","reason","turn","disast","movi","like","attack","killer","tomato","plan","outer","space","manoshand","fate","heaven","gate","etcbr","br","hear","thi","movi","rachel","attic","consid","mani","peopl","singl","wrong","film","decad","natur","see","itbr","br","boi","regret","decis","thi","movi","beyond","badit","bad","even","enjoy","usual","bad","movi","act","film","script","etc","even","wrong","low","budget","porno","film","sound","utterli","horribl","plot","complet","incomprehens","act","laughableit","complet","wast","everyon","time","monei","littl","porno","film","porno","break","monotoni","thi","ridicul","nightmar","gui","squeez","rotten","appl","mad","hatter","tea","partybr","br","light","nonexistentmani","scene","take","place","semi","complet","dark","probabl","good","writerdirector","us","term","loos","david","tybor","try","get","kinki","bondag","scenesbut","result","laughabl","thei","pathet","nuditi","abysm","qualiti","actual","act","sexual","suppress","go","forev","justic","flaw","shortcom","thi","truli","aw","wast","filmbr","br","love","god","avoid","thi","train","wreck","know","despit","perhap","becaus","neg","comment","mai","still","tempt","see","thi","piec","trash","realli","bad","claim","bebut","trust","thisit","even","wrong","sai","absolut","posit","regret","experi","expens","wast","monei","purchas","rental"],"filtered2":["sometim","enjoi","realli","lousi","moviesthos","occasion","result","peopl","even","talent","peopl","get","togeth","good","intent","produc","whatev","reason","turn","disast","like","attack","killer","tomato","plan","outer","space","manoshand","fate","heaven","gate","etcbr","hear","rachel","attic","consid","mani","peopl","singl","wrong","decad","natur","see","itbr","boi","regret","decis","beyond","badit","bad","even","enjoy","usual","bad","act","script","etc","even","wrong","low","budget","porno","sound","utterli","horribl","plot","complet","incomprehens","act","laughableit","complet","wast","everyon","time","monei","littl","porno","porno","break","monotoni","ridicul","nightmar","gui","squeez","rotten","appl","mad","hatter","tea","partybr","light","nonexistentmani","scene","take","place","semi","complet","dark","probabl","good","writerdirector","us","term","loos","david","tybor","try","get","kinki","bondag","scenesbut","result","laughabl","pathet","nuditi","abysm","qualiti","actual","act","sexual","suppress","go","forev","justic","flaw","shortcom","truli","aw","wast","filmbr","love","god","avoid","train","wreck"

{"value":"This motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies. The most famous disasters in their ouvre are \"Subspecies\", \"Seedpeople\" and \"Trancers\". None of these are recommended and neither is Doctor Mordrid, actually. Hyperactive director Charles Band did come to the right company for his film. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless. I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him. For every good movie, it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones. Anyways, the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers. One good one who's here since 150 years to protect the humans ( Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid ) and one wicked one called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I already forgot. Combs gets his instructions from mentor. That \"guy\" only exists of a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that is ! Every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of Special effects this movie has got. The whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it...I would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little, but nooooooo.... In some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example Jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called Edgar Allen) but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes...but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid maillot for that.","finished_norm":["thi","motion","pictur","come","straight","out","of","the","dark","dungeon","of","full","moon","entertain","thi","product","compani","gain","fame","and","fortun","dure","the","half","of","the","by","produc","terribli","bad","and","cheesi","horror","movi","the","much","famou","disast","in","their","ouvr","be","subspeci","seedpeopl","and","trancer","none","of","thi","be","recommend","and","neither","be","doctor","mordrid","actual","hyperact","director","charl","band","do","come","to","the","right","compani","for","hi","film","doctor","mordrid","be","amazingli","dumb","and","cheesi","and","almost","complet","humourless","i","onli","see","it","becaus","it","star","jeffrei","comb","i","learn","that","it","can","have","sever","disadvantag","if","you","re","a","fan","of","him","for","everi","good","movi","it","seem","like","he","have","make","inferior","on","anywai","the","stori","be","about","the","battl","between","ancient","sorcer","on","good","on","who","here","sinc","year","to","protect","the","human","jeffrei","a","drmordrid","and","on","wick","on","call","kabal","he","want","to","destroi","everi","form","of","human","life","for","some","reason","i","alreadi","forget","comb","get","hi","instruct","from","mentor","that","gui","onli","exist","of","a","pair","of","ey","in","space","veri","veri","cheesi","that","be","everi","onc","and","a","while","a","blind","lightflash","be","show","on","the","screen","but","that","about","the","onli","form","of","special","effect","thi","movi","have","get","the","whole","thing","be","just","a","piec","of","whine","and","nag","and","when","the","two","wizard","final","face","each","other","it","over","befor","you","know","iti","would","have","expect","for","the","wick","wizard","to","at","littl","fight","back","a","littl","but","nooooooo","in","some","scene","you","realli","can","detect","some","origin","and","creativ","like","for","exampl","jeffrei","lectur","about","the","influenc","of","the","moon","on","crimin","and","if","you","realli","pai","attent","you","mai","even","find","some","veri","small","but","nice","aspect","like","the","raven","which","be","call","edgar","allen","but","overal","it","a","terribl","wast","of","time","and","energi","i","be","a","big","fan","of","jeffrei","and","mayb","he","be","a","superhero","in","my","eyesbut","he","sure","doe","not","have","to","put","on","a","stupid","maillot","for","that"],"filtered":["thi","motion","pictur","come","straight","dark","dungeon","full","moon","entertain","thi","product","compani","gain","fame","fortun","dure","half","produc","terribli","bad","cheesi","horror","movi","much","famou","disast","ouvr","subspeci","seedpeopl","trancer","none","thi","recommend","neither","doctor","mordrid","actual","hyperact","director","charl","band","come","right","compani","hi","film","doctor","mordrid","amazingli","dumb","cheesi","almost","complet","humourless","onli","see","becaus","star","jeffrei","comb","learn","sever","disadvantag","re","fan","everi","good","movi","seem","like","make","inferior","anywai","stori","battl","ancient","sorcer","good","sinc","year","protect","human","jeffrei","drmordrid","wick","call","kabal","want","destroi","everi","form","human","life","reason","alreadi","forget","comb","get","hi","instruct","mentor","gui","onli","exist","pair","ey","space","veri","veri","cheesi","everi","onc","blind","lightflash","show","screen","onli","form","special","effect","thi","movi","get","whole","thing","piec","whine","nag","two","wizard","final","face","befor","know","iti","expect","wick","wizard","littl","fight","back","littl","nooooooo","scene","realli","detect","origin","creativ","like","exampl","jeffrei","lectur","influenc","moon","crimin","realli","pai","attent","mai","even","find","veri","small","nice","aspect","like","raven","call","edgar","allen","overal","terribl","wast","time","energi","big","fan","jeffrei","mayb","superhero","eyesbut","sure","doe","put","stupid","maillot"],"filtered2":["motion","pictur","come","straight","dark","dungeon","full","moon","entertain","product","compani","gain","fame","fortun","dure","half","produc","terribli","bad","cheesi","horror","famou","disast","ouvr","subspeci","seedpeopl","trancer","none","recommend","neither","doctor","mordrid","actual","hyperact","director","charl","band","come","right","compani","doctor","mordrid","amazingli","dumb","cheesi","almost","complet","humourless","onli","see","becaus","star","jeffrei","comb","learn","sever","disadvantag","re","fan","everi","good","seem","like","make","inferior","anywai","stori","battl","ancient","sorcer","good","sinc","year","protect","human","jeffrei","drmordrid","wick","call","kabal","want","destroi","everi","form","human","life","reason","alreadi","forget","comb","get","instruct","mentor","gui","onli","exist","pair","ey","space","veri","veri","cheesi","everi","onc","blind","lightflash","show","screen","onli","form","special","effect","get","whole","thing","piec","whine","nag","two","wizard","final",

{"value":"Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. By the last few years of the Thirties, swing-style big bands were recording the year's biggest popular hits. The Swing Era, also called the Big Band Era, has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the Swing Era began, Benny Goodman's engagement at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream America's youth. When Goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society-style dance music that his band had been playing, the youth in the audience went wild. That was the beginning, but, since radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts. In Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half or so after Goodman's Palomar Ballroom engagement). There are a few interesting musical moments here and there in Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and His Orchestra's \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" there isn't a lot to commend. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening \"Hooray for Hollywood\" parade and \"Let That Be a Lesson to You\" production number at the drive-in restaurant. The film is most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.","finished_norm":["hollywood","hotel","be","the","last","movi","music","that","busbi","berkelei","direct","for","warner","bro","hi","direct","styl","have","chang","or","evolv","to","the","point","that","thi","film","doe","not","contain","hi","signatur","overhead","shot","or","huge","product","number","with","thousand","of","extra","by","the","last","few","year","of","the","thirti","swingstyl","big","band","be","record","the","year","big","popular","hit","the","swing","era","conjur","call","the","big","band","era","have","be","date","various","from","to","or","to","although","it","be","imposs","to","exactli","pinpoint","the","moment","that","the","swing","era","begin","benni","goodman","engag","at","the","palomar","ballroom","in","lo","angel","in","the","late","summer","of","be","certainli","on","of","the","earli","indic","that","swing","be","enter","the","conscious","of","mainstream","america","youth","when","goodman","featur","hi","swing","repertoir","rather","than","the","societystyl","danc","music","that","hi","band","have","be","plai","the","youth","in","the","audienc","go","wild","that","be","the","begin","but","sinc","radio","live","concert","and","word","of","mouth","be","the","primari","method","avail","to","spread","the","phenomenon","it","take","some","time","befor","swing","make","enough","inroad","to","produc","big","hit","that","show","up","on","the","pop","chart","in","hollywood","hotel","the","appear","of","benni","goodman","and","hi","orchestra","and","raymond","paig","and","hi","orchestra","in","the","film","indic","that","the","film","industri","be","readi","to","capit","on","the","shift","in","music","tast","the","film","be","in","product","onli","a","year","and","a","half","or","so","after","goodman","palomar","ballroom","engag","there","be","a","few","interest","music","moment","here","and","there","in","hollywood","hotel","but","except","for","benni","goodman","and","hi","orchestra","sing","sing","sing","there","be","not","a","lot","to","commend","otherwis","the","much","interest","music","sequenc","be","the","open","hoorai","for","hollywood","parad","and","let","that","be","a","lesson","to","you","product","numb","at","the","drivein","restaur","the","film","be","much","interest","to","see","and","hear","benni","goodman","and","hi","orchestra","plai","and","dick","powel","and","franc","langford","sing"],"filtered":["hollywood","hotel","last","movi","music","busbi","berkelei","direct","warner","bro","hi","direct","styl","chang","evolv","point","thi","film","doe","contain","hi","signatur","overhead","shot","huge","product","number","thousand","extra","last","year","thirti","swingstyl","big","band","record","year","big","popular","hit","swing","era","conjur","call","big","band","era","date","various","although","imposs","exactli","pinpoint","moment","swing","era","begin","benni","goodman","engag","palomar","ballroom","lo","angel","late","summer","certainli","earli","indic","swing","enter","conscious","mainstream","america","youth","goodman","featur","hi","swing","repertoir","rather","societystyl","danc","music","hi","band","plai","youth","audienc","go","wild","begin","sinc","radio","live","concert","word","mouth","primari","method","avail","spread","phenomenon","take","time","befor","swing","make","enough","inroad","produc","big","hit","show","pop","chart","hollywood","hotel","appear","benni","goodman","hi","orchestra","raymond","paig","hi","orchestra","film","indic","film","industri","readi","capit","shift","music","tast","film","product","onli","year","half","goodman","palomar","ballroom","engag","interest","music","moment","hollywood","hotel","except","benni","goodman","hi","orchestra","sing","sing","sing","lot","commend","otherwis","much","interest","music","sequenc","open","hoorai","hollywood","parad","let","lesson","product","numb","drivein","restaur","film","much","interest","see","hear","benni","goodman","hi","orchestra","plai","dick","powel","franc","langford","sing"],"filtered2":["hollywood","hotel","last","music","busbi","berkelei","direct","warner","bro","direct","styl","chang","evolv","point","doe","contain","signatur","overhead","shot","huge","product","number","thousand","extra","last","year","thirti","swingstyl","big","band","record","year","big","popular","hit","swing","era","conjur","call","big","band","era","date","various","although","imposs","exactli","pinpoint","moment","swing","era","begin","benni","goodman","engag","palomar","ballroom","lo","angel","late","summer","certainli","earli","indic","swing","enter","conscious","mainstream","america","youth","goodman","featur","swing","repertoir","rather","societystyl","danc","music","band","plai","youth","audienc","go","wild","begin","sinc","radio","live","concert","word","mouth","primari","method","avail","spread","phenomenon","take","time","befor","swing","make","enough","inroad","produc","big","hit","show","pop","chart","hollywood","hotel","appear","benni","goodman","orchestra","raymond","paig","orchestra","indic"

{"value":"Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too! What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there isn't much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there's not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elope, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.<br /><br />Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic?

{"value":"Hoo boy, this was a real trial to get through. The DVD case has Tom Hanks' mug plastered on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it. He looks about forty on the box, however, the movie was made in 1982, so he still has his Bosom Buddies 'do and of course is about forty pounds lighter. The plot concerns a Dungeons and Dragons like game that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real. Chris Makepeace is a boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats. Ooh,look, he has a yellow hardhat on with a tuxedo! Now he's dressed like a WWI pilot! This was a truly awful movie but in a bad way. A bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually looks kind of hot. Murray Hamilton, the Mayor from Jaws, has a thankless roll as a cop. Wendy Crewson, is the love interest for Hanks and some blonde guy I have never seen before or since. There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he's, you know, nuts. The monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator fame. A friend of mine got this out of the ol' discount bin at MallWart and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it, so naturally I had to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit of a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin. Oh yeah, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recuperate and is visited by his friends.

{"value":"Can you say \"All shock, no plot?\" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no history about the room other than the deaths. *WHY* was it evil? What made it that way? Why an \"hour\" countdown? Then, there were the unexplored things hinted at; for example we *saw* a camera in the air vent, which he mentioned. But when he climbed up said vent, there was no camera.<br /><br />How about the fact that all the ghosts looked \"Digital\", and things \"winked out\" before hitting the ground making a static noise? Hmmm... when you put all of *those* things together, it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech spook house. Except that there was no follow up on that.<br /><br />Oh... by the way... electronics don't work in 1408. Well, except for the TV... the cell phone has no signal, but Wireless Internet works fine. How many incontinuities can you possibly add? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but \"shock after shock\". It's all been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just out of site. Changing paintings. Bleeding walls. The \"Oh, it was all just a dream... no it wasn't.\" And, if the room was \"evil\", why make our main character come to terms with his daughter's death, if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway? It just didn't make sense.<br /><br />Additionally, there was no background information about \"The first book\" that he wrote. Just some vague information about the \"dad was a jerk\" and so forth. Speaking of dads, what was with the bit about his father? \"You'll be in my place\".<br /><br />Overall, a truly HORRIBLE movie. It was 100% adrenalin shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no back story, character development, etc.<br /><br />My overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the \"Cheap\"; pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots, and was nothing but an effects film of recycled, cheesy, \"seen-that-before\" effects.","finished_norm":["can","you","sai","all","shock","no","plot","there","be","so","mani","unexplor","direct","in","thi","movi","there","be","no","histori","about","the","room","other","than","the","death","why","be","it","evil","what","make","it","that","wai","why","a","hour","countdown","then","there","be","the","unexplor","thing","hint","at","for","exampl","we","see","a","camera","in","the","air","vent","which","he","mention","but","when","he","climb","up","sai","vent","there","be","no","camerabr","br","how","about","the","fact","that","all","the","ghost","look","digit","and","thing","wink","out","befor","hit","the","grind","make","a","static","nois","hmmm","when","you","put","all","of","that","thing","togeth","it","make","room","look","like","a","hightech","spook","hous","except","that","there","be","no","follow","up","on","thatbr","br","oh","by","the","wai","electron","do","not","work","in","good","except","for","the","tv","the","cell","phone","have","no","signal","but","wireless","internet","work","fine","how","mani","incontinu","can","you","possibli","add","i","be","sorri","but","thi","film","be","noth","but","shock","after","shock","it","all","be","do","befor","reflect","in","the","mirror","thing","just","out","of","site","chang","paint","ble","wall","the","oh","it","be","all","just","a","dream","no","it","be","not","and","if","the","room","be","evil","why","make","our","main","charact","come","to","term","with","hi","daughter","death","if","it","be","go","to","keep","him","trap","there","forev","anywai","it","just","do","not","make","sensebr","br","addition","there","be","no","background","inform","about","the","book","that","he","write","just","some","vagu","inform","about","the","dad","be","a","jerk","and","so","forth","speak","of","dad","what","be","with","the","bite","about","hi","father","you","will","be","in","my","placebr","br","overal","a","truli","horribl","movi","it","be","adrenalin","shock","factor","without","ani","new","or","innov","effect","and","certainli","no","back","stori","charact","develop","etcbr","br","my","overal","impress","be","that","the","entir","movi","be","make","on","the","cheap","pretti","much","us","on","set","and","a","coupl","of","locat","shot","and","be","noth","but","a","effect","film","of","recycl","cheesi","seenthatbefor","effect"],"filtered":["sai","shock","plot","mani","unexplor","direct","thi","movi","histori","room","death","evil","make","wai","hour","countdown","unexplor","thing","hint","exampl","see","camera","air","vent","mention","climb","sai","vent","camerabr","br","fact","ghost","look","digit","thing","wink","befor","hit","grind","make","static","nois","hmmm","put","thing","togeth","make","room","look","like","hightech","spook","hous","except","follow","thatbr","br","oh","wai","electron","work","good","except","tv","cell","phone","signal","wireless","internet","work","fine","mani","incontinu","possibli","add","sorri","thi","film","noth","shock","shock","befor","reflect","mirror","thing","site","chang","paint","ble","wall","oh","dream","room","evil","make","main","charact","come","term","hi","daughter","death","go","keep","trap","forev","anywai","make","sensebr","br","addition","background","inform","book","write","vagu","inform","dad","jerk","forth","speak","dad","bite","hi","father","placebr","br","overal","truli","horribl","movi","adrenalin","shock","factor","without","ani","new","innov","effect","certainli","back","stori","charact","develop","etcbr","br","overal","impress","entir","movi","make","cheap","pretti","much","us","set","coupl","locat","shot","noth","effect","film","recycl","cheesi","seenthatbefor","effect"],"filtered2":["shock","plot","mani","unexplor","direct","histori","room","death","evil","make","wai","hour","countdown","unexplor","thing","hint","exampl","see","camera","air","vent","mention","climb","vent","camerabr","fact","ghost","look","digit","thing","wink","befor","hit","grind","make","static","nois","hmmm","put","thing","togeth","make","room","look","like","hightech","spook","hous","except","follow","thatbr","oh","wai","electron","work","good","except","tv","cell","phone","signal","wireless","internet","work","fine","mani","incontinu","possibli","add","sorri","noth","shock","shock","befor","reflect","mirror","thing","site","chang","paint","ble","wall","oh","dream","room","evil","make","main","charact","come","term","daughter","death","go","keep","trap","forev","anywai","make","sensebr","addition","background","inform","book","write","vagu","inform","dad","jerk","forth","speak","dad","bite","father","placebr","overal","truli","horribl","adrenalin","shock","factor","without","ani","new","innov","effect","certainli","back","stori","charact","develop","etcbr","overal","impress","entir","make","cheap","pretti","us","set","coupl","locat","shot","noth","effect","recycl","cheesi","seenthatbefor","effect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,10,16,17,27,29,32,33,34,48,49,50,56,63,65,78,79,87,97,102,106,109,125,134

{"value":"Having read the other comments on this film, I would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile. I am not.<br /><br />When looked at by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting. It is quite difficult to watch. The Brooks character (Robert Cole) is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him---let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to the next. And he should NEVER do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like Kathryn Harrold----unless, of course, he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks-controlled production.<br /><br />\"Modern Romance\" has its amusing moments-----but they are fragmentary and infrequent. More often than not, I felt as if I were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already. It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person---someone who lacks the self-discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening.<br /><br />As most people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is in fact what he portrayed. Six years later, he cast Albert Brooks in the very successful \"Broadcast News.\" James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance. Albert allowed us to see James (generally not cast as an actor) do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner.<br /><br />Fans of \"Modern Romance\" will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it. To you I say-----there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an

{"value":"\"The Brain Machine\" will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about. Four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.<br /><br />The whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as The General, but it seems he's taking his direction from a Senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Good call there on the Senator's part. There's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on, who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the General or 'The Project'. Too bad he wasn't more effective, he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.<br /><br />If nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones, room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit. Perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title - \"Time Warp\"; nothing else would make any sense. As for myself, I'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered Dr. Krisner's experiment titled 'Group Stress Project'. It applies to the film's actors and viewers alike.<br /><br />Keep an eye out just above The General's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.<br /><br />You may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard Gerald McRaney fan, could he have ever been that young? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but don't call him Father. For something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's \"The Killer Shrews\".

{"value":"\"So there's this bride, you see, and she gets crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding. Then, get this, a year later, her former fiancé falls in love with a beautiful psychic and then, that beautiful psychic gets haunted by the ghost of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriendhe heit'll be hilarious!.\" Polite chuckling.<br /><br />This, I like to envision, is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed up \"Over Her Dead Body,\" presented his concept to the studio execs over there at New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how those very same corporate bigwigs could then turn right around and green light the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as write the screenplay.<br /><br />For if you think that no movie could ever possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another think coming. The only way in which it might have worked is if the writer had simply gone crazy with it and turned it into a no-holds-barred satirical farce. Instead, wanting to ensure that he delivered a fuzzy, inoffensive and warmhearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half-measures every step of the way, tamping down the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. Indeed, \"Over Her Dead Body\" is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it. Virtually every set-up, joke and sight gag in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament. How else to explain the halfhearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /><br />I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proved their talents in better vehicles in the past (that is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some 'splainin' to do.","finished_norm":["so","there","thi","bride","you","see","and","she","get","crush","to","death","by","thi","statu","that","fall","on","her","on","the","dai","of","her","wed","then","get","thi","a","year","late","her","former","fiancé","fall","in","love","with","a","beauti","psychic","and","then","that","beauti","psychic","get","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","the","disgruntl","dead","bride","who","want","to","keep","her","from","steal","her","boyfriendh","heitll","be","hilari","polit","chucklingbr","br","thi","i","like","to","envis","be","how","jeff","lowel","the","man","who","dream","up","over","her","dead","bodi","present","hi","concept","to","the","studio","exec","over","there","at","new","line","cinema","the","big","mysteri","be","how","that","veri","same","corpor","bigwig","can","then","turn","right","around","and","green","light","the","project","allow","lowel","to","direct","the","film","a","good","a","write","the","screenplaybr","br","for","if","you","think","that","no","movi","can","ever","possibli","be","a","bad","a","thi","origin","premis","sound","then","clearli","you","have","anoth","think","come","the","onli","wai","in","which","it","mai","have","work","be","if","the","writer","have","simpli","go","crazi","with","it","and","turn","it","into","a","noholdsbar","satir","farc","instead","want","to","ensur","that","he","deliv","a","fuzzi","inoffens","and","warmheart","romant","comedi","lowel","engag","in","bore","halfmeasur","everi","step","of","the","wai","tamp","down","the","absurd","in","favor","of","drab","convention","ind","over","her","dead","bodi","be","so","thoroughli","inept","and","unfunni","that","it","hard","to","know","where","exactli","lowel","think","he","be","go","with","it","virtual","everi","setup","joke","and","sight","gag","in","the","film","be","flatfoot","and","poorli","execut","with","even","the","actor","themselv","seemingli","awar","of","their","predica","how","els","to","explain","the","halfheart","lifeless","perform","of","paul","rudd","eva","langoria","parker","lake","bell","and","jason","bigg","in","their","variou","role","br","br","i","choos","not","to","blame","the","actor","some","of","whom","have","prove","their","talent","in","well","vehicl","in","the","past","that","be","particularli","the","case","with","rudd","but","lowel","and","that","studio","exec","sure","have","some","splainin","to","do"],"filtered":["thi","bride","see","get","crush","death","thi","statu","fall","dai","wed","get","thi","year","late","former","fiancé","fall","love","beauti","psychic","beauti","psychic","get","haunt","ghost","disgruntl","dead","bride","want","keep","steal","boyfriendh","heitll","hilari","polit","chucklingbr","br","thi","like","envis","jeff","lowel","man","dream","dead","bodi","present","hi","concept","studio","exec","new","line","cinema","big","mysteri","veri","corpor","bigwig","turn","right","around","green","light","project","allow","lowel","direct","film","good","write","screenplaybr","br","think","movi","ever","possibli","bad","thi","origin","premis","sound","clearli","anoth","think","come","onli","wai","mai","work","writer","simpli","go","crazi","turn","noholdsbar","satir","farc","instead","want","ensur","deliv","fuzzi","inoffens","warmheart","romant","comedi","lowel","engag","bore","halfmeasur","everi","step","wai","tamp","absurd","favor","drab","convention","ind","dead","bodi","thoroughli","inept","unfunni","hard","know","exactli","lowel","think","go","virtual","everi","setup","joke","sight","gag","film","flatfoot","poorli","execut","even","actor","themselv","seemingli","awar","predica","els","explain","halfheart","lifeless","perform","paul","rudd","eva","langoria","parker","lake","bell","jason","bigg","variou","role","br","br","choos","blame","actor","prove","talent","well","vehicl","past","particularli","case","rudd","lowel","studio","exec","sure","splainin"],"filtered2":["bride","see","get","crush","death","statu","fall","dai","wed","get","year","late","former","fiancé","fall","love","beauti","psychic","beauti","psychic","get","haunt","ghost","disgruntl","dead","bride","want","keep","steal","boyfriendh","heitll","hilari","polit","chucklingbr","like","envis","jeff","lowel","man","dream","dead","bodi","present","concept","studio","exec","new","line","cinema","big","mysteri","veri","corpor","bigwig","turn","right","around","green","light","project","allow","lowel","direct","good","write","screenplaybr","think","ever","possibli","bad","origin","premis","sound","clearli","anoth","think","come","onli","wai","mai","work","writer","simpli","go","crazi","turn","noholdsbar","satir","farc","instead","want","ensur","deliv","fuzzi","inoffens","warmheart","romant","comedi","lowel","engag","bore","halfmeasur","everi","step","wai","tamp","absurd","favor","drab","convention","ind","dead","bodi","thoroughli","inept","unfunni","hard","know","exactli","lowel","think","go","virtual","everi","setup","joke","sight","gag","flatfoot","poorli","execut","even","actor","themselv","seemingl

{"value":"For the first couple of seasons, I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show. The combination between reality TV and a 16 week job-interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too \"out there\".<br /><br />The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (that means lying, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.). The boardroom can be entertaining to watch, but it's entertainment at it's low-point - Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode. The tasks on the show are, at most, boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay NBC for the publicity. And what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? That is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life. <br /><br />I have absolutely NO respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem like idiots to me. In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems like Donald Trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest, I can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth.<br /><br />R.I.P The Apprentice. Please NBC, for God's sake, get the show off the air as soon as possible. It's just too embarrassing to watch. The Apprentice was once a great TV-show, but now it's just a big fat

{"value":"The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. It was, on the non-literal level, a \"man vs. cruel nature\" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.<br /><br />The second movie, Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still, for being fairly entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10.<br /><br />The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. There is no \"homage\" or \"tribute\" here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say).<br /><br />That we see something from \"behind the scenes\" means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. And, in this movie, those who get through to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! That's just flippin' stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.<br /><br />The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.","finished_norm":["the","cube","movi","be","a","art","movi","it","set","up","a","world","in","which","all","the","major","archetyp","of","mankind","be","repres","and","show","how","thei","struggl","to","make","sens","of","a","hostil","world","that","thei","can","not","understand","it","be","on","the","nonliter","level","a","man","v","cruel","natur","plot","where","the","individu","who","repres","innoc","and","good","come","through","in","the","end","triumph","to","face","a","new","indefin","world","beyond","man","petti","squabbl","a","world","where","there","be","no","much","struggl","but","peac","i","rate","cube","a","out","of","and","it","a","movi","that","be","never","mean","to","have","ani","sequelsbr","br","the","movi","hypercub","be","a","massiv","disappoint","some","of","the","idea","be","kind","of","cool","but","in","the","context","of","the","origin","movi","both","the","stori","and","the","set","make","no","sens","and","have","no","mean","still","for","be","fairli","entertain","i","rate","it","a","out","of","br","br","the","movi","cube","zero","while","ignor","the","plai","like","a","vastli","inferior","commerci","bmovi","rehash","of","the","san","the","symbol","there","be","no","homag","or","tribut","here","there","be","onli","rip","off","the","same","kind","of","plot","with","some","elem","idiot","alter","like","have","letter","instead","of","prime","number","between","the","cube","a","idea","which","show","much","clearli","than","anyth","els","that","thi","be","a","ripoff","with","absolut","no","origin","and","noth","to","saybr","br","that","we","see","someth","from","behind","the","scene","mean","noth","becaus","the","watcher","be","just","part","of","the","big","bad","experi","the","architect","of","which","we","hear","noth","of","and","in","thi","movi","that","who","get","through","to","the","exit","like","kazan","do","at","the","end","of","the","movi","be","just","kill","where","the","bleep","be","the","sens","in","that","that","just","flippin","stupid","i","be","glad","i","do","not","pai","to","see","thisbr","br","the","product","valu","and","act","in","cube","zero","be","not","too","bad","but","the","stori","and","the","idea","be","so","utterli","devoid","of","ani","inspir","that","thi","movi","can","onli","get","from","me","a","rate","of","out","of"],"filtered":["cube","movi","art","movi","set","world","major","archetyp","mankind","repres","show","thei","struggl","make","sens","hostil","world","thei","understand","nonliter","level","man","v","cruel","natur","plot","individu","repres","innoc","good","come","end","triumph","face","new","indefin","world","beyond","man","petti","squabbl","world","much","struggl","peac","rate","cube","movi","never","mean","ani","sequelsbr","br","movi","hypercub","massiv","disappoint","idea","kind","cool","context","origin","movi","stori","set","make","sens","mean","still","fairli","entertain","rate","br","br","movi","cube","zero","ignor","plai","like","vastli","inferior","commerci","bmovi","rehash","san","symbol","homag","tribut","onli","rip","kind","plot","elem","idiot","alter","like","letter","instead","prime","number","cube","idea","show","much","clearli","anyth","els","thi","ripoff","absolut","origin","noth","saybr","br","see","someth","behind","scene","mean","noth","becaus","watcher","part","big","bad","experi","architect","hear","noth","thi","movi","get","exit","like","kazan","end","movi","kill","bleep","sens","flippin","stupid","glad","pai","see","thisbr","br","product","valu","act","cube","zero","bad","stori","idea","utterli","devoid","ani","inspir","thi","movi","onli","get","rate"],"filtered2":["cube","art","set","world","major","archetyp","mankind","repres","show","struggl","make","sens","hostil","world","understand","nonliter","level","man","v","cruel","natur","plot","individu","repres","innoc","good","come","end","triumph","face","new","indefin","world","beyond","man","petti","squabbl","world","struggl","peac","rate","cube","never","mean","ani","sequelsbr","hypercub","massiv","disappoint","idea","kind","cool","context","origin","stori","set","make","sens","mean","still","fairli","entertain","rate","cube","zero","ignor","plai","like","vastli","inferior","commerci","bmovi","rehash","san","symbol","homag","tribut","onli","rip","kind","plot","elem","idiot","alter","like","letter","instead","prime","number","cube","idea","show","clearli","anyth","els","ripoff","absolut","origin","noth","saybr","see","someth","behind","scene","mean","noth","becaus","watcher","part","big","bad","experi","architect","hear","noth","get","exit","like","kazan","end","kill","bleep","sens","flippin","stupid","glad","pai","see","thisbr","product","valu","act","cube","zero","bad","stori","idea","utterli","devoid","ani","inspir","onli","get","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,11,17,19,21,22,24,27,28,32,34,40,42,45,49,53,61,64,69,76,82,87,88,104,109,122,123,136,152,165,173,187,190,195,196,202,212,216,222,251,322,333,382,393,404,445,451,456,479,481,

{"value":"I truly wish I was not writing this review. I'm a Christian, so I waited anxiously to see this movie. It seemed great -- a Christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that I buy the Bible Code itself -- you can make it say anything you want. I do, however believe everything inside the Bible). So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews, when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable Tension Scenes, I'm sure). Once the final credits began to roll, however, I could reflect. There were many parts of the movie I liked -- some mostly unexpected plot twists, some effects that were indeed special (I'm not counting the Visions. Those were poorly done), and some interesting technical work -- fades, sets, that type of thing. Unfortunately, I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could've gotten a better script. And the music was beyond cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue). So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater -- like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was -- but I'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a Biblical shell and slaps a Christian stamp on it. I need a good plot and believable dialogue before I can enjoy most movies, and this just didn't have either. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. And that's the tragedy.

{"value":"Claire Denis's movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. \"L'Intrus\" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not so awful as \"Trouble Every Day\" or \"J'ai pas sommeil.\"<br /><br />Now, ever since I saw \"Chocolat,\" I've made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes. And I have always been disappointed. \"L'Intrus\" was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. <br /><br />You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from \"Trouble Every Day\" and \"J'ai pas sommeil,\" Grégoire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, I think, he finally got it cut. <br /><br />There was certainly some action--gruesome murders, a man's search for a son--and there may even have been a plot, but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out, and two viewings are, I fear, out of the question. For one thing, the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in \"Beau Travail\"). For another, the seasons changed too abruptly, leaving you even more confused about what was going on. Oh, there were a few pretty shots, and if you liked \"Friday Evening\" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of \"L'Intrus.\" Otherwise, steer clear. <br /><br />I saw this movie in French and it's possible I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages, double spaced and with ample margins. In \"Chocolat\" the silence is sublime; in \"L'Intrus,\" it's just
