{"value":"The first half was OK, but the last half really, really disappointed. It's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending, and it really showed. Whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this. I really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort. When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn. They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama, so I started watching again. But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel, same with baltar and six was pretty dumb.","finished_norm":["the","half","be","okai","but","the","last","half","realli","realli","disappoint","it","funni","the","produc","even","admit","thei","do","not","have","a","clue","for","the","end","and","it","realli","show","what","realli","sad","be","i","have","to","write","ten","line","of","comment","minimum","to","be","abl","to","post","thi","i","realli","do","not","want","to","includ","spoiler","to","qualifi","my","remark","sinc","the","show","be","not","realli","worth","that","effort","when","battlestar","galatica","come","out","i","be","realli","excit","with","the","prospect","of","a","well","remak","it","do","not","happen","that","season","border","on","be","space","porn","thei","eventu","clean","it","up","a","bite","and","actual","have","some","pretti","fair","drama","so","i","start","watch","again","but","to","end","the","seri","with","kara","be","a","cyclon","god","angel","same","with","baltar","and","six","be","pretti","dumb"],"filtered":["half","okai","last","half","realli","realli","disappoint","funni","produc","even","admit","thei","clue","end","realli","show","realli","sad","write","ten","line","comment","minimum","abl","post","thi","realli","want","includ","spoiler","qualifi","remark","sinc","show","realli","worth","effort","battlestar","galatica","come","realli","excit","prospect","well","remak","happen","season","border","space","porn","thei","eventu","clean","bite","actual","pretti","fair","drama","start","watch","end","seri","kara","cyclon","god","angel","baltar","six","pretti","dumb"],"filtered2":["half","okai","last","half","realli","realli","disappoint","funni","produc","even","admit","clue","end","realli","show","realli","sad","write","ten","line","comment","minimum","abl","post","realli","want","includ","spoiler","qualifi","remark","sinc","show","realli","worth","effort","battlestar","galatica","come","realli","excit","prospect","well","remak","happen","season","border","space","porn","eventu","clean","bite","actual","pretti","fair","drama","start","watch","end","kara","cyclon","god","angel","baltar","six","pretti","dumb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,13,20,24,28,34,37,52,62,65,71,78,94,107,144,154,162,187,191,206,219,261,280,301,352,401,420,454,455,463,483,490,524,545,637,691,716,817,877,971,1036,1038,1224,1229,1348,1495,2188,2469,3173,5206,5411],"values":[1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,13,20,24,28,34,37,52,62,65,71,78,94,107,144,154,162,187,191,206,219,261,280,301,352,401,420,454,455,463,483,490,524,545,637,691,716,817,877,971,1036,1038,1224,1229,1348,1495,2188,2469,3173,5206,5411],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,7.922559098813782,1.165345040023057,2.6420723132238515,3.0904588387038183,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,4.012839573363895,2.08112281984698,2.1439533986393955,2.2931108769894046,2.348499626138016,2.3586007221245198,2.4732161909892554,2.5460113484259455,5.194609285626992,2.5792094178355414,2.7085302779237206,2.8028805344481915,2.8309760279012264,3.1236456418640466,3.0879275592619675,3.3023374306074227,3.2556198060399626,3.2787058260741455,3.3467891931782563,3.613480989738201,3.3490645070153917,3.4028786598293,3.442099372982581,3.7432044657665027,3.5929222627171646,3.6746621462132825,4.197121957260614,3.865219416329466,4.181290492043933,4.327618446189983,4.165705761027235,4.403125998698128,4.3215761317340196,4.470719289830655,4.5432147918688095,5.089758498236879,5.129498826886393,5.501738287366237,6.543192162194399,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.03322772728263E-5,6.985801028483145E-5,7.040108970175002E-5,6.999431145544539E-5,6.999545823343378E-5,6.989761857058866E-5,7.010550388178027E-5,6.986806938184656E-5,7.002515827174912E-5,7.768909057973042E-5,0.8024550879828913,6.975528691365647E-5,7.10572347524572E-5,7.207088182003556E-5,6.980615174119376E-5,6.961323765629964E-5,7.134965279062066E-5,7.011207223831546E-5,6.98945498073215E-5,6.995247996207243E-5,7.062931123365987E-5,7.018153556021798E-5,7.026144788544336E-5,7.033714671507821E-5,7.087694818062567E-5,7.050628169502896E-5,7.347023183523969E-5,6.977602452087222E-5,6.977789119293505E-5,6.995467308567728E-5,7.144154328554713E-5,7.010800984243467E-5,7.525500959568191E-5,7.030521332852143E-5,6.985197258565296E-5,7.017438548603016E-5,6.97819791635341E-5,6.982321517903246E-5,6.961288791376519E-5,6.963094870853638E-5,6.978767951162103E-5,7.052379165464624E-5,7.016543063292083E-5,6.988801613417451E-5,7.073722881226498E-5,6.99148395366681E-5,7.223776247092245E-5,7.117548511768766E-5,6.964825580587133E-5,6.980218271048546E-5,6.977797268371231E-5,7.174178713337587E-5,6.980322123389224E-5,6.962476707143462E-5,7.038899853076177E-5,6.9821200690655E-5,0.1920538

{"value":"Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating, and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating. This is not the case here.<br /><br />Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film. It does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything. There are strands of a bad D&D novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout. It is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort, because even a completely patently untalented persons' hard work would amount to more.

{"value":"Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for $2. I enjoy a good B movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one.<br /><br />The movie is quite cliche \"1970's\" and is quite groovy for that. Unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie. In fact, I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was.<br /><br />The movie has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait.......for them.<br /><br />If you are into B movies, this might just be for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens, and did I mention not much story line either...<br /><br

{"value":"Man, this was hilarious. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this movie tased, effective immediately. For everyone who is thinking of watching this \"movie\", let''s go over a few plot points. Oh, wait. There aren't any. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to film something with some random someones, and miraculously, it somehow got on videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Don't believe me? Go watch it. Do it, man. I dare you. But be prepared to gouge your eyes out.

{"value":"if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one... incredible bad... the main characters (the mom, the dad and son) are OK. Specially the mother she's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary. But does the the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. the script hasn't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing. If you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. oh... actually there was something funny: the movie's from 2001 but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad (like on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80's).","finished_norm":["if","my","grandma","do","film","thei","would","probabl","do","much","well","figur","than","thi","on","incred","bad","the","main","charact","the","mom","the","dad","and","son","be","okai","special","the","mother","she","a","nice","actress","and","the","kid","conjur","prove","to","be","a","nice","on","special","on","the","scene","where","he","be","suppos","to","be","scari","but","doe","the","the","director","know","the","mean","of","the","word","plot","point","triller","and","good","script","the","script","have","not","ani","evolv","atmospher","to","becom","a","suspens","thing","if","you","like","be","chase","by","tree","you","can","probabl","enjoi","it","otherwis","just","stai","at","home","and","sleep","oh","actual","there","be","someth","funni","the","movi","from","but","we","can","not","realiz","it","sinc","the","imag","be","so","bad","like","on","minidv","and","the","car","be","so","old","like","and"],"filtered":["grandma","film","thei","probabl","much","well","figur","thi","incred","bad","main","charact","mom","dad","son","okai","special","mother","nice","actress","kid","conjur","prove","nice","special","scene","suppos","scari","doe","director","know","mean","word","plot","point","triller","good","script","script","ani","evolv","atmospher","becom","suspens","thing","like","chase","tree","probabl","enjoi","otherwis","stai","home","sleep","oh","actual","someth","funni","movi","realiz","sinc","imag","bad","like","minidv","car","old","like"],"filtered2":["grandma","probabl","well","figur","incred","bad","main","charact","mom","dad","son","okai","special","mother","nice","actress","kid","conjur","prove","nice","special","scene","suppos","scari","doe","director","know","mean","word","plot","point","triller","good","script","script","ani","evolv","atmospher","becom","suspens","thing","like","chase","tree","probabl","enjoi","otherwis","stai","home","sleep","oh","actual","someth","funni","realiz","sinc","imag","bad","like","minidv","car","old","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,9,10,18,19,20,26,27,29,32,39,52,53,58,62,66,67,77,88,114,115,148,149,162,179,191,200,203,234,258,262,284,302,354,365,396,397,405,415,434,529,530,540,627,732,740,835,1016,1121,1351,1418,3889,4527],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,9,10,18,19,20,26,27,29,32,39,52,53,58,62,66,67,77,88,114,115,148,149,162,179,191,200,203,234,258,262,284,302,354,365,396,397,405,415,434,529,530,540,627,732,740,835,1016,1121,1351,1418,3889,4527],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6786144649922705,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,3.8927804517536475,2.0317223413467334,2.4433074195966826,2.201553588425805,4.603730819247303,2.3253197803590226,2.3586007221245198,2.507968722980095,2.5460113484259455,2.5308211829319704,5.139521057275218,2.673149229007135,2.7061321952397077,5.453403166975632,3.110998680163279,2.902686292364678,3.0316467233633775,3.008694896185175,3.291526514503207,3.3176717946075294,3.109204957709252,3.1588018988486244,3.4101163271295305,3.4648563601051974,3.5784919978881358,3.432149042129413,3.477726550625732,3.7099788181381825,3.7740817043309423,3.8614098879127985,4.34596758485818,4.403125998698128,4.573751515728891,4.550761997504193,5.7959777603641776,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.944912897637121E-5,7.891338492599343E-5,7.952686124600227E-5,7.906735419449485E-5,7.906864962407343E-5,7.895812745283428E-5,7.919295998693647E-5,7.892474793778727E-5,7.910219954263451E-5,8.77595723736183E-5,0.9166259855631258,7.879734599363084E-5,8.026805938122865E-5,8.141310088608646E-5,7.885480419632339E-5,7.863688354016922E-5,8.059838223340852E-5,7.920037976951372E-5,0.05811855345211912,7.902010027579448E-5,7.978466609218342E-5,7.927884730440601E-5,7.936911829917282E-5,7.945462962217023E-5,8.006440308495108E-5,7.964568879667124E-5,8.299384224911344E-5,7.882077172210474E-5,7.88228803623369E-5,7.902257768399026E-5,8.070218407327781E-5,7.919579078381895E-5,8.500997259469404E-5,7.941855685664096E-5,7.890656458746107E-5,7.927077039877512E-5,7.88274982378838E-5,7.887407948963385E-5,7.863648846210826E-5,7.865689039517273E-5,7.88339374960442E-5,7.966546849233797E-5,7.926065476897845E-5,7.894728029646827E-5,7.990657253334921E-5,7.897758069405146E-5,8.160161351314874E-5,8.0401638000932E-5,7.867644093244647E-5,7.885032067830175E-5,7.882297241639124E-5,8.104134715906805E-5,7.8851493820752E-5,7.864990746070186E-5,7.951320275177217E-5,7.887180387233369E-5,8.481795682923799E-5,7.880680325754052E-5,7.8675531084

There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such, and I think that that is a great description of how they behaved.<br /><br />More absurdly unbelievable writing/acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as \"pigface\" who, of course, has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I quit watching...<br /><br />If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time.","finished_norm":["i","can","not","bear","to","sit","through","he","entir","movi","do","famili","like","thi","realli","exist","somewher","there","have","be","mani","comment","describ","thi","famili","a","akin","to","llbean","model","and","such","and","i","think","that","that","be","a","great","descript","of","how","thei","behavedbr","br","much","absurdli","unbeliev","writingact","occur","a","we","meet","a","charact","refer","to","in","high","school","a","pigfac","who","of","cours","have","grow","into","a","dropdead","gorgeou","year","harvardeduc","plastic","surgeon","but","onli","to","do","good","in","the","worldnot","for","the","monei","and","she","bed","steve","carrel","on","the","date","that","when","i","quit","watchingbr","br","if","you","can","complet","suspend","your","disbelief","for","two","hour","then","perhap","you","will","enjoi","thi","sentiment","selfindulg","wast","of","time"],"filtered":["bear","sit","entir","movi","famili","like","thi","realli","exist","somewher","mani","comment","describ","thi","famili","akin","llbean","model","think","great","descript","thei","behavedbr","br","much","absurdli","unbeliev","writingact","occur","meet","charact","refer","high","school","pigfac","cours","grow","dropdead","gorgeou","year","harvardeduc","plastic","surgeon","onli","good","worldnot","monei","bed","steve","carrel","date","quit","watchingbr","br","complet","suspend","disbelief","two","hour","perhap","enjoi","thi","sentiment","selfindulg","wast","time"],"filtered2":["bear","sit","entir","famili","like","realli","exist","somewher","mani","comment","describ","famili","akin","llbean","model","think","great","descript","behavedbr","absurdli","unbeliev","writingact","occur","meet","charact","refer","high","school","pigfac","cours","grow","dropdead","gorgeou","year","harvardeduc","plastic","surgeon","onli","good","worldnot","monei","bed","steve","carrel","date","quit","watchingbr","complet","suspend","disbelief","two","hour","perhap","enjoi","sentiment","selfindulg","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,10,11,12,13,47,50,51,57,89,103,120,126,174,182,198,199,200,211,244,280,296,318,350,525,528,561,571,647,668,715,804,1065,1102,1105,1253,1737,1782,1858,2068,2633,2696,3067,3851,4254,4404,7436],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,10,11,12,13,47,50,51,57,89,103,120,126,174,182,198,199,200,211,244,280,296,318,350,525,528,561,571,647,668,715,804,1065,1102,1105,1253,1737,1782,1858,2068,2633,2696,3067,3851,4254,4404,7436],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,2.456282578459816,5.473059344848157,2.5439726117360975,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.5687161421197025,2.634508058031767,2.8028805344481915,2.9504565686333644,2.902686292364678,3.0135689919434205,3.4149707055943286,3.4198487640477615,3.4725585804672896,3.467417180966871,3.6746621462132825,3.5813614403160887,3.68099128126493,3.7740817043309423,4.1302590120314875,4.390138803171316,4.613282354485526,4.315570107673808,4.760735085628657,4.715065048795469,4.8184434032493035,4.944927550358424,5.3064295350454715,5.290429193699031,5.501738287366237,5.7446844659766265,5.907203395474402,5.9370563586240825,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.671806979248573E-5,7.620074191265441E-5,7.679313001987297E-5,7.634941849651354E-5,7.635066939577575E-5,7.624394641773953E-5,7.64707065971514E-5,7.621171432157927E-5,7.638306603783921E-5,8.474284218169745E-5,0.7480320395780623,7.608869181183725E-5,0.04784796294833838,7.861453028212593E-5,7.614417489215684E-5,7.593374524587295E-5,7.782781753570959E-5,7.647787132513445E-5,7.624059902727195E-5,7.630378892851787E-5,7.704207283947328E-5,7.655364154308235E-5,7.664080947765866E-5,7.67233813539056E-5,7.731219388939783E-5,7.690787288040455E-5,8.014093375281269E-5,0.15603974901085782,7.611334843810536E-5,7.630618117595112E-5,7.792805119337562E-5,7.647344008555582E-5,8.208775973512147E-5,7.668854858759164E-5,7.619415602286209E-5,7.654584228061238E-5,7.611780757444914E-5,7.616278759838174E-5,7.593336374859734E-5,7.595306436640031E-5,7.61240254834851E-5,7.692697265018411E-5,7.653607437500115E-5,7.62334721317422E-5,7.715978875382008E-5,7.626273095492224E-5,7.879656279860612E-5,0.04223998179628383,7.597194285509328E-5,7.61398454948062E-5,7.611343732780694E-5,7.825555556783427E-5,7.614097831055301E-5,7.59463214698954E-5,7.677994103558697E-5,7.616059020529382E-5,8.190234450042587E-5,7.609782398285054E-5,7.597106428315789E-5,7.633380381760303E-5,7.709097099752141E-5,7.632875390228663E-5,7.595700946642274E-5,7.6133863729

{"value":"\"True\" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. Not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is watchable but isn't at all scary (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). Its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told, \"here watch this\", which is what happened to me.

{"value":"This is a rip off of the old Frankenstein premise. An acclaimed scientist is killed in a freakish accident and his father, a noted brain surgeon saves the brain. It is then put into a robotic body of his own design. His brother, an electrical genius, gives the 'colossus' impetus to transfer thoughts into motion. The whole project goes bad, when the creation goes berserk.<br /><br />Special effects are undeveloped. The script is lacking. And it is humorous that this is not scary a bit. Well, very small kids will think this is good. If you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on....night, night.<br /><br />The lead characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin.

{"value":"It was a good story, but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main story line, which wasn't as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in. The acting was okay to cheesy, some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting. It took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad. I only just finished watching it and I'm glad I did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was sub par. Would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy, and I do mean, a little.","finished_norm":["it","be","a","good","stori","but","not","veri","good","tell","i","like","the","theme","and","the","main","stori","line","which","be","not","a","clear","a","it","can","have","be","mayb","there","be","too","much","go","on","and","a","lack","of","abil","to","reign","it","all","in","the","act","be","okai","to","cheesi","some","be","strong","than","other","and","even","the","strong","actor","have","their","moment","of","lesser","qualiti","act","it","take","me","a","coupl","of","month","to","get","through","the","entir","movi","becaus","it","do","not","keep","my","attent","and","the","flow","be","just","bad","i","onli","just","finish","watch","it","and","i","be","glad","i","do","a","the","movi","final","get","move","and","have","some","continu","toward","the","end","again","a","good","stori","but","the","deliveri","be","sub","par","would","recommend","it","for","the","stori","line","and","mayb","a","littl","ey","candi","and","i","do","mean","a","littl"],"filtered":["good","stori","veri","good","tell","like","theme","main","stori","line","clear","mayb","much","go","lack","abil","reign","act","okai","cheesi","strong","even","strong","actor","moment","lesser","qualiti","act","take","coupl","month","get","entir","movi","becaus","keep","attent","flow","bad","onli","finish","watch","glad","movi","final","get","move","continu","toward","end","good","stori","deliveri","sub","par","recommend","stori","line","mayb","littl","ey","candi","mean","littl"],"filtered2":["good","stori","veri","good","tell","like","theme","main","stori","line","clear","mayb","go","lack","abil","reign","act","okai","cheesi","strong","even","strong","actor","moment","lesser","qualiti","act","take","coupl","month","get","entir","becaus","keep","attent","flow","bad","onli","finish","watch","glad","final","get","move","continu","toward","end","good","stori","deliveri","sub","par","recommend","stori","line","mayb","littl","ey","candi","mean","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,14,15,17,21,22,24,31,41,88,90,107,134,156,163,179,183,188,191,198,253,275,281,298,319,433,533,543,563,573,590,631,636,847,1227,1231,1788,1899,2113,2139,2739,2924,5805],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,14,15,17,21,22,24,31,41,88,90,107,134,156,163,179,183,188,191,198,253,275,281,298,319,433,533,543,563,573,590,631,636,847,1227,1231,1788,1899,2113,2139,2739,2924,5805],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,5.108214776042387,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.5687599167621034,2.0317223413467334,2.0477128419653545,4.287906797278791,2.2443961816702407,2.3451551414151686,4.800114871605731,2.507968722980095,2.4885128563647294,2.5378812223426954,2.5460113484259455,2.5439726117360975,2.7073305177318163,2.7832848715031413,2.832333801361687,2.7819920465008363,2.9056060024680126,3.164467636384302,3.4933926673701317,3.477726550625732,3.459754308221302,3.4623020803001006,3.4986697244709752,7.215127625420226,3.530930586689197,3.900174431363043,4.246178114249808,4.327618446189983,4.828393734102471,4.828393734102471,5.00274712124725,4.956227105612356,5.390512652256013,5.373120909544144,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.15363339665302E-5,8.098651540495507E-5,8.161610833760606E-5,8.114452959414583E-5,8.11458590559047E-5,8.103243336098561E-5,8.12734351714958E-5,8.099817693399164E-5,8.118029036307686E-5,0.07810109784154659,0.7691612547549239,8.086742801829474E-5,8.237677846033528E-5,8.355190130621811E-5,8.092639570320479E-5,8.070275006193316E-5,8.271577921137088E-5,8.128104987889375E-5,8.102887573827925E-5,8.10960342695775E-5,8.188068596491606E-5,8.136157883135604E-5,8.145422133193003E-5,8.154197911958193E-5,8.216777191738609E-5,8.173805760225628E-5,8.517417026436877E-5,8.089146916317407E-5,8.089363319941209E-5,8.109857676166804E-5,8.282230802535499E-5,8.127634033613353E-5,0.14646211012307417,8.15049586878266E-5,8.097951588957329E-5,8.135328973765015E-5,8.089837239098862E-5,8.094617737699924E-5,8.070234460479177E-5,8.072328251624958E-5,8.090498081465075E-5,8.175835692954178E-5,8.13429083605349E-5,8.102130123939485E-5,8.200579500547611E-5,8.105239765754937E-5,8.374536634120456E-5,8.251386631878316E-5,8.074334666493082E-5,8.092179439885485E-5,8.089372767181492E-5,8.317038125143575E-5,8.092299836088498E-5,8.071611613337769E-5,8.160209102160304E-5,8.094384197704512E-5,8.704620608797719E-5,8.08771337336183E-5,8.074241291444764E-5,8.112793423821638E-5,8.193265516273015E-5,8.112256716390319E-5,8.072747538754876E-5,8.091543694998587E-5,8.070332071393538E-5,8.257062828218293E-5,8.139854

The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as \"Once Upon a Time in America\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Enemy at the Gates\" (if you want to watch a GREAT \"war\" movie) etc.<br /><br />This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, then this movie was High school ball. It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera. Sure they went into a hostile area (to make a film) but I don't call that brave, around here we call that plain stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think.","finished_norm":["a","blair","witchwar","movi","that","be","a","much","of","a","letdown","a","bwitch","be","the","titl","sai","it","all","save","your","monei","and","your","time","and","spend","it","on","a","good","movi","such","a","onc","upon","a","time","in","america","the","shawshank","redempt","or","enemi","at","the","gate","if","you","want","to","watch","a","great","war","movi","etcbr","br","thi","movi","if","it","be","a","basebal","team","and","the","major","leagu","be","the","pinnacl","and","singl","a","be","the","rooki","then","thi","movi","be","high","school","ball","it","be","film","a","if","it","be","a","high","school","drama","club","film","with","their","daddi","old","camera","sure","thei","go","into","a","hostil","area","to","make","a","film","but","i","do","not","call","that","brave","around","here","we","call","that","plain","stupid","thi","be","a","pass","all","the","wai","now","go","watch","it","and","then","you","tell","me","what","you","think"],"filtered":["blair","witchwar","movi","much","letdown","bwitch","titl","sai","save","monei","time","spend","good","movi","onc","upon","time","america","shawshank","redempt","enemi","gate","want","watch","great","war","movi","etcbr","br","thi","movi","basebal","team","major","leagu","pinnacl","singl","rooki","thi","movi","high","school","ball","film","high","school","drama","club","film","daddi","old","camera","sure","thei","go","hostil","area","make","film","call","brave","around","call","plain","stupid","thi","pass","wai","go","watch","tell","think"],"filtered2":["blair","witchwar","letdown","bwitch","titl","save","monei","time","spend","good","onc","upon","time","america","shawshank","redempt","enemi","gate","want","watch","great","war","etcbr","basebal","team","major","leagu","pinnacl","singl","rooki","high","school","ball","high","school","drama","club","daddi","old","camera","sure","go","hostil","area","make","call","brave","around","call","plain","stupid","pass","wai","go","watch","tell","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,7,8,12,33,37,51,67,90,98,119,126,136,142,189,211,231,236,264,283,296,314,404,443,463,487,586,630,723,809,1035,1156,1311,1564,1854,2349,2549,2704,2715,2841,3071,3153,3665,4893,6417,8104],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,7,8,12,33,37,51,67,90,98,119,126,136,142,189,211,231,236,264,283,296,314,404,443,463,487,586,630,723,809,1035,1156,1311,1564,1854,2349,2549,2704,2715,2841,3071,3153,3665,4893,6417,8104],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,1.066728610262888,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.7139899308309823,1.9570915389266579,2.0477128419653545,2.0881990796736947,2.1653408989309972,2.2391270689902285,2.346825985579986,4.568864643066313,2.498193474075453,5.137432284239405,2.7049353070058615,2.617923930016232,2.757740698455715,2.7678802023081546,5.900913137266729,3.189397019426827,3.1419947805322432,3.239158528985891,3.3467891931782563,3.3220965805878846,3.4572130107926293,3.558633189238533,3.865219416329466,3.90413483257914,4.2860694432771105,4.2860694432771105,4.506310234933358,4.724033718778229,5.0768550934009715,5.102830579804232,5.408212229355414,5.604922523601468,5.463272006538442,5.5623629091826725,5.482320201509136,5.463272006538442,5.695894301807195,6.1754673820690815,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.145151322355205E-5,7.096969896588546E-5,7.152142070224943E-5,7.110816917148861E-5,7.110933419878163E-5,7.10099375599319E-5,7.122113106364814E-5,7.097991813880664E-5,7.11395068700318E-5,7.892539951963188E-5,0.4656589730197807,7.086534090158725E-5,7.218800734760018E-5,0.13307549882787187,7.091701516891257E-5,7.072103113679666E-5,7.248507879375273E-5,7.122780394602916E-5,7.100681996175841E-5,7.106567199070909E-5,7.175327404807384E-5,7.129837267572088E-5,7.137955668943363E-5,7.14564601558987E-5,0.0661994960313139,7.162828667318374E-5,0.0826780638289757,7.088640851767555E-5,7.08883048951107E-5,7.106790001468797E-5,0.09467057360987481,7.122367690302344E-5,7.645258367514715E-5,7.142401859591645E-5,7.096356518550154E-5,7.129110881849643E-5,7.089245791981914E-5,7.093435014655933E-5,7.07206758286182E-5,7.07390240346832E-5,7.089824898065928E-5,7.164607527835409E-5,7.128201146191754E-5,7.100018231470129E-5,7.186290897806262E-5,7.102743257265236E-5,7.338732144857099E-5,7.230813949549266E-5,7.075660654931288E-5,7.091298297685032E-5,7.088838768269521E-5,7.288345338452698E-5,7.091403802684742E-5,7.07327440258132E-5,7.150913711785183E-5,7.09323036005278E-5,7.62798968605605E-5,7.087384616559717E-5,7.07557882897499E-5,7.109362641201E-5,0.1007490756297789,7.10889231642356E-5,7.074269831073295E-5,7.090741184898827E-5,7.072153120771105E-5,7.235788085595312E-5,7.1330764000921

{"value":"I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened.....I was mad because I could have used that time doing something else....I tried to figure it all out, but really had no clue. Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth.

{"value":"What were they thinking at \"Cannes\"? One of the most irritating, films of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how meaningless was shown. If I had to watch her put on those boots one more time I think I would have shouted. If the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had, then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over. The whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think I passed up \"Tumbleweeds\" to see this over-hyped film of boredom. It was like watching grass grow, only that is more

{"value":"Watching \"Kroko\" I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life. I would not recommend to watch this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development e.g. Kroko the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot-wise chances to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolving plot. I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed: camera appeared shaky rather than motivated. Pictures were low - contrast, gray and dark - i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu. The story had certain potential though, it could have made a good short

{"value":"Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii... Full of clichés, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do however, it does provide 40 minutes of simple, unpretensive entertainment, endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. On the other hand, If you are looking for anything more than that, stay away...<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, if you have ever worked in a Hotel or know anything about running one, you have two options: 1. You will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents Hotel Business or, 2.

{"value":"This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!!

The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he has acted in 164 movies at this date!!

One by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.<br /><br />It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit.

{"value":"SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film. A group of thugs pull off a paramilitary-like robbery of the payroll at Camp Pendleton in California. They high-jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to Mexico. Along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows. These aren't just any run-of-the-mill scarecrows...they can kill. The acting is no better than the horrible dialog. And the attempts at humor are not funny. Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark.<br /><br />The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J.

{"value":"This is an attempt, by both author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers, at an Arabian \"Tarzan of the Apes\". But, this desert-set film shows none of the majesty present in Burroughs' more successful jungle adventure. The focus is on the love between handsome English noble Jon Hall (as \"El 'Lion\" Chatham) and exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke (as \"Princess\" Eulilah), with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge. The opening states that, although guilty of conduct unbecoming, the lad's mother is living - but, she never re-enters the picture. Unfortunately, \"The Lion Man\" has deteriorated, and is looks like it's missing footage.<br /><br />*** The Lion Man (1936) John P.

{"value":"This is a great idea for a film but it, unfortunately, doesn't turn out to be a great movie. What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots, with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious \"dash\" of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but, in the end, this slick, well-produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything.

{"value":"Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad script, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound, and bad music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be western flavored, it's not. It tries to be hard core violent, it's not. It tries to present a fresh look at an old genre, it doesn't. The actors try there best, and my heart goes out to them. But with such inane material to work with it's hard to make something shine. To me this has all of the looks of a \"fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire\" first attempt. Freshmen film makers often bite off more that they, or their budget, can chew.

{"value":"To be honest I knew what to expect before I watched this film, and I've got to say it has the worst acting I've ever seen. It does have its moments, and on a comedy level its very entertaining, but i'm afraid its not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There's a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is all over the place. I have no idea why the aliens were evil, and why they even came to this remote part of wales, (i mean who'd go there anyway?) but I didn't care at that point, because I was amused by the costumes, and the bad CGI. As far as B-movies go, this deserves the title of 'being so bad, its good', and kudos to the film-makers, because they probably knew what they were doing.

{"value":"The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes. It gives the basic summary of what is going on. This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them. The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the plot change, but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but know people who have. From my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better. Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters.","finished_norm":["the","movi","start","out","with","some","scroll","text","which","take","nearli","five","minut","it","give","the","basic","summari","of","what","be","go","on","thi","can","have","easili","be","do","with","act","but","instead","you","get","a","scroll","text","effect","soon","after","you","be","bombard","with","charact","that","you","learn","a","littl","about","keep","in","mind","thi","be","all","you","will","learn","about","them","the","plot","start","to","get","off","the","grind","and","then","crash","through","the","entir","movi","not","onli","doe","the","plot","chang","but","you","mai","even","ask","yourself","if","your","watch","the","same","movi","i","have","never","plai","the","video","game","but","know","peopl","who","have","from","my","understand","whether","you","have","plai","the","game","or","not","thi","movi","doe","not","get","ani","well","save","your","monei","unless","you","like","to","sleep","at","the","theater"],"filtered":["movi","start","scroll","text","take","nearli","five","minut","give","basic","summari","go","thi","easili","act","instead","get","scroll","text","effect","soon","bombard","charact","learn","littl","keep","mind","thi","learn","plot","start","get","grind","crash","entir","movi","onli","doe","plot","chang","mai","even","ask","watch","movi","never","plai","video","game","know","peopl","understand","whether","plai","game","thi","movi","doe","get","ani","well","save","monei","unless","like","sleep","theater"],"filtered2":["start","scroll","text","take","nearli","five","minut","give","basic","summari","go","easili","act","instead","get","scroll","text","effect","soon","bombard","charact","learn","littl","keep","mind","learn","plot","start","get","grind","crash","entir","onli","doe","plot","chang","mai","even","ask","watch","never","plai","video","game","know","peopl","understand","whether","plai","game","doe","get","ani","well","save","monei","unless","like","sleep","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,7,10,11,14,18,20,21,23,26,27,30,31,32,40,42,46,59,71,106,126,134,152,189,198,212,238,240,278,286,306,374,424,430,449,460,505,583,597,611,732,1064,1183,1839,2162,6182,7441],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,7,10,11,14,18,20,21,23,26,27,30,31,32,40,42,46,59,71,106,126,134,152,189,198,212,238,240,278,286,306,374,424,430,449,460,505,583,597,611,732,1064,1183,1839,2162,6182,7441],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.389902141215977,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,3.2569937516641474,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,1.8693254449200722,3.8429853485101932,2.159084361316692,2.2391270689902285,2.2443961816702407,2.3131195476980753,2.498193474075453,2.5439726117360975,2.5983793339432615,2.597304642813496,2.7666071276613566,2.8336934208777267,2.780700890737216,2.8739486825973213,6.914426021585259,3.212973749990824,6.437911643336743,3.2597778161886266,3.216957819005698,3.3956930001684253,3.4986697244709752,3.4986697244709752,3.520060914452293,3.7099788181381825,4.105687751300982,4.315570107673808,4.760735085628657,10.286208957884345,13.451027437976705,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.165383169193009E-5,8.110322081572387E-5,8.173372102165923E-5,8.126146271085759E-5,8.126279408843392E-5,8.114920494170744E-5,8.139055404725991E-5,8.111489914957702E-5,8.129727501275318E-5,9.019488878326636E-5,0.6961243742682858,8.098396181848976E-5,8.249548730612216E-5,8.367230355977475E-5,8.104301447863123E-5,8.08190465533806E-5,8.28349765733225E-5,8.139817972781248E-5,8.114564219229799E-5,8.12128975022259E-5,8.1998679917882E-5,8.147882472631562E-5,8.157160072912799E-5,8.16594849799152E-5,8.228617957482913E-5,8.18558460209852E-5,8.529691028445596E-5,8.100803760779938E-5,8.10102047625163E-5,8.121544365816815E-5,8.294165890038138E-5,8.13934633983777E-5,8.736898797779343E-5,0.04741782385208445,8.109621121370836E-5,8.147052368763246E-5,8.101495078349272E-5,8.106282465875608E-5,8.081864051195622E-5,8.083960859593775E-5,8.102156873020686E-5,8.187617460056433E-5,8.146012735046028E-5,8.113805677820134E-5,8.212396924650477E-5,8.116919800776967E-5,8.386604738705477E-5,8.263277271467763E-5,8.085970165800911E-5,8.103840654358344E-5,8.101029937105834E-5,0.25016057002039166,8.103961224057996E-5,8.083243188596817E-5,8.171968350603887E-5,8.106048589337984E-5,8.717164380049719E-5,8.099368152020954E-5,8.085876656194718E-5,8.124484344023294E-5,8.20507240057756E-5,8.123946863171105E-5,8.08438075093634E-5,8.103203993332904E-5,8.081961802771943E-5,8.26896164747595E-5,8.151584109863477E-

{"value":"Not too keen on this really. The story is pretty horrid and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. After that it was pretty appalling. Tim doesn't fit the role, he comes across as a smug self inflated ass & Pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player. It's a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it. There's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates, he's completely self indulgent. I find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe i'm watching the wrong film. If you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this

{"value":"This might be unbelievable, but this movie has grossed $878,138 in Russia! It's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh \"movie\", which had almost no screening around the world. That's some kind of enigma! Haha! Maybe it was based on the fact that another movie, \"Pledge This\" with Paris Hilton, which was as well released only DVD almost everywhere, had major screenings in Russia and grossed more than 1mln$. Besides, both movies had a lot of promotion, like there were the banners all over the city, TV commercials and etc. Speaking about movie, I'd say it's dull and absolutely boring. It could be better, really. Even if it has Jessica Simpson.","finished_norm":["thi","mai","be","unbeliev","but","thi","movi","have","gross","in","russia","it","show","in","almost","all","cinema","theater","and","still","run","good","i","have","no","idea","why","distributor","put","their","ey","on","thi","particular","uh","movi","which","have","almost","no","screen","around","the","world","that","some","kind","of","enigma","haha","mayb","it","be","base","on","the","fact","that","anoth","movi","pledg","thi","with","pari","hilton","which","be","a","good","releas","onli","dvd","almost","everywher","have","major","screen","in","russia","and","gross","much","than","mln","besid","both","movi","have","a","lot","of","promot","like","there","be","the","banner","all","over","the","citi","tv","commerci","and","etc","speak","about","movi","i","have","sai","it","dull","and","absolut","bore","it","can","be","well","realli","even","if","it","have","jessica","simpson"],"filtered":["thi","mai","unbeliev","thi","movi","gross","russia","show","almost","cinema","theater","still","run","good","idea","distributor","put","ey","thi","particular","uh","movi","almost","screen","around","world","kind","enigma","haha","mayb","base","fact","anoth","movi","pledg","thi","pari","hilton","good","releas","onli","dvd","almost","everywher","major","screen","russia","gross","much","mln","besid","movi","lot","promot","like","banner","citi","tv","commerci","etc","speak","movi","sai","dull","absolut","bore","well","realli","even","jessica","simpson"],"filtered2":["mai","unbeliev","gross","russia","show","almost","cinema","theater","still","run","good","idea","distributor","put","ey","particular","uh","almost","screen","around","world","kind","enigma","haha","mayb","base","fact","anoth","pledg","pari","hilton","good","releas","onli","dvd","almost","everywher","major","screen","russia","gross","mln","besid","lot","promot","like","banner","citi","tv","commerci","etc","speak","dull","absolut","bore","well","realli","even","jessica","simpson"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,11,13,20,28,46,64,72,73,97,98,108,122,123,131,137,159,163,165,172,192,222,247,281,327,334,344,367,404,409,424,429,571,595,832,972,1125,1477,1655,1894,2003,2024,2126,3716,3771,4693,5478,6876],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,11,13,20,28,46,64,72,73,97,98,108,122,123,131,137,159,163,165,172,192,222,247,281,327,334,344,367,404,409,424,429,571,595,832,972,1125,1477,1655,1894,2003,2024,2126,3716,3771,4693,5478,6876],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.655771293751733,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,2.0545557924622586,2.0881990796736947,2.138507503627933,2.2489347673732487,2.2619070973220485,6.753635424615902,2.2939035841256437,2.300267965194495,2.4000574358028657,2.448847599972298,2.5001408943598484,5.063653426867979,2.5771019354959765,2.7303758068497004,2.832333801361687,2.9674191958529437,2.942840385588056,2.983093497946387,3.0791938792932125,3.1419947805322432,3.2209578243390444,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.467417180966871,3.6284289511740746,3.7987743169213135,3.9911462095687695,4.240607069200353,4.589376833631972,9.521470171257315,5.1994574154933035,5.214056214914456,5.322690055917252,4.933754249760298,5.7959777603641776,11.814406790948803,6.032366538428407,6.255510089742618,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.101405119623479E-5,7.053518684728866E-5,7.10835306662592E-5,7.067280926879133E-5,7.06739671632025E-5,7.057517908046557E-5,7.078507955154857E-5,7.054534345330396E-5,7.070395510221484E-5,7.844217860907316E-5,0.4223163409170739,7.04314677154401E-5,7.174603613359003E-5,7.276950910422474E-5,7.048282560696419E-5,7.028804148746237E-5,7.20412887592414E-5,7.079171157919437E-5,7.057208056979289E-5,7.063057227708299E-5,7.131396448952729E-5,7.086184825170264E-5,7.094253521613508E-5,7.10189678409786E-5,7.156400193338385E-5,7.118974235008066E-5,7.418242387784534E-5,7.045240634500834E-5,7.045429111186897E-5,7.063278665998076E-5,7.213407000512433E-5,7.078760980401739E-5,7.59845025843586E-5,7.098672490450982E-5,7.052909062098695E-5,7.085462886745804E-5,7.045841870967564E-5,7.050005445117693E-5,7.02876883546589E-5,7.030592422379693E-5,7.046417431473464E-5,7.12074220444816E-5,7.084558720946232E-5,7.056548356174266E-5,7.142292817944606E-5,7.059256697993695E-5,7.293800743166794E-5,7.186543277217568E-5,7.032339908944694E-5,7.047881810200561E-5,7.045437339258634E-5,7.243722430081642E-5,7.047986669245709E-5,7.029968266429334E-5,7.107132228813074E-5,7.049802043512743E-5,7.581287304512683E-5,7.043992090595473E-5,7.032258583967971E-5,7.065835554738564E-5,7.135922705033499E-5,7.06536810952548E-5,7.03095760040845E-5,7.047328108338464E-5,7.02885384

is good from the two leads, Cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to.<br /><br />The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn't interesting, Succo is not a unique character, he isn't interesting or exciting.<br /><br />Films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it.","finished_norm":["for","a","film","about","a","killer","thi","be","surprisingli","dullbr","br","noth","much","happen","and","even","when","thing","do","happen","thei","do","not","gener","ani","real","excit","or","interestbr","br","the","act","be","good","from","the","two","lead","cassetti","in","particular","deliv","a","great","perform","combin","the","certainti","and","stupid","of","succo","but","the","rest","of","the","cast","conjur","do","what","thei","ne","tobr","br","the","problem","be","that","there","be","poor","write","and","direct","and","the","fact","that","a","a","true","stori","it","be","not","interest","succo","be","not","a","uniqu","charact","he","be","not","interest","or","excitingbr","br","film","of","thi","sort","normal","try","to","gener","tension","or","empathi","or","outrag","and","thi","gener","noth","except","a","feel","of","regret","that","you","wast","your","time","watch","it"],"filtered":["film","killer","thi","surprisingli","dullbr","br","noth","much","happen","even","thing","happen","thei","gener","ani","real","excit","interestbr","br","act","good","two","lead","cassetti","particular","deliv","great","perform","combin","certainti","stupid","succo","rest","cast","conjur","thei","ne","tobr","br","problem","poor","write","direct","fact","true","stori","interest","succo","uniqu","charact","interest","excitingbr","br","film","thi","sort","normal","try","gener","tension","empathi","outrag","thi","gener","noth","except","feel","regret","wast","time","watch"],"filtered2":["killer","surprisingli","dullbr","noth","happen","even","thing","happen","gener","ani","real","excit","interestbr","act","good","two","lead","cassetti","particular","deliv","great","perform","combin","certainti","stupid","succo","rest","cast","conjur","ne","tobr","problem","poor","write","direct","fact","true","stori","interest","succo","uniqu","charact","interest","excitingbr","sort","normal","try","gener","tension","empathi","outrag","gener","noth","except","feel","regret","wast","time","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,10,17,21,27,29,36,39,43,47,49,51,60,65,80,89,92,94,97,102,105,110,136,146,157,167,225,226,233,252,269,304,517,524,700,832,886,968,1301,1406,1677,1738,3348,3863,5564,6349],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,10,17,21,27,29,36,39,43,47,49,51,60,65,80,89,92,94,97,102,105,110,136,146,157,167,225,226,233,252,269,304,517,524,700,832,886,968,1301,1406,1677,1738,3348,3863,5564,6349],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,3.3840606616174704,1.7139899308309823,3.676353282473182,1.9073850067444174,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,4.16224563969396,2.0545557924622586,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1290479736304078,2.346825985579986,2.326138445979858,2.3360150694757706,2.4609576687888097,7.923658477859261,2.5940874818617203,2.6102777977348763,3.0433232530252132,2.76533567167316,2.871119826396843,3.4198487640477615,3.4028786598293,3.616452760127359,3.7987743169213135,3.944626193933877,3.9911462095687695,4.3773181147422555,4.429617614145104,4.679973728984199,4.751432692966343,5.5623629091826725,5.7446844659766265,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.692556280565555E-5,8.633940341411936E-5,8.701060994679981E-5,8.650786171557212E-5,8.650927904948936E-5,8.638835636523535E-5,8.664528744119443E-5,8.635183572405243E-5,8.654598612973782E-5,9.601804725171022E-5,0.8595931080603262,8.6212444822717E-5,8.782155735283387E-5,8.907435116603228E-5,8.627531003812214E-5,8.603688230546804E-5,8.818296471126877E-5,8.665340545060161E-5,8.63845635977542E-5,8.645616104206286E-5,8.729267510770279E-5,8.673925704797424E-5,8.68380228510262E-5,8.693158108097252E-5,8.759873630493908E-5,8.714061957499585E-5,9.080384567908308E-5,8.6238074992084E-5,8.624038206254905E-5,8.64588715828138E-5,8.82965346580656E-5,8.664838462571198E-5,9.300970076191572E-5,0.06443439769025477,8.633194125848481E-5,8.673042007799434E-5,8.624543449592437E-5,8.629639920223059E-5,8.603645004921496E-5,8.60587718737183E-5,8.625247971022509E-5,8.716226060744149E-5,8.671935253295593E-5,8.63764884544841E-5,8.742605336048541E-5,8.640964022275505E-5,8.928060347382327E-5,8.796770617593764E-5,8.608016218318511E-5,8.627040460577315E-5,8.624048277920365E-5,8.866761414622447E-5,8.627168814492647E-5,8.605113182131324E-5,8.699566614170934E-5,8.629390944158631E-5,9.279961565846808E-5,8.62227920473945E-5,8.607916671549208E-5,8.64901694723236E-5,8.734807926372483E-5,8.648444765564878E-5,8.606324187720904E-5,8.62636269547057E-5,8.603749067530815E-5,8.802821

{"value":"The idea was awesome, the actors were incredible, the story could of been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I couldn't really get into this movie.

You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. The movie had so much to give, but couldn't. Just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should, right?

{"value":"If this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history. Mark Anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted. He died a coward's death by committing suicide and even then, he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave chose to kill himself instead. In the real story Mark Anthony was ashamed by the slave's great valor and decided to copy him. But even in death Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt. He cried out for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She hauled his litter up on ropes and Mark Anthony died a while later. If you want history don't watch this movie. If you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it!","finished_norm":["if","thi","book","remain","faith","to","the","book","then","we","can","onli","assum","that","the","author","be","ignor","of","histori","mark","anthoni","never","die","of","injuri","obtain","in","battl","a","depict","he","die","a","coward","death","by","commit","suicid","and","even","then","he","ask","hi","slave","to","do","it","for","him","the","slave","choos","to","kill","himself","instead","in","the","real","stori","mark","anthoni","be","asham","by","the","slave","great","valor","and","decid","to","copi","him","but","even","in","death","mark","anthoni","be","a","drunken","failur","and","fail","at","hi","own","suicid","attempt","he","cry","out","for","cleopatra","and","be","take","to","her","ble","she","haul","hi","litter","up","on","rope","and","mark","anthoni","die","a","while","late","if","you","want","histori","do","not","watch","thi","movi","if","you","want","romant","drivel","then","you","will","probabl","enjoi","it"],"filtered":["thi","book","remain","faith","book","onli","assum","author","ignor","histori","mark","anthoni","never","die","injuri","obtain","battl","depict","die","coward","death","commit","suicid","even","ask","hi","slave","slave","choos","kill","instead","real","stori","mark","anthoni","asham","slave","great","valor","decid","copi","even","death","mark","anthoni","drunken","failur","fail","hi","suicid","attempt","cry","cleopatra","take","ble","haul","hi","litter","rope","mark","anthoni","die","late","want","histori","watch","thi","movi","want","romant","drivel","probabl","enjoi"],"filtered2":["book","remain","faith","book","onli","assum","author","ignor","histori","mark","anthoni","never","die","injuri","obtain","battl","depict","die","coward","death","commit","suicid","even","ask","slave","slave","choos","kill","instead","real","stori","mark","anthoni","asham","slave","great","valor","decid","copi","even","death","mark","anthoni","drunken","failur","fail","suicid","attempt","cry","cleopatra","take","ble","haul","litter","rope","mark","anthoni","die","late","want","histori","watch","want","romant","drivel","probabl","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,11,17,31,37,42,51,76,80,148,150,151,152,177,200,215,245,249,293,306,499,584,682,717,747,763,786,856,864,920,969,1011,1072,1112,1267,1372,1585,1710,1940,2385,2622,3053,3526,3780,3921,4170,7086,7956],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,11,17,31,37,42,51,76,80,148,150,151,152,177,200,215,245,249,293,306,499,584,682,717,747,763,786,856,864,920,969,1011,1072,1112,1267,1372,1585,1710,1940,2385,2622,3053,3526,3780,3921,4170,7086,7956],"values":[1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.4070669811451506,2.975308642954861,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,2.1337665533324026,1.9951803900462557,2.3018654096236517,2.332712011146513,5.6004909736203725,2.3131195476980753,2.458149992634611,2.5308211829319704,2.605934685587711,5.500405948648577,2.6754694156628323,8.703688883604642,2.8739486825973213,6.762949502332293,3.5146700658174166,3.6497387377608255,14.959327125151454,3.7465885637507435,3.7465885637507435,3.900174431363043,3.900174431363043,3.9782428047328615,3.952924996748572,4.0536665665501035,4.086456389373095,4.268777946167049,4.2574141875167335,4.327618446189983,8.913660355339978,4.597282013139085,19.43541176634872,4.85885294158718,16.22463668806624,5.339219357868463,5.482320201509136,5.695894301807195,5.719991853386255,5.822646007446338,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.309167241365043E-5,5.2733662854745395E-5,5.3143616799301896E-5,5.283655241527762E-5,5.2837418082701626E-5,5.2763561931155656E-5,5.29204881571981E-5,5.2741256157624404E-5,5.2859837727934985E-5,5.86451044542968E-5,0.7339716505251583,5.2656120142023444E-5,5.36389205124584E-5,5.4404091499972E-5,5.2694516435527644E-5,5.254889152764292E-5,5.3859657893530155E-5,5.292544640747783E-5,5.27612454161726E-5,5.280497510783291E-5,5.3315894212741784E-5,5.297788213221494E-5,5.303820548810773E-5,5.309534820580306E-5,0.10794702980457195,5.322302299890554E-5,5.546041777689688E-5,5.267177432373961E-5,5.2673183417053615E-5,5.280663062937304E-5,5.3929023201234335E-5,5.292237982980282E-5,5.6807691601416964E-5,5.307124267468888E-5,5.2729105181379105E-5,5.2972484761175185E-5,5.267626930029666E-5,5.270739709981309E-5,5.2548627517763134E-5,5.2562261056114276E-5,5.2680572317702186E-5,5.3236240728744864E-5,5.296572501804972E-5,5.275631334731562E-5,5.339735787285834E-5,5.277656150866385E-5,5.4530064569416255E-5,5.372818407532096E-5,5.257532565145751E-5,5.2691520336349055E-5,5.267324493193439E-5,5.4155668045269486E-5,5.269230428571975E-5,5.2557594728437814E-5,5.313448954629521E-5,5.270587642451059E-5,5.667937756891347E-5,5.266243993386876E-5,5.2

{"value":"As a member of the cast, I was a member of the band at all the basketball games, I would like to let the world know after being in the movie, that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. Seems that the U of O sign was shown. While we were shooting, we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met. Quite a time for a young 20 year old. BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's despite what Hollywood may think.

{"value":"A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon, then other parts felt like some other movie, I don't know which, but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie. It was kind of nice to watch, but it would have been fantastic! if the story would have been more original. The theme little girl, bad assassin from Leon, is just tweaked a little. The opening scenes are really good :-) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts was from Leon, Nikita and if they where from the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon.<br /><br />Best Regards /Rick","finished_norm":["a","lot","of","theme","or","part","of","the","stori","be","the","same","a","in","leon","then","other","part","feel","like","some","other","movi","i","do","not","know","which","but","there","be","a","familiar","feel","over","the","whole","movi","it","be","kind","of","nice","to","watch","but","it","would","have","be","fantast","if","the","stori","would","have","be","much","origin","the","theme","littl","girl","bad","assassin","from","leon","be","just","tweak","a","littl","the","open","scene","be","realli","good","it","be","strang","that","peopl","like","to","fight","in","the","kitchen","in","the","movi","my","big","problem","be","to","rememb","which","part","be","from","leon","nikita","and","if","thei","where","from","the","french","or","american","version","if","you","have","not","see","leon","then","thi","be","a","good","movi","if","you","like","thi","movi","then","i","can","recommend","leonbr","br","well","regard","rick"],"filtered":["lot","theme","part","stori","leon","part","feel","like","movi","know","familiar","feel","whole","movi","kind","nice","watch","fantast","stori","much","origin","theme","littl","girl","bad","assassin","leon","tweak","littl","open","scene","realli","good","strang","peopl","like","fight","kitchen","movi","big","problem","rememb","part","leon","nikita","thei","french","american","version","see","leon","thi","good","movi","like","thi","movi","recommend","leonbr","br","well","regard","rick"],"filtered2":["lot","theme","part","stori","leon","part","feel","like","know","familiar","feel","whole","kind","nice","watch","fantast","stori","origin","theme","littl","girl","bad","assassin","leon","tweak","littl","open","scene","realli","good","strang","peopl","like","fight","kitchen","big","problem","rememb","part","leon","nikita","french","american","version","see","leon","good","like","recommend","leonbr","well","regard","rick"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,13,14,17,19,20,23,26,43,61,69,72,82,84,111,122,167,220,223,232,242,262,290,298,417,533,899,1019,1095,1395,1809,2661,2717,3737],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,13,14,17,19,20,23,26,43,61,69,72,82,84,111,122,167,220,223,232,242,262,290,298,417,533,899,1019,1095,1395,1809,2661,2717,3737],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,3.321622407243643,5.645555114217758,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,2.2212694515902225,2.1183455303375887,2.2489347673732487,2.4609576687888097,2.8336934208777267,2.825563294794476,2.8377834061292515,2.689504733779216,2.726701583487816,2.8612813773965557,2.7819920465008363,3.1932880749197934,6.986785334740263,4.197121957260614,4.091229668125752,4.1554492608600455,4.403125998698128,5.014723312293965,5.541743621979936,5.274680836730892,25.02204035897047]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.537414615337023E-5,9.473101598920285E-5,9.546745930783958E-5,9.491584731090997E-5,9.491740240020485E-5,9.478472683977063E-5,9.506662989796136E-5,9.47446566365143E-5,9.4957677163157E-5,0.09495037992024631,0.5172536754051937,9.459171787181352E-5,9.63572253781348E-5,9.773178237130793E-5,9.466069316571434E-5,9.439909185204773E-5,9.675375911472202E-5,9.507553692358978E-5,9.47805654406563E-5,9.485912167770901E-5,9.577693931593432E-5,9.516973272205269E-5,9.527809790061695E-5,9.538074936479787E-5,9.611274761460881E-5,9.561010500239362E-5,9.962937218419121E-5,9.461983912222878E-5,9.462237042451337E-5,9.486209566489289E-5,9.687836730079324E-5,9.507002810810007E-5,1.0204962162834606E-4,9.533744606800821E-5,9.472282856194742E-5,9.516003685769229E-5,9.462791392062216E-5,9.468383205553008E-5,9.439861758337778E-5,9.442310893993476E-5,9.463564388263462E-5,9.563384939845803E-5,9.514789362129574E-5,9.477170544746679E-5,0.3804492379980619,9.48080793458951E-5,9.795808102400355E-5,9.65175788894029E-5,9.444657824442365E-5,9.46553109581485E-5,9.462248093015321E-5,9.728551323342652E-5,9.465671924872323E-5,9.441472632553251E-5,9.545106306483828E-5,9.468110030680267E-5,1.0181911765788967E-4,9.460307077752759E-5,9.444548602392854E-5,9.489643549994318E-5,9.583772838537946E-5,9.4890157560955E-5,9.44280133978695E-5,9.464787456472613E-5,9.439975935136754E-5,9.658397412119569E-5,9.521296896498805E-5,9.50101514006872E-5,9.492706072925818E-5,9.527308495512916E-5,9.43963154984332E-5,9.492905083061825E-5,9.64687370169527E-5,9.456547893913591E-5,9.690592527113954E-5,9.481550045809023E-5,9.55575741081249E-5,9.4973568252389E-5,9.436671947333418E-5,9.448369350328257E-5]}}
{"value":"The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dismal standards. Poor screenplay(almost non existent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer. some of the scenes were funny, but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration. The editing was pathetic. Dismal! overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident. In fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval.<br /><br />One wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie. Not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie. wait till it appears on
