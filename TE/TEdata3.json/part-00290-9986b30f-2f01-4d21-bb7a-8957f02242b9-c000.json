{"value":"It is difficult to find any positives in this movie. Seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of Galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots of the two cops & a lot less of Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun. Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate. Ms Stabs whom I had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright this is real garbage.","finished_norm":["it","be","difficult","to","find","ani","posit","in","thi","movi","seem","a","though","the","produc","ne","to","make","a","buck","without","much","effort","henc","we","be","treat","to","a","full","show","of","galaxi","which","be","the","lame","excus","for","a","movi","in","histori","the","polic","girl","look","extrem","sexi","in","their","littl","uniform","much","action","shot","of","the","two","cop","a","lot","littl","of","galaxi","would","have","be","the","wai","to","go","of","cours","that","would","add","to","the","budget","so","thei","decid","to","fill","the","space","with","that","wretch","rerun","m","albright","doe","excel","look","sexi","her","act","be","rate","m","stab","whom","i","have","hear","of","but","not","see","on","screen","befor","conjur","look","veri","desir","but","seem","to","lack","basic","act","talent","apart","from","m","albright","thi","be","real","garbag"],"filtered":["difficult","find","ani","posit","thi","movi","seem","though","produc","ne","make","buck","without","much","effort","henc","treat","full","show","galaxi","lame","excus","movi","histori","polic","girl","look","extrem","sexi","littl","uniform","much","action","shot","two","cop","lot","littl","galaxi","wai","go","cours","add","budget","thei","decid","fill","space","wretch","rerun","m","albright","doe","excel","look","sexi","act","rate","m","stab","hear","see","screen","befor","conjur","look","veri","desir","seem","lack","basic","act","talent","apart","m","albright","thi","real","garbag"],"filtered2":["difficult","find","ani","posit","seem","though","produc","ne","make","buck","without","effort","henc","treat","full","show","galaxi","lame","excus","histori","polic","girl","look","extrem","sexi","littl","uniform","action","shot","two","cop","lot","littl","galaxi","wai","go","cours","add","budget","decid","fill","space","wretch","rerun","m","albright","doe","excel","look","sexi","act","rate","m","stab","hear","see","screen","befor","conjur","look","veri","desir","seem","lack","basic","act","talent","apart","m","albright","real","garbag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,14,15,16,18,21,27,28,33,35,38,39,47,72,79,80,84,86,110,125,129,183,192,199,202,216,249,256,261,276,286,299,329,336,372,401,441,471,476,499,509,553,572,580,617,637,702,803,849,1087,1182,1221,1407,1584,2274,2611,2714,3418,6933],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,14,15,16,18,21,27,28,33,35,38,39,47,72,79,80,84,86,110,125,129,183,192,199,202,216,249,256,261,276,286,299,329,336,372,401,441,471,476,499,509,553,572,580,617,637,702,803,849,1087,1182,1221,1407,1584,2274,2611,2714,3418,6933],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,3.589841616087325,1.2153159934048174,2.324031090670098,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.9209463754160525,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.031112399272319,2.1290479736304078,2.2242236634876535,2.4106958340079214,2.4885128563647294,2.5318267134339894,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.6070186965339692,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.7085302779237206,2.7884729505849193,2.780700890737216,2.7949961309240425,2.951986790814132,2.9233055795674137,3.070535816550098,3.0879275592619675,3.293679367864308,3.496027715008137,3.6105180246075443,3.3814747511661465,3.360519385990158,3.454678155189441,3.4933926673701317,3.5039747767006686,3.5119855004467477,3.7432044657665027,3.6466665387238555,3.7636829971100436,3.880604335168946,8.352137096125563,4.327618446189983,13.412157869491967,4.443131333311827,4.706176101378222,5.0768550934009715,5.243909178064138,5.408212229355414,5.626901430320244,13.321950395701563]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.03185681864952857,0.03118808882203051,6.185568966327625E-5,6.149828682943111E-5,6.149929440962147E-5,6.141333068594408E-5,6.159598253620803E-5,6.138736822632342E-5,6.152538940844611E-5,6.825906100999611E-5,0.7314968358452825,6.128827547958642E-5,6.243219074873643E-5,6.33227996683688E-5,6.133296625071299E-5,6.116346839467925E-5,6.268911460456322E-5,6.16017536148257E-5,6.14106344142087E-5,6.14615329115132E-5,6.205620929034591E-5,6.166278536448732E-5,6.17329978002657E-5,6.179950818147717E-5,6.227378765746453E-5,6.194811327942891E-5,6.455229427757816E-5,6.130649592193653E-5,6.130813601427474E-5,6.146345983016844E-5,6.276985128010699E-5,6.15981843192373E-5,6.612043277849525E-5,6.177145092189324E-5,6.137322528572204E-5,6.16565031780623E-5,6.131172778028005E-5,6.1347958500407E-5,6.116316110446877E-5,6.117902965027071E-5,6.13167362107423E-5,6.196349785135375E-5,6.16486352797491E-5,6.140489380905254E-5,6.2151027

{"value":"First of all when I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel, would be doing martial arts and I was fine with that... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the movie couldn't have realated to anyone, the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked... along with the plot. If you really think about it's a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen, the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil.

{"value":"When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I had so wrong. This movie was exactly as every other horror movies. It's a virus, zombies etc. Exactly as Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. It's bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK but the rest is total crap. Don't see this \"horror\" movie, go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies. We have seen enough of that. The only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous, infected

{"value":"The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I got out of it! I didn't get anything! In the first half there's a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. The first half-hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, underlit chase scene. There's always an irritating sound in the background whether it's a loud watch ticking, a blaring siren, a train whistling, or even the horrible score by Quincy Jones. There are a lot of parts that are laughably bad, too. Like, the bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with a CAR! Or, the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times.

{"value":"Some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death.. I personally think that this movie is a disgust, which should have never been released. This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come. The appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them. Such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering.. \"Kill Bill\" would be another example but at least \"Kill Bill\" has its purpose, meaning, climax and

{"value":"Faces are slashed, throats are cut, blood squirts, and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die. They even blow up Kevin Costner's dog with a shotgun. Why would anyone want to see a movie like this? Violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys, not the other way around. Take for instance Underworld and Underworld Evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain. In this movie, the good guys are cut up. See the difference? Why would anyone want to MAKE a movie that depresses the audience? Beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent. Let's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse.","finished_norm":["face","be","slash","throat","be","cut","blood","squirt","and","in","end","the","three","main","charact","be","either","depress","or","thei","die","thei","even","blow","up","kevin","costner","dog","with","a","shotgun","why","would","anyon","want","to","see","a","movi","like","thi","violenc","be","valid","onli","when","the","good","gui","kill","the","bad","gui","not","the","other","wai","around","take","for","instanc","underworld","and","underworld","evolut","where","you","can","enjoi","see","justic","do","when","the","demon","be","slai","in","thi","movi","the","good","gui","be","cut","up","see","the","differ","why","would","anyon","want","to","make","a","movi","that","depress","the","audienc","beauti","photographi","and","skill","edit","in","a","motion","pictur","like","thi","be","a","wast","of","talent","let","put","thi","on","into","the","categori","of","the","exquisit","corps"],"filtered":["face","slash","throat","cut","blood","squirt","end","three","main","charact","either","depress","thei","die","thei","even","blow","kevin","costner","dog","shotgun","anyon","want","see","movi","like","thi","violenc","valid","onli","good","gui","kill","bad","gui","wai","around","take","instanc","underworld","underworld","evolut","enjoi","see","justic","demon","slai","thi","movi","good","gui","cut","see","differ","anyon","want","make","movi","depress","audienc","beauti","photographi","skill","edit","motion","pictur","like","thi","wast","talent","let","put","thi","categori","exquisit","corps"],"filtered2":["face","slash","throat","cut","blood","squirt","end","three","main","charact","either","depress","die","even","blow","kevin","costner","dog","shotgun","anyon","want","see","like","violenc","valid","onli","good","gui","kill","bad","gui","wai","around","take","instanc","underworld","underworld","evolut","enjoi","see","justic","demon","slai","good","gui","cut","see","differ","anyon","want","make","depress","audienc","beauti","photographi","skill","edit","motion","pictur","like","wast","talent","let","put","categori","exquisit","corps"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,9,10,11,24,31,33,37,55,76,89,98,124,158,159,168,179,200,204,207,224,251,276,293,303,311,325,348,355,452,609,754,976,1021,1073,1075,1216,1371,1426,1473,1485,1575,1933,2808,3587,3846,4481,4625,5127,5501,6709,7566],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,9,10,11,24,31,33,37,55,76,89,98,124,158,159,168,179,200,204,207,224,251,276,293,303,311,325,348,355,452,609,754,976,1021,1073,1075,1216,1371,1426,1473,1485,1575,1933,2808,3587,3846,4481,4625,5127,5501,6709,7566],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,2.975308642954861,5.86109936677661,2.1337665533324026,1.9940046109572438,2.0881990796736947,2.2323930368088845,4.621394522982961,2.300267965194495,2.4894767118610357,2.507968722980095,2.5308211829319704,2.624524614047584,2.5531798379045583,2.689504733779216,2.6942272927333892,2.7884729505849193,2.9012296278682137,5.736597900110404,2.9203338091782562,2.973659465713028,3.0103169565570433,3.185521045582134,3.41740676039221,3.68099128126493,3.7465885637507435,4.058285512406398,4.076977645418551,4.535724120139652,8.404910606471953,4.280272325592784,4.403125998698128,4.5432147918688095,4.535724120139652,4.679973728984199,4.715065048795469,4.869215728622727,5.3560264761848435,5.719991853386255,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.1754673820690815,12.685042933464494,6.725513718988353,6.543192162194399,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.997903872786691E-5,5.957458604777031E-5,6.003772164699612E-5,5.969082305171651E-5,0.06328654246272793,5.960836380952485E-5,5.9785647435399066E-5,5.958316439888919E-5,5.971712907309751E-5,6.625289487696921E-5,0.43496859219030476,5.948698403491268E-5,6.0597279092503004E-5,6.146171259416301E-5,5.953036132310869E-5,5.936584508934405E-5,6.084665183451869E-5,5.9791248899282767E-5,5.960574678249282E-5,5.965514934885419E-5,0.03149919237266508,5.9850486896914996E-5,5.991863575595072E-5,5.9983191365556686E-5,6.044353154310898E-5,6.012742888929491E-5,0.05266210749189327,5.950466896983226E-5,5.950626085907985E-5,5.9657019634457486E-5,6.092501562092843E-5,5.978778450698225E-5,0.30648027832987657,5.9955958722120855E-5,5.9569437126010686E-5,5.9844389346924484E-5,5.9509747061381075E-5,5.9544912943483314E-5,5.9365546830538395E-5,5.938094899226331E-5,5.951460829169987E-5,6.014236130136419E-5,5.9836752689869235E-5,5.960017489644115E-5,6.032437951603283E-5,5.962304976925004E-5,6.160402763656734E-5,6.069812245362764E-5,5.939570840432233E-5,5.952697655219274E-5,5.9506

Turn down the volume whenever he speaks. Preferably all the way down<br /><br />2) Bo's fantasies are sadly tame, especially by today's standards. A few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model<br /><br />3) The plot is skimpier than Bo's

{"value":"Kirstie Alley, looking a bit slimmer, but only a bit, is in this mess along with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike, bleached blond hair and all. The premise of the movie is about an older woman (50!!!) who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting, inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast, it was torture to watch their scenes. What is there to say about this film.

Spillane wrote trash paperbacks, for sure, but how do you make it worse?

{"value":"my wife is a fanatic as regards this show. That being the case I bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order. I personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire to name a few, the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals. I've seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures serials I saw as a child. I can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though I don't know if it was their own choosing or not.

{"value":"I don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it. Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about. Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner. Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song. Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s. Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out. I don't know what it was that made me hate it so, but if it means trying to watch it again I'm not willing to find out.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","know","what","it","be","about","thi","film","that","make","me","react","so","viscer","against","it","perhap","it","be","the","charact","who","so","unlik","and","be","not","compel","enough","to","care","about","perhap","it","be","the","disorgan","storylin","perhap","it","be","the","fact","that","rob","lowe","wear","a","long","dangli","ear","and","eyelin","perhap","it","be","becaus","at","some","point","in","the","movi","thei","all","break","out","in","song","perhap","it","be","becaus","the","be","never","that","perhap","it","be","becaus","everyth","be","a","garish","hyperbol","perhap","it","be","becaus","a","charact","pump","hi","fist","while","drive","awai","from","the","camera","dure","a","fade","out","i","do","not","know","what","it","be","that","make","me","hate","it","so","but","if","it","mean","try","to","watch","it","again","i","be","not","will","to","find","out"],"filtered":["know","thi","film","make","react","viscer","perhap","charact","unlik","compel","enough","care","perhap","disorgan","storylin","perhap","fact","rob","lowe","wear","long","dangli","ear","eyelin","perhap","becaus","point","movi","thei","break","song","perhap","becaus","never","perhap","becaus","everyth","garish","hyperbol","perhap","becaus","charact","pump","hi","fist","drive","awai","camera","dure","fade","know","make","hate","mean","try","watch","find"],"filtered2":["know","make","react","viscer","perhap","charact","unlik","compel","enough","care","perhap","disorgan","storylin","perhap","fact","rob","lowe","wear","long","dangli","ear","eyelin","perhap","becaus","point","break","song","perhap","becaus","never","perhap","becaus","everyth","garish","hyperbol","perhap","becaus","charact","pump","fist","drive","awai","camera","dure","fade","know","make","hate","mean","try","watch","find"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,10,22,26,36,38,42,66,88,93,97,99,155,193,205,231,239,318,328,339,360,461,514,515,615,1254,1559,1789,2165,2476,2943,4230,4560,7970,8261],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,10,22,26,36,38,42,66,88,93,97,99,155,193,205,231,239,318,328,339,360,461,514,515,615,1254,1559,1789,2165,2476,2943,4230,4560,7970,8261],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,5.191696066944709,2.6649848339420377,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,1.929723173391612,2.0317223413467334,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,2.056430207256609,2.3074766467914385,2.517840471459249,2.571852579609833,2.7049353070058615,2.6593400337329487,20.318804046552746,3.1550424959247185,3.003844442051426,3.028335462059722,3.358217889001879,3.405285399859865,3.3956930001684253,3.5013187326425523,4.34596758485818,4.6295428753573065,4.798834931860927,4.9909126636002465,5.185068678041204,5.463272006538442,6.437831646536572,5.967828017290836,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.849794743383226E-5,8.790118508515476E-5,8.858453298109192E-5,8.807269060580454E-5,8.807413357768134E-5,8.79510235395146E-5,8.821260220659992E-5,8.791384228144348E-5,8.81115046472888E-5,9.775490458864439E-5,0.2965883356656174,8.777192995713999E-5,8.941014950394677E-5,9.068560493325173E-5,8.783593233283676E-5,8.759319171350519E-5,0.6964976495534716,8.822086706157004E-5,8.794716216518073E-5,8.80200547258765E-5,8.88717003801494E-5,8.830827161675686E-5,8.840882398092499E-5,8.850407457290912E-5,8.918329787656263E-5,8.871689433568802E-5,9.244638403623284E-5,8.779802374713862E-5,8.780037254988606E-5,8.80228142972287E-5,8.989371860875246E-5,8.821575541566501E-5,9.46921405302532E-5,8.846389331795098E-5,8.789358794760656E-5,8.829927479603448E-5,8.780551637603835E-5,8.785740297595317E-5,8.759275163822783E-5,8.761547723916456E-5,8.78126890302579E-5,8.873892682981257E-5,8.828800705168613E-5,8.79389409517474E-5,8.900749129392195E-5,8.797269239782479E-5,9.089558811085627E-5,8.955894199314204E-5,8.763725447501657E-5,8.783093816679229E-5,8.780047508839047E-5,9.027151050306874E-5,8.783224492370998E-5,8.760769898689548E-5,8.856931885955309E-5,8.785486817836881E-5,9.44782552260751E-5,8.778246435135086E-5,8.763624100044447E-5,8.805467832998534E-5,8.892810673437938E-5,8.804885301215052E-5,8.762002809993768E-5,8.782403791572078E-5,8.759381108806422E-5,8.962055032170948E-5,8.834839065224868E-5,8.816019564481668E-5,8.808309556928319E-5,8.840417245423605E-5,8.759061552691643E-5,8.80849421901197E-5,8.951362147772986E-5,8.774758277524137E-5,8.991928972953784E-5,8.797957846940112E-5,8.866815076620779E-5,8.812625003517681E-5,8.756315328920211E-5,8.76716938315924E-5]}}
{"value":"For the life of me I can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I'll reiterate, why the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I don't know if she was thrown by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /><br />And the girl Modine was in love with, suddenly she's shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way?

{"value":"This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","terribl","movi","terribl","script","bad","direct","and","nonsens","end","conjur","bad","perform","except","from","clanci","brown","who","be","crimin","underus","here","and","michael","pollard","watch","thi","movi","be","purgatoryy","do","it","to","unload","enough","bad","movi","karma","to","actual","see","a","good","on","far","down","the","linebr","br","the","movi","present","a","father","and","son","who","look","like","thei","can","not","everi","possibli","have","be","relat","the","part","of","the","male","lead","be","not","good","write","and","seem","uncharismat","in","thi","role","you","can","see","the","plot","point","a","mile","awai","the","action","of","the","femal","lead","and","that","of","her","brother","the","cop","conjur","make","no","sens","so","a","major","action","on","her","part","at","the","end","of","the","movi","make","no","sens","scriptwis"],"filtered":["thi","terribl","movi","terribl","script","bad","direct","nonsens","end","conjur","bad","perform","except","clanci","brown","crimin","underus","michael","pollard","watch","thi","movi","purgatoryy","unload","enough","bad","movi","karma","actual","see","good","far","linebr","br","movi","present","father","son","look","like","thei","everi","possibli","relat","part","male","lead","good","write","seem","uncharismat","thi","role","see","plot","point","mile","awai","action","femal","lead","brother","cop","conjur","make","sens","major","action","part","end","movi","make","sens","scriptwis"],"filtered2":["terribl","terribl","script","bad","direct","nonsens","end","conjur","bad","perform","except","clanci","brown","crimin","underus","michael","pollard","watch","purgatoryy","unload","enough","bad","karma","actual","see","good","far","linebr","present","father","son","look","like","everi","possibli","relat","part","male","lead","good","write","seem","uncharismat","role","see","plot","point","mile","awai","action","femal","lead","brother","cop","conjur","make","sens","major","action","part","end","make","sens","scriptwis"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,9,16,24,32,35,39,52,61,65,66,77,85,93,101,102,105,128,129,155,157,166,173,233,342,381,404,411,422,434,466,476,558,649,903,905,1033,1206,1955,5378,6104],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,9,16,24,32,35,39,52,61,65,66,77,85,93,101,102,105,128,129,155,157,166,173,233,342,381,404,411,422,434,466,476,558,649,903,905,1033,1206,1955,5378,6104],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,3.205071257016622,1.1966138720291084,2.6420723132238515,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,3.1077880109725475,1.7122153074726136,3.7637034094785053,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.9463902258768238,2.011190219103739,2.035389827120098,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.3409902041158843,4.821391668015843,2.3074766467914385,4.672030138951541,4.884774065938707,4.8737648638280495,2.6102777977348763,3.112795625839981,3.24941502915308,3.1419947805322432,3.229006157521873,3.2090054908152035,3.4101163271295305,3.4446025032006995,3.6105180246075443,3.4572130107926293,3.6375061693251913,3.948766986599908,3.9121030022283168,4.2574141875167335,4.364659717870332,5.014723312293965,6.214688095222362,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.129751158478036E-5,9.068187112054834E-5,9.13868361988899E-5,9.085880208575615E-5,9.086029070493272E-5,9.073328617588267E-5,9.100313968187962E-5,9.069492871745661E-5,9.089884397943634E-5,0.9927580437874635,1.1745106963231257E-4,9.054852710648357E-5,9.223857046217645E-5,9.355437393795655E-5,9.061455414785646E-5,9.03641346166906E-5,9.261815491844629E-5,9.101166598914732E-5,9.07293026499569E-5,9.080450111045839E-5,9.168308791661277E-5,9.110183551986664E-5,9.120556878034005E-5,9.130383255116512E-5,9.200454255893479E-5,9.152338470261254E-5,9.537085392663481E-5,9.057544635335616E-5,9.057786945866272E-5,9.080734797871697E-5,9.273743690177435E-5,9.100639264027579E-5,9.768765319119081E-5,9.126238019326978E-5,9.0674033653427E-5,9.109255409167597E-5,9.058317600577874E-5,9.06367039981693E-5,9.036368061997205E-5,9.038712512772569E-5,9.059057556136949E-5,9.15461141776558E-5,9.108092990094604E-5,9.072082136479227E-5,9.182317447096508E-5,9.07556405117737E-5,9.377099977105048E-5,9.23920698867387E-5,9.04095912695983E-5,9.060940199523007E-5,9.057797524089344E-5,9.312717995060341E-5,9.061075009039262E-5,9.037910081645929E-5,9.137114079037794E-5,9.063408901422295E-5,9.74670017907658E-5,9.055939474811135E-5,9.04085457345416E-5,9.084022000551636E-5,9.17412786422521E-5,9.083421040825528E-5,9.039181995146116E-5,9.060228346005035E-5,9.036477358468499E-5,9.24556271471521E-5,9.114322369003095E-5,9.094907527902891E-5,9.086953620221055E-5,9.1200770106

{"value":"Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing.

{"value":"I cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is! I want my $3.99 back! Words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap! The dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor's mouths. The movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder. I have shot better movies with my cell phone camera. The gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot. The acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a Saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped, then tried to put on a play in your garage. Don't get me wrong...I wasn't expecting O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable.

{"value":"This movie is not in anyway funny, it tries to be funny with it's lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing, \"when is this gonna end\". One thing you have to hand to them, is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments, which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars. It is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book, even the ones that wasn't funny the first time. It basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes.<br /><br />To sum it all up, this movie is blonde humor gone bad, it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch, it is just that bad.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","not","in","anywai","funni","it","try","to","be","funni","with","it","lame","humor","which","be","so","spindri","and","bore","that","the","movi","be","just","hour","of","tortur","throughout","the","whole","movi","i","be","think","on","thing","when","be","thi","gonna","end","on","thing","you","have","to","hand","to","them","be","that","thei","do","have","a","veri","few","mildli","funni","moment","which","be","conjur","why","i","give","it","a","whole","star","it","be","unorigin","and","us","up","almost","everi","old","blond","joke","in","the","book","even","the","on","that","be","not","funni","the","time","it","basic","be","a","movi","to","belittl","blond","and","to","record","the","whole","repetoir","of","blond","jokesbr","br","to","sum","it","all","up","thi","movi","be","blond","humor","go","bad","it","be","not","worth","pai","ani","amount","of","monei","to","watch","it","be","just","that","bad"],"filtered":["thi","movi","anywai","funni","try","funni","lame","humor","spindri","bore","movi","hour","tortur","throughout","whole","movi","think","thing","thi","gonna","end","thing","hand","thei","veri","mildli","funni","moment","conjur","give","whole","star","unorigin","us","almost","everi","old","blond","joke","book","even","funni","time","basic","movi","belittl","blond","record","whole","repetoir","blond","jokesbr","br","sum","thi","movi","blond","humor","go","bad","worth","pai","ani","amount","monei","watch","bad"],"filtered2":["anywai","funni","try","funni","lame","humor","spindri","bore","hour","tortur","throughout","whole","think","thing","gonna","end","thing","hand","veri","mildli","funni","moment","conjur","give","whole","star","unorigin","us","almost","everi","old","blond","joke","book","even","funni","time","basic","belittl","blond","record","whole","repetoir","blond","jokesbr","sum","blond","humor","go","bad","worth","pai","ani","amount","monei","watch","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,8,9,12,15,24,27,29,30,36,39,56,62,67,85,100,108,111,126,131,151,174,188,214,219,235,286,322,369,372,386,438,772,802,985,1020,1148,1353,1447,1560,2379,8212],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,8,9,12,15,24,27,29,30,36,39,56,62,67,85,100,108,111,126,131,151,174,188,214,219,235,286,322,369,372,386,438,772,802,985,1020,1148,1353,1447,1560,2379,8212],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,2.6390769554676132,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.8610609350701788,8.090448178027707,1.9570915389266579,2.011190219103739,2.1405462403177813,2.138507503627933,6.355036591012766,2.2391270689902285,2.2512118082053005,2.8002454868101863,2.456282578459816,2.5378812223426954,2.7303758068497004,2.5792094178355414,2.6457189377809835,2.780700890737216,2.885344817328191,6.243658221875298,3.070535816550098,3.0433232530252132,3.1797351085150902,3.7398317812878634,3.8883864756110005,16.68349492474271,4.100845126825194,4.176068548062782,4.436351646326448,4.477736862489302,4.573751515728891,5.102830579804232,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.646719774662372E-5,8.588412921783758E-5,8.655179642776826E-5,8.605169922594145E-5,8.605310908614986E-5,8.593282403634443E-5,8.618840029533141E-5,8.589649597126125E-5,8.608962260719132E-5,9.5511736835348E-5,0.8570861188552272,8.575784008867813E-5,8.735846764687133E-5,8.86046553836567E-5,8.58203738110536E-5,8.558320332584463E-5,8.77179692770045E-5,8.619647549786175E-5,8.592905126841272E-5,8.600027117398907E-5,8.683237423777059E-5,8.628187439327619E-5,8.63801193967879E-5,8.647318428712032E-5,8.713682155119399E-5,8.668112050537389E-5,9.032503014149415E-5,8.578333510822597E-5,8.578563001333418E-5,8.600296742185387E-5,8.78309403608928E-5,8.619148114816102E-5,9.25192535838447E-5,8.643392506564776E-5,8.587670641071339E-5,8.627308402130655E-5,8.579065580484664E-5,8.584135177040663E-5,8.558277334891142E-5,8.560497746874795E-5,8.579766386920016E-5,8.670264742302067E-5,8.626207483626916E-5,8.592101870598307E-5,8.69650491769509E-5,0.038972126306596806,8.88098201074484E-5,8.750384581619079E-5,8.562625498549712E-5,8.581549424541994E-5,8.578573019890224E-5,8.820006311887925E-5,8.581677101637436E-5,8.559737770291636E-5,8.653693142249089E-5,8.583887513845831E-5,0.09727694126391842,8.576813275165828E-5,8.562526476698044E-5,8.603410027522805E-5,8.68874862434927E-5,8.602840863012477E-5,8.560942390157263E-5,8.580875233341856E-5,8.558380848770462E-5,8.756404042729251E-5,8.63210728230236E-5,8.61371962993933E-5,8.606186542821779E-5,8.63755746080137E-5,8.558068625463944E-5,8.606366967491123E-5,8.745956526413557E-5,8.57340515980651E-5,8.785592470484276E-5,8.59607237203567E-5,8.6633495447

{"value":"I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actresses were not very great. Some of the jokes that were supposedly \"funny\" were really stupid. I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get. Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie.

{"value":"I love a good sappy love story (and I'm a guy) but when I rented \"Love Story\" I prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for Ali McGraw's character.<br /><br />Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes. When we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness I couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care. If she didn't die her grating personality would probably have pushed Oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court.<br /><br />People love this movie but it's one of the worst of the 70's.","finished_norm":["i","love","a","good","sappi","love","stori","and","i","be","a","gui","but","when","i","rent","love","stori","i","prai","for","the","end","to","come","a","quickli","and","painlessli","a","possibl","and","just","the","opposit","for","ali","mcgraw","characterbr","br","ali","mcgraw","a","jenni","alien","and","irrit","the","heck","out","of","me","within","the","minut","when","we","learn","that","she","have","be","diagnos","with","a","life","threaten","ill","i","can","not","help","but","wonder","if","her","death","would","be","such","a","terribl","loss","for","poor","oliv","or","if","anyon","watch","thi","film","would","even","care","if","she","do","not","die","her","grate","person","would","probabl","have","push","oliv","over","the","edg","and","eventu","land","them","in","divorc","courtbr","br","peopl","love","thi","movi","but","it","on","of","the","wrong","of","the"],"filtered":["love","good","sappi","love","stori","gui","rent","love","stori","prai","end","come","quickli","painlessli","possibl","opposit","ali","mcgraw","characterbr","br","ali","mcgraw","jenni","alien","irrit","heck","within","minut","learn","diagnos","life","threaten","ill","help","wonder","death","terribl","loss","poor","oliv","anyon","watch","thi","film","even","care","die","grate","person","probabl","push","oliv","edg","eventu","land","divorc","courtbr","br","peopl","love","thi","movi","wrong"],"filtered2":["love","good","sappi","love","stori","gui","rent","love","stori","prai","end","come","quickli","painlessli","possibl","opposit","ali","mcgraw","characterbr","ali","mcgraw","jenni","alien","irrit","heck","within","minut","learn","diagnos","life","threaten","ill","help","wonder","death","terribl","loss","poor","oliv","anyon","watch","even","care","die","grate","person","probabl","push","oliv","edg","eventu","land","divorc","courtbr","peopl","love","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,17,23,24,25,34,54,55,59,75,146,148,153,158,166,175,185,205,245,293,402,430,565,661,672,716,771,870,959,1257,1489,1545,1552,1598,1639,1652,2277,2493,2544,2785,3303,3856,3860,4557],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,17,23,24,25,34,54,55,59,75,146,148,153,158,166,175,185,205,245,293,402,430,565,661,672,716,771,870,959,1257,1489,1545,1552,1598,1639,1652,2277,2493,2544,2785,3303,3856,3860,4557],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.5541073880211935,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,7.245557301091765,1.9536997889255368,1.8693254449200722,1.9742250248702675,2.326138445979858,2.3018654096236517,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.4423870329693536,2.3791142619576227,2.518833027372001,2.571852579609833,2.7502029743242886,2.9012296278682137,3.084424928710765,3.2189558216683714,3.9081109809587793,3.5727776966246974,3.616452760127359,3.6746621462132825,3.7264536553416874,3.944626193933877,3.969732115064953,4.3215761317340196,4.5432147918688095,4.566029469634981,4.597282013139085,4.662879295624898,4.646072177308517,4.646072177308517,10.428112429828913,5.170884043049248,5.170884043049248,5.426230734858092,5.541743621979936,6.0662680901040895,5.7446844659766265,12.429376190444724]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.268664422169838E-5,7.219650118696123E-5,7.275776014077785E-5,7.233736502757006E-5,7.233855019385326E-5,7.22374353566867E-5,7.245227961083885E-5,7.220689701138609E-5,7.236924443840365E-5,8.02897262230116E-5,0.6055795686178693,7.209033915974739E-5,7.343586959077583E-5,7.448344840699458E-5,7.214290668302349E-5,7.194353481568498E-5,7.373807629768428E-5,7.245906784254565E-5,7.223426386683241E-5,7.22941332285446E-5,7.29936213688924E-5,0.06931476269389018,7.261344382664828E-5,7.269167666811199E-5,7.324954794141653E-5,7.286647342700884E-5,7.592964154392672E-5,7.211177095658589E-5,7.211370011533591E-5,7.229639976677399E-5,7.383304281904641E-5,7.245486945831121E-5,7.77741645868083E-5,7.265867431417934E-5,7.219026137632062E-5,7.25234670208826E-5,7.211792493040011E-5,7.216054131798019E-5,7.194317336554918E-5,7.196183874387616E-5,7.21238160971503E-5,7.288456953102238E-5,7.251421240483355E-5,7.222751147953726E-5,7.310515147918457E-5,7.22552327931285E-5,7.46559153733555E-5,7.35580783768393E-5,7.197972519480984E-5,7.213880478935268E-5,7.211378433400995E-5,7.414333730392744E-5,7.213987807724143E-5,7.195545017700265E-5,0.1019719083578721,7.21584593947771E-5,7.75984926592682E-5,7.209899144814842E-5,7.197889279058142E-5,7.232257087785182E-5,7.303994999820692E-5,7.231778632841066E-5,7.196557653449741E-5,7.213313735740404E-5,7.194404353096616E-5,7.360867958047764E-5,7.256380769396946E-5,7.240923615930491E-5,7.234591100971363E-5,7.260962335537937E-5,7.194141889815856E-5,7.234742770784786E-5,7.352085495781964E-5,7.207034191687585E-5,0.1720976314839163

{"value":"I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then.Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good.Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to shave cost and time.But every

{"value":"Watching this I mainly noticed the ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It's one product placement after another. It's quite obvious how this movie got its funding. Jessica Simpson's \"acting\" is laughable. Any Dick shouldn't ever get work because he plays the same lame character. The \"story\" is just a backdrop for this very long commercial. I can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie the more you're embarrassed for everyone involved. The only minor saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who gets almost no screen time as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed I watched the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this one.","finished_norm":["watch","thi","i","mainli","notic","the","ad","placem","dhl","aquawhit","strip","rockstar","and","much","it","on","product","placem","after","anoth","it","quit","obviou","how","thi","movi","get","it","fund","jessica","simpson","act","be","laughabl","ani","dick","should","not","ever","get","work","becaus","he","plai","the","same","lame","charact","the","stori","be","just","a","backdrop","for","thi","veri","long","commerci","i","ca","not","believ","thi","movi","be","even","consid","for","theatric","releas","the","long","you","watch","thi","movi","the","much","you","re","embarrass","for","everyon","involv","the","onli","minor","save","grace","be","larri","miller","and","rachael","lee","cook","who","get","almost","no","screen","time","a","jessica","cousin","i","be","embarrass","i","watch","the","whole","thing","i","would","recommend","avoid","thi","on"],"filtered":["watch","thi","mainli","notic","ad","placem","dhl","aquawhit","strip","rockstar","much","product","placem","anoth","quit","obviou","thi","movi","get","fund","jessica","simpson","act","laughabl","ani","dick","ever","get","work","becaus","plai","lame","charact","stori","backdrop","thi","veri","long","commerci","ca","believ","thi","movi","even","consid","theatric","releas","long","watch","thi","movi","much","re","embarrass","everyon","involv","onli","minor","save","grace","larri","miller","rachael","lee","cook","get","almost","screen","time","jessica","cousin","embarrass","watch","whole","thing","recommend","avoid","thi"],"filtered2":["watch","mainli","notic","ad","placem","dhl","aquawhit","strip","rockstar","product","placem","anoth","quit","obviou","get","fund","jessica","simpson","act","laughabl","ani","dick","ever","get","work","becaus","plai","lame","charact","stori","backdrop","veri","long","commerci","ca","believ","even","consid","theatric","releas","long","watch","re","embarrass","everyon","involv","onli","minor","save","grace","larri","miller","rachael","lee","cook","get","almost","screen","time","jessica","cousin","embarrass","watch","whole","thing","recommend","avoid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,7,8,10,11,15,17,21,22,27,29,40,44,48,68,73,81,91,99,111,120,131,189,190,192,241,246,298,317,327,335,372,383,552,557,570,688,1097,1125,1149,1211,1832,1865,1883,1912,2003,2024,2108,2237,2292,2403,2687,3001,4568],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,7,8,10,11,15,17,21,22,27,29,40,44,48,68,73,81,91,99,111,120,131,189,190,192,241,246,298,317,327,335,372,383,552,557,570,688,1097,1125,1149,1211,1832,1865,1883,1912,2003,2024,2108,2237,2292,2403,2687,3001,4568],"values":[2.389902141215977,0.926017105726131,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,4.112860414513218,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.2512118082053005,2.498193474075453,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.6627744961815836,2.673149229007135,2.7819920465008363,2.8529247828056143,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.070535816550098,3.0433232530252132,3.424750734647968,6.86925471628776,3.944626193933877,3.6016814428070463,4.186539847930077,4.240607069200353,4.297765483040301,4.274508620876034,4.8085911068062925,5.00274712124725,4.890269137820559,4.933754249760298,5.214056214914456,10.645380111834504,5.02684467282631,5.290429193699031,5.089758498236879,5.143104478942172,5.5623629091826725,5.444579873526289,12.202718819830718]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.647601191276607E-5,6.602774862361535E-5,6.654105140846068E-5,6.615657650453704E-5,6.615766040555908E-5,6.606518521713878E-5,6.626167233456364E-5,6.603725618797892E-5,6.618573201332462E-5,7.342945673202979E-5,0.5706238667423043,6.593065749688475E-5,6.716122052424397E-5,6.811929009276218E-5,6.597873344454948E-5,6.579639669245177E-5,0.19830296230675046,6.626788055309731E-5,6.606228471183147E-5,6.611703860018337E-5,6.675675972706294E-5,6.633353525380291E-5,6.640906604691306E-5,6.648061436719663E-5,6.699081892825562E-5,6.66404758046197E-5,6.944191480914939E-5,6.595025807684278E-5,6.595202240069376E-5,6.611911147648619E-5,6.752445771226738E-5,6.626404089529811E-5,7.112883456015591E-5,6.645043186397797E-5,6.602204196689842E-5,6.632677721275382E-5,6.595588623096882E-5,6.599486130704762E-5,6.579606612603494E-5,6.581313666114226E-5,6.596127403329839E-5,6.665702570644635E-5,6.631831334744112E-5,6.605610927502216E-5,6.685876026677421E-5,6.608146197072383E-5,6.827702080427226E-5,6.727298731173552E-5,6.582949482347149E-5,6.597498203278125E-5,6.595209942339357E-5,0.0520238576778197,6.5

{"value":"Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.","finished_norm":["okai","honestli","i","do","see","why","everybodi","think","thi","be","so","great","it","realli","not","there","be","two","good","thing","that","come","out","of","thi","movi","jack","perform","he","be","veri","good","i","can","tip","my","hat","for","him","danni","perform","he","be","good","no","other","then","that","it","get","pretti","stupid","and","what","be","stanlei","kubrick","think","draft","shelli","a","the","wendi","she","be","so","bad","she","look","the","same","everi","time","she","get","scare","the","problem","with","thi","movi","be","the","end","i","would","have","have","much","respect","for","it","if","kubrick","would","have","end","it","differ","and","the","over","all","movi","be","just","stupid","the","problem","with","the","movi","be","that","the","book","be","so","much","well","so","do","see","the","movi","read","the","book","and","you","will","be","much","well","off"],"filtered":["okai","honestli","see","everybodi","think","thi","great","realli","two","good","thing","come","thi","movi","jack","perform","veri","good","tip","hat","danni","perform","good","get","pretti","stupid","stanlei","kubrick","think","draft","shelli","wendi","bad","look","everi","time","get","scare","problem","thi","movi","end","much","respect","kubrick","end","differ","movi","stupid","problem","movi","book","much","well","see","movi","read","book","much","well"],"filtered2":["okai","honestli","see","everybodi","think","great","realli","two","good","thing","come","jack","perform","veri","good","tip","hat","danni","perform","good","get","pretti","stupid","stanlei","kubrick","think","draft","shelli","wendi","bad","look","everi","time","get","scare","problem","end","respect","kubrick","end","differ","stupid","problem","book","well","see","read","book","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,9,12,13,15,16,20,24,29,34,47,51,78,85,105,136,145,151,167,191,204,623,695,757,777,1215,1731,2079,2900,3049,3379,3446,5563],"values":[2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,9,12,13,15,16,20,24,29,34,47,51,78,85,105,136,145,151,167,191,204,623,695,757,777,1215,1731,2079,2900,3049,3379,3446,5563],"values":[1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,4.353122425996981,4.693651971159972,2.34599021453259,5.6004909736203725,4.9219153375776195,2.5460113484259455,2.624524614047584,3.607563812710113,3.6284289511740746,3.7165362186843414,4.086456389373095,4.291900363587903,4.760735085628657,5.129498826886393,6.101359409915359,5.426230734858092,12.202718819830718,5.878215858601149,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.021896894787168E-4,1.0150060051256264E-4,1.0228967089573695E-4,1.0169864008757302E-4,1.0170030630529096E-4,1.0155814960068063E-4,1.0186019776720667E-4,1.0151521593581166E-4,1.0174345914792078E-4,1.1287881396801991E-4,0.6710291995933734,1.0135134799565838E-4,1.0324302064616043E-4,1.0471580502188924E-4,1.0142525234132972E-4,1.0114495670473417E-4,1.0366789112777419E-4,1.0186974129886444E-4,1.0155369082332386E-4,1.0163786077707763E-4,1.0262126669189973E-4,1.0197066843460671E-4,1.0208677751022539E-4,1.0219676456303019E-4,1.0298107222778091E-4,1.0244251021142018E-4,1.0674899872854312E-4,1.0138147882213065E-4,1.0138419101411215E-4,1.0164104728871721E-4,1.038014039544122E-4,1.0186383881724869E-4,0.1657142669061724,1.0215036676414217E-4,1.0149182800258371E-4,1.0196027969291749E-4,1.0139013065466289E-4,1.0145004476213263E-4,1.0114444854429378E-4,1.0117069008062635E-4,1.013984130084201E-4,1.0246795140862661E-4,1.019472686872448E-4,1.0154419768509578E-4,1.0277806616256342E-4,1.01583170903053E-4,0.15538346653184146,1.0341483319897697E-4,1.0119583652790509E-4,1.0141948551518189E-4,1.013843094166088E-4,1.0423764499148959E-4,1.0142099444377871E-4,1.0116170843520842E-4,1.0227210295884318E-4,1.0144711779958097E-4,1.090952258668163E-4,1.0136351219273267E-4,1.0119466625610985E-4,1.0167784108684879E-4,1.0268639981634533E-4,1.0167111451930777E-4,1.0117594501661922E-4,1.0141151770875507E-4,1.0114567190430313E-4,1.0348597310841178E-4,1.0201699438789687E-4,1.0179968325324824E-4,1.0171065482935802E-4,1.0208140633403737E-4,1.011419819497802E-4,1.0171278714559066E-4,1.0336250103160721E-4,1.0132323399945792E-4,1.0383093124819078E-4,1.0159112233623895E-4,1.023862254006002E-4,1.0176048583219102E-4,1.0111027095957315E-4,1.0123560408473979E-4]}}
{"value":"My 7-year-old daughter loved it, as Disney execs crassly calculated that she would. That's the problem with \"Air Buddies.\" It's a strictly by-the-numbers children's film filled with carefully calculated cuteness, a couple politically correct morals, and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent, or even as a 10-year-old, you've seen it all before, and done better before. Think \"101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone\" and you get the general idea. I'm of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story, period. \"Air Buddies,\" which is about as original as recycled paper, fails to meet that standard. It isn't the worst video your child could watch, but there are megatons of better ones.","finished_norm":["my","yearold","daughter","love","it","a","disnei","exec","crassli","calcul","that","she","would","that","the","problem","with","air","buddi","it","a","strictli","bythenumb","child","film","fill","with","carefulli","calcul","cute","a","coupl","polit","correct","moral","and","enough","potti","humor","to","avoid","the","dread","g","rate","a","a","parent","or","even","a","a","yearold","you","have","see","it","all","befor","and","do","well","befor","think","dalmatian","meet","home","alon","and","you","get","the","gener","idea","i","be","of","the","opinion","that","a","good","child","stori","be","a","good","stori","period","air","buddi","which","be","about","a","origin","a","recycl","paper","fail","to","meet","that","standard","it","be","not","the","wrong","video","your","child","can","watch","but","there","be","megaton","of","well","on"],"filtered":["yearold","daughter","love","disnei","exec","crassli","calcul","problem","air","buddi","strictli","bythenumb","child","film","fill","carefulli","calcul","cute","coupl","polit","correct","moral","enough","potti","humor","avoid","dread","g","rate","parent","even","yearold","see","befor","well","befor","think","dalmatian","meet","home","alon","get","gener","idea","opinion","good","child","stori","good","stori","period","air","buddi","origin","recycl","paper","fail","meet","standard","wrong","video","child","watch","megaton","well"],"filtered2":["yearold","daughter","love","disnei","exec","crassli","calcul","problem","air","buddi","strictli","bythenumb","child","fill","carefulli","calcul","cute","coupl","polit","correct","moral","enough","potti","humor","avoid","dread","g","rate","parent","even","yearold","see","befor","well","befor","think","dalmatian","meet","home","alon","get","gener","idea","opinion","good","child","stori","good","stori","period","air","buddi","origin","recycl","paper","fail","meet","standard","wrong","video","child","watch","megaton","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,12,17,20,25,54,69,79,93,123,167,180,202,215,225,240,253,302,335,350,369,426,457,538,553,575,616,670,679,743,841,855,878,995,1302,1399,1465,1646,2335,2578,3162,3650,5203,5279,5777],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,12,17,20,25,54,69,79,93,123,167,180,202,215,225,240,253,302,335,350,369,426,457,538,553,575,616,670,679,743,841,855,878,995,1302,1399,1465,1646,2335,2578,3162,3650,5203,5279,5777],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,2.330690080046114,1.2796387880827016,1.8113893252729412,2.127032521151058,3.893901213901217,2.035389827120098,2.2619070973220485,2.4609576687888097,8.129194437808064,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,2.641219492619754,2.7666071276613566,2.7073305177318163,2.902686292364678,2.908534262247101,6.027137983886841,3.121829110937649,3.3909310864081816,3.3243163373261977,3.43462735814388,3.454678155189441,3.6314455447135003,3.5173618574831282,3.7264536553416874,7.343025074620773,3.7568101178222815,4.30366520516749,3.9201351739255808,4.067587905068712,4.030886538218284,8.983842994962517,4.436351646326448,4.484804029712395,9.55920713986608,5.0768550934009715,5.214056214914456,5.541743621979936,5.672363804397,12.511020179485236,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.505480503578595E-5,6.461612527685775E-5,6.511845403623429E-5,6.474219891508281E-5,6.474325964312045E-5,6.465276150431477E-5,6.48450478757188E-5,6.462542957668321E-5,6.477073110113489E-5,7.18595904618116E-5,0.7840854330000235,6.452110988501308E-5,6.572536440518723E-5,6.666295117065779E-5,6.456815800526348E-5,6.438971947507397E-5,6.599584048244942E-5,6.485112336723381E-5,6.464992300961806E-5,6.470350630123246E-5,0.023676529843538477,6.491537442007512E-5,6.498929042193194E-5,6.505930909322038E-5,6.555860586649277E-5,6.521575281397102E-5,6.795729917054972E-5,6.454029141939017E-5,6.45420180233311E-5,6.470553486100707E-5,6.608083585674813E-5,6.484736579841548E-5,6.960815385263799E-5,6.502977186910172E-5,6.461054062414705E-5,6.490876086083439E-5,6.454579924783605E-5,6.458394106625452E-5,6.43893959759172E-5,6.440610155588972E-5,6.455107186302513E-5,6.523194889140882E-5,6.490047794656315E-5,6.464387959897892E-5,6.54293705193538E-5,6.466869027321386E-5,6.681730971880458E-5,6.583474170326102E-5,6.442210999307558E-5,6.456448679584268E-5,6.454209339934382E-5,6.635855052405407E-5,6.456544739231948E-5,6.440038376582163E-5,6.510727014170115E-5,6.45820777375849E-5,6.945092685283972E-5,6.452885371389758E-5,6.442136498833129E-5,6.472895809848031E-5,0.0394752358154277,6.47246759097177E-5,6.440944689178649E-5,6.455941442409654E-5,6.43901747770595E-5,6.588002996044383E-5,6.494486590668948E-5,6.480652383354309E-5

{"value":"It's hard to praise this film much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow. Also, the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious.<br /><br />I was amazed to see \"Marcus Aurelius\" in the acting credits, wondering what an ex-Emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film! Like \"Whoopie Goldberg\" it must be an alias, and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker.<br /><br />The story might been interesting, but the acting is flat, and direction is tedious. If you MUST watch this film, go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so - then it'll be enjoyable.","finished_norm":["it","hard","to","prais","thi","film","much","the","cgi","for","the","dragon","be","good","do","but","lack","proper","model","for","light","and","shadow","conjur","the","same","footag","be","us","endlessli","of","the","dragon","stomp","through","corridor","which","becom","slightli","tediousbr","br","i","be","amaz","to","see","marcu","aureliu","in","the","act","credit","wonder","what","a","exemperor","of","the","roman","empir","be","do","act","in","thi","film","like","whoopi","goldberg","it","must","be","a","alia","and","can","on","blame","him","for","us","on","if","he","appear","in","thi","stinkerbr","br","the","stori","mai","be","interest","but","the","act","be","flat","and","direct","be","tediou","if","you","must","watch","thi","film","go","around","to","your","friend","hous","and","get","drink","while","do","so","then","it","will","be","enjoy"],"filtered":["hard","prais","thi","film","much","cgi","dragon","good","lack","proper","model","light","shadow","conjur","footag","us","endlessli","dragon","stomp","corridor","becom","slightli","tediousbr","br","amaz","see","marcu","aureliu","act","credit","wonder","exemperor","roman","empir","act","thi","film","like","whoopi","goldberg","must","alia","blame","us","appear","thi","stinkerbr","br","stori","mai","interest","act","flat","direct","tediou","must","watch","thi","film","go","around","friend","hous","get","drink","enjoy"],"filtered2":["hard","prais","cgi","dragon","good","lack","proper","model","light","shadow","conjur","footag","us","endlessli","dragon","stomp","corridor","becom","slightli","tediousbr","amaz","see","marcu","aureliu","act","credit","wonder","exemperor","roman","empir","act","like","whoopi","goldberg","must","alia","blame","us","appear","stinkerbr","stori","mai","interest","act","flat","direct","tediou","must","watch","go","around","friend","hous","get","drink","enjoy"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,17,21,39,46,56,60,98,102,115,141,161,169,171,175,183,213,353,356,594,658,667,685,736,898,965,1012,1102,1235,1476,1620,1645,1768,3160,3627,4019,4070,4279,4424,6213,6637,8091],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,17,21,39,46,56,60,98,102,115,141,161,169,171,175,183,213,353,356,594,658,667,685,736,898,965,1012,1102,1235,1476,1620,1645,1768,3160,3627,4019,4070,4279,4424,6213,6637,8091],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.2770536940105968,3.4860466360051467,1.5538940054862738,1.655771293751733,3.7221218701403576,1.838176641236591,2.0881990796736947,2.087553710177271,2.201553588425805,4.5315094715482385,2.4323182980210873,2.4214486257841834,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,2.4885128563647294,2.8432628718938773,3.0266839340212486,3.028335462059722,3.490764544963862,3.813163054373413,3.6652429242967908,3.607563812710113,3.68099128126493,3.892300374932137,3.9868265484242533,4.297765483040301,4.390138803171316,4.297765483040301,10.179516996473758,4.605250182788262,4.662879295624898,4.798834931860927,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,6.1754673820690815,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.267289684435561E-5,7.218284651139776E-5,0.02041471891375953,7.232368371013322E-5,7.232486865226344E-5,7.222377293915794E-5,7.243857655936607E-5,7.219324036963856E-5,7.235555709154704E-5,8.027454085883702E-5,0.925983902949715,7.207670456283061E-5,7.342198051086894E-5,7.446936119631089E-5,7.212926214390087E-5,7.192992798418142E-5,7.372413006078963E-5,7.244536350720038E-5,7.222060204913416E-5,7.22804600876285E-5,7.29798159323185E-5,7.25171385303168E-5,7.259971029384962E-5,7.26779283389721E-5,7.323569410091364E-5,7.285269203819162E-5,7.591528081170442E-5,7.209813230622845E-5,7.210006110011263E-5,7.228272619718279E-5,7.381907862093456E-5,7.244116591701515E-5,7.775945499607754E-5,7.26449322268438E-5,7.217660788090561E-5,7.250975050558579E-5,7.21042851161287E-5,7.214689344358211E-5,7.192956660240746E-5,7.19482284505123E-5,7.211017516867018E-5,7.287078471965109E-5,7.250049763988165E-5,7.221385093893217E-5,7.309132494868718E-5,7.224156700953328E-5,7.464179554363305E-5,7.354416618332861E-5,7.196611151854404E-5,7.21251610260298E-5,7.210014530285821E-5,7.41293144191694E-5,7.212623411092535E-5,7.194184109192184E-5,7.273150575461223E-5,7.21448119141375E-5,7.758381629373724E-5,7.208535521480619E-5,7.196527927174998E-5,7.230889235846352E-5,7.302613579940226E-5,7.230410871393422E-5,7.195196553419738E-5,7.211949466597443E-5,7.193043660324821E-5,7.359475781665527E-5,7.25500835489566E-5,7.239554124873032E-5,7.233222807595727E-5,7.259589054515446E-5,7.192781246684293E-5,7.233374448723522E-5,0.04799624239364336,7.20

{"value":"Trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout Mormons, and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film. Finally Kurt Hale's fortunes have changed (thank goodness) and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters.<br /><br />The cinematography was amateurish (I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes). The plot was limp and very unfunny. You really didn't understand why anyone did anything. It was like I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was that painful.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't

{"value":"As a young black/latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it; unfortunately, I didn't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed. The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film. Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, I would recommend a film like \"Raising Victor\" over this one any day. I just was not too impressed.","finished_norm":["a","a","young","blacklatina","woman","i","be","alwai","search","for","movi","that","repres","the","experi","and","live","of","peopl","like","me","of","cours","when","i","see","thi","movi","at","the","video","store","i","think","i","would","enjoi","it","unfortun","i","do","not","although","the","topic","present","in","the","film","be","interest","and","relev","the","stori","be","simpli","not","properli","develop","the","movi","just","keep","drag","on","and","on","and","mani","of","the","charact","that","appear","on","screen","just","come","and","go","without","much","to","contribut","to","the","overal","film","have","the","director","do","a","well","job","interconnect","the","scene","perhap","i","would","have","enjoi","it","a","bite","much","honestli","i","would","recommend","a","film","like","rais","victor","over","thi","on","ani","dai","i","just","be","not","too","impress"],"filtered":["young","blacklatina","woman","alwai","search","movi","repres","experi","live","peopl","like","cours","see","thi","movi","video","store","think","enjoi","unfortun","although","topic","present","film","interest","relev","stori","simpli","properli","develop","movi","keep","drag","mani","charact","appear","screen","come","go","without","much","contribut","overal","film","director","well","job","interconnect","scene","perhap","enjoi","bite","much","honestli","recommend","film","like","rais","victor","thi","ani","dai","impress"],"filtered2":["young","blacklatina","woman","alwai","search","repres","experi","live","peopl","like","cours","see","video","store","think","enjoi","unfortun","although","topic","present","interest","relev","stori","simpli","properli","develop","keep","drag","mani","charact","appear","screen","come","go","without","contribut","overal","director","well","job","interconnect","scene","perhap","enjoi","bite","honestli","recommend","like","rais","victor","ani","dai","impress"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,10,12,17,19,20,23,27,34,50,58,60,70,116,125,132,134,135,154,169,192,197,199,200,201,227,237,240,289,298,318,320,333,411,412,418,757,764,793,1045,1089,1349,1870,1895,2017,2084,2287],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,10,12,17,19,20,23,27,34,50,58,60,70,116,125,132,134,135,154,169,192,197,199,200,201,227,237,240,289,298,318,320,333,411,412,418,757,764,793,1045,1089,1349,1870,1895,2017,2084,2287],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.717994385570355,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,2.094675786251684,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.348499626138016,2.4214486257841834,2.5318267134339894,2.558331832813986,2.558331832813986,5.061642365863941,2.561435818751577,2.6005321873043625,2.640097787510554,2.7666071276613566,2.8282659991423613,2.7819920465008363,2.902686292364678,2.938298364153555,2.948928684455311,3.229006157521873,3.107414446935464,3.164467636384302,3.7165362186843414,3.7465885637507435,3.770603439954617,4.1554492608600455,4.2078172463773615,4.470719289830655,4.848596441419991,4.848596441419991,4.979216623837056,4.944927550358424,5.649374286172302]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.219458312657707E-5,9.157289349922052E-5,9.228478542692262E-5,9.175156295358312E-5,9.175306619964139E-5,9.162481374886036E-5,9.189731878277393E-5,9.158607939752919E-5,9.179199829110068E-5,0.22256160539185976,0.719787670784617,9.14382392728815E-5,9.314488866495452E-5,9.447362096904802E-5,9.150491508308474E-5,9.125203497844848E-5,9.3528202844056E-5,9.190592886787382E-5,9.162079108158581E-5,9.169672842749318E-5,9.25839480562417E-5,9.199698438681496E-5,9.210173691007324E-5,9.220096620154467E-5,9.290856124918137E-5,0.05054863735830663,9.630794933580144E-5,9.146542302302342E-5,9.146786993729012E-5,9.169960326852399E-5,9.3648656868887E-5,9.190060370410483E-5,9.86475130180531E-5,9.215910654086567E-5,9.15649790226759E-5,9.198761176112117E-5,9.147322862550307E-5,9.152728257350655E-5,9.125157652084671E-5,9.127525138976082E-5,9.148070088768383E-5,9.244562844004165E-5,9.197587335336036E-5,9.161222646096737E-5,9.272541107375403E-5,9.164738773409578E-5,9.469237532532637E-5,9.329989634492338E-5,9.12979382795616E-5,9.149971230641153E-5,9.14679767589164E-5,9.404222945689681E-5,9.150107364769422E-5,9.126714823317703E-5,9.226893579838791E-5,9.152464189523799E-5,9.842469354000424E-5,9.144921369783625E-5,9.129688247128135E-5,9.173279828944722E-5,9.264271055260142E-5,9.172672964305558E-5,9.127999234391863E-5,9.149252382589357E-5,9.125268022481774E-5,9.336407810658115E-5,9.20387792290668E-5,9.184272315364574E-5,9.176240254137218E-5,9.209

{"value":"We loved School of Rock and Jack Black. We couldn't wait to go and see this movie. It was the only time in my life the movie was so bad I wanted to walk out. My husband hated it too. The only funny parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money. The writing was awful. It had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people who should be utterly offended. The movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry. I made my husband stay because I was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts, but there weren't.

{"value":"When I first saw a small scene of it in some announcements, I thought the show would be entertaining to watch. The little robot guy does look kinda cute. The style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows. Before the show aired, I studied it through some sources. There, I did became slightly dismayed. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are voiced appropriately but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad. One good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from \"Whatever Happened To Robot Jones?\" The show isn't bad really. But the way Robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism. Thus, I don't watch it much.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","a","small","scene","of","it","in","some","announc","i","think","the","show","would","be","entertain","to","watch","the","littl","robot","gui","doe","look","kinda","cute","the","styl","of","anim","doe","look","sort","of","familiar","to","some","classic","show","befor","the","show","air","i","studi","it","through","some","sourc","there","i","do","becom","slightli","dismai","the","three","child","tommi","gu","and","lola","be","voic","appropri","but","robotboi","be","a","except","it","would","have","be","a","lot","nice","if","he","be","to","be","portrai","by","a","young","lad","on","good","exampl","be","robot","jone","a","robot","charact","from","whatev","happen","to","robot","jone","the","show","be","not","bad","realli","but","the","wai","robotboi","be","inappropri","portrai","be","my","onli","critic","thu","i","do","not","watch","it","much"],"filtered":["see","small","scene","announc","think","show","entertain","watch","littl","robot","gui","doe","look","kinda","cute","styl","anim","doe","look","sort","familiar","classic","show","befor","show","air","studi","sourc","becom","slightli","dismai","three","child","tommi","gu","lola","voic","appropri","robotboi","except","lot","nice","portrai","young","lad","good","exampl","robot","jone","robot","charact","whatev","happen","robot","jone","show","bad","realli","wai","robotboi","inappropri","portrai","onli","critic","thu","watch","much"],"filtered2":["see","small","scene","announc","think","show","entertain","watch","littl","robot","gui","doe","look","kinda","cute","styl","anim","doe","look","sort","familiar","classic","show","befor","show","air","studi","sourc","becom","slightli","dismai","three","child","tommi","gu","lola","voic","appropri","robotboi","except","lot","nice","portrai","young","lad","good","exampl","robot","jone","robot","charact","whatev","happen","robot","jone","show","bad","realli","wai","robotboi","inappropri","portrai","onli","critic","thu","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,18,19,28,33,55,72,79,94,115,135,180,195,224,233,262,269,277,307,332,363,380,428,469,556,579,679,855,965,1095,1152,1171,1192,1195,1397,1588,1750,2330,2489,3239,5662,6127,7321],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,18,19,28,33,55,72,79,94,115,135,180,195,224,233,262,269,277,307,332,363,380,428,469,556,579,679,855,965,1095,1152,1171,1192,1195,1397,1588,1750,2330,2489,3239,5662,6127,7321],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,6.180917677407637,1.4018535447685214,1.9536997889255368,1.9209463754160525,1.9469506069506084,2.08112281984698,2.201553588425805,2.366244071437088,2.7097314792693545,2.51289241584188,2.689504733779216,2.6102777977348763,2.726701583487816,2.76533567167316,3.1163992333432793,2.8767855639325206,2.9705344631698933,3.0349689855553557,3.102062070196872,3.3721070011625462,6.657541375351156,3.4471119148061256,3.5642670069567886,3.6715125373103863,3.9201351739255808,3.9868265484242533,4.1554492608600455,18.357507334527888,4.297765483040301,4.268777946167049,8.845857251988615,4.422928625994308,4.654440426979034,4.706176101378222,5.102830579804232,5.2288713006995975,5.719991853386255,6.660975197850782,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.635772112243373E-5,6.591025549573635E-5,6.642264488354791E-5,6.603885413378664E-5,6.603993610606018E-5,6.594762547268476E-5,6.614376295095797E-5,6.591974614185723E-5,6.606795776178177E-5,7.329879262898608E-5,0.7936273206231343,6.581333713788562E-5,6.704171043892294E-5,6.799807516981338E-5,6.586132753676843E-5,6.567931524394397E-5,6.731760360462193E-5,6.614996012227241E-5,6.594473012868385E-5,6.599938658518715E-5,6.663796935981736E-5,6.621549799367055E-5,6.629089438345302E-5,6.636231538702325E-5,0.037172279452313266,6.6521892358889E-5,6.93183463406356E-5,6.583290283957661E-5,6.583466402390016E-5,6.600145577290865E-5,6.74043012642538E-5,6.614612729695523E-5,7.100226430099867E-5,6.633218659208305E-5,6.59045589937341E-5,6.620875197822277E-5,6.58385209786795E-5,6.58774267005293E-5,6.567898526575378E-5,6.569602542468433E-5,6.584389919368007E-5,6.653841281098016E-5,6.620030317394168E-5,6.59385656807603E-5,6.673978839459008E-5,6.596387326258818E-5,0.09335142510015212,6.715327834291885E-5,6.571235447846906E-5,6.585758280045276E-5,6.583474090954188E-5,6.768757799430563E-5,6.585856263573293E-5,6.569019311885286E-5,6.641123699824129E-5,6.587552605315743E-5,0.07080324482553983,6.582123605999069E-5,6.571159455278749E-5,6.602534813042442E-5,6.668026409356046E-5,6.60209801780872E-5,

At at then end of the day, he's an undead serial killer, I'm just not going to get that sympathetic.<br /><br />Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and

{"value":"This movie makes me think the others I've seen with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a \"b\" movie. The acting was so laughable that not even the memories of Combs' past campy triumphs were enough to save it. Considering the script I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am thoroughly upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash. The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of. Avoid this movie no matter what.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","make","me","think","the","other","i","have","see","with","comb","be","a","accid","the","plot","have","much","hole","than","i","think","i","have","ever","see","in","a","movi","purport","to","be","someth","much","than","a","b","movi","the","act","be","so","laughabl","that","not","even","the","memori","of","comb","past","campi","triumph","be","enough","to","save","it","consid","the","script","i","have","to","imagin","that","there","be","not","enough","monei","in","the","budget","for","thing","like","continu","and","origin","idea","i","be","thoroughli","upset","that","i","pai","blockbust","price","for","thi","trash","the","fact","that","it","be","make","for","televis","be","someth","that","would","have","help","me","avoid","thi","atroc","and","frankli","someth","that","movi","thi","poor","should","be","requir","to","warn","you","of","avoid","thi","movi","no","matt","what"],"filtered":["thi","movi","make","think","see","comb","accid","plot","much","hole","think","ever","see","movi","purport","someth","much","b","movi","act","laughabl","even","memori","comb","past","campi","triumph","enough","save","consid","script","imagin","enough","monei","budget","thing","like","continu","origin","idea","thoroughli","upset","pai","blockbust","price","thi","trash","fact","make","televis","someth","help","avoid","thi","atroc","frankli","someth","movi","thi","poor","requir","warn","avoid","thi","movi","matt"],"filtered2":["make","think","see","comb","accid","plot","hole","think","ever","see","purport","someth","b","act","laughabl","even","memori","comb","past","campi","triumph","enough","save","consid","script","imagin","enough","monei","budget","thing","like","continu","origin","idea","thoroughli","upset","pai","blockbust","price","trash","fact","make","televis","someth","help","avoid","atroc","frankli","someth","poor","requir","warn","avoid","matt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,12,21,29,32,44,53,69,77,93,97,123,126,146,185,189,256,317,322,335,340,408,433,440,527,552,642,663,671,810,989,1068,1325,1332,1590,1653,1682,1733,1826,3507,3794,3914,6360],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,12,21,29,32,44,53,69,77,93,97,123,126,146,185,189,256,317,322,335,340,408,433,440,527,552,642,663,671,810,989,1068,1325,1332,1590,1653,1682,1733,1826,3507,3794,3914,6360],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,2.133457220525776,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,5.100954820682302,2.127032521151058,1.9463902258768238,4.070779654240196,2.0545557924622586,2.2619070973220485,2.2391270689902285,2.326138445979858,2.518833027372001,2.498193474075453,2.748952192422636,2.8529247828056143,2.885344817328191,5.817068524494202,2.948928684455311,3.130944944345658,3.164467636384302,3.212973749990824,3.439602492783994,3.424750734647968,3.622422927113863,3.7297814454343623,3.6466665387238555,3.8425769395797067,4.044492190274062,4.1554492608600455,4.422928625994308,4.383707912841026,4.573751515728891,4.706176101378222,4.671389985292807,4.798834931860927,4.77960356993304,5.626901430320244,5.770002273960917,12.064733076856815,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.782869684774607E-5,7.730387975003771E-5,7.790484370204579E-5,7.745470868518727E-5,0.049994399449739234,7.734770971523133E-5,7.75777526413415E-5,7.731501100360303E-5,7.748884333300352E-5,8.596964172867807E-5,0.8314670379339739,7.719020752976617E-5,7.86309244749112E-5,7.975261189059287E-5,7.724649382385637E-5,7.703301784365111E-5,7.895451011336213E-5,7.758502109118255E-5,7.734431386548385E-5,7.740841855009348E-5,7.815739040051594E-5,7.766188821438712E-5,7.775031805592684E-5,7.783408530322537E-5,7.843142192090792E-5,7.802124766439666E-5,8.13011126976226E-5,7.721315547071056E-5,7.721522110344316E-5,7.741084542945544E-5,7.905619482698345E-5,7.758052570172922E-5,8.327612236095574E-5,7.779874827223447E-5,7.729719851807363E-5,7.765397604407244E-5,7.721974479351566E-5,7.726537598127004E-5,7.703263082354109E-5,7.705261664193885E-5,7.7226052717564E-5,7.804062393645427E-5,7.764406673109429E-5,7.733708379578644E-5,7.827681045678996E-5,7.73667661911538E-5,7.993727964331254E-5,7.876177864577724E-5,7.707176842948258E-5,7.724210175097385E-5,7.721531127997724E-5,7.938844039500933E-5,7.724325096619239E-5,7.704577613031786E-5,7.789146378434841E-5,7.726314677710786E-5,8.308802291931037E-5,7.7199471904786E-5,7.707087713869535E-5,7.743886795673062E-5,7.820699644416948E-5,7.743374493513571E-5,7.705661885412318E-5,7.723603338934072E-5,7.703356254684692E-5,7.881595951738397E-5,0.11253429525503611,7.753166417795752E-5,7.746385923355334E-5,7.774622731403904E-5,7.703075224031392E-5,7.746548322707461E-5,7.87219219399747E-5,7.716879562707201E-5,7.907868311134904E-
