{"value":"Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without any moral qualities. He only wanted to success in a society where all the people, the politic men, the businessmen, the journalists, the women are corrupt. The only king is MONEY. The Maupassant hero, Charles Forestier is going higher and higher in the society scale thanks to his seduction poser. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the society stapes. At the end of the novel, he married himself with the biggest daily paper owner's daughter, in the greatest church of Paris : \"La Madeleine\". \"Le Tout Paris\" is there. He has a fortune and more, he will become a member of Parliament and later a Minister. The \"useless\" women are out of his view, but he is always keeping in touch with the pretty and the usefull women. The picture \"THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI\" is a story of MORALITY. It is everything, but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why had they put \"BEL AMI\" in its title ?","finished_norm":["gui","de","maupass","be","a","novelist","who","write","a","novel","about","a","man","a","poor","man","without","ani","moral","qualiti","he","onli","want","to","success","in","a","societi","where","all","the","peopl","the","polit","man","the","businessman","the","journalist","the","woman","be","corrupt","the","onli","king","be","monei","the","maupass","hero","charl","foresti","be","go","high","and","high","in","the","societi","scale","thank","to","hi","seduct","poser","he","be","in","love","with","all","the","woman","who","can","help","him","in","hi","action","to","climb","the","societi","stape","at","the","end","of","the","novel","he","marri","himself","with","the","big","daili","paper","owner","daughter","in","the","great","church","of","pari","la","madelein","le","tout","pari","be","there","he","have","a","fortun","and","much","he","will","becom","a","member","of","parliam","and","late","a","minist","the","useless","woman","be","out","of","hi","view","but","he","be","alwai","keep","in","touch","with","the","pretti","and","the","useful","woman","the","pictur","the","privat","affair","of","bel","ami","be","a","stori","of","moral","it","be","everyth","but","not","a","stori","in","the","maupass","idea","why","have","thei","put","bel","ami","in","it","titl"],"filtered":["gui","de","maupass","novelist","write","novel","man","poor","man","without","ani","moral","qualiti","onli","want","success","societi","peopl","polit","man","businessman","journalist","woman","corrupt","onli","king","monei","maupass","hero","charl","foresti","go","high","high","societi","scale","thank","hi","seduct","poser","love","woman","help","hi","action","climb","societi","stape","end","novel","marri","big","daili","paper","owner","daughter","great","church","pari","la","madelein","le","tout","pari","fortun","much","becom","member","parliam","late","minist","useless","woman","hi","view","alwai","keep","touch","pretti","useful","woman","pictur","privat","affair","bel","ami","stori","moral","everyth","stori","maupass","idea","thei","put","bel","ami","titl"],"filtered2":["gui","de","maupass","novelist","write","novel","man","poor","man","without","ani","moral","qualiti","onli","want","success","societi","peopl","polit","man","businessman","journalist","woman","corrupt","onli","king","monei","maupass","hero","charl","foresti","go","high","high","societi","scale","thank","seduct","poser","love","woman","help","action","climb","societi","stape","end","novel","marri","big","daili","paper","owner","daughter","great","church","pari","la","madelein","le","tout","pari","fortun","becom","member","parliam","late","minist","useless","woman","view","alwai","keep","touch","pretti","useful","woman","pictur","privat","affair","bel","ami","stori","moral","everyth","stori","maupass","idea","put","bel","ami","titl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,11,17,23,24,27,37,45,51,54,55,65,70,78,82,115,123,125,126,129,134,146,150,159,185,193,197,211,264,311,312,319,375,426,474,532,541,575,618,651,733,745,750,766,878,1049,1130,1201,1224,1400,1465,1689,1774,1783,1886,1928,1959,2253,2450,2751,2834,2964,3470,4468,4794,6346,6615,7170],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,11,17,23,24,27,37,45,51,54,55,65,70,78,82,115,123,125,126,129,134,146,150,159,185,193,197,211,264,311,312,319,375,426,474,532,541,575,618,651,733,745,750,766,878,1049,1130,1201,1224,1400,1465,1689,1774,1783,1886,1928,1959,2253,2450,2751,2834,2964,3470,4468,4794,6346,6615,7170],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.982619630677639,2.5541073880211935,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.4876543214774305,5.44888831938665,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,1.9073850067444174,8.378703145006735,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,2.201553588425805,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,2.2443961816702407,2.326138445979858,2.332712011146513,2.300267965194495,2.518833027372001,2.517840471459249,2.558331832813986,5.137432284239405,2.757740698455715,2.9203338091782562,2.8824835850471584,2.9056060024680126,3.2597778161886266,3.3909310864081816,7.293333077447711,3.4446025032006995,3.8023521382691974,3.6314455447135003,3.5642670069567886,3.5474598886404074,3.7636829971100436,3.6969916226113715,4.030886538218284,3.9825254665248626,8.135175810137424,12.528205644188345,4.416284083275639,4.315570107673808,4.5432147918688095,4.436351646326448,4.506310234933358,4.74221603786142,4.828393734102471,4.869215728622727,10.398914830986607,4.828393734102471,4.900964426937307,5.259176650194926,10.852461469716184,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.463272006538442,5.7959777603641776,6.032366538428407,6.1754673820690815,6.868614562629026

{"value":"This film is so bad I can't believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you insane? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh** should I say. Everything is bad in this film. The story (is there a story?) is going nowhere, completely incoherent, the acting (some dialogs are simply just ridiculous), the music score (what the **** is that?), the editing, and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me the old Macist movies... To give you an example of the amateurism of the production, the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it. I'm not joking, that's exactly what it is.<br /><br />Another example of the enormous mistakes we find here: you see in a scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, who's talking on her cell phone. The next shot, which is in a complete different location, you can see this same woman, still talking on her cell phone (!) Yes, it goes that far. <br /><br />A big, huge, waste of money.

{"value":"The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Hough's less than perfect, but interesting, fictionalised account of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light.<br /><br />I hadn't realised until checking the movie out later on the IMDb that it was originally a serial. Whoever edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on DVD has done a hell of a good job. The shortened version plays just as well as any B movie of the period despite the many 'duh-what?' moments. For instance are we really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty? Looking over the chapter titles I see that number five is titled \"Gorilla Warfare\" and number eleven is called \"The Gorilla\". There were no gorillas at all in the movie.

{"value":"Yuck. I thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written. The acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times. Why would a \"demonico\" kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for the heck of it? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle whenever she's out somewhere. We get it! You spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket. It doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The \"Faith's\" lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance. Everyone is a throwaway character. Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies I've seen the SciFi channel come out with.

{"value":"This film was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it wasnt the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans Id say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see Meet the Parents

{"value":"There is only one problem with this website, you can't give a negative rating. Additionally a mate rated this as a D grade movie. I say he was being too nice. A piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire. This is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back. After watching 5 minutes, myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining. Half a carto and a bottle of 151 later I finally found some of this G grade acting remotely funny. It's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more, he should go and buy a rope. And to the actors in this flick, I hope you got paid well to be in this joke because I doubt you will ever work again.

{"value":"Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loves kids. That didn't work (and why should it?), so instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing \"Kid Midas\". I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does can be best liked, but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie, and the same went for DR. DOLITTLE! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic, and that wouldn't have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is far better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy

{"value":"I don't normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films I don't like, but in a case like this one, I just have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical, and stupid. There are so many flaws in the storytelling that I don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience. The most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for Bacon's character's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition.<br /><br />Granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good stuff (the director's cut of Robocop on DVD is great). However, this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter, and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment.<br /><br /> In short, as many other reviews here say (wish I had read them before...) - Stay away from this

{"value":"This film is terrible. The story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, lurching from Noir/thriller to erotic, with elements of horror thrown in for good measure. The film has a very confused structure, for example with frequent use of flashbacks without tying these into the story. The plot is poorly developed, and the characterisation made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they were playing. Some implausibilities exist in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home, then agrees to go upstairs alone (to where he says she will find a phone), minus the gun she had brought with her, to call the Police, was too hard to believe. Some of the cinematography is very poor: we were watching on a 42\" TV so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me.

{"value":"This was surely the stupidest, crudest, most repulsive film I have seen in quite some time. I was tempted to turn off the VCR, but, as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident, I literally found it COMPULSIVELY HATEABLE in every conceivable way and slugged it out through to the end. I am by no means a prude who objects to the comedic portrayal of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, There's Something About Mary, both American Pie movies, and even the notorious Freddy Got Fingered I have found highly enjoyable on their own crude terms. Mamie Van Doren's breast-baring sponge bath is the most horrifying appearance by a naked geriatric since The Shining. Ineptly edited and shot, with incredibly annoying performances from Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended, without the benefit of having made me giggle once. The only useful purpose for the film is as a textbook example of how not to make a gross out picture.

{"value":"Notice I have given this 1 star if the option been given I would have given this zero. As I put this DVD into my TV and sat down on my couch I was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest. I looked this movie up on IMDb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so I guess I came into it critical of every mistake. But it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen.<br /><br />The box makes this movie out to look well OK at best. DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU. This movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it. The acting (if you can call it that), the \"plot\" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects really are just terrible.<br /><br />Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch.<br /><br />In the end I'm not saying I can make a better movie than this, but I am thinking it.","finished_norm":["notic","i","have","give","thi","star","if","the","option","be","give","i","would","have","give","thi","zero","a","i","put","thi","dvd","into","my","tv","and","sit","down","on","my","couch","i","be","expect","some","of","the","wrong","film","make","at","it","fine","i","look","thi","movi","up","on","imdb","and","see","that","it","be","the","wrong","rate","movi","so","i","guess","i","come","into","it","critic","of","everi","mistak","but","it","do","not","prepar","me","for","the","crap","that","be","about","to","spew","from","my","televis","screenbr","br","the","box","make","thi","movi","out","to","look","good","okai","at","well","do","not","let","that","fool","you","thi","movi","ne","to","be","ban","from","all","shelv","around","the","worldbr","br","the","well","wai","i","can","describ","thi","movi","be","like","porn","but","without","ani","sex","scene","in","it","the","act","if","you","can","call","it","that","the","plot","so","mani","hole","must","look","like","swiss","chees","and","the","special","effect","realli","be","just","terriblebr","br","pleas","do","not","be","like","me","and","rend","thi","movi","becaus","you","think","it","will","be","funni","to","watchbr","br","in","the","end","i","be","not","sai","i","can","make","a","well","movi","than","thi","but","i","be","think","it"],"filtered":["notic","give","thi","star","option","give","give","thi","zero","put","thi","dvd","tv","sit","couch","expect","wrong","film","make","fine","look","thi","movi","imdb","see","wrong","rate","movi","guess","come","critic","everi","mistak","prepar","crap","spew","televis","screenbr","br","box","make","thi","movi","look","good","okai","well","let","fool","thi","movi","ne","ban","shelv","around","worldbr","br","well","wai","describ","thi","movi","like","porn","without","ani","sex","scene","act","call","plot","mani","hole","must","look","like","swiss","chees","special","effect","realli","terriblebr","br","pleas","like","rend","thi","movi","becaus","think","funni","watchbr","br","end","sai","make","well","movi","thi","think"],"filtered2":["notic","give","star","option","give","give","zero","put","dvd","tv","sit","couch","expect","wrong","make","fine","look","imdb","see","wrong","rate","guess","come","critic","everi","mistak","prepar","crap","spew","televis","screenbr","box","make","look","good","okai","well","let","fool","ne","ban","shelv","around","worldbr","well","wai","describ","like","porn","without","ani","sex","scene","act","call","plot","mani","hole","must","look","like","swiss","chees","special","effect","realli","terriblebr","pleas","like","rend","becaus","think","funni","watchbr","end","make","well","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,12,13,16,19,20,21,22,24,25,27,30,32,33,34,50,62,85,98,100,106,110,124,125,130,141,142,159,172,191,202,203,243,244,247,254,313,346,464,533,579,591,592,654,663,668,688,810,964,971,1057,1295,1861,2332,3024,3205,3563,3570,3993,4104,4654,4937,6303],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,12,13,16,19,20,21,22,24,25,27,30,32,33,34,50,62,85,98,100,106,110,124,125,130,141,142,159,172,191,202,203,243,244,247,254,313,346,464,533,579,591,592,654,663,668,688,810,964,971,1057,1295,1861,2332,3024,3205,3563,3570,3993,4104,4654,4937,6303],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,3.589841616087325,1.312380678011735,3.4960351200691706,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,4.009325967515556,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.717994385570355,2.0226120445069267,2.011190219103739,2.0881990796736947,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.1290479736304078,2.2323930368088845,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.5001408943598484,2.5460113484259455,2.597304642813496,2.569760528637609,2.627841366673578,2.634508058031767,2.7303758068497004,2.889652074525771,2.907069060519773,3.023389038124396,3.2872346624216657,3.424750734647968,3.5642670069567886,3.509308122676031,3.5227672760500357,3.634471265630037,3.7297814454343623,3.5813614403160887,3.6016814428070463,3.8425769395797067,4.062925891962901,4.181290492043933,4.181290492043933,4.358390104856736,4.911775343041523,5.274680836730892,5.444579873526289,5.482320201509136,5.649374286172302,5.626901430320244,5.7959777603641776,5.822646007446338,5.999576715605417,6.101359409915359,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5554831722340397E-4,1.554104779957175E-4,1.5544885004325235E-4,1.554175998520318E-4,1.5543230828433675E-4,1.5540962110922643E-4,1.554579556589917E-4,1.5538649869231504E-4,1.55410510840

{"value":"Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of \"Land of the Dead\".<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. <br /><br />It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art, which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre.<br /><br />We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone. They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, I couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore.<br /><br />Some people actually consider this a \"so bad, it's good\" movie, they are liars. I didn't finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way

{"value":"Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in THE MUMMY'S HAND, return for this very minor Universal Horror offering. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick \"Babe,\" we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named \"Stuff\". But the results are nowhere near as charming, and the scare level is virtually nil.<br /><br />Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle. Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride. But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as \"The Phantom\" who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself.<br /><br />This \"phantom\" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness. It's always nice to see perky Moran, but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universal's instantly forgettable

{"value":"This movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours. Someone please tell me what the point was?<br /><br />I mean, I understand the historical setting. It's supposed to be about a ragtag group of Confederate bushwhackers (terrorists?) on the Missouri-Kansas frontier, taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the U.S. Civil War. But aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? That war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point it was done quite well, but I don't think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot.

{"value":"I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two don't really mesh together. The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate movie for the politics. There is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flopping breasts, and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Other than the interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored dry watching this film. Unlike many other reviewers, I think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is. I think the cast did a fine job however. They played their parts believably. There is little of the over-the-topness I'm so used to seeing in the American films during this

{"value":"All these reviewers are spot on.

No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people taking part in 'Wizards of the Lost Kingdom' aren't actually aware they are appearing in a film!<br /><br />FACT! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful. It is. Worse even than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all of John Derek's films, this is, truly, the Citizen Kane of

{"value":"If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. The Omega Man comes to mind. To the studio's credit, they avoided the sprawling, unnecessary, big budget technofest that typifies movies of this ilk. Additionally, the set-up and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease. What's bad is EVERYTHING else! I get tired of endlessly stupid, careless, wimpy, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie. That pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point. I rented it, and found myself yelling at the TV repeatedly, \"no, don't do that!\", \"why are you so stupid\", \"look out!\", etcetera. A true lack of character development is evident about halfway in. A movie SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them. This one does not.

{"value":"I found this movie to be a great idea, that didn't deliver. It seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well. In one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers. They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very anti-climatic to say the least. There are also large narration scenes that take us \"inside the thinking\" of the terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear, as Hitchcock proved time and again, is far more effective. The greatest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie, and the get the quick, rather bland ending.

{"value":"Enough is enough...sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. The third one was nauseating. The tv series was depressingly awful. And this movie just drives the stake deeper.<br /><br />Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have the series set in the Wild West, in the 1800's, and they fight graboids. Like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again. Mildly entertaining I suppose. Otherwise this straight-to-video release, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is just going way too far. Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place...did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event? I think something like this would be history-making, so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared. <br /><br />Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy.

{"value":"Here's an indie film I really wanted to like, but ultimately could not. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows through and kills the picture. The story is a nonsensical mess that isn't worth trying to figure out. I quickly became bored within 10 minutes, then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes--hoping for the best--before hitting the chapter stops to (mercifully) get to the end... even that wasn't worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever, lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there's very little in OZARK SAVAGE that hasn't been done before, and better. This film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced. Of course, there's no money in shorts, so I completely understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it being stretched out to 75+ minutes.

{"value":"There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD??? The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it didn't happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. Apart from the general awfulness of the film, I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen.

{"value":"I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies, but they should at least hire some proper actors. The sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has. But let's face it, the lines aren't really important. There isn't really a recognisable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f**k, s**t, m*****f****r and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue.<br /><br />The 'story' as it is, is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death, with a couple of cringe-worthy 'surprises', which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen. Not only this, but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors (Why are they going in there? Didn't he have a weapon? Wasn't he dead?), so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them.<br /><br />Another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of

{"value":"I remember watching this movie when I was young, but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies I find it and think to myself \"that is the title?\" This movie is a kind of combination disaster film/insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it. It is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such. The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too. What else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through. In the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of

{"value":"All the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character Jim being either a bad father, a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish. How can that be funny? Of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed, but Jim's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner.<br /><br />And why it that? My guess is that it's because \"he should now better\". Jim's not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so. But he chooses not to. It's a conscious choice he makes, when he chooses to not play with his kids, not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy \"lady products\" and it's a choice he makes, when he puts down his relatives.<br /><br />The other characters seems to only be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a jerk to. If the Cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years.

{"value":"I am a guy, who loves guy movies... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects. All of this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />The story was standard, but the portrayal of the story was terrible. The scene transitions were the worst I have ever seen. Why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The serpent dragon's actions itself was very poorly written... and the serpent dragon's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie, several times the main characters should have died.<br /><br />The director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times, this movie was obviously not watched after it was made, I love movies, but had to

{"value":"There's little to get excited about \"Dan in Real Life\". First off, the whole setup is incredibly contrived. Did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant, Marie wouldn't have told Dan where she was going? And since Dan did all the talking during that conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? For that matter, I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie. He's very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he's truly a good guy (for example he lies to Marie in the bookstore, ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a 'blind date'). There's more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught making out by the whole family. Yeah like that could really happen. Dan in Real life is slow-paced, sappy and manipulative.

{"value":"I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen--the others being THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you LIKE being thoroughly depressed, then by all means watch this film or any of the others. In this film, the acting is good and some of the scenery (apart when people are dying) is lovely. But, I am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in! Despite a \"happily ever after\" ending, the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another. And, for some crazy reason, I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie (I know this sounds crazy folks--after all, isn't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway?).<br /><br />For a more uplifting viewing experience, try the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT A Christmas TREE, George C.

{"value":"I really hate most end of the world movies. They show what jaded Hollywood people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think we're a bunch of sadistic idiots (or at least that watching sadistic idiots react to things is somehow entertaining). I've been to L.A. many times, I have family that works in show business, and I just want to say that these are the *last* people we should be looking to for a reality check. Some disaster movies at least paint a clever picture: Children of Men, 12 Monkeys, but usually the message is just \"people will do anything to survive, all is dark and sad and purposeless, we should all be ashamed of ourselves\".<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of a story that explores throwing off the system of social order and testing people's mettle in the face of horror, and I do believe some people would act like this film portrayed, but sadistic idiots aside, I seriously doubt society would just dissolve into every man for himself, that's just

{"value":"This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series.<br /><br />Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. The live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. While the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap.<br /><br />The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. Thats basiclly the idea every episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were Gem says \"just adore me for now\" and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god.

{"value":"Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fleed to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of..<br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it's been americanized alot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist makes it all average, the effects makes the movie a little too much though.

{"value":"As a mother of 2 young children who are or should I say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of Scooby I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby.<br /><br />If as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to Shaggy and Scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the \"old\" Scooby and gang. I'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but I'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. My 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series(Where are you).<br /><br />Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this.
