{"value":"Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and deservedly so with the Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable. <br /><br />It was right after the release of this film that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I don't think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy like teenager. He was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion.<br /><br />Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs at Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them Rooney was playing an adult part. Even in the Andy Hardy film, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. <br /><br />Rooney's bad casting makes Summer Holiday all the worse because in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the father's character played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the inebriated brother-in-law Uncle Sid here played by Frank Morgan and that's the central character.<br /><br />Gloria DeHaven steps in for Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and adorable girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell plays the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original play O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood of the Code so all Marilyn does is get young Rooney soused.<br /><br />A lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best, but Summer Holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn.","finished_norm":["summer","holidai","be","the","forget","music","version","of","eugen","oneil","ah","wilder","and","deservedli","so","with","the","broadwai","music","adapt","of","take","me","along","with","the","except","of","the","stanlei","steamer","song","none","of","the","other","harri","warrenralph","blane","song","be","worth","rememb","and","even","that","on","be","question","br","br","it","be","right","after","the","releas","of","thi","film","that","mgm","let","mickei","roonei","go","and","i","do","not","think","it","be","a","coincid","the","film","be","make","in","and","releas","in","so","mickei","be","plai","a","andi","hardi","like","teenag","he","be","just","wai","too","old","for","the","part","of","the","year","old","who","be","affect","radic","idea","in","a","spirit","of","youth","rebellionbr","br","roonei","make","four","film","for","mgm","from","to","thi","on","killer","mccoi","a","remak","of","robert","taylor","a","crowd","roar","love","laugh","at","andi","hardi","and","word","and","music","in","all","of","them","roonei","be","plai","a","adult","part","even","in","the","andi","hardi","film","mickei","plai","a","adult","andi","hardi","return","from","world","war","ii","why","he","be","in","thi","loui","b","mayer","onli","know","br","br","roonei","bad","cast","make","summer","holidai","all","the","wrong","becaus","in","the","origin","ah","wilder","the","emphasi","be","on","the","father","charact","plai","here","by","walter","huston","and","in","the","broadwai","show","take","me","along","which","win","a","toni","award","for","jacki","gleason","the","great","on","plai","the","inebri","brotherinlaw","uncl","sid","here","plai","by","frank","morgan","and","that","the","central","characterbr","br","gloria","dehaven","step","in","for","judi","garland","a","roonei","sweet","and","ador","girl","friend","and","marilyn","maxwel","plai","the","show","girl","who","give","roonei","a","adult","educ","in","the","origin","plai","o","neill","have","her","a","a","prostitut","but","thi","be","the","hollywood","of","the","code","so","all","marilyn","doe","be","get","young","roonei","sousedbr","br","a","lot","of","realli","talent","peopl","have","a","hand","in","thi","on","and","thei","do","their","well","but","summer","holidai","fade","rather","quickli","into","a","chilli","autumn"],"filtered":["summer","holidai","forget","music","version","eugen","oneil","ah","wilder","deservedli","broadwai","music","adapt","take","along","except","stanlei","steamer","song","none","harri","warrenralph","blane","song","worth","rememb","even","question","br","br","right","releas","thi","film","mgm","let","mickei","roonei","go","think","coincid","film","make","releas","mickei","plai","andi","hardi","like","teenag","wai","old","part","year","old","affect","radic","idea","spirit","youth","rebellionbr","br","roonei","make","four","film","mgm","thi","killer","mccoi","remak","robert","taylor","crowd","roar","love","laugh","andi","hardi","word","music","roonei","plai","adult","part","even","andi","hardi","film","mickei","plai","adult","andi","hardi","return","world","war","ii","thi","loui","b","mayer","onli","know","br","br","roonei","bad","cast","make","summer","holidai","wrong","becaus","origin","ah","wilder","emphasi","father","charact","plai","walter","huston","broadwai","show","take","along","win","toni","award","jacki","gleason","great","plai","inebri","brotherinlaw","uncl","sid","plai","frank","morgan","central","characterbr","br","gloria","dehaven","step","judi","garland","roonei","sweet","ador","girl","friend","marilyn","maxwel","plai","show","girl","give","roonei","adult","educ","origin","plai","o","neill","prostitut","thi","hollywood","code","marilyn","doe","get","young","roonei","sousedbr","br","lot","realli","talent","peopl","hand","thi","thei","well","summer","holidai","fade","rather","quickli","chilli","autumn"],"filtered2":["summer","holidai","forget","music","version","eugen","oneil","ah","wilder","deservedli","broadwai","music","adapt","take","along","except","stanlei","steamer","song","none","harri","warrenralph","blane","song","worth","rememb","even","question","right","releas","mgm","let","mickei","roonei","go","think","coincid","make","releas","mickei","plai","andi","hardi","like","teenag","wai","old","part","year","old","affect","radic","idea","spirit","youth","rebellionbr","roonei","make","four","mgm","killer","mccoi","remak","robert","taylor","crowd","roar","love","laugh","andi","hardi","word","music","roonei","plai","adult","part","even","andi","hardi","mickei","plai","adult","andi","hardi","return","world","war","ii","loui","b","mayer","onli","know","roonei","bad","cast","make","summer","holidai","wrong","becaus","origin","ah","wilder","emphasi","father","charact","plai","walter","huston","broadwai","show","take","along","win","toni","award","jacki","gleason","great","plai","inebri","brotherinlaw","uncl","sid","plai","frank","morgan","central","characterbr","gloria","dehaven","step","judi","garland","ro

{"value":"\"Drawing Restraint 9\" is a kind of movie one either loves or hates; fortunately or not, I left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with \"killing whales is bad\" propaganda. Aesthetically, the movie could have been pleasing, especially its first half, until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting. Until then, it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers, but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word \"propaganda\" because the movie uses basically the old morality play device, where \"good\" and \"bad\" are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone. Probably it's just me, but I find such type of art shallow and preconceived, even when it's all about the noble (no sarcasm here) quest of protecting the environment.<br /><br />In my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification, for the sake of stretching only. In my opinion, \"Drawing Restraint 9\" could've been easily fit into 75 minutes, but has a torturous length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough of these to leave 15-minute gaps of nothingness without notice. The movie has no standard scenario, and there's no evolution of characters, but neither it is a documentary, it's rather a kind of conceptual installation. That's an unusual form for a movie, but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also believe that the director should've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes.<br /><br />And yes, the music score mostly resembled whale sounds.

{"value":"The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans aren't as they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined? <br /><br />Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought. Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap opera-ish 70s made-for-TV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be. The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there. The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit\"man\"? Yeah, right! It's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen. The movie also lacks any pace. Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had. With no drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made-for-TV movie. The lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to. The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.<br /><br />Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start. So even though I've only rated Superdome a 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.","finished_norm":["the","championship","game","be","onli","a","coupl","of","dai","awai","but","thing","in","new","orlean","be","not","a","thei","should","be","from","player","with","marit","problem","to","drug","overdos","to","gambl","problem","to","a","killer","on","the","loos","life","be","get","in","the","wai","of","what","should","be","a","memor","wonder","time","can","thing","be","put","back","into","order","and","a","killer","stop","befor","the","big","game","be","ruin","br","br","despit","what","you","mai","think","when","you","read","about","superdom","thi","be","not","a","footbal","movi","in","fact","footbal","be","noth","much","than","a","plot","devic","and","a","after","think","instead","superdom","be","anoth","of","that","lousi","soap","operaish","madefortv","movi","popul","with","hollywood","have","been","and","that","that","never","will","be","the","cast","sleepwalk","it","wai","through","the","thing","with","no","on","realli","look","good","the","well","or","wrong","exampl","be","van","johnson","in","a","veri","small","role","look","gener","lose","a","to","why","he","there","the","plot","be","dull","uninterest","and","unbeliev","donna","mill","a","a","hitman","ye","right","it","about","a","believ","a","the","affair","she","have","with","the","liquor","soak","david","jansen","the","movi","conjur","lack","ani","pace","try","to","get","all","four","or","five","stori","line","into","the","film","zap","whatev","flow","superdom","mai","have","have","with","no","drama","or","suspens","in","sight","superdom","end","up","be","a","veri","poor","exampl","of","a","madefortv","movi","the","lone","highlight","for","me","be","the","voiceov","work","from","the","late","charli","jone","a","sportscast","i","miss","listen","to","the","eloqu","wai","he","overst","the","intrigu","and","overhyp","the","atmospher","in","new","orlean","be","pure","chees","at","it","finestbr","br","like","much","other","who","have","see","superdom","i","conjur","do","so","courtesi","of","mysteri","scienc","theater","it","mai","be","on","of","the","ktma","public","access","episod","but","it","on","of","the","well","exampl","of","the","show","earli","start","so","even","though","i","have","onli","rate","superdom","a","i","will","give","thi","episod","a","gener","on","my","mstk","rate","scale"],"filtered":["championship","game","onli","coupl","dai","awai","thing","new","orlean","thei","player","marit","problem","drug","overdos","gambl","problem","killer","loos","life","get","wai","memor","wonder","time","thing","put","back","order","killer","stop","befor","big","game","ruin","br","br","despit","mai","think","read","superdom","thi","footbal","movi","fact","footbal","noth","much","plot","devic","think","instead","superdom","anoth","lousi","soap","operaish","madefortv","movi","popul","hollywood","never","cast","sleepwalk","wai","thing","realli","look","good","well","wrong","exampl","van","johnson","veri","small","role","look","gener","lose","plot","dull","uninterest","unbeliev","donna","mill","hitman","ye","right","believ","affair","liquor","soak","david","jansen","movi","conjur","lack","ani","pace","try","get","four","five","stori","line","film","zap","whatev","flow","superdom","mai","drama","suspens","sight","superdom","end","veri","poor","exampl","madefortv","movi","lone","highlight","voiceov","work","late","charli","jone","sportscast","miss","listen","eloqu","wai","overst","intrigu","overhyp","atmospher","new","orlean","pure","chees","finestbr","br","like","much","see","superdom","conjur","courtesi","mysteri","scienc","theater","mai","ktma","public","access","episod","well","exampl","show","earli","start","even","though","onli","rate","superdom","give","thi","episod","gener","mstk","rate","scale"],"filtered2":["championship","game","onli","coupl","dai","awai","thing","new","orlean","player","marit","problem","drug","overdos","gambl","problem","killer","loos","life","get","wai","memor","wonder","time","thing","put","back","order","killer","stop","befor","big","game","ruin","despit","mai","think","read","superdom","footbal","fact","footbal","noth","plot","devic","think","instead","superdom","anoth","lousi","soap","operaish","madefortv","popul","hollywood","never","cast","sleepwalk","wai","thing","realli","look","good","well","wrong","exampl","van","johnson","veri","small","role","look","gener","lose","plot","dull","uninterest","unbeliev","donna","mill","hitman","ye","right","believ","affair","liquor","soak","david","jansen","conjur","lack","ani","pace","try","get","four","five","stori","line","zap","whatev","flow","superdom","mai","drama","suspens","sight","superdom","end","veri","poor","exampl","madefortv","lone","highlight","voiceov","work","late","charli","jone","sportscast","miss","listen","eloqu","wai","overst","intrigu","overhyp","atmospher","new","orlean","pure","chees","finestbr","like","see","superdom","conjur","courtesi","mysteri","scienc","theater","mai","ktma","public","access","well","exampl","show","earli","start","e

{"value":"An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. <br /><br />Only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent, and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion. His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. Perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one.<br /><br />Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /><br />The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits (the opera music) hanging above the mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one isn't one of them. Just get one of his many superb opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.<br /><br />It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers, actors, models, and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. However effective he is as an actor (opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.<br /><br />I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie.","finished_norm":["a","attempt","at","crossov","to","appeal","to","that","who","do","not","appreci","opu","exploit","the","fame","of","on","of","the","great","opu","singer","of","all","time","it","fail","badli","all","that","be","desir","in","thi","movi","be","the","opu","and","on","can","well","find","a","record","of","pavarotti","do","what","he","doe","well","the","plot","revolv","around","a","romanc","with","a","doctor","who","heal","hi","throat","which","have","suddenli","becom","troublesom","br","br","onli","becaus","it","come","out","so","long","ago","be","it","larg","forget","like","much","opu","star","pavarotti","be","a","decent","actor","and","have","stage","presenc","asid","from","hi","sing","talent","and","noth","that","he","doe","in","thi","movi","negat","that","opinion","hi","culpabl","lie","in","not","reject","the","horrid","script","perhap","becaus","great","opera","can","have","silli","stori","he","toler","thi","onebr","br","who","know","except","that","involv","do","we","ne","to","know","br","br","the","plot","be","weak","and","trite","thi","movi","be","like","trudg","through","cold","mud","to","pick","off","a","few","juici","tidbit","the","opu","music","hang","abov","the","mud","we","have","other","wai","in","which","to","appreci","the","great","pavarotti","and","thi","on","be","not","on","of","them","just","get","on","of","hi","mani","superb","opu","or","vocalconcert","record","and","recogn","the","master","tenor","where","he","be","much","suitedbr","br","it","would","be","on","of","imdb","wrong","film","if","much","peopl","rememb","it","and","give","it","some","vote","it","would","fit","neatli","in","a","list","includ","sever","effort","of","singer","actor","model","and","athlet","to","exploit","their","popular","through","film","veri","often","it","all","go","badli","wrong","due","to","incompet","act","or","a","horribl","script","pavarotti","would","have","be","a","decent","actor","have","he","not","show","such","a","superb","voic","howev","effect","he","be","a","a","actor","opu","requir","it","not","even","jimmi","stewart","can","have","rescu","thi","turkei","of","a","scriptbr","br","i","give","it","a","polit","of","becaus","someon","mai","have","becom","a","fan","of","pavarotti","sing","and","of","opu","becaus","of","thi","movi"],"filtered":["attempt","crossov","appeal","appreci","opu","exploit","fame","great","opu","singer","time","fail","badli","desir","thi","movi","opu","well","find","record","pavarotti","doe","well","plot","revolv","around","romanc","doctor","heal","hi","throat","suddenli","becom","troublesom","br","br","onli","becaus","come","long","ago","larg","forget","like","much","opu","star","pavarotti","decent","actor","stage","presenc","asid","hi","sing","talent","noth","doe","thi","movi","negat","opinion","hi","culpabl","lie","reject","horrid","script","perhap","becaus","great","opera","silli","stori","toler","thi","onebr","br","know","except","involv","ne","know","br","br","plot","weak","trite","thi","movi","like","trudg","cold","mud","pick","juici","tidbit","opu","music","hang","abov","mud","wai","appreci","great","pavarotti","thi","get","hi","mani","superb","opu","vocalconcert","record","recogn","master","tenor","much","suitedbr","br","imdb","wrong","film","much","peopl","rememb","give","vote","fit","neatli","list","includ","sever","effort","singer","actor","model","athlet","exploit","popular","film","veri","often","go","badli","wrong","due","incompet","act","horribl","script","pavarotti","decent","actor","show","superb","voic","howev","effect","actor","opu","requir","even","jimmi","stewart","rescu","thi","turkei","scriptbr","br","give","polit","becaus","someon","mai","becom","fan","pavarotti","sing","opu","becaus","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["attempt","crossov","appeal","appreci","opu","exploit","fame","great","opu","singer","time","fail","badli","desir","opu","well","find","record","pavarotti","doe","well","plot","revolv","around","romanc","doctor","heal","throat","suddenli","becom","troublesom","onli","becaus","come","long","ago","larg","forget","like","opu","star","pavarotti","decent","actor","stage","presenc","asid","sing","talent","noth","doe","negat","opinion","culpabl","lie","reject","horrid","script","perhap","becaus","great","opera","silli","stori","toler","onebr","know","except","involv","ne","know","plot","weak","trite","like","trudg","cold","mud","pick","juici","tidbit","opu","music","hang","abov","mud","wai","appreci","great","pavarotti","get","mani","superb","opu","vocalconcert","record","recogn","master","tenor","suitedbr","imdb","wrong","peopl","rememb","give","vote","fit","neatli","list","includ","sever","effort","singer","actor","model","athlet","exploit","popular","veri","often","go","badli","wrong","due","incompet","act","horribl","script","pavarotti","decent","actor","show","superb","voic","howev","effect","actor","opu","requir","even","jimmi","stewart","rescu","turkei","scriptbr","give","polit","becaus","someon","mai","becom","fan","pavarot

{"value":"This is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for TV.<br /><br />\"The Muslims are good; the Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD.\" <br /><br />That's the message.<br /><br />Using \"entertainment\" to get across a propaganda message is nothing new.<br /><br />This movie lays it on thick.<br /><br />And apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up.<br /><br />I know better.<br /><br />The Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved over 500 shot-down US fliers from the Germans in World War II.<br /><br />Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British backing behind communist Tito. Roosevelt followed suit and as a result, after the war ended Yugoslavia was delivered over to communist Tito.<br /><br />And US ally Milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since.<br /><br />This movie is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign engineered by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG) which culminated in the Kosovo \"War,\" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of totally false claims by the ICG of \"mass graves\" in Kosovo filled with \"victims\" of the nasty Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians (Muslims) had no business being in Serbia's Kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print.<br /><br />I chose this movie to watch because the one-sentence description on the video cover looked interesting.<br /><br />Imagine my disgust when I discovered I had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia.<br /><br />Instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the Clinton Administration to come clean with the Congress and with the American people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo.<br /><br />I won't hold my breath waiting for such a

{"value":"Wow...<br /><br />I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time, and just had to buy the film.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing, or lack thereof. Time and again, characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor, but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow...<br /><br />I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey, plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while.","finished_norm":["wowbr","br","i","pick","thi","up","at","the","local","walmart","after","read","onlin","that","it","have","be","releas","earli","i","have","be","follow","thi","onlin","for","some","time","and","just","have","to","bui","the","filmbr","br","wowbr","br","i","guess","the","thing","that","realli","strike","me","be","the","edit","or","lack","thereof","time","and","again","charact","usual","the","narrat","and","whoever","he","be","with","be","show","walkingand","walkingand","walk","i","be","not","a","editor","but","i","do","know","that","you","can","cut","between","someon","leav","point","a","to","show","them","arriv","at","point","b","there","be","no","ne","to","show","almost","the","entir","journei","wowbr","br","i","actual","end","up","feel","somewhat","sorri","for","the","actor","involv","in","thi","thei","seem","to","have","be","give","no","direct","a","to","what","to","do","dure","scene","other","than","to","look","scare","or","look","happi","depend","on","what","action","be","to","be","add","at","a","late","datebr","br","wowbr","br","why","it","be","decid","to","do","almost","all","the","effect","us","cg","be","beyond","me","even","ilm","still","emploi","miniatur","sometim","on","of","the","much","distract","us","of","green","screen","in","thi","film","be","the","constant","rush","about","of","accord","to","the","end","credit","the","same","group","of","peopl","repres","the","citizenri","of","differ","town","and","citi","includ","london","at","time","thi","folk","be","come","and","go","with","no","regard","a","to","the","angl","of","the","shoot","or","the","distanc","thei","be","from","the","camera","in","on","shoot","in","london","there","appear","to","be","at","littl","two","man","over","six","foot","tall","walk","just","behind","the","narrat","brother","plai","by","star","anthoni","piana","without","hi","distract","mustach","not","sinc","gettysburg","have","i","see","such","a","fake","piec","of","facial","hairbr","br","wowbr","br","why","timothi","hine","talk","up","thi","film","the","wai","he","do","be","beyond","me","it","be","a","turkei","plain","and","simpl","on","the","plu","side","at","littl","for","me","it","have","provid","some","of","the","much","genuin","laughoutloud","bit","of","hilar","i","have","see","in","quit","a","while"],"filtered":["wowbr","br","pick","thi","local","walmart","read","onlin","releas","earli","follow","thi","onlin","time","bui","filmbr","br","wowbr","br","guess","thing","realli","strike","edit","lack","thereof","time","charact","usual","narrat","whoever","show","walkingand","walkingand","walk","editor","know","cut","someon","leav","point","show","arriv","point","b","ne","show","almost","entir","journei","wowbr","br","actual","end","feel","somewhat","sorri","actor","involv","thi","thei","seem","give","direct","dure","scene","look","scare","look","happi","depend","action","add","late","datebr","br","wowbr","br","decid","almost","effect","us","cg","beyond","even","ilm","still","emploi","miniatur","sometim","much","distract","us","green","screen","thi","film","constant","rush","accord","end","credit","group","peopl","repres","citizenri","differ","town","citi","includ","london","time","thi","folk","come","go","regard","angl","shoot","distanc","thei","camera","shoot","london","appear","littl","two","man","six","foot","tall","walk","behind","narrat","brother","plai","star","anthoni","piana","without","hi","distract","mustach","sinc","gettysburg","see","fake","piec","facial","hairbr","br","wowbr","br","timothi","hine","talk","thi","film","wai","beyond","turkei","plain","simpl","plu","side","littl","provid","much","genuin","laughoutloud","bit","hilar","see","quit"],"filtered2":["wowbr","pick","local","walmart","read","onlin","releas","earli","follow","onlin","time","bui","filmbr","wowbr","guess","thing","realli","strike","edit","lack","thereof","time","charact","usual","narrat","whoever","show","walkingand","walkingand","walk","editor","know","cut","someon","leav","point","show","arriv","point","b","ne","show","almost","entir","journei","wowbr","actual","end","feel","somewhat","sorri","actor","involv","seem","give","direct","dure","scene","look","scare","look","happi","depend","action","add","late","datebr","wowbr","decid","almost","effect","us","cg","beyond","even","ilm","still","emploi","miniatur","sometim","distract","us","green","screen","constant","rush","accord","end","credit","group","peopl","repres","citizenri","differ","town","citi","includ","london","time","folk","come","go","regard","angl","shoot","distanc","camera","shoot","london","appear","littl","two","man","six","foot","tall","walk","behind","narrat","brother","plai","star","anthoni","piana","without","distract","mustach","sinc","gettysburg","see","fake","piec","facial","hairbr","wowbr","timothi","hine","talk","wai","beyond","turkei","plain","simpl","plu","side","littl","provid","genuin","laughoutloud","bit","hilar","see","quit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,8,10,13,14,1

{"value":"Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton, and the diversity of his skills, I noticed this movie listed, and was surprised I hadn't heard of it.<br /><br />I'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000, and when it hit theaters more than 2-1/2 years later (that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production).<br /><br />Now Patrick Swayze can't act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make-up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed her watching paint dry.<br /><br />Being curious, I checked this site's production info. It made a whopping < $600 per screen its opening weekend, and just over $400 each, after its month's theater run in latter 2002. Overall gross was $261K, which I'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location.<br /><br />The story is pretty benign, and even the use of the usually interesting locale of Reno is as dull as the rest of the goings-on.<br /><br />It's something like several SNL bits all pieced together, none individually too great at all, and the overall presentation even worse.<br /><br />Whatever, the expenses for this production had to be considerable - even if all worked for less than their usual fees - so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bob's present (albeit understandably somewhat laconic here , compared with his usual work.<br /><br />Think of the three superb, totally diverse characters he portrayed in \"Sling Blade,\" \"Bandits\" and \"Bad Santa,\" and you know he realized this work was below standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this. One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, say, the typical \"Lifetime\" flick.","finished_norm":["be","a","fan","of","billi","bob","thornton","and","the","divers","of","hi","skill","i","notic","thi","movi","list","and","be","surpris","i","have","not","hear","of","itbr","br","i","have","travel","much","than","usual","dure","both","the","period","it","be","be","film","in","and","when","it","hit","theater","much","than","year","late","that","passag","of","time","be","the","clue","all","be","not","good","with","the","productionbr","br","now","patrick","swayz","ca","not","act","for","sour","appl","but","thornton","have","much","than","enough","abil","to","makeup","for","the","differ","between","them","and","charliz","theron","be","someon","whom","it","would","be","a","pleasur","to","see","even","if","it","show","her","watch","paint","drybr","br","be","curiou","i","check","thi","site","product","info","it","make","a","whop","per","screen","it","open","weekend","and","just","over","each","after","it","month","theater","run","in","latter","overal","gross","be","k","which","i","have","doubt","can","cover","cast","and","crow","hotel","and","food","for","a","week","on","locationbr","br","the","stori","be","pretti","benign","and","even","the","us","of","the","usual","interest","local","of","reno","be","a","dull","a","the","rest","of","the","goingsonbr","br","it","someth","like","sever","snl","bit","all","piec","togeth","none","individu","too","great","at","all","and","the","overal","present","even","worsebr","br","whatev","the","expens","for","thi","product","have","to","be","consider","even","if","all","work","for","littl","than","their","usual","fee","so","the","on","thing","which","make","it","a","bare","toler","opu","be","the","qualiti","of","the","film","and","billi","bob","present","albeit","understand","somewhat","lacon","here","compar","with","hi","usual","workbr","br","think","of","the","three","superb","total","divers","charact","he","portrai","in","sling","blade","bandit","and","bad","santa","and","you","know","he","realiz","thi","work","be","below","standard","long","befor","the","viewer","have","the","opportun","to","confirm","thi","on","star","for","him","even","here","and","on","becaus","product","be","well","than","sai","the","typic","lifetim","flick"],"filtered":["fan","billi","bob","thornton","divers","hi","skill","notic","thi","movi","list","surpris","hear","itbr","br","travel","much","usual","dure","period","film","hit","theater","much","year","late","passag","time","clue","good","productionbr","br","patrick","swayz","ca","act","sour","appl","thornton","much","enough","abil","makeup","differ","charliz","theron","someon","pleasur","see","even","show","watch","paint","drybr","br","curiou","check","thi","site","product","info","make","whop","per","screen","open","weekend","month","theater","run","latter","overal","gross","k","doubt","cover","cast","crow","hotel","food","week","locationbr","br","stori","pretti","benign","even","us","usual","interest","local","reno","dull","rest","goingsonbr","br","someth","like","sever","snl","bit","piec","togeth","none","individu","great","overal","present","even","worsebr","br","whatev","expens","thi","product","consider","even","work","littl","usual","fee","thing","make","bare","toler","opu","qualiti","film","billi","bob","present","albeit","understand","somewhat","lacon","compar","hi","usual","workbr","br","think","three","superb","total","divers","charact","portrai","sling","blade","bandit","bad","santa","know","realiz","thi","work","standard","long","befor","viewer","opportun","confirm","thi","star","even","becaus","product","well","sai","typic","lifetim","flick"],"filtered2":["fan","billi","bob","thornton","divers","skill","notic","list","surpris","hear","itbr","travel","usual","dure","period","hit","theater","year","late","passag","time","clue","good","productionbr","patrick","swayz","ca","act","sour","appl","thornton","enough","abil","makeup","differ","charliz","theron","someon","pleasur","see","even","show","watch","paint","drybr","curiou","check","site","product","info","make","whop","per","screen","open","weekend","month","theater","run","latter","overal","gross","k","doubt","cover","cast","crow","hotel","food","week","locationbr","stori","pretti","benign","even","us","usual","interest","local","reno","dull","rest","goingsonbr","someth","like","sever","snl","bit","piec","togeth","none","individu","great","overal","present","even","worsebr","whatev","expens","product","consider","even","work","littl","usual","fee","thing","make","bare","toler","opu","qualiti","billi","bob","present","albeit","understand","somewhat","lacon","compar","usual","workbr","think","three","superb","total","divers","charact","portrai","sling","blade","bandit","bad","santa","know","realiz","work","standard","long","befor","viewer","opportun","confirm","star","even","becaus","product","well","typic","lifetim","flick"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,10,12,14,17,20,21,22,26,28,29,48,51,53,56,57,60,78,79,81,92,93,99,100,137,139,140

{"value":"This Hal Roach comedy short, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-ninth in the \"Our Gang/Little Rascals\" series and the eleventh talkie. Bascally a showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit who gets special billing here, we see him going to his shack where the gang hangs out. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail for him and is told by Stepin to read it since he can't read it during the day as he goes to NIGHT school. It happens to be from his sweetheart in Tennesse so now Farina has to have his ears stuffed with cotton since it's too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer relays instructions to Mary Ann of making taffy from the radio but because he keeps running back and forth to the kitchen, he misses the lady announcer's segue to rice pudding and Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux! After the concoction is completed, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful tasting but very sticky substance as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. As they all try to clean the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mixes variable appliances' functions such a telephone that vacuums, a vacuum that rings, and a refrigerator that plays music! The End. What I've just described portends the meandering nature of this \"Our Gang\" short that served as the pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit movie short series. It's just as well that it never took place as Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for some laughs though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. So in summary, A Tough Winter is a curio worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore

{"value":"I don't know much about film-making, but good movies have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they may, but its not in any satisfying way, and I'm not meaning a happy ending, just ANY ending.<br /><br />Last Exit to Brooklyn, set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion. Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion...it leaves some of them dangling with no ending, or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an \"artistic\" ending.<br /><br />Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A sad transvestite character (an important character in the film), is struck by a car and killed. And that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....nothing.<br /><br />In another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene drags on and on and on...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course that's it for him too....brain erasure.....gone.<br /><br />Bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this movie is a depressing piece of sludge. Avoid it. And if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...don't even let the teenagers

{"value":"Watching CBS's \"Surrender, Dorothy\", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses, it isn't any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV--but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother, grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. Aside from being coarse and dim, these phony people are incredibly unconvincing, as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside (one young man, who wears muscle shirts to tell us he's gay, hears Diane Keaton say, \"Surrender, Dorothy\" and actually asks, \"That's from \"The Wizard of Oz\", right?\"...no, genius, it's from \"Citizen Kane\"!). Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits), but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. Here, she's a crazed harpy who doesn't learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie quickly forgets it's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom, who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat, \"It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there\".

{"value":"I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to watch it; though not expecting much. As the beginning credits roll around I'm surprised to discover this film was made under the Filmirage company. Filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as \"Troll 2\", \"Ator the Invincible\", and \"Quest for the Mighty Sword\", so I was compelled to watch.<br /><br />As the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent, even though it was unoriginal. The gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while into the film, the pace started dragging and I found myself thinking \"Okay someone better get killed soon\",or \"Someone better mutate\". At the onset of this drag, when I was having these thoughts, though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated, however as noted, the gore and effects weren't very good. What made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing; example: first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo, then he'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone, finally he'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed-- making the audience ask \"Was he dreaming he was at the zoo?\". Like the movie's pace, these scene transitions got progressively worse.<br /><br />I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once you've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into, hopefully you'll laugh-- which really, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; this movie unintentionally runs like a long-winded joke.<br /><br />The costume of the um, thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D' Amato's \"Quest for the Mighty Sword\", which was made in the same year. You've gotta love Filmirage movies, they're always re-using the same

{"value":"Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location. He bets chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky can't make a prim missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store <br /><br />This is one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals in splashy colour, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which I don't. My main problem with these type of movies is simply the music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, don't advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat (nicely performed by Kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them. The movie's trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show.","finished_norm":["nathan","detroit","run","illeg","crap","game","for","high","roller","in","nyc","but","the","heat","be","on","and","he","ca","not","find","a","secur","locat","he","bet","chronic","gambler","sky","masterson","that","sky","ca","not","make","a","prim","missionari","sarah","brown","go","out","to","dinner","with","him","sky","take","up","the","challeng","but","both","man","have","some","surpris","in","store","br","br","thi","be","on","of","that","expens","fifti","mgm","music","in","splashi","colour","with","big","set","loud","music","largerthanlif","role","and","perform","to","match","broadwai","photograph","for","the","big","screen","if","you","like","that","sort","of","thing","which","i","do","not","my","main","problem","with","thi","typ","of","movi","be","simpli","the","music","i","like","all","kind","of","music","from","albinoni","to","zz","top","but","broadwai","show","tune","in","swing","time","with","neverend","pahpahtahdah","trumpet","flourish","at","the","end","of","everi","bar","be","not","my","cup","of","tea","thi","be","write","by","the","tag","team","of","frank","loesser","mankiewicz","jo","swerl","and","ab","burrow","base","on","a","coupl","of","damon","runyon","stori","and","while","the","plot","be","quit","affabl","the","song","be","weak","blain","two","number","for","exampl","be","ident","unnecessari","do","not","advanc","the","plot","and","grate","on","the","ear","and","be","conjur","flagrantli","misogynist","if","that","sort","of","thing","bother","you","there","be","onli","two","memor","tune","luck","be","a","ladi","sing","by","brando","not","sinatra","a","you","mai","expect","and","sit","down","you","re","rockin","the","boat","nice","perform","by","kaye","but","you","have","to","sit","through","two","hour","to","get","to","them","the","movi","trump","card","be","a","young","brando","give","a","thought","laidback","perform","he","conjur","sing","quit","good","and","even","danc","a","littl","and","be","evenli","match","with","the","alwai","interest","simmon","the","sequenc","where","the","two","of","them","escap","to","havana","for","the","night","be","a","welcom","respit","from","all","the","nois","bustl","and","vowelmurd","of","noo","yawk","fan","of","music","mai","dig","thi","but","in","my","view","a","music","have","to","do","someth","much","than","just","film","the","stage","show"],"filtered":["nathan","detroit","run","illeg","crap","game","high","roller","nyc","heat","ca","find","secur","locat","bet","chronic","gambler","sky","masterson","sky","ca","make","prim","missionari","sarah","brown","go","dinner","sky","take","challeng","man","surpris","store","br","br","thi","expens","fifti","mgm","music","splashi","colour","big","set","loud","music","largerthanlif","role","perform","match","broadwai","photograph","big","screen","like","sort","thing","main","problem","thi","typ","movi","simpli","music","like","kind","music","albinoni","zz","top","broadwai","show","tune","swing","time","neverend","pahpahtahdah","trumpet","flourish","end","everi","bar","cup","tea","thi","write","tag","team","frank","loesser","mankiewicz","jo","swerl","ab","burrow","base","coupl","damon","runyon","stori","plot","quit","affabl","song","weak","blain","two","number","exampl","ident","unnecessari","advanc","plot","grate","ear","conjur","flagrantli","misogynist","sort","thing","bother","onli","two","memor","tune","luck","ladi","sing","brando","sinatra","mai","expect","sit","re","rockin","boat","nice","perform","kaye","sit","two","hour","get","movi","trump","card","young","brando","give","thought","laidback","perform","conjur","sing","quit","good","even","danc","littl","evenli","match","alwai","interest","simmon","sequenc","two","escap","havana","night","welcom","respit","nois","bustl","vowelmurd","noo","yawk","fan","music","mai","dig","thi","view","music","someth","much","film","stage","show"],"filtered2":["nathan","detroit","run","illeg","crap","game","high","roller","nyc","heat","ca","find","secur","locat","bet","chronic","gambler","sky","masterson","sky","ca","make","prim","missionari","sarah","brown","go","dinner","sky","take","challeng","man","surpris","store","expens","fifti","mgm","music","splashi","colour","big","set","loud","music","largerthanlif","role","perform","match","broadwai","photograph","big","screen","like","sort","thing","main","problem","typ","simpli","music","like","kind","music","albinoni","zz","top","broadwai","show","tune","swing","time","neverend","pahpahtahdah","trumpet","flourish","end","everi","bar","cup","tea","write","tag","team","frank","loesser","mankiewicz","jo","swerl","ab","burrow","base","coupl","damon","runyon","stori","plot","quit","affabl","song","weak","blain","two","number","exampl","ident","unnecessari","advanc","plot","grate","ear","conjur","flagrantli","misogynist","sort","thing","bother","onli","two","memor","tune","luck","ladi","sing","brando","sinatra","mai","expect","sit","re","rockin","boat","nice","perform","kaye","sit","two","hour","get","trump"

{"value":"Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family in Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island. The reckless Peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son. The Young family does not accept the trade, and they initiate a deadly war between families.<br /><br />\"Savage Island\" is a very low-budget movie, with a stupid screenplay, amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is totally absurd, and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family? The logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue Peter. Then the Young family vanishes; Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends, and nobody chases them? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning. There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject. I believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are. The good cast deserved a better material to work.

{"value":"\"The Cobweb\" is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong, sometimes noteworthy performances and high points, but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.<br /><br />The plot is preposterous. Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows. One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them, but a lot of the patients want to make their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children.<br /><br />The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real-like lunatic could buy it. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the acting. The cast following Widmark is composed of other great actors, many of them Academy Award-nominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus, the movie slows down. A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint, adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest.<br /><br />In a short analysis, \"The Cobweb\" is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which it does pretty quickly. It just really doesn't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch.","finished_norm":["the","cobweb","be","a","exampl","of","mani","exampl","of","movi","that","featur","strong","sometim","noteworthi","perform","and","high","point","but","unfortun","be","shatter","and","slow","down","drastic","by","a","murki","plot","and","veri","littl","to","interest","the","audienc","it","star","richard","widmark","a","a","doctor","work","at","a","mental","institut","whose","life","becom","in","turmoil","due","to","famili","problem","and","a","rather","ludicr","and","overwork","conflict","that","realli","seem","like","no","big","deal","at","allbr","br","the","plot","be","preposter","it","time","for","the","institut","to","get","new","drape","for","the","librari","window","on","old","woman","want","to","have","her","drape","put","over","them","but","a","lot","of","the","patient","want","to","make","their","own","and","somehow","thi","ridicul","and","unintention","looni","conflict","break","out","into","the","point","where","live","be","in","danger","and","famili","start","to","fall","apart","it","sound","much","like","a","conflict","that","would","occur","between","veri","young","childrenbr","br","the","question","of","the","logic","of","the","plot","and","whether","it","can","realli","happen","be","so","massiv","that","on","wonder","if","onli","a","reallik","lunat","can","bui","it","do","not","get","me","wrong","there","noth","wrong","with","the","act","the","cast","follow","widmark","be","compos","of","other","great","actor","mani","of","them","academi","awardnomine","and","winner","and","there","be","occasion","a","moment","in","the","film","that","work","out","brilliantli","but","it","alwai","exclud","the","stupid","plot","about","window","drape","unfortun","there","be","too","much","about","the","doggon","drape","and","thu","the","movi","slow","down","a","lot","of","the","take","be","long","and","do","from","on","camera","viewpoint","adher","to","the","slow","pace","and","lack","of","view","interestbr","br","in","a","short","analysi","the","cobweb","be","a","unrecogn","film","and","it","becom","obviou","why","to","the","viewer","basic","a","soon","a","the","plot","come","into","focu","which","it","doe","pretti","quickli","it","just","realli","doe","not","sound","like","much","fun","to","watch","and","i","tell","you","that","it","be","not","much","fun","to","watch"],"filtered":["cobweb","exampl","mani","exampl","movi","featur","strong","sometim","noteworthi","perform","high","point","unfortun","shatter","slow","drastic","murki","plot","veri","littl","interest","audienc","star","richard","widmark","doctor","work","mental","institut","whose","life","becom","turmoil","due","famili","problem","rather","ludicr","overwork","conflict","realli","seem","like","big","deal","allbr","br","plot","preposter","time","institut","get","new","drape","librari","window","old","woman","want","drape","put","lot","patient","want","make","somehow","thi","ridicul","unintention","looni","conflict","break","point","live","danger","famili","start","fall","apart","sound","much","like","conflict","occur","veri","young","childrenbr","br","question","logic","plot","whether","realli","happen","massiv","wonder","onli","reallik","lunat","bui","get","wrong","noth","wrong","act","cast","follow","widmark","compos","great","actor","mani","academi","awardnomine","winner","occasion","moment","film","work","brilliantli","alwai","exclud","stupid","plot","window","drape","unfortun","much","doggon","drape","thu","movi","slow","lot","take","long","camera","viewpoint","adher","slow","pace","lack","view","interestbr","br","short","analysi","cobweb","unrecogn","film","becom","obviou","viewer","basic","soon","plot","come","focu","doe","pretti","quickli","realli","doe","sound","like","much","fun","watch","tell","much","fun","watch"],"filtered2":["cobweb","exampl","mani","exampl","featur","strong","sometim","noteworthi","perform","high","point","unfortun","shatter","slow","drastic","murki","plot","veri","littl","interest","audienc","star","richard","widmark","doctor","work","mental","institut","whose","life","becom","turmoil","due","famili","problem","rather","ludicr","overwork","conflict","realli","seem","like","big","deal","allbr","plot","preposter","time","institut","get","new","drape","librari","window","old","woman","want","drape","put","lot","patient","want","make","somehow","ridicul","unintention","looni","conflict","break","point","live","danger","famili","start","fall","apart","sound","like","conflict","occur","veri","young","childrenbr","question","logic","plot","whether","realli","happen","massiv","wonder","onli","reallik","lunat","bui","get","wrong","noth","wrong","act","cast","follow","widmark","compos","great","actor","mani","academi","awardnomine","winner","occasion","moment","work","brilliantli","alwai","exclud","stupid","plot","window","drape","unfortun","doggon","drape","thu","slow","lot","take","long","camera","viewpoint","adher","slow","pace","lack","view","interestbr","short","analysi","cobweb","unrecogn","bec

{"value":"The Minion is about... well, a minion. A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another. Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of Templars, who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion. The movie begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion. Then flash forward to 1999, where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York. An archeologist is assigned to study/dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologist.<br /><br />The movie, is just that, a low budget B-movie flick. The movie lacks energy, and just trods along. You'll follow the chase but you won't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies (especially The Terminator films). The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome, in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is. It \"skillfully\" becomes a one-man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one-on one. And it's supposed to be around for a long time. All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience. The whole idea of a secret order of Templars, a door to hell, and the key isn't well explained. We are merely to accept that they just exist. The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else.<br /><br />The verdict: 2 of 5

{"value":"Hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest, though the audience sees he is a werewolf. The hunters never seem to realize this, because after they shoot him, he looks normal when they decapitate him.<br /><br />A doctor transplants the werewolf's eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, gets to have sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even gets his bandages removed.<br /><br />After he leaves the hospital, he finds his wife has been cheating on him too. When a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon (with a fake tree branch on the foreground), he turns into a werewolf! His torso grows larger, splitting his shirt, and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes. His pants stay intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, though some sort of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows give him a baleful look at times.<br /><br />Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a fair amount of blood and gore, and those are fairly well done. There's even a pretty good decapitation later in the movie. However, when a man falls from a height, a rather bad dummy does the job.<br /><br />Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is some sort of occult expert, and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with crutches named Androse who is also such an expert. They try to help him a little.<br /><br />Rich kills people who have done him wrong. A policewoman investigates the murders and tries to hit on Beaton, who doesn't much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it.<br /><br />Quite cheap, but between the nudity and blood and gore, and a not-terrible story combining (sort of) The Most Dangerous Game with The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man, it's somewhat entertaining. Available on its own, or in the box set Scream Queens Vol.

{"value":"Lee hosted the 100 Years of Horror for Ted Newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves. He said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was The Howling II, then he quipped, \"The less said about that the better.\" Indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. It was a film to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(See CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay, I'll cede Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave America to go to Romania. The story isn't really worth examining here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(I counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning's contributions.

{"value":"As soon as I began to see posters and hear talk about this movie, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was an incredible to behold and I couldn't wait to see the second one, especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other movie-goers at the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always, there simply were too few of them. In the first movie, there was constant fighting going on it seemed, but the second took a much more (and much unfortunate) preachy point of view. To sum up the plot, there wasn't much to it that wasn't expected. The machines were digging toward Zion with intent of destroying it (that's not a spoiler, everyone saw it in the commercials). The dialogue of the movie was absolutely horrendous. Unless you're a psychology major, you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie, and because of that simply won't care. It became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, for as bad-ass as he was in the first movie, seemed to get all religious and preachy. Personally, I don't need to hear about that or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of my time, and I don't think I can watch the first one anymore. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film quickly, and the small amount of good fighting scenes pushed me nearer the edge, and the ending of the movie shoved me right off. What movie ends with \"To Be Concluded\"? How original is that folks. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to come up with that one. In conclusion, the movie was bad and that's the end of

{"value":"Rather foolish attempt at a Hitchcock-type mystery-thriller, improbably exchanging espionage for archaeology and based on the Robin Cook novel; incidentally, I’ve recently acquired another adaptation of his work – COMA (1978) – in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) – a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a false step from which his so-far impressive career would not recover.<br /><br />Despite its scope and reasonably decent cast, however, this one proved a critical and commercial flop – mainly because the narrative just isn’t very thrilling: in fact, it’s quite dreary (feeble attempts at horror – the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment, rotting corpses galore, and even an attack by a flurry of bats – notwithstanding). Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure – it’s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country’s heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long. Sir John Gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts Down on the way of the loot, and pays for this ‘act of treason’ with his life.<br /><br />Typically, it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be – so that apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I

{"value":"OK, the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some...) - the execution is everything.<br /><br />This is what bothered me with this flick. And it did bother me immensely. The rhythm (directing, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the climax expected. We have seen those frigging highways five, six, seven times - why? Norton character's troubles were seen as a childish game, not enough deep to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a loony? References to the \"Taxi Driver\" were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick (or to E.N. for that matter).<br /><br />And IMHO, it is cowardly executed at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in Mid America. This guy should have killed the kid, blamed the father, create a real havoc. Or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc., but no, we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony, the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony, of course, dies. The happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed, safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop-corns, undisturbed.<br /><br />And that scene where the loony enters the movie, oh my God, I would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. Creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16 years old girl somewhere in Kansas nowhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, then you might enjoy this movie and its

{"value":"The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, poised to flick around to watch something else. The premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space \"bin\" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.<br /><br />The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes. And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.<br /><br />Ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.<br /><br />However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the \"Terrible movie\" archives and just about nudges it into the \"could have been a cult movie\" archives. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano's character. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.<br /><br />I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, I think

{"value":"\"That 'Malcom' show on FOX is really making a killing... can't we do our own version?\" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts we all know it's true, and that the only thing NBC added to the 'Malcom' metric was sex. And, boy, did they add sex...<br /><br />Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally walks in on his Aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off. He spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window, and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window. And this is all in the pilot.<br /><br />Take it from a grown man- a boy's puberty is so sex-crazy and testicle-driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience. The only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies, and you can count those on one hand. So it's no surprise that \"Tucker\" has the warmth and appeal of a strip-club bathroom. Did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty? Isn't this the stuff people go to jail for? If you doubt the show's depravity consider this: 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes aired; they then made the unprecedented move of \"burning off\" the remaining episodes by airing them AT MIDNIGHT so no children could see them. Ironic since kids were originally the target audience. <br /><br />Apart from its general scuzziness Tucker features a running voice-over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated, with it's ska incidental music and super-sarcasm. I couldn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn't exactly come a mile-a-minute...

{"value":"(SPOILERS IN THIS)<br /><br />\"Rosenstraße\" is a movie about heroic women in German Nazi time. But it is way too long, it is not touching and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting.<br /><br />The storytelling (storyline) is bad. Like in James Cameron´s Titanic an old woman remembers events of her live. Good, now we´ve got a point of view. Than there is another woman introduced who does the same. Confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling...How can Riemann know about the fate of the little girl´s mother and her interrogation for example?<br /><br />The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place. For example the scene when Riemann is proposing to Fabian. When did that happen? The scene looks like it is set in the Twenties...<br /><br />Riemann´s character is of course a talented pianist, well, she is even a Baroness! Wow. Her brother comes back from the Eastern Front, he has received a \"Ritterkreuz\" which he is showing in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even made some photographs! And so it goes, cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not work.<br /><br />Basically von Trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie. And in the end it´s all very simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels into bed and - ta da! - everyone is free. Which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the \"true story\" claim at the beginning.

{"value":"The saddest thing about this \"tribute\" is that almost all the singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise, Cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears in one.<br /><br />To see some of these singer upstarts make convoluted suffering faces, launch their pathetic squeals in the patent effort to scream \"I'm a singer!,\" is a true pain. It's the same feeling many of you probably had listening in to some horrendous operatic versions of simple songs such as Lennon's \"Imagine.\" Nothing, simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments, it's Cohen's art. Embellishments cast it in the street looking like the tasteless make-up of sex for sale.<br /><br />In this Cohen's tribute I found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tributes and awful reinterpretations, all of them entirely lacking the original irony of the master and, if truth be told, several of these singers sounded as if they had been recruited at some asylum talent show. It's Cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material, really, not the other way around: they may have been friends, or his daughter's, he could have become very tender-hearted and in the mood for a gift. Too bad it didn't stay in the family.<br /><br />Fortunately, but only at the very end, Cohen himself performed his majestic \"Tower of Song,\" but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous background of the U2, all of them carrying the expression that bored kids have when they visit their poor grandpa at the nursing home.<br /><br />A sad show, really, and sadder if you

{"value":"Holy @#%& this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I rank this well below anything I have ever watched on film or TV, and thats saying something. I once witnessed a cow crap in a field. I watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half, who knows... it might have moved or something. Well that was time better spent than watching this tripe. The acting was non-existent, the plot was somewhere other than on this film. I think I saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to Portland in hopes of becoming a Steven King shi77er. Please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs. It's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and I'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Bah... I can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone. Let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this Chilton on the rack, walk to your car, start the engine, then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones vibrate anymore. Be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.<br /><br />By the way, I watched this after a \"buddy\" of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it. HE dint come over, SHE had too. Whats worse is that she had to watch this $%&@ thing TWICE! I heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month.

{"value":"I really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /><br />First of all, surely they could have 2 found real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.<br /><br />So, if you don't care at all about the following: <br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone sucked. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE sucked).<br /><br />-plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Nothing to learn from this film. Nothing to be scared about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /><br />- scenery (Could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. Even the rocks are fake).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and \"women,\" this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic gore; again, wasted. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent

{"value":"Oh my, I think this may be the single cheesiest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the ultimate b-movies. The first proof is that it isn't a $5 DVD. Oh no, that's too mainstream for this. I got this on VHS, from a bin full of ex-rental videos at my local video store.<br /><br />If I may quote the blurb: \"In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan.\" It then goes on to say \"A multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents\"<br /><br />I must have seen a different movie. This was no epic, and it certainly wasn't a multi million dollar anything. No, 'Shogun Mayeda' is really just the crazy adventures of the Engrish-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). He isn't even a Shogun really, but thats not important. What is important, is that he does a really cool impression of John Cleese's repeated charging of the one castle in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers. Awesome.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this movie is Sho Kosugi's Engrish accent. The movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie, but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever, delivered by the coolest Engrish accent ever. And honestly, do you really want anything else? You could fast forward 'Shogun Mayeda' to the end, and replay Kosugi's final line over and over.

{"value":"*Spoilers* Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-English speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they're trendy, dude? Let's make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and \"hicks\" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the \"reality\" in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The film's \"message\" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. The clever message is nowhere to be

{"value":"This show is not clever. That's basically what it boils down to. The \"original humor\" that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny. In another comment, someone quotes a couple hilarious lines. The standout for me was George H.W. Bush telling the kids they're not supposed to watch any TV besides Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic.<br /><br />My problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season. I'm a liberal republican and I know Bush hasn't been a good president. We all do. But that's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time. I place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula, bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit.<br /><br />Again, just plain bad. Unfunny, and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed, but amazing and original shows like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons. Please don't watch this crap, unless you're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words Bush and dumb is comedic gold. <br /><br />Oh, and the voice of Bush sucks. All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent, and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits the voices aren't accurate. If you want funny political satire, watch Daily Show/Colbert. Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, since the stop motion action figure animation is EXTREMELY well done. Look for the George Bush as a Jedi bit on youtube.

{"value":"Someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow seen as \"realistic\" by some people.<br /><br />I didn't see anything realistic about the characters (although the actors did their best with really bad parts) or the situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort at being \"edgy\", \"gritty\" and \"down and dirty\".<br /><br />Sadly, it takes a lot more than hand-holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way.<br /><br />It's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies, with bad cinematography, non-existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as \"Art\".<br /><br />It's little wonder that films like \"In the Bedroom\" or \"About Schmidt\" get such raves. I found them to be meandering and very average, but compared to the current slew of independent clones like \"Raising victor Vargas\" they are outright brilliant and inspired.<br /><br />A few years ago seeing an \"independent\" film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets, nowadays, it means that chances are you'll get yet another by-the-numbers, let's-shake-the-camera-around-for-two-hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived.<br /><br />Is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them.","finished_norm":["someon","will","have","to","explain","to","me","why","everi","film","that","featur","poor","peopl","and","adopt","a","pseudogritti","look","be","somehow","see","a","realist","by","some","peoplebr","br","i","do","not","see","anyth","realist","about","the","charact","although","the","actor","do","their","well","with","realli","bad","part","or","the","situat","instead","i","see","a","forc","selfconsci","effort","at","be","edgi","gritti","and","down","and","dirtybr","br","sadli","it","take","a","lot","much","than","handhold","the","camera","without","rhym","or","reason","and","fail","to","light","the","film","to","achiev","ani","of","the","abov","qualiti","in","ani","signific","waybr","br","it","a","sad","commentari","on","the","state","of","independ","film","distribut","that","the","onli","film","that","see","the","insid","of","a","movi","theater","be","nowadai","all","carbon","copi","with","bad","cinematographi","nonexist","camera","direct","and","a","lot","of","swear","strive","to","pass","themselv","a","artbr","br","it","littl","wonder","that","film","like","in","the","bedroom","or","about","schmidt","get","such","rave","i","find","them","to","be","meander","and","veri","averag","but","compar","to","the","current","slai","of","independ","clone","like","rais","victor","varga","thei","be","outright","brilliant","and","inspiredbr","br","a","few","year","ago","see","a","independ","film","mean","that","you","would","like","be","treat","to","some","origin","and","a","lot","of","energi","and","care","and","mayb","a","few","technic","glitch","caus","by","the","low","budget","nowadai","it","mean","that","chanc","be","you","will","get","yet","anoth","bythenumb","letsshakethecameraaroundfortwohour","attempt","at","placat","the","lack","of","tast","of","independ","distributor","and","of","cours","all","that","to","serv","charact","and","situat","that","be","complet","unreal","and","contrivedbr","br","be","it","ani","surpris","that","the","independ","marketplac","have","few","and","few","surviv","compani","not","at","all","when","you","see","film","like","rais","victor","varga","that","do","noth","but","copi","the","wrong","of","the","film","that","preced","them"],"filtered":["someon","explain","everi","film","featur","poor","peopl","adopt","pseudogritti","look","somehow","see","realist","peoplebr","br","see","anyth","realist","charact","although","actor","well","realli","bad","part","situat","instead","see","forc","selfconsci","effort","edgi","gritti","dirtybr","br","sadli","take","lot","much","handhold","camera","without","rhym","reason","fail","light","film","achiev","ani","abov","qualiti","ani","signific","waybr","br","sad","commentari","state","independ","film","distribut","onli","film","see","insid","movi","theater","nowadai","carbon","copi","bad","cinematographi","nonexist","camera","direct","lot","swear","strive","pass","themselv","artbr","br","littl","wonder","film","like","bedroom","schmidt","get","rave","find","meander","veri","averag","compar","current","slai","independ","clone","like","rais","victor","varga","thei","outright","brilliant","inspiredbr","br","year","ago","see","independ","film","mean","like","treat","origin","lot","energi","care","mayb","technic","glitch","caus","low","budget","nowadai","mean","chanc","get","yet","anoth","bythenumb","letsshakethecameraaroundfortwohour","attempt","placat","lack","tast","independ","distributor","cours","serv","charact","situat","complet","unreal","contrivedbr","br","ani","surpris","independ","marketplac","surviv","compani","see","film","like","rais","victor","varga","noth","copi","wrong","film","preced"],"filtered2":["someon","explain","everi","featur","poor","peopl","adopt","pseudogritti","look","somehow","see","realist","peoplebr","see","anyth","realist","charact","although","actor","well","realli","bad","part","situat","instead","see","forc","selfconsci","effort","edgi","gritti","dirtybr","sadli","take","lot","handhold","camera","without","rhym","reason","fail","light","achiev","ani","abov","qualiti","ani","signific","waybr","sad","commentari","state","independ","distribut","onli","see","insid","theater","nowadai","carbon","copi","bad","cinematographi","nonexist","camera","direct","lot","swear","strive","pass","themselv","artbr","littl","wonder","like","bedroom","schmidt","get","rave","find","meander","veri","averag","compar","current","slai","independ","clone","like","rais","victor","varga","outright","brilliant","inspiredbr","year","ago","see","independ","mean","like","treat","origin","lot","energi","care","mayb","technic","glitch","caus","low","budget","nowadai","mean","chanc","get","yet","anoth","bythenumb","letsshakethecameraaroundfortwohour","attempt","placat","lack","tast","independ","distributor","cours","serv","charact","situat","complet","unreal","contrivedbr","ani","surpris","independ","marketplac","surviv","compani","see","like","rais","victor","varga","noth","copi","wrong","preced"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indic

{"value":"I watched this hoping to find out something I didn`t know about modern history`s most infamous man and couldn`t help thinking that history has been rewritten in HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL . Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? That`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document, and I haven`t even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicous by their absence <br /><br />There is one positive point about the mini series and that`s Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud ( Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate Hitler`s own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler.<br /><br />I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place .

{"value":"In an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says \"The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation.\" This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no \"secret\" to radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available. It uses a lightweight \"honeycomb\" of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. These materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays.<br /><br />Space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. But it simply wasn't a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who flew to the Moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. Only two have died from cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died from heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa), and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (Shepard would be
