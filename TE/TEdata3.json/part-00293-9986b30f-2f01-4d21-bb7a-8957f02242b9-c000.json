{"value":"If you hit your head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better. Those who think \"Scarface\" was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw \"Goodfellas\", \"Menace II Society\" or \"Dead Presidents\" and thought MMM \"That's the life for me!\" will like this movie. I thought I'd give the movie a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone above a 4th grade education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.","finished_norm":["if","you","hit","your","head","with","a","shovel","write","the","script","with","your","foot","you","mai","come","close","to","the","intellig","level","of","thi","movi","there","be","noth","in","thi","movi","that","have","not","be","do","a","thousand","time","in","other","gangster","flick","and","do","much","well","that","who","think","scarfac","be","some","kind","of","hero","to","be","look","up","to","or","see","goodfella","menac","ii","societi","or","dead","presid","and","think","mmm","that","the","life","for","me","will","like","thi","movi","i","think","i","have","give","the","movi","a","chanc","sinc","the","premis","be","perfect","for","a","prequel","i","should","have","know","well","after","see","mario","van","peebl","and","sean","comb","be","involv","anyon","abov","a","th","grade","educ","see","the","origin","with","pacino","a","real","actor","and","be","satisfi"],"filtered":["hit","head","shovel","write","script","foot","mai","come","close","intellig","level","thi","movi","noth","thi","movi","thousand","time","gangster","flick","much","well","think","scarfac","kind","hero","look","see","goodfella","menac","ii","societi","dead","presid","think","mmm","life","like","thi","movi","think","give","movi","chanc","sinc","premis","perfect","prequel","know","well","see","mario","van","peebl","sean","comb","involv","anyon","abov","th","grade","educ","see","origin","pacino","real","actor","satisfi"],"filtered2":["hit","head","shovel","write","script","foot","mai","come","close","intellig","level","noth","thousand","time","gangster","flick","well","think","scarfac","kind","hero","look","see","goodfella","menac","ii","societi","dead","presid","think","mmm","life","like","think","give","chanc","sinc","premis","perfect","prequel","know","well","see","mario","van","peebl","sean","comb","involv","anyon","abov","th","grade","educ","see","origin","pacino","real","actor","satisfi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,12,16,20,26,30,34,41,46,49,65,69,75,77,80,122,158,162,208,228,241,257,295,375,388,445,484,486,603,677,704,818,853,938,981,1049,1169,1393,1457,1685,1698,1705,1714,1818,2295,2522,3914,3979,6959,7950,7965],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,12,16,20,26,30,34,41,46,49,65,69,75,77,80,122,158,162,208,228,241,257,295,375,388,445,484,486,603,677,704,818,853,938,981,1049,1169,1393,1457,1685,1698,1705,1714,1818,2295,2522,3914,3979,6959,7950,7965],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.9418936859054116,3.200185830788664,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.2489347673732487,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.6289494000279396,2.7742700004069256,2.6627744961815836,2.7602659523229094,2.7910771187233068,3.2597778161886266,3.0914425013694116,3.241201430615691,3.291526514503207,3.3066947359763783,3.530930586689197,3.6559115968679063,3.5900195030592035,4.202455303235976,3.8962296530720266,3.952924996748572,4.039936373738201,4.176068548062782,4.528289141652134,4.436351646326448,4.933754249760298,4.662879295624898,4.890269137820559,5.00274712124725,4.74221603786142,4.8085911068062925,5.521540914662417,5.501738287366237,6.032366538428407,6.101359409915359,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.866653466237634E-5,6.820350016622259E-5,6.873371734462568E-5,6.833657319356362E-5,6.8337692811377E-5,6.824217037330708E-5,6.844513214961024E-5,6.82133210245915E-5,6.836668943695965E-5,0.0930479640143546,0.37256474685656926,6.810320968508175E-5,6.937432232167139E-5,7.036396227362811E-5,6.815286983513826E-5,6.796452470810851E-5,6.965981476030757E-5,6.845154494184713E-5,6.823917429032178E-5,6.829573243308987E-5,6.895653370063244E-5,6.851936310139114E-5,6.85973827911099E-5,6.867128877724568E-5,6.919830563894961E-5,6.883641798127183E-5,7.1730170223231E-5,6.812345614488528E-5,6.812527860687393E-5,6.829787361497493E-5,6.974952892995596E-5,6.844757875934349E-5,0.30463836799581456,6.864011169781767E-5,6.81976054633067E-5,6.851238236884425E-5,6.812926975838677E-5,6.816952914422425E-5,6.79641832488412E-5,6.798181629355802E-5,6.813483510000055E-5,6.885351323675934E-5,0.07752767157358124,6.823279536003519E-5,6.906189537011489E-5,6.825898347975075E-5,7.052689053989414E-5,0.017240556234192256,6.799871349133315E-5,6.814899480655572E-5,6.812535816763179E-5,7.004266183256513E-5,6.815000873367816E-5,6.797578106173021E-5,6.872191253972005E-5,6.816756236678775E-5,7.330672151659409E-5,6.811138343787719E-5,6.799792712522123E-5,6.832259726985293E-5,6.900030001375295E-5,6.831807734141817E-5,6.7985347356685

{"value":"From the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like its a movie about another Jason's from Friday the 13th. And It is... Dispute that the movie starts interesting. But as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone. He was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to. I'm tired of it. For me it's all over the same thing.<br /><br />In another words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information.<br /><br />Well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time :} For that and for intriguing intro 2

{"value":"I'm not sure if Carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion, and make the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satan is the father, but it drags on and on. Ron Perlman is laughable. The baby is really stupid looking, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You can pretty much see the material on the Satan costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of tedium. Very, very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous. After learning his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, gory, uproar? NO! He just puts his head down and sulks out of the room.

{"value":"This was an absolutely terrible movie. Don't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","absolut","terribl","movi","do","not","be","lure","in","by","christoph","walken","or","michael","ironsid","both","be","great","actor","but","thi","must","simpli","be","their","wrong","role","in","histori","even","their","great","act","can","not","redeem","thi","movi","ridicul","storylin","thi","movi","be","a","earli","nineti","u","propaganda","piec","the","much","pathet","scene","be","that","when","the","columbian","rebel","be","make","their","case","for","revolut","mare","conchita","alonso","appear","phoni","and","her","pseudolov","affair","with","walken","be","noth","but","a","pathet","emot","plug","in","a","movi","that","be","devoid","of","ani","real","mean","i","be","disappoint","that","there","be","movi","like","thi","ruin","actor","like","christoph","walken","good","name","i","can","bare","sit","through","it"],"filtered":["thi","absolut","terribl","movi","lure","christoph","walken","michael","ironsid","great","actor","thi","must","simpli","wrong","role","histori","even","great","act","redeem","thi","movi","ridicul","storylin","thi","movi","earli","nineti","u","propaganda","piec","much","pathet","scene","columbian","rebel","make","case","revolut","mare","conchita","alonso","appear","phoni","pseudolov","affair","walken","noth","pathet","emot","plug","movi","devoid","ani","real","mean","disappoint","movi","like","thi","ruin","actor","like","christoph","walken","good","name","bare","sit"],"filtered2":["absolut","terribl","lure","christoph","walken","michael","ironsid","great","actor","must","simpli","wrong","role","histori","even","great","act","redeem","ridicul","storylin","earli","nineti","u","propaganda","piec","pathet","scene","columbian","rebel","make","case","revolut","mare","conchita","alonso","appear","phoni","pseudolov","affair","walken","noth","pathet","emot","plug","devoid","ani","real","mean","disappoint","like","ruin","actor","like","christoph","walken","good","name","bare","sit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,19,21,25,27,41,49,51,80,88,112,128,141,143,166,169,187,201,218,222,244,266,274,288,466,499,506,515,589,601,634,710,1162,1201,1656,2322,2327,2465,2677,2751,2916,3169,3331,4377,5251],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,19,21,25,27,41,49,51,80,88,112,128,141,143,166,169,187,201,218,222,244,266,274,288,466,499,506,515,589,601,634,710,1162,1201,1656,2322,2327,2465,2677,2751,2916,3169,3331,4377,5251],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,3.1375198335242067,1.6920303308087352,3.4279798616619646,1.9951803900462557,2.0317223413467334,2.2466628996789315,2.3409902041158843,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.4732161909892554,2.561435818751577,2.5940874818617203,2.5771019354959765,2.634508058031767,2.747702973022204,2.748952192422636,2.8015621426949333,3.4446025032006995,3.3814747511661465,3.449627639403373,3.3956930001684253,3.496027715008137,7.013275788240304,3.5119855004467477,3.6528204042982337,8.767415825682052,4.315570107673808,4.798834931860927,16.56462274398725,5.051537285416681,5.463272006538442,5.290429193699031,5.695894301807195,5.408212229355414,5.604922523601468,5.583416318380505,5.967828017290836,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.128160887344332E-5,7.08009403205299E-5,7.13513501193459E-5,7.093908125822493E-5,7.094024351520284E-5,7.0841083231338E-5,7.105177453862231E-5,7.081113519330886E-5,7.097034443894386E-5,7.873772303655308E-5,0.4838951147285157,7.069683040897603E-5,7.201635169020823E-5,7.304368077165617E-5,7.074838180020801E-5,7.055286379796477E-5,7.231271673101375E-5,7.105843155357529E-5,7.083797304649233E-5,7.089668513137072E-5,7.15826521417586E-5,7.112883247808535E-5,7.120982344456276E-5,7.12865440424936E-5,7.183363164477903E-5,7.145796197399181E-5,7.446191894520334E-5,7.071784792843995E-5,7.071973979648457E-5,7.089890785733773E-5,7.240584754623148E-5,7.10543143242534E-5,7.627078729383303E-5,7.125417962520458E-5,7.079482112564492E-5,7.112158589356634E-5,7.072388294572738E-5,7.076567555706072E-5,7.055250933467261E-5,7.057081391059057E-5,7.072966023602042E-5,7.147570827968852E-5,7.111251016956579E-5,7.083135118307726E-5,7.169202637115911E-5,7.085853664271745E-5,7.321281394558882E-5,0.5105357423345095,7.058835461580872E-5,7.074435919628381E-5,7.071982238720873E-5,7.271014402798145E-5,7.074541173748052E-5,7.056454883493582E-5,7.13390957440487E-5,7.07636338775052E-5,7.609851111073173E-5,7.070531544834284E-5,7.058753830198284E-5,7.092457307993271E-5,7.162808523706518E-5,7.091988101599783E-5,7.057447944958976E-5,7.073880131599087E-5,7.055336267976196E-5,7.218582125682872E-5,7.116114678004637E-5,7.100956311849611E-5,7.094

{"value":"I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television. But the version put to DVD was a disaster. The lighting was poor to non-existent and entire scenes were simply excised. In one instance Adele is being put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid-sentence - where it's the next night. Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even introduced, leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie.<br /><br />The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $6.32 it was a gyp.<br /><br />Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We're sending this one back.","finished_norm":["i","bui","the","dvd","version","of","thi","movi","on","the","recommend","of","my","wife","who","love","the","version","she","see","air","in","televis","but","the","version","put","to","dvd","be","a","disast","the","light","be","poor","to","nonexist","and","entir","scene","be","simpli","excis","in","on","instanc","adel","be","be","put","to","bed","and","we","immedi","cut","to","anoth","scene","come","in","in","midsent","where","it","the","next","night","charact","such","a","grace","pool","and","mason","be","never","even","introduc","leav","on","to","wonder","if","thei","have","doze","off","for","a","few","minut","dure","the","moviebr","br","the","dvd","we","see","be","produc","by","platinum","disc","corp","and","even","at","it","be","a","gypbr","br","be","care","which","version","of","thi","movi","you","bui","we","re","send","thi","on","back"],"filtered":["bui","dvd","version","thi","movi","recommend","wife","love","version","see","air","televis","version","put","dvd","disast","light","poor","nonexist","entir","scene","simpli","excis","instanc","adel","put","bed","immedi","cut","anoth","scene","come","midsent","next","night","charact","grace","pool","mason","never","even","introduc","leav","wonder","thei","doze","minut","dure","moviebr","br","dvd","see","produc","platinum","disc","corp","even","gypbr","br","care","version","thi","movi","bui","re","send","thi","back"],"filtered2":["bui","dvd","version","recommend","wife","love","version","see","air","televis","version","put","dvd","disast","light","poor","nonexist","entir","scene","simpli","excis","instanc","adel","put","bed","immedi","cut","anoth","scene","come","midsent","next","night","charact","grace","pool","mason","never","even","introduc","leav","wonder","doze","minut","dure","moviebr","dvd","see","produc","platinum","disc","corp","even","gypbr","care","version","bui","re","send","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,10,19,34,42,54,59,63,68,73,74,146,159,175,198,201,205,210,220,239,247,261,263,297,298,303,347,353,465,663,679,721,929,987,1034,1065,1149,1216,1484,2362,3444,3896,6238],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,10,19,34,42,54,59,63,68,73,74,146,159,175,198,201,205,210,220,239,247,261,263,297,298,303,347,353,465,663,679,721,929,987,1034,1065,1149,1216,1484,2362,3444,3896,6238],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.852034211452262,1.1238870241028365,2.62476135602347,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,2.326138445979858,4.60053593038899,2.3791142619576227,2.5439726117360975,2.561435818751577,2.571852579609833,2.687151791517189,11.334773683510907,2.6593400337329487,8.191127420549101,2.7085302779237206,2.902686292364678,2.813490713560207,2.7819920465008363,2.868298950055202,6.030397968308703,3.0266839340212486,3.2681460658591432,3.7297814454343623,3.6715125373103863,3.6841709341823097,3.9954846111673676,4.035401218572811,4.125296222689358,4.1302590120314875,4.297765483040301,4.280272325592784,4.484804029712395,5.143104478942172,5.719991853386255,5.967828017290836,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.010740303035719E-5,7.956722008414147E-5,8.018577934904096E-5,7.972246506171449E-5,7.972377122454704E-5,7.961233332422874E-5,7.984911155825519E-5,7.957867724392579E-5,7.975759912023873E-5,8.848670242811691E-5,0.5525851901832205,7.945021971369377E-5,8.093311866551838E-5,8.208764738720408E-5,7.950815398509227E-5,7.928842775201583E-5,8.12661784006047E-5,7.985659281728182E-5,7.960883804915194E-5,7.96748196216843E-5,8.044572023174534E-5,7.993571049325138E-5,8.002672942640905E-5,8.011294925163898E-5,8.072777497936633E-5,8.03055914428322E-5,8.368148594888823E-5,7.947383953553848E-5,7.947596564686405E-5,7.967731755639253E-5,8.137084028839174E-5,7.985196580964452E-5,8.571432089920205E-5,8.007657760598467E-5,7.956034323584048E-5,7.992756666659213E-5,7.948062178371973E-5,7.952758898343201E-5,7.928802940054407E-5,7.930860037338734E-5,0.3904414675318412,8.032553502274311E-5,7.991736722396177E-5,7.960139629398134E-5,8.056863672611456E-5,7.963194774485877E-5,8.227772193159436E-5,8.106780404801009E-5,7.932831289621832E-5,7.950363331897823E-5,7.947605846363027E-5,8.17128135026544E-5,7.95048161814751E-5,7.93015595819627E-5,8.017200768764988E-5,7.952529451155351E-5,0.05079859111497697,7.945975533556073E-5,7.932739550978888E-5,7.970616054075799E-5,8.04967786651079E-5,7.970088752486206E-5,7.931271976427332E-5,7.94973872849218E-5,7.928898840329494E-5,8.112357125334858E-5,7.997202581850494E-5,7.980167369457656E-5,7.973188352425593E-5,8.002251891380415E-5,7.92860958152497E-5,7.9733555065844E-5,8.102678039832168E-5,7.94281809029692E-5,8.139398699561028E-5,7.963818094378663E-5,8.026146928092091E-5,7.9770946488

{"value":"Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles. This film is fantastic. Vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter. Plan 9 From OUterSpace dons't stand a chance against this. Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece- he's from England and thoroughly sarcastic.<br /><br />It has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her. Though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers. And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira.

{"value":"I'm at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this \"poppycock\" of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the buried movie set, and that was it. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is the buried set, some wolf headed monster running amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is. What I would have missed, had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase, some really bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialog, more bad C.G.I., and the hero fighting paper cut outs. Other than the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities.

{"value":"I was really horrified by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start sweating, and feeling uncomfortable, for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare, and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and most of all: your wallet, since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all.","finished_norm":["i","be","realli","horrifi","by","thi","eeri","movi","what","a","unusu","dark","atmospher","and","such","a","creepi","music","score","realli","promis","ind","after","ten","minut","you","realli","start","sweat","and","feel","uncomfort","for","you","start","fear","the","wrong","thi","movi","have","the","atmospher","of","a","true","nightmar","and","what","worseit","all","come","out","for","on","hour","and","a","half","i","have","be","try","to","fight","complet","boredom","and","fall","asleep","but","the","monstrou","soundtrack","keep","me","awak","nuit","noir","be","a","truli","horrifi","pictur","for","your","ey","your","ear","your","intellig","and","much","of","all","your","wallet","sinc","the","think","of","spend","preciou","monei","on","a","movi","ticket","for","thi","cheap","amateurist","homevideo","be","the","big","horror","of","all"],"filtered":["realli","horrifi","thi","eeri","movi","unusu","dark","atmospher","creepi","music","score","realli","promis","ind","ten","minut","realli","start","sweat","feel","uncomfort","start","fear","wrong","thi","movi","atmospher","true","nightmar","worseit","come","hour","half","try","fight","complet","boredom","fall","asleep","monstrou","soundtrack","keep","awak","nuit","noir","truli","horrifi","pictur","ey","ear","intellig","much","wallet","sinc","think","spend","preciou","monei","movi","ticket","thi","cheap","amateurist","homevideo","big","horror"],"filtered2":["realli","horrifi","eeri","unusu","dark","atmospher","creepi","music","score","realli","promis","ind","ten","minut","realli","start","sweat","feel","uncomfort","start","fear","wrong","atmospher","true","nightmar","worseit","come","hour","half","try","fight","complet","boredom","fall","asleep","monstrou","soundtrack","keep","awak","nuit","noir","truli","horrifi","pictur","ey","ear","intellig","wallet","sinc","think","spend","preciou","monei","ticket","cheap","amateurist","homevideo","big","horror"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,13,25,34,36,43,59,71,82,83,103,118,126,134,162,170,174,206,232,281,283,304,311,343,351,368,518,545,603,683,755,796,812,829,835,1054,1346,1766,1789,2058,2060,2158,2219,2534,2540,2563,3821,3975,6200,7511],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,13,25,34,36,43,59,71,82,83,103,118,126,134,162,170,174,206,232,281,283,304,311,343,351,368,518,545,603,683,755,796,812,829,835,1054,1346,1766,1789,2058,2060,2158,2219,2534,2540,2563,3821,3975,6200,7511],"values":[1.066728610262888,3.3953824709201923,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.8693254449200722,3.8429853485101932,2.020196584395323,2.292318797740072,2.098582041218749,2.354379525480895,2.2391270689902285,2.2443961816702407,2.3586007221245198,2.4071371113909277,2.456282578459816,2.597304642813496,2.8377834061292515,2.832333801361687,2.7678802023081546,2.871119826396843,2.9203338091782562,2.9705344631698933,3.0135689919434205,3.1346146732346205,3.4101163271295305,3.442099372982581,3.530930586689197,3.6105180246075443,3.79165684915245,3.850067611308864,3.952924996748572,3.8240921249056035,7.722819775825597,4.3095999406873045,4.416284083275639,4.715065048795469,4.798834931860927,4.956227105612356,4.979216623837056,5.064116067623542,5.014723312293965,5.426230734858092,5.156897801074508,10.518353300389853,5.7446844659766265,5.907203395474402,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.689365976829802E-5,6.644258018201936E-5,6.695910788666901E-5,6.657221744796057E-5,6.657330815879151E-5,6.648025197787448E-5,6.6677973562002E-5,6.645214747941675E-5,6.660155613163142E-5,7.389079089234695E-5,0.906962424357307,6.634487906230477E-5,6.758317332977129E-5,6.854726214777859E-5,6.639325705601388E-5,6.620977473950419E-5,0.062387637021357335,6.66842207848183E-5,6.647733324960544E-5,6.653243113940077E-5,6.717617143272989E-5,6.67502879733397E-5,6.68262933026451E-5,6.689829113850088E-5,6.741170115419947E-5,6.705915693500928E-5,6.987819649888331E-5,6.636460278653621E-5,6.636637819507852E-5,6.653451703893284E-5,6.794869262269633E-5,6.668035700365792E-5,7.157571463562613E-5,6.686791900811624E-5,6.643683767217479E-5,6.674348747364619E-5,6.637026630058284E-5,6.640948624479488E-5,6.620944209624262E-5,6.622661988014805E-5,6.63756879527783E-5,6.707581081465904E-5,6.673497043253223E-5,6.647111901447073E-5,0.02549106512442034,6.649663099317822E-5,6.870598383169386E-5,6.769564231280334E-5,6.624308081566146E-5,6.63894820753065E-5,6.636645570168771E-5,6.823425723944079E-5,6.639046982423386E-5,6.62207404696536E-5,6.694760786548881E-5,6.640757024682989E-5,7.141404341971657E-5,6.635284178011509E-5,6.624231475243429E-5,6.655860236325815E-5,6.721880776021593E-5,6.655419913312022E-5,6.623005977611216E-5,6.63842663266832E-5,6.621024291116492E-5,6.77422106

{"value":"The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the Playboy Channel. \"The Hazing\" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable... just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional

{"value":"Well where do i start? i think it's very insulting to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the film Annie, and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film, but i was so disappointed! the acting is awful, the original Annie came out a few years before i was born, I'm now 25 and Annie is still one of my favourite films, So i was really excited to see Annie 2. The acting was awful in the film, were any of the characters original? very badly written, directed and acted. This is not a film i wish to see again, and any Annie lover i recommend that you don't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed.

{"value":"I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it.

{"value":"This film is the worst film, but it ranks very high for me. It is how a slasher movie should be. It takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students. The teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers. It is filled with good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. The slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia. A lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this film for a fun time. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and

{"value":"My spouse & I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.","finished_norm":["my","spous","i","find","thi","movi","to","be","veri","schlocki","it","start","out","good","but","quickli","get","unbeliev","ridicul","much","of","the","act","be","poor","with","the","except","of","the","littl","girl","abbi","who","realli","be","terrif","in","addit","the","dialog","be","predict","lame","especi","gideon","the","angel","conjur","without","give","awai","anyth","when","on","of","the","charact","have","a","tragedi","she","almost","appear","nonchal","at","we","think","it","be","shock","but","then","we","realiz","that","it","be","just","a","terribl","script","we","love","almost","all","of","the","hallmark","movi","their","heartwarm","stori","but","thi","movi","doe","not","rise","to","the","occas","of","be","on","there","be","so","mani","great","on","do","not","wast","your","time","with","thi","horribl","movi"],"filtered":["spous","find","thi","movi","veri","schlocki","start","good","quickli","get","unbeliev","ridicul","much","act","poor","except","littl","girl","abbi","realli","terrif","addit","dialog","predict","lame","especi","gideon","angel","conjur","without","give","awai","anyth","charact","tragedi","almost","appear","nonchal","think","shock","realiz","terribl","script","love","almost","hallmark","movi","heartwarm","stori","thi","movi","doe","rise","occas","mani","great","wast","time","thi","horribl","movi"],"filtered2":["spous","find","veri","schlocki","start","good","quickli","get","unbeliev","ridicul","act","poor","except","littl","girl","abbi","realli","terrif","addit","dialog","predict","lame","especi","gideon","angel","conjur","without","give","awai","anyth","charact","tragedi","almost","appear","nonchal","think","shock","realiz","terribl","script","love","almost","hallmark","heartwarm","stori","doe","rise","occas","mani","great","wast","time","horribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,10,12,13,14,15,17,18,21,30,38,39,50,51,54,71,77,84,89,104,125,131,146,155,166,169,230,233,267,274,337,372,405,432,508,571,771,922,1036,1185,1880,2341,2425,4574,5617,7015,7603],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,10,12,13,14,15,17,18,21,30,38,39,50,51,54,71,77,84,89,104,125,131,146,155,166,169,230,233,267,274,337,372,405,432,508,571,771,922,1036,1185,1880,2341,2425,4574,5617,7015,7603],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.9214926742550966,1.9463902258768238,2.2212694515902225,1.9940046109572438,2.0728240170322856,2.2242236634876535,4.502423616410601,2.326138445979858,2.3074766467914385,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.7121382192999195,2.6102777977348763,2.7085302779237206,2.748952192422636,2.973659465713028,3.070535816550098,3.109204957709252,3.235085203598255,3.4149707055943286,3.467417180966871,3.7264536553416874,4.030886538218284,4.327618446189983,4.235066888824737,4.911775343041523,5.129498826886393,5.129498826886393,6.0662680901040895,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.072108426789254E-5,9.0109330787816E-5,9.080984491101591E-5,9.028514465969039E-5,9.028662388013592E-5,9.016042122266638E-5,9.042857094802667E-5,9.012230594265744E-5,9.032493373989367E-5,1.0021058334055611E-4,0.6744988385208301,8.997682867109231E-5,9.165620155899218E-5,9.296369741440093E-5,9.004243883593001E-5,8.979360038464181E-5,9.20333894236588E-5,9.043704342254102E-5,9.015646284762504E-5,9.023118652577957E-5,9.110422617707142E-5,9.052664364770365E-5,9.06297219649703E-5,9.072736532543829E-5,9.142365124340874E-5,9.094553128513327E-5,9.476870864924485E-5,9.000357795726195E-5,9.000598576374966E-5,9.023401541969685E-5,0.037882122207300535,9.043180336814038E-5,0.21386778776353546,9.068617468630202E-5,9.010154280430123E-5,9.051742081989163E-5,9.001125880679024E-5,9.006444883819483E-5,8.979314925433337E-5,8.981644573992882E-5,9.001861164362708E-5,9.096811725253776E-5,9.050587002109712E-5,9.014803511095659E-5,9.124342826354223E-5,9.018263441944382E-5,9.317895553170974E-5,9.180873183050844E-5,8.98387700367757E-5,9.003731921257482E-5,9.000609087810054E-5,9.253920061210408E-5,9.00386587962362E-5,8.980847209195142E-5,9.079424859898597E-5,9.006185036453616E-5,9.685162201368196E-5,8.998762769742713E-5,8.98377311029391E-5,9.026667990158205E-5,9.116204950251258E-5,9.026070824726118E-5,8.982111092184164E-5,9.003024562186362E-5,8.979423531836844E-5,9.187188780790272E-5,9.05677705043725E-5,9.037484789290968E-5,9.029581100389295E-5,9.062495358833605E-5,8.979095948225495E-5,9.029770401327202E-5,9.176227282872372E-5,8.995186986916797E-5

{"value":"Kurt Thomas stars as Jonathan Cabot some kind of a gymnast who trains for a special game which involves being hunted by a group of ninjas, but those ninjas won't stand a chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole Gymkata is one helluva bad movie, the atrocious acting, the god-awful script and really incompetent directing make the quality below human standards, however this movie is so terrible it becomes really, really funny. I mean with dialog such as \"I know I'll outsleep them!\" or \"Ha!, your through!\" only add to the mock value that Gymkata more then obtains. Besides it's (Wisely) the only movie that has are hero a gymnast who finds things to swing on in the heat of the moment.","finished_norm":["kurt","thoma","star","a","jonathan","cabot","some","kind","of","a","gymnast","who","train","for","a","special","game","which","involv","be","hunt","by","a","group","of","ninja","but","that","ninja","wo","not","stand","a","chanc","especi","sinc","cabot","be","a","gymnast","take","a","a","whole","gymkata","be","on","helluva","bad","movi","the","atroci","act","the","godaw","script","and","realli","incompet","direct","make","the","qualiti","below","human","standard","howev","thi","movi","be","so","terribl","it","becom","realli","realli","funni","i","mean","with","dialog","such","a","i","know","i","will","outsleep","them","or","ha","your","through","onli","add","to","the","mock","valu","that","gymkata","much","then","obtain","besid","it","wise","the","onli","movi","that","have","be","hero","a","gymnast","who","find","thing","to","swing","on","in","the","heat","of","the","moment"],"filtered":["kurt","thoma","star","jonathan","cabot","kind","gymnast","train","special","game","involv","hunt","group","ninja","ninja","wo","stand","chanc","especi","sinc","cabot","gymnast","take","whole","gymkata","helluva","bad","movi","atroci","act","godaw","script","realli","incompet","direct","make","qualiti","human","standard","howev","thi","movi","terribl","becom","realli","realli","funni","mean","dialog","know","outsleep","ha","onli","add","mock","valu","gymkata","much","obtain","besid","wise","onli","movi","hero","gymnast","find","thing","swing","heat","moment"],"filtered2":["kurt","thoma","star","jonathan","cabot","kind","gymnast","train","special","game","involv","hunt","group","ninja","ninja","wo","stand","chanc","especi","sinc","cabot","gymnast","take","whole","gymkata","helluva","bad","atroci","act","godaw","script","realli","incompet","direct","make","qualiti","human","standard","howev","terribl","becom","realli","realli","funni","mean","dialog","know","outsleep","ha","onli","add","mock","valu","gymkata","obtain","besid","wise","onli","hero","gymnast","find","thing","swing","heat","moment"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,11,13,21,26,29,31,38,62,77,88,100,102,111,113,115,122,162,166,188,203,241,267,292,299,319,374,375,377,406,410,432,451,486,616,713,972,1219,1247,1635,1900,1903,1945,2260,2488,2713,2879,3083,3494,3921,4053,4318],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,11,13,21,26,29,31,38,62,77,88,100,102,111,113,115,122,162,166,188,203,241,267,292,299,319,374,375,377,406,410,432,451,486,616,713,972,1219,1247,1635,1900,1903,1945,2260,2488,2713,2879,3083,3494,3921,4053,4318],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,3.3953824709201923,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.519311641348122,2.0226120445069267,1.9463902258768238,2.0317223413467334,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,2.1183455303375887,2.1521782565202803,2.201553588425805,2.2489347673732487,2.3586007221245198,2.4423870329693536,2.5378812223426954,2.569760528637609,2.6627744961815836,2.7085302779237206,2.9752256367457734,2.7949961309240425,2.9056060024680126,3.4572130107926293,3.2597778161886266,3.0602441305135506,3.121829110937649,3.2070272508030975,3.235085203598255,3.216957819005698,3.3066947359763783,3.5173618574831282,3.865219416329466,3.9911462095687695,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.654440426979034,4.828393734102471,5.626901430320244,5.014723312293965,11.124725818365345,5.214056214914456,5.426230734858092,5.426230734858092,5.463272006538442,5.878215858601149,5.822646007446338,19.02756440019674,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.39886372358985E-5,6.355714689569463E-5,0.03057302417578579,6.36811543429071E-5,6.368219768692403E-5,6.359318270069241E-5,6.378231773627375E-5,0.11029812730932291,6.370921892171615E-5,7.06819006444132E-5,0.4357179672458292,6.346368868861475E-5,6.464820696653021E-5,6.557042784444802E-5,6.350996574835964E-5,6.333445160500125E-5,6.491425027538953E-5,6.378829365799651E-5,6.359039072541336E-5,6.364309585314579E-5,6.425888013295119E-5,6.385149171554238E-5,6.392419632554227E-5,6.399306747740185E-5,6.448418139405115E-5,6.414694727904665E-5,6.684356308136918E-5,6.34825558613656E-5,6.348425416840327E-5,6.364509116733447E-5,6.499785268061905E-5,6.378459767108405E-5,0.3736316738897562,6.396401433185718E-5,6.35516537685352E-5,0.04497502929273703,6.34879734233149E-5,6.352549014450029E-5,6.333413340759559E-5,6.33505652037725E-5,6.34931596268618E-5,6.416287792280525E-5,6.383683937680849E-5,6.35844463588006E-5,6.43570640544237E-5,6.36088504167687E-5,6.572225664688916E-5,6.475579170595778E-5,6.336631128247084E-5,6.3506354705521E-5,6.348432830909637E-5,6.527101594798345E-5,6.350729955900954E-5,6.334494112121231E-5,6.404024250361245E-5,6.352365735348315E-5,6.831271205314731E-5,6.3471

{"value":"Interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work.<br /><br />When you see the film, maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as I did. I didn't really know who to root for in the movie, Taye Diggs looked bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant.<br /><br />If the victim Alicia(Mia Kirschner) had been more of a nice girl, we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead. I can't understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't

{"value":"There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running. If something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail. I thought I had seen bad but this is it. A white van in a western. Did they not catch this? Oh well, and I paid top dollar at the rental. It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie. The talking was so so slow, the acting was mostly OK but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming.

{"value":"Great western I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well I'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one I saw. Great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none! The acting was poor to say the least and I couldn't care less about any of the characters, making the whole film pointless. the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish like you see on those \"FACT OR FICTION\" programmes on sci-fi.<br /><br />Please, if you are looking for a good film, a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half, please look elsewhere.","finished_norm":["great","western","i","hear","you","all","sai","brilliant","effort","good","i","be","not","sure","what","film","you","all","watch","but","it","must","have","be","a","differ","on","to","the","on","i","see","great","western","or","ind","good","film","of","ani","genr","have","charact","you","can","believ","in","and","thi","film","have","none","the","act","be","poor","to","sai","the","littl","and","i","can","not","care","littl","about","ani","of","the","charact","make","the","whole","film","pointless","the","stori","be","too","big","for","the","maker","and","perhap","thei","should","try","their","hand","at","make","straight","to","tv","low","budget","rubbish","like","you","see","on","that","fact","or","fiction","programm","on","scifibr","br","pleas","if","you","be","look","for","a","good","film","a","great","western","or","even","just","a","enjoy","hour","and","a","half","pleas","look","elsewher"],"filtered":["great","western","hear","sai","brilliant","effort","good","sure","film","watch","must","differ","see","great","western","ind","good","film","ani","genr","charact","believ","thi","film","none","act","poor","sai","littl","care","littl","ani","charact","make","whole","film","pointless","stori","big","maker","perhap","thei","try","hand","make","straight","tv","low","budget","rubbish","like","see","fact","fiction","programm","scifibr","br","pleas","look","good","film","great","western","even","enjoy","hour","half","pleas","look","elsewher"],"filtered2":["great","western","hear","brilliant","effort","good","sure","watch","must","differ","see","great","western","ind","good","ani","genr","charact","believ","none","act","poor","littl","care","littl","ani","charact","make","whole","pointless","stori","big","maker","perhap","try","hand","make","straight","tv","low","budget","rubbish","like","see","fact","fiction","programm","scifibr","pleas","look","good","great","western","even","enjoy","hour","half","pleas","look","elsewher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,10,14,16,17,21,27,36,51,82,91,97,111,119,141,146,172,174,204,205,206,216,217,235,256,318,346,370,401,467,534,548,736,762,770,829,912,916,1098,2352,2371],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,10,14,16,17,21,27,36,51,82,91,97,111,119,141,146,172,174,204,205,206,216,217,235,256,318,346,370,401,467,534,548,736,762,770,829,912,916,1098,2352,2371],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,2.2350163994518417,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,2.600540117735859,1.4680183469605717,5.141969792492947,2.020196584395323,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.1183455303375887,2.1653408989309972,2.2657547357741192,2.326138445979858,2.5001408943598484,2.456282578459816,2.624524614047584,2.571852579609833,2.597304642813496,2.6070186965339692,2.6113665294700725,2.6457189377809835,2.748952192422636,2.902686292364678,6.046778076248792,2.9958122703541616,3.0879275592619675,3.342254038012865,3.4272107604888307,3.459754308221302,3.68099128126493,3.749984152751882,12.160999699650311,3.8240921249056035,3.9405024767500145,4.100845126825194,4.186539847930077,5.0768550934009715,5.259176650194926]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.074261701582871E-5,9.013071833539889E-5,9.083139872638718E-5,9.030657393688681E-5,9.030805350842691E-5,9.01818208966195E-5,9.045003426760849E-5,9.014369656990743E-5,9.034637246107153E-5,1.0023436843140927E-4,0.9928185623173957,8.999818476915381E-5,9.167795625803357E-5,9.298576244900444E-5,9.006381050663543E-5,8.98149129932704E-5,9.205523364864976E-5,9.045850875307388E-5,9.017786158205353E-5,9.025260299595428E-5,9.112584986415608E-5,9.054813024494732E-5,9.065123302796458E-5,9.074889956419029E-5,9.144535074638001E-5,9.096711730581288E-5,9.479120210522642E-5,9.002494040429558E-5,9.002734878227879E-5,9.025543256131261E-5,9.217379065137786E-5,9.045326745494064E-5,9.709392016091991E-5,9.070769914841106E-5,9.012292850339777E-5,9.053890522808709E-5,9.003262307688185E-5,9.008582573299819E-5,8.981446175588569E-5,8.983776377092732E-5,9.003997765892251E-5,9.098970863402127E-5,9.052735168769793E-5,9.016943184505263E-5,9.126508499039339E-5,9.020403936572333E-5,9.32010716580613E-5,9.183052273277553E-5,8.986009336647031E-5,9.005868966813208E-5,9.002745392157867E-5,9.256116489193025E-5,9.006002956974508E-5,8.982978823039591E-5,9.081579871255562E-5,9.008322664258897E-5,9.687460985141405E-5,9.000898635864925E-5,8.985905418604163E-5,9.028810479614808E-5,9.118368691402638E-5,9.028213172444857E-5,8.984243006012613E-5,9.005161439849643E-5,8.981554807769924E-5,9.189369370030966E-5,9.05892668631203E-5,9.039629846126599E-5,9.031724281275777E-5,9.064646351955096E-5,8.981227146406249E-5,9.0319136271

{"value":"How sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching. Every single part of the film was awful. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, simply everything. I actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film. I particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion, and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand, because, .............well. Just because.

{"value":"What is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film? No point. This is why the Prom Night sequels are so embarrassingly bad.<br /><br />The original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed, bar one, in a brutal act of revenge. Can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen-to-be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then? Prom Night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen? But in the end, i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad, you end up laughing yourself through it.","finished_norm":["what","be","the","point","of","creat","sequel","that","have","absolut","no","relev","to","the","origin","film","no","point","thi","be","why","the","prom","night","sequel","be","so","embarrassingli","badbr","br","the","origin","film","entail","a","group","of","child","hide","a","dark","secret","that","eventu","get","them","all","kill","bar","on","in","a","brutal","act","of","reveng","can","someon","pleas","explain","to","me","what","a","dead","prom","queentob","rise","from","the","grave","to","steel","the","crown","have","to","do","with","the","movi","then","prom","night","have","continu","plot","hole","that","leav","the","audienc","constantli","wonder","how","do","that","happen","and","why","should","that","happen","but","in","the","end","i","guess","you","can","call","it","on","of","that","movi","that","be","so","bad","you","end","up","laugh","yourself","through","it"],"filtered":["point","creat","sequel","absolut","relev","origin","film","point","thi","prom","night","sequel","embarrassingli","badbr","br","origin","film","entail","group","child","hide","dark","secret","eventu","get","kill","bar","brutal","act","reveng","someon","pleas","explain","dead","prom","queentob","rise","grave","steel","crown","movi","prom","night","continu","plot","hole","leav","audienc","constantli","wonder","happen","happen","end","guess","call","movi","bad","end","laugh"],"filtered2":["point","creat","sequel","absolut","relev","origin","point","prom","night","sequel","embarrassingli","badbr","origin","entail","group","child","hide","dark","secret","eventu","get","kill","bar","brutal","act","reveng","someon","pleas","explain","dead","prom","queentob","rise","grave","steel","crown","prom","night","continu","plot","hole","leav","audienc","constantli","wonder","happen","happen","end","guess","call","bad","end","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,9,21,24,32,66,69,74,76,94,133,139,142,168,175,180,210,222,228,243,346,362,368,387,395,410,433,707,716,798,810,871,922,1070,1157,1191,1444,1628,1893,2017,3424,3437,4068],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,9,21,24,32,66,69,74,76,94,133,139,142,168,175,180,210,222,228,243,346,362,368,387,395,410,433,707,716,798,810,871,922,1070,1157,1191,1444,1628,1893,2017,3424,3437,4068],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.3711311285073675,3.859446346783224,4.254065042302116,1.9486336368009016,2.1337665533324026,4.16224563969396,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.2844323215331563,2.4894767118610357,2.3791142619576227,2.7097314792693545,5.374303583034378,2.5771019354959765,2.7742700004069256,2.627841366673578,3.023389038124396,3.058539100262467,3.1346146732346205,6.721038771980316,3.153168081130368,3.2070272508030975,3.164467636384302,3.6375061693251913,3.6746621462132825,3.9282323841582003,3.8425769395797067,3.9954846111673676,4.030886538218284,4.176068548062782,4.224077767249142,4.3215761317340196,4.573751515728891,4.613282354485526,17.159975560158767,4.979216623837056,5.7959777603641776,5.604922523601468,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.617991199795284E-5,7.566621304194107E-5,7.62544456968894E-5,7.581384669728695E-5,7.581508882180822E-5,7.570911447838496E-5,7.59342839926723E-5,7.567710848220126E-5,7.584725820964734E-5,8.414839264491545E-5,0.7082334214007041,7.555494894415156E-5,7.696514459871605E-5,7.806306929843194E-5,7.561004282473999E-5,7.540108928903417E-5,7.728187514232538E-5,7.594139846190638E-5,7.57057905690122E-5,7.576853720913354E-5,7.650164224577247E-5,7.601663717099996E-5,7.610319364463165E-5,7.618518630011699E-5,7.676986846506745E-5,7.636838366536713E-5,7.957876543605395E-5,7.557741073771207E-5,7.557943261044234E-5,7.577091267555801E-5,7.738140568631437E-5,7.59369983063491E-5,8.15119349280494E-5,7.615059787682088E-5,7.565967335049465E-5,7.600889261837737E-5,7.558386046707605E-5,7.562852496755318E-5,7.540071046786514E-5,7.54202728908327E-5,7.559003475905775E-5,7.638734945510771E-5,7.599919323214567E-5,7.569871366684634E-5,7.661853241284724E-5,7.572776724680537E-5,7.824382490299467E-5,7.709322665102949E-5,7.543901895171739E-5,7.560574379701331E-5,7.557952087660521E-5,7.770661270068125E-5,7.560686866634508E-5,7.541357729403596E-5,7.624134922998182E-5,7.562634298862024E-5,8.132782033418128E-5,7.556401705530222E-5,7.54381465427412E-5,7.57983415513872E-5,7.655019739564843E-5,7.579332705994548E-5,7.542419031697944E-5,7.55998039923666E-5,7.54016224528054E-5,7.71462597120744E-5,7.605117203516158E-5,7.588917190385522E-5,7.582280339317797E-5,7.609918956426486E-5,7.53988716820352E-5,7.582439298273229E-5,7.705421430129806E-5,7.553399064818856E-5,7.740341756102565E-5,7.573369484560182E-5,0.28581397056442814,7.585995118597343E-5,7.537523191509135E-5,7.54686646918649E-5]}}
{"value":"I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 Sept 2009). I am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as I can remember. I can truthfully say that Brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film I have ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local children's club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film. The owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this

{"value":"The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat. These sequences are lively and well-filmed, but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy-drama with a flat ending. For fans of the stars only.","finished_norm":["the","threesom","of","bill","boyd","robert","armstrong","and","jame","gleason","plai","conei","island","carni","vie","for","the","hand","of","ginger","roger","a","work","gal","who","sell","salt","water","taffi","with","the","outbreak","of","world","war","i","the","threesom","enlist","and","pursu","ginger","from","afar","the","half","of","thi","rko","path","product","be","hard","go","with","the","three","male","lead","chew","up","the","sceneri","with","overcook","onelin","and","snappi","dialogu","that","quickli","grow","tiresom","the","half","concentr","on","action","sequenc","a","the","u","navi","pursu","both","a","german","merchant","cruiser","and","a","uboat","thi","sequenc","be","live","and","wellfilm","but","overal","thi","be","a","overlong","and","unsatisfi","comedydrama","with","a","flat","end","for","fan","of","the","star","onli"],"filtered":["threesom","bill","boyd","robert","armstrong","jame","gleason","plai","conei","island","carni","vie","hand","ginger","roger","work","gal","sell","salt","water","taffi","outbreak","world","war","threesom","enlist","pursu","ginger","afar","half","thi","rko","path","product","hard","go","three","male","lead","chew","sceneri","overcook","onelin","snappi","dialogu","quickli","grow","tiresom","half","concentr","action","sequenc","u","navi","pursu","german","merchant","cruiser","uboat","thi","sequenc","live","wellfilm","overal","thi","overlong","unsatisfi","comedydrama","flat","end","fan","star","onli"],"filtered2":["threesom","bill","boyd","robert","armstrong","jame","gleason","plai","conei","island","carni","vie","hand","ginger","roger","work","gal","sell","salt","water","taffi","outbreak","world","war","threesom","enlist","pursu","ginger","afar","half","rko","path","product","hard","go","three","male","lead","chew","sceneri","overcook","onelin","snappi","dialogu","quickli","grow","tiresom","half","concentr","action","sequenc","u","navi","pursu","german","merchant","cruiser","uboat","sequenc","live","wellfilm","overal","overlong","unsatisfi","comedydrama","flat","end","fan","star","onli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,11,24,40,48,100,112,116,129,140,157,165,171,190,206,224,235,248,314,349,412,539,561,594,620,649,720,722,771,830,861,925,1138,1479,2097,2143,2388,2407,2463,2506,2929,3111,3597,3829,4402,5035,5280,5523,5737,6611,7334,7356,7405,8525],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,11,24,40,48,100,112,116,129,140,157,165,171,190,206,224,235,248,314,349,412,539,561,594,620,649,720,722,771,830,861,925,1138,1479,2097,2143,2388,2407,2463,2506,2929,3111,3597,3829,4402,5035,5280,5523,5737,6611,7334,7356,7405,8525],"values":[0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.3210361566119257,1.6284968758320737,1.6955116224012472,2.1405462403177813,2.2466628996789315,2.2466628996789315,2.4106958340079214,2.317169775997098,2.3360150694757706,2.448847599972298,2.373087554090762,2.558331832813986,5.194609285626992,2.689504733779216,2.6457189377809835,2.689504733779216,3.189397019426827,6.113673944383873,3.107414446935464,3.6105180246075443,3.4725585804672896,3.490764544963862,3.7568101178222815,3.6375061693251913,4.072271754381138,3.850067611308864,3.7264536553416874,3.9571003681590526,3.892300374932137,4.339813719283801,4.224077767249142,4.715065048795469,5.00274712124725,5.00274712124725,5.089758498236879,5.102830579804232,10.370137356082408,5.156897801074508,5.373120909544144,5.463272006538442,5.822646007446338,5.7446844659766265,5.999576715605417,12.978249881848246,6.600350576034347,6.389041482367141,13.589013180950609,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.0856279215004886E-5,5.051334343503059E-5,0.41812124043591975,5.061190089198858E-5,5.0612730111002054E-5,5.054198362866292E-5,5.069230256956182E-5,5.0520617026421165E-5,5.0634205790445824E-5,0.05271395259840968,0.09287297196845894,5.043906561197481E-5,5.138048575903727E-5,5.211343967853382E-5,5.047584525244379E-5,5.033635179444263E-5,5.15919291243453E-5,5.069705205567104E-5,5.053976464916146E-5,5.0581653128238466E-5,5.10710602889902E-5,5.074728000549516E-5,5.080506348247E-5,5.085980024012148E-5,5.125012307789993E-5,5.0982099362216345E-5,5.3125289967650474E-5,5.045406068370729E-5,5.045541044798781E-5,5.058323894503164E-5,5.165837384714389E-5,5.069411459441988E-5,5.441583763141637E-5,5.0836709658016304E-5,5.0508977659782807E-5,5.074210988754359E-5,5.045836640195758E-5,5.048818358404261E-5,5.0336098900541355E-5,5.034915840689241E-5,5.046248824338193E-5,0.304591182371347,5.0735634759370345E-5,5.05350402421218E-5,5.114909397028932E-5,5.0554435866714165E-5,5.2234108727030046E-5,5.146599093282978E-5,5.036167292524154E-5,5.0472975302233994E-5,5.045546937282122E-5,5.187547

While that might make this campy and fun, it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true-to-life gusto or didn't have the cojones. This movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad Lifetime TV movie.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","some","of","the","comment","about","thi","film","and","can","onli","surmis","that","some","peopl","be","easili","entertain","thi","movi","be","noth","it","so","badli","write","direct","and","act","that","it","bare","make","a","impress","the","charact","speak","in","clicheridden","dialogu","and","the","situat","be","complet","implaus","while","that","mai","make","thi","campi","and","fun","it","doe","not","becaus","everyth","be","so","lifeless","the","film","becom","dull","it","a","if","lee","rise","decid","to","write","a","drama","about","a","woman","struggl","with","her","sexual","but","then","she","either","be","not","allow","by","studio","exec","to","give","the","stori","some","truetolif","gusto","or","do","not","have","the","cojon","thi","movi","can","go","in","the","enyclopedia","a","the","standardissu","bad","lifetim","tv","movi"],"filtered":["read","comment","thi","film","onli","surmis","peopl","easili","entertain","thi","movi","noth","badli","write","direct","act","bare","make","impress","charact","speak","clicheridden","dialogu","situat","complet","implaus","mai","make","thi","campi","fun","doe","becaus","everyth","lifeless","film","becom","dull","lee","rise","decid","write","drama","woman","struggl","sexual","either","allow","studio","exec","give","stori","truetolif","gusto","cojon","thi","movi","go","enyclopedia","standardissu","bad","lifetim","tv","movi"],"filtered2":["read","comment","onli","surmis","peopl","easili","entertain","noth","badli","write","direct","act","bare","make","impress","charact","speak","clicheridden","dialogu","situat","complet","implaus","mai","make","campi","fun","doe","becaus","everyth","lifeless","becom","dull","lee","rise","decid","write","drama","woman","struggl","sexual","either","allow","studio","exec","give","stori","truetolif","gusto","cojon","go","enyclopedia","standardissu","bad","lifetim","tv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,9,10,11,17,18,21,22,23,30,46,49,65,70,102,103,115,145,172,193,195,207,248,249,259,280,344,367,418,448,463,473,519,521,570,583,589,842,922,932,1733,2041,2044,3007,5777,7915],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,9,10,11,17,18,21,22,23,30,46,49,65,70,102,103,115,145,172,193,195,207,248,249,259,280,344,367,418,448,463,473,519,521,570,583,589,842,922,932,1733,2041,2044,3007,5777,7915],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,3.8147700134888347,2.094675786251684,2.087553710177271,2.098582041218749,2.201553588425805,2.34599021453259,2.5001408943598484,2.517840471459249,2.51289241584188,2.5531798379045583,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.7464553122240485,2.8028805344481915,2.983093497946387,3.0791938792932125,3.164467636384302,3.2681460658591432,3.3467891931782563,3.335489637924323,3.5614461306151473,3.4076979462652486,3.944626193933877,3.4986697244709752,3.496027715008137,3.8883864756110005,4.030886538218284,4.058285512406398,4.798834931860927,4.9676558014359795,4.9676558014359795,5.501738287366237,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.115644479100795E-5,9.054175557314505E-5,9.124563138671262E-5,9.071841315648793E-5,9.071989947554996E-5,9.059309118538305E-5,9.086252773183513E-5,9.055479299433003E-5,9.075839318011866E-5,0.21378319639920454,0.7062333426542011,9.040861759331065E-5,9.209604960732086E-5,0.07296337393135943,9.047454261412605E-5,9.022451001443014E-5,9.247504755513848E-5,9.087104086482448E-5,9.058911381453447E-5,9.066419608341654E-5,9.154142535614374E-5,9.096107107163043E-5,9.106464405042467E-5,9.116275599065925E-5,9.186238330830468E-5,9.138196890484233E-5,9.522349327737686E-5,9.04354952463678E-5,9.043791460765449E-5,9.066703855288516E-5,9.259414523194328E-5,9.086577566397808E-5,9.753671277904128E-5,9.11213676821681E-5,9.053393021595245E-5,9.095180398448033E-5,9.044321295544969E-5,9.049665823997524E-5,9.022405671919687E-5,9.024746500206897E-5,9.045060107774325E-5,9.140466325982466E-5,9.094019775467056E-5,9.058064563408304E-5,9.16812954581445E-5,9.061541098085304E-5,9.362611110917002E-5,9.22493118548638E-5,9.026989643076543E-5,9.046939842226047E-5,9.04380202264376E-5,9.298328607594398E-5,9.047074443443675E-5,9.023945308943036E-5,9.122996022969357E-5,9.049404729652677E-5,9.731640231436643E-5,9.041946844298722E-5,9.026885251119941E-5,9.069985978803267E-5,9.159952616937526E-5,9.069385947639836E-5,9.02521525716776E-5,9.046229088616405E-5,9.022514799513401E-5,9.231277091085968E-5,9.100239529156912E-5,9.08085468656749E-5,9.072913068730526E-5,9.105985279087447E-5,9.022185643864268E-5,9.073103278102851E-5,9.220262990143025

{"value":"This movie barely followed the story line of the movie. All of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie. They ended up turning it into a cheesy \"tween\" Disney movie \"crush\" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part, or one of the likes. This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can't believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic rendition. If you've ever read the book, I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of \"Lord of the Rings\" equivalence. This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time.

done.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","bare","follow","the","stori","line","of","the","movi","all","of","the","fascin","point","in","the","book","do","not","even","exist","in","the","movi","thei","end","up","turn","it","into","a","cheesi","tween","disnei","movi","crush","stori","between","meg","and","calvin","it","be","so","bad","it","should","have","be","hillari","duff","plai","the","part","or","on","of","the","like","thi","movi","be","noth","much","than","a","insult","to","the","intellig","and","mystic","of","the","book","i","ca","not","believ","disnei","can","even","get","awai","with","make","such","a","cheap","basic","rendit","if","you","have","ever","read","the","book","i","think","you","would","agre","it","can","easili","be","make","into","a","movi","of","lord","of","the","ring","equival","thi","movi","should","have","never","be","abl","to","us","the","titl","of","a","wrinkl","in","time","poorli","do"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bare","follow","stori","line","movi","fascin","point","book","even","exist","movi","thei","end","turn","cheesi","tween","disnei","movi","crush","stori","meg","calvin","bad","hillari","duff","plai","part","like","thi","movi","noth","much","insult","intellig","mystic","book","ca","believ","disnei","even","get","awai","make","cheap","basic","rendit","ever","read","book","think","agre","easili","make","movi","lord","ring","equival","thi","movi","never","abl","us","titl","wrinkl","time","poorli"],"filtered2":["bare","follow","stori","line","fascin","point","book","even","exist","end","turn","cheesi","tween","disnei","crush","stori","meg","calvin","bad","hillari","duff","plai","part","like","noth","insult","intellig","mystic","book","ca","believ","disnei","even","get","awai","make","cheap","basic","rendit","ever","read","book","think","agre","easili","make","lord","ring","equival","never","abl","us","titl","wrinkl","time","poorli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,8,9,12,17,24,40,42,44,49,56,61,66,81,91,96,107,145,151,155,260,264,286,351,398,454,528,543,583,589,603,622,709,841,1084,1258,1446,2160,3028,3292,4181,4498,4865,6444,7118],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,8,9,12,17,24,40,42,44,49,56,61,66,81,91,96,107,145,151,155,260,264,286,351,398,454,528,543,583,589,603,622,709,841,1084,1258,1446,2160,3028,3292,4181,4498,4865,6444,7118],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,1.3210361566119257,1.6284968758320737,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0390708128715254,2.1439533986393955,2.34599021453259,8.400736460430558,2.3074766467914385,2.6754694156628323,2.757740698455715,2.780700890737216,3.0135689919434205,3.143848349181566,3.2556198060399626,3.4198487640477615,3.477726550625732,3.4986697244709752,3.496027715008137,3.530930586689197,3.4933926673701317,3.6497387377608255,8.60733041033498,4.224077767249142,4.34596758485818,4.581533656170946,5.014723312293965,5.5623629091826725,5.521540914662417,5.878215858601149,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.80193238814773E-5,7.749322134111552E-5,7.809565724344771E-5,7.764441970391418E-5,7.764569182031317E-5,7.753715865972238E-5,7.77677650335377E-5,7.750437985863277E-5,7.767863795825249E-5,8.618020850491143E-5,0.5853524429882573,7.737927070171267E-5,7.88235164172062E-5,7.99479511992641E-5,7.743569485869556E-5,7.722169600846256E-5,7.91478946189778E-5,7.777505128610563E-5,7.753375449246745E-5,7.75980161896749E-5,0.06253572354957469,7.78521066811467E-5,7.79407531152682E-5,7.802472553498413E-5,7.86235252185046E-5,7.821234631582814E-5,8.150024477332618E-5,7.740227484940456E-5,7.740434554152343E-5,7.760044901323008E-5,7.924982839054456E-5,0.05071629293023731,8.348009185844538E-5,7.798930195245542E-5,7.748652374470643E-5,0.2497689722284929,7.740888031154016E-5,7.745462326447011E-5,7.722130804041819E-5,7.72413428103908E-5,7.741520368568467E-5,7.823177004648928E-5,7.783424154741856E-5,7.752650671404826E-5,7.84685350621307E-5,7.755626181096673E-5,8.013307126157333E-5,7.895469109122153E-5,7.726054150670465E-5,7.743129202824085E-5,7.74044359389283E-5,7.958288773279084E-5,7.743244405825004E-5,7.723448554419864E-5,7.808224455411051E-5,7.745238860028361E-5,8.329153170192156E-5,7.738855776810985E-5,7.725964803286508E-5,7.762854017651575E-5,7.839855005296683E-5,7.762340460702463E-5,7.724535482525545E-5,7.742520880327549E-5,7.722224204580836E-5,7.900900466887701E-5,7.788747541132193E-5,7.772156368496587E-5,7.765359266486022E-5,7.793665235386286E-5,7.7219424855948E-5,7.7655220636054E-5,7.891473676377158E-5,7.73578063

{"value":"Robert Forster, normally a very strong character actor, is lost at sea here cast as a New York family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. Scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the \"Death Wish\" vein. It isn't difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings: the dialogue is full of howlers, the crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and the supporting characters are ridiculously over-written (particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom).

{"value":"This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place.
