{"value":"I couldn't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths, and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot. And we get titty shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree to boot.<br /><br />A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were leftover sets from the Klaus Kinski film, ANDROID which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks.<br /><br />Inside the container is a midget alien (played by Ray's son) who starts clawing people to death. It was pretty funny watching this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it, running around in the dark. We even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of ET, which I thought was hilarious.<br /><br />And then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by William Fair, after the mini creature chews into Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. A low budget take on ALIEN, I suppose...<br /><br />The whole thing ends abruptly, looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits. Talk about a lack of funding...<br /><br />Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they also weren't sure if Aldo Ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines. He barely did.<br /><br />Low budget cheese sneeze. It's fun to watch, I'll grant ya that. <br /><br />4 out of

{"value":"I shouldn't even review this movie, since it's not actually a horror movie -- and thus not worthy of Dr. Cheese's attention. At least, it's not horror in the usual sense. It's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yep, that's right; in plain terms, this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g.<br /><br />\"The Order\" had lots of flaws, not all of them unique. In particular, it seems to me the main problem with the \"religious\" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, films like this are just an anything-goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers' (usually dull and illogical) imaginations.<br /><br />Think about it. If someone made a movie ostensibly about, say, physics, but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong, but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals, you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot. The same goes for these sorts of movies.<br /><br />In other words, \"The Order\"(and many similar movies before it) invent out of whole cloth stuff about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions. Unsurprisingly, the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing.<br /><br />Avoid this steaming

{"value":"This film should have been only 10 minutes. I mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing (I even hesitate to call it a movie). The opening credits of the film was somehow promising. As the film begins by short comments of the man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already tickled your fancy. But as it turns out Cave's performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who don't even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat. I mean what does the filmmaker really think? five-minute close-up shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in Australia!!! What does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding \"fake applause\" to these endless nasty performances. The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is not a single footage of Cohen's past. In fact, except for a few photographs of his early days as a singer/poet there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between disastrous camera-work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming Cohen's lyrics. If you ever decided to waste your money on this film, DON'T! just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time.","finished_norm":["thi","film","should","have","be","onli","minut","i","mean","there","be","realli","onli","minut","worth","of","watchabl","content","in","thi","thing","i","even","hesit","to","call","it","a","movi","the","open","credit","of","the","film","be","somehow","promis","a","the","film","begin","by","short","comment","of","the","man","himself","you","realli","rub","your","hand","and","stai","tune","for","much","footag","from","cohen","life","good","nick","cave","doe","a","reason","job","cover","on","of","cohen","famou","song","the","length","of","cave","perform","make","you","even","much","eager","to","see","much","of","cohen","whose","wit","and","good","speak","word","have","alreadi","tickl","your","fanci","but","a","it","turn","out","cave","perform","be","onli","the","start","of","lengthi","super","bore","perform","by","liter","a","bunch","of","no","on","who","do","not","even","have","a","minim","attract","to","keep","you","on","your","seat","i","mean","what","doe","the","filmmak","realli","think","fiveminut","closeup","shot","of","wanna","be","singer","in","a","fake","concert","in","australia","what","doe","the","filmmak","realli","think","to","insult","the","audienc","by","add","fake","applaus","to","thi","endless","nasti","perform","the","film","be","a","perfect","tortur","that","show","you","veri","littl","of","what","you","come","to","see","there","be","not","a","singl","footag","of","cohen","past","in","fact","except","for","a","few","photograph","of","hi","earli","dai","a","a","singerpoet","there","be","absolut","noth","if","you","add","up","all","the","minut","that","cohen","talk","it","mai","not","even","reach","minut","but","thi","minut","be","tortuous","present","bite","by","bite","in","between","disastr","camerawork","that","captur","some","of","the","much","unattract","peopl","scream","cohen","lyric","if","you","ever","decid","to","wast","your","monei","on","thi","film","don","t","just","throw","it","in","the","garbag","and","at","littl","save","your","time"],"filtered":["thi","film","onli","minut","mean","realli","onli","minut","worth","watchabl","content","thi","thing","even","hesit","call","movi","open","credit","film","somehow","promis","film","begin","short","comment","man","realli","rub","hand","stai","tune","much","footag","cohen","life","good","nick","cave","doe","reason","job","cover","cohen","famou","song","length","cave","perform","make","even","much","eager","see","much","cohen","whose","wit","good","speak","word","alreadi","tickl","fanci","turn","cave","perform","onli","start","lengthi","super","bore","perform","liter","bunch","even","minim","attract","keep","seat","mean","doe","filmmak","realli","think","fiveminut","closeup","shot","wanna","singer","fake","concert","australia","doe","filmmak","realli","think","insult","audienc","add","fake","applaus","thi","endless","nasti","perform","film","perfect","tortur","show","veri","littl","come","see","singl","footag","cohen","past","fact","except","photograph","hi","earli","dai","singerpoet","absolut","noth","add","minut","cohen","talk","mai","even","reach","minut","thi","minut","tortuous","present","bite","bite","disastr","camerawork","captur","much","unattract","peopl","scream","cohen","lyric","ever","decid","wast","monei","thi","film","throw","garbag","littl","save","time"],"filtered2":["onli","minut","mean","realli","onli","minut","worth","watchabl","content","thing","even","hesit","call","open","credit","somehow","promis","begin","short","comment","man","realli","rub","hand","stai","tune","footag","cohen","life","good","nick","cave","doe","reason","job","cover","cohen","famou","song","length","cave","perform","make","even","eager","see","cohen","whose","wit","good","speak","word","alreadi","tickl","fanci","turn","cave","perform","onli","start","lengthi","super","bore","perform","liter","bunch","even","minim","attract","keep","seat","mean","doe","filmmak","realli","think","fiveminut","closeup","shot","wanna","singer","fake","concert","australia","doe","filmmak","realli","think","insult","audienc","add","fake","applaus","endless","nasti","perform","perfect","tortur","show","veri","littl","come","see","singl","footag","cohen","past","fact","except","photograph","earli","dai","singerpoet","absolut","noth","add","minut","cohen","talk","mai","even","reach","minut","minut","tortuous","present","bite","bite","disastr","camerawork","captur","unattract","peopl","scream","cohen","lyric","ever","decid","wast","monei","throw","garbag","littl","save","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,11,12,13,14,15,18,23,28,29,34,44,45,46,49,59,71,75,88,89,95,96,97,105,108,126,132,134,142,147,154,168,186,189,219,222,232,235,242,249,258,266,272,280,289,299,310,323,328,330,344,356,366,411,419,440,441,443,491,526,549,598,639,648,658,677,683,702,709,802,851,865,897,925,934,1052,1142,1178,1312,1320,1342,1389,1443,1453,1651,1750,1948,2017,2066,2312,2386,2469,2962,3013,3393,3463,3558,3573,3810,3863,3937,3979,7065,7970],"values

{"value":"If you are looking for eye candy, you may enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live performers. The visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie. Now, saying that, the visuals are the ONLY thing good in Sky Captain.<br /><br />After ten minutes, I knew I was watching one of the worse movies of all time. I was hoping this movie would get better, but it never achieved any degree of interest. After thirty minutes, the urge to walk out kept growing and growing. Now, I own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number. Yet, this is only the second movie I felt like walking out of my entire life.<br /><br />Acting---there is none. The three main performers are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other movie I wanted to walk out on) is just awful in the title role. I would rather sit through Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Law again.<br /><br />Paltrow tries SO hard to be campy, that it backfires in her face. The last article I had read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would applaud that decision.<br /><br />Story---Soap operas are better written. The story behind Sky Captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses.<br /><br />Directing---none. Everything was put into the special effects that story, acting and directing suffer greatly. Even \"the Phantom Menace\" had better acting and that is NOT saying a great deal.<br /><br />I would have to give this movie a \"0\" out of \"10\".

{"value":"My, how the mighty have fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role. This movie is bad for one reason in particular: lapses in logic. Its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted.<br /><br />The story details Della(Kim Basinger)is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid. From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.<br /><br />So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting is made-for-TV bad. Hell, this pseudo thriller is made-for-TV bad. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs(1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk a Caucasian woman. Don't you just love America?)is laughable to a fault. The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame. I only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else.

{"value":"In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is decapitated and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. In the present days (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session, where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy per US$ 9.98; despite of having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version \"Horror Rises from the Tomb\" is a trash B (or C) movie that immediately made me recall Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is disclosed through awful screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with lots of naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back.

{"value":"Robin Williams gave a fine performance in The Night Listener as did the other cast members. However, the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a \"must see.\" I think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the Gabriel Noon(I had to spell it this way, because IMDb wants to auto correct the right spelling to \"No one\") character. The movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes, or so it seems, Noon begins his search for Pete Logande, the boy caller.<br /><br />This happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations aren't too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you... I'm in the hospital...why did you boyfriend move out... etc. In the book, the kid almost becomes Noon's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax.<br /><br />In the movie, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? Since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between Noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller doesn't exist? <br /><br />I know there's a difference between a book and a movie, but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen, because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. Since it doesn't, the movie falls apart.<br /><br />This is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City.

{"value":"In sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. Additionally, the film is not really realistic. Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals. I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. The actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of

{"value":"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Amateurish. This film tries it's best to be different from most films by the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it doesn't work....it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power-suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching. The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually aCt....they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger. The only thumbs up(get it...finger....LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their pride) after making this terrible movie.

{"value":"Why do I constantly do this to myself? I mean, really, it's right there in the title - \"The Incredible Melting Man\". What else would I expect? I have to admit, I'm a sucker for just about anything I come across on the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary Rick Baker. As for creepy, I'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out. Now they were truly scary.<br /><br />Something I could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster's victims wouldn't simply just run away when faced with virtual annihilation. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen that she could have run right out of at any time. Incredible Steve-O couldn't muster much more than a brisk walk, so why not just blow right by him? I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. <br /><br />This flick had some of the feel of a 'Tales From The Crypt' episode, but 'Tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist which often times you didn't see coming. This was one picture that you couldn't quite get a handle on coming OR going. For example, in an early scene, you can clearly make out that Melting Man's eyeball fell out of his head, so how did he manage to get around for the rest of the story? I guess we're not supposed to ask.<br /><br />At eighty four minutes, this picture was about an hour and a half too long.

{"value":"<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven finally bombed out on this one. He became a joke on himself. Once again we have a film which includes sex and violence, immorality, leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans.<br /><br />Its all for nothing. Because their is no action at all in this film. It fudges all its set pieces. All the actors give the kind of performances form a Verhoeven film. In other words rampant over acting on almost every level. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited. In this scientists are acting the same way. Sorry Paul but Soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset.<br /><br />One major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things Kevin Bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens (Elizabeth Shue excepted) walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. How could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all??? Think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of story and characterisation. Then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was.<br /><br />More insulting is the Doco on the DVD where everyone is claiming that Verhoeven is some kind of MAd Genius.

{"value":"December holiday specials, like the original Frosty, ought to be richly-produced with quality music and a wholesome, yet lighthearted storyline. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound, and feel...well, \"special\" and they should have a decent and appropriate December holiday subtext.<br /><br />So when I saw Legend of Frosty the Snowman in the TV listings, I got my kids (6 and 8) pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately relating how much I enjoyed it as a kid. As my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high, but 10 minutes into it my kids were yawning and my wife and I were giving each other \"the look\" and rolling our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed -- I guess they were fed up with the insensitive language and pointless, disconnected segments. I was actually embarrassed about their (and my) disappointment with this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents crossed with a worse-than-normal episode of Sponge Bob than a classic holiday movie. Don't get me wrong...those shows are fine and I like them as much as the next guy, but when I watch Fairly Odd Parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied.<br /><br />We picked out some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the embarrassingly bad Legend of Frosty the Snowman.","finished_norm":["decemb","holidai","special","like","the","origin","frosti","ought","to","be","richlyproduc","with","qualiti","music","and","a","wholesom","yet","lightheart","storylin","thei","should","have","a","touch","of","the","mystic","magic","of","the","holidai","basic","thei","should","look","sound","and","feelwel","special","and","thei","should","have","a","decent","and","appropri","decemb","holidai","subtextbr","br","so","when","i","see","legend","of","frosti","the","snowman","in","the","tv","list","i","get","my","kid","and","pump","up","for","it","by","tell","them","the","stori","of","the","origin","frosti","and","passion","relat","how","much","i","enjoi","it","a","a","kid","a","my","wife","and","kid","cozi","up","on","the","couch","to","watch","the","movi","the","expect","be","high","but","minut","into","it","my","kid","be","yawn","and","my","wife","and","i","be","give","each","other","the","look","and","roll","our","ey","after","minut","my","kid","be","actual","ask","to","go","to","bed","i","guess","thei","be","fe","up","with","the","insensit","languag","and","pointless","disconnect","segment","i","be","actual","embarrass","about","their","and","my","disappoint","with","thi","moviebr","br","unfortun","legend","of","frosti","the","snowman","be","much","like","a","bad","episod","of","fairli","odd","parent","cross","with","a","worsethannorm","episod","of","spong","bob","than","a","classic","holidai","movi","do","not","get","me","wrongthos","show","be","fine","and","i","like","them","a","much","a","the","next","gui","but","when","i","watch","fairli","odd","parent","or","spong","bob","my","low","expect","for","mediocr","offcolor","zero","subtext","mind","numb","episod","be","alwai","satisfiedbr","br","we","pick","out","some","good","book","and","spend","the","rest","of","the","even","read","togeth","a","much","well","choic","than","the","embarrassingli","bad","legend","of","frosti","the","snowman"],"filtered":["decemb","holidai","special","like","origin","frosti","richlyproduc","qualiti","music","wholesom","yet","lightheart","storylin","thei","touch","mystic","magic","holidai","basic","thei","look","sound","feelwel","special","thei","decent","appropri","decemb","holidai","subtextbr","br","see","legend","frosti","snowman","tv","list","get","kid","pump","tell","stori","origin","frosti","passion","relat","much","enjoi","kid","wife","kid","cozi","couch","watch","movi","expect","high","minut","kid","yawn","wife","give","look","roll","ey","minut","kid","actual","ask","go","bed","guess","thei","fe","insensit","languag","pointless","disconnect","segment","actual","embarrass","disappoint","thi","moviebr","br","unfortun","legend","frosti","snowman","much","like","bad","episod","fairli","odd","parent","cross","worsethannorm","episod","spong","bob","classic","holidai","movi","get","wrongthos","show","fine","like","much","next","gui","watch","fairli","odd","parent","spong","bob","low","expect","mediocr","offcolor","zero","subtext","mind","numb","episod","alwai","satisfiedbr","br","pick","good","book","spend","rest","even","read","togeth","much","well","choic","embarrassingli","bad","legend","frosti","snowman"],"filtered2":["decemb","holidai","special","like","origin","frosti","richlyproduc","qualiti","music","wholesom","yet","lightheart","storylin","touch","mystic","magic","holidai","basic","look","sound","feelwel","special","decent","appropri","decemb","holidai","subtextbr","see","legend","frosti","snowman","tv","list","get","kid","pump","tell","stori","origin","frosti","passion","relat","enjoi","kid","wife","kid","cozi","couch","watch","expect","high","minut","kid","yawn","wife","give","look","roll","ey","minut","kid","actual","ask","go","bed","guess","fe","insensit","languag","pointless","disconnect","segment","actual","embarrass","disappoint","moviebr","unfortun","legend","frosti","snowman","like","bad","fairli","odd","parent","cross","worsethannorm","spong","bob","classic","holidai","get","wrongthos","show","fine","like","next","gui","watch","fairli","odd","parent","spong","bob","low","expect","mediocr","offcolor","zero","subtext","mind","numb","alwai","satisfiedbr","pick","good","book","spend","rest","even","read","togeth","well","choic","embarrassingli","bad","legend","frosti","snowman"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,16,17,20,28,30,52,55,59,69,90,114,118,130,145,151,172,178,187,194,197,200,203,211,217,226,227,238,243,263,270,281,283,286,297,306,309,319,332,446,464,465,515,516,531,556,601,670,745,772,787,795,809,819,903,964,1022,1065,1094,1254,1377,1464,1531,1687,1748,2031,2122,2554,3027,3417,3563,4560,5095,5231,5236,5324,6091,6419],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"I missed the beginning of this film, which might account for why I disliked it so much. On the other hand I've studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story. Then again, that might also be the reason why I disliked this film.<br /><br />The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Though it's so inaccurate that I don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing. Like throwing in Antonius' marriage to Octavia, and then pushing it aside two scenes later. Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen? And like calling Antonius by his actual name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes.<br /><br />Though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady. There isn't an ounce of dignity in her. She's hysterical, dramatical, and completely lacking control of herself. Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS. 95% of that comes from the poor acting, but 5% is also from poor script writing. Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script. Sometimes you weren't watching Antonius and Cleopatra, you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from \"Dawson's Creek\".<br /><br />If you want to watch something about this period,

{"value":"Story goes like this, Netflix was late sending me my dvds so I went on down to the the analog rental place known as \"Blockbuster Video\" They suck you know. Real bad, They have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure yet I never want to see any of those. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all by its lonesome self. I like seeing films based on serial killers. Its just a part of humanity that I will never understand, therefore I wanna see that kind of stuff. Anyways I put this DVD in and all the sudden from the very first second, it sucks. I'm sitting there with my b.f. and we are like, \"what is this kind of crap?\" Unsteady camera operation, horrible acting,- the first scene in which a woman gets killed you wonder if she would rather just calmly gab instead, Then a rat gets stuffed down her throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard-on for this crap. There is nothing decent about this \"film\". All I have to say to the director is \"do you own a freakin' tripod?\" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was awful. It was like they just decided one day to make a movie. They were probably gathering people from WalMart to show up and \"act\" for them. Just plain awful. If you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby-NOT what you should be doing for a living- SHould not make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself.

{"value":"In a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more. It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. It wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. The dialog is smart -- at times. There are some \"laugh out loud\" moments.<br /><br />But here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: <br /><br />1. David Schwimmer -- how many times can Joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? Maybe some drool would have helped.<br /><br />2. Gwenneth Paltrow -- she's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very dull. Combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.<br /><br />(I kept picturing someone else in this role -- Kate Hudson for example.) <br /><br />3. The script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said \"oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!\" So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.","finished_norm":["in","a","nutshel","thi","be","a","cooki","cutter","romant","comedi","that","realli","want","and","try","to","be","someth","much","it","want","to","be","harold","and","maud","anni","hall","the","graduat","it","want","to","be","deep","and","human","it","have","interest","camera","shot","light","music","edit","all","of","which","give","it","the","feel","of","a","import","movi","the","dialog","be","smart","at","time","there","be","some","laugh","out","loud","momentsbr","br","but","here","what","keep","it","from","ultim","be","anyth","much","than","a","formula","latenightc","inflight","timekil","br","br","david","schwimmer","how","mani","time","can","joe","sadsack","puppi","dog","stare","blankli","into","space","with","hi","jaw","hang","open","befor","it","start","to","get","annoi","mayb","some","drool","would","have","helpedbr","br","gwenneth","paltrow","she","realli","flat","here","and","not","just","in","the","chest","her","role","be","suppos","to","be","thi","live","nice","care","girl","who","just","keep","get","herself","into","wrong","situat","be","veri","confus","a","a","result","and","that","be","why","a","sadsack","loser","like","schwimmer","have","ani","chanc","with","her","but","gwenneth","plai","her","veri","dull","combin","thi","with","puppydog","droolfac","abov","and","you","have","veri","littl","chemistri","to","care","aboutbr","br","i","keep","pictur","someon","els","in","thi","role","kate","hudson","for","exampl","br","br","the","script","and","the","plot","the","stuff","that","happen","just","basic","doe","not","ring","true","all","the","problem","get","wrap","up","in","the","end","with","such","a","neat","and","tidi","bow","on","top","that","it","seem","like","a","whistl","blow","and","the","script","writer","just","sai","oop","time","to","wrap","it","up","get","a","train","to","catch","so","thei","pull","out","the","hollywood","formula","book","check","off","all","the","box","and","go","home"],"filtered":["nutshel","thi","cooki","cutter","romant","comedi","realli","want","try","someth","much","want","harold","maud","anni","hall","graduat","want","deep","human","interest","camera","shot","light","music","edit","give","feel","import","movi","dialog","smart","time","laugh","loud","momentsbr","br","keep","ultim","anyth","much","formula","latenightc","inflight","timekil","br","br","david","schwimmer","mani","time","joe","sadsack","puppi","dog","stare","blankli","space","hi","jaw","hang","open","befor","start","get","annoi","mayb","drool","helpedbr","br","gwenneth","paltrow","realli","flat","chest","role","suppos","thi","live","nice","care","girl","keep","get","wrong","situat","veri","confus","result","sadsack","loser","like","schwimmer","ani","chanc","gwenneth","plai","veri","dull","combin","thi","puppydog","droolfac","abov","veri","littl","chemistri","care","aboutbr","br","keep","pictur","someon","els","thi","role","kate","hudson","exampl","br","br","script","plot","stuff","happen","basic","doe","ring","true","problem","get","wrap","end","neat","tidi","bow","top","seem","like","whistl","blow","script","writer","sai","oop","time","wrap","get","train","catch","thei","pull","hollywood","formula","book","check","box","go","home"],"filtered2":["nutshel","cooki","cutter","romant","comedi","realli","want","try","someth","want","harold","maud","anni","hall","graduat","want","deep","human","interest","camera","shot","light","music","edit","give","feel","import","dialog","smart","time","laugh","loud","momentsbr","keep","ultim","anyth","formula","latenightc","inflight","timekil","david","schwimmer","mani","time","joe","sadsack","puppi","dog","stare","blankli","space","jaw","hang","open","befor","start","get","annoi","mayb","drool","helpedbr","gwenneth","paltrow","realli","flat","chest","role","suppos","live","nice","care","girl","keep","get","wrong","situat","veri","confus","result","sadsack","loser","like","schwimmer","ani","chanc","gwenneth","plai","veri","dull","combin","puppydog","droolfac","abov","veri","littl","chemistri","care","aboutbr","keep","pictur","someon","els","role","kate","hudson","exampl","script","plot","stuff","happen","basic","doe","ring","true","problem","get","wrap","end","neat","tidi","bow","top","seem","like","whistl","blow","script","writer","oop","time","wrap","get","train","catch","pull","hollywood","formula","book","check","box","go","home"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,8,13,14,15,18,24,25,27,30,32,35,36,37,40,43,50,53,60,71,77,79,84,94,104,116,118,127,128,133,134,139,149,151,163,167,196,205,231,242,262,271,286,287,292,300,302,304,307,311,348,353,361,364,367,427,432,441,447,473,486,505,512,544,593,600,609,637,654,675,704,713,735,754,821,834,848,864,957,968,1084,1119,1132,1176,1524,1558,1594,1989,2093,2474,2482,2613,2944,3192,3198,3319,3477,3636,3869,3962,3973,4615,5042,6162,6696,7159,7444],"values":[2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,

{"value":"I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie so I just want to know a few things:<br /><br />What was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with being split in half.<br /><br />What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed, she already totally infected her room, they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer.<br /><br />Why would the Hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative, the hog lady, to take him to the hospital?<br /><br />Why didn't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad, are they all really that lazy?<br /><br />Even if Paul was threatened by the guy w/ the shotgun for peeping on his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is deteriorating.<br /><br />What was the point of the box?<br /><br />Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected, if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn't he have just gone back home?<br /><br />If the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.<br /><br />Who makes lemonade out of river water, that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it. Why couldn't the two kids have just use the tap water, it was contaminated too, so the stupid ending would still

{"value":"I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful. It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great, or I wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day. I like supporting indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those that walked out, as I considered doing after about three minutes, probably didn't mind shelling out $11.00, or just figured it was going nowhere, fast, and not going to improve. Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are..either that or they didn't pay to get in in the first place.<br /><br />Logan is bored. He's a klutz. He's gay. I'm okay with that. The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry, re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc...Nothing or no one goes anywhere. NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. Probably most appalling of all is that I didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan. That in itself is a major accomplishment. He didn't grow, he didn't change, he didn't learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, and neither did the movie!

{"value":"I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it. If it's using the original words in an updated setting, that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles, eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively. It could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show. <br /><br />Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important, he's such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time. Of course he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students. Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King, thus an unimposing so-called King with no Kingly attributes. <br /><br />The amount of song and dance, which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing, unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically. So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection, and I got very bored, including with the comic turns, and was glad when it ended. Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production.<br /><br />Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older

{"value":"If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches, or Pinata Survival Island, this movie might be for you.<br /><br />I live in Nashville and I didn't even know of this movie's existence until the day prior to its release, when the advertising company panicked and blanketed Music Row with dozens of fliers and billboards. It barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway.<br /><br />Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film. For starters, the names are a bit much: Bo Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh.<br /><br />Toby's awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera. Angel's character rapidly transitions from her city-slicker ways to a cowgirl, slipping into southern slang after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's--in fact, in the final scene, their outfits are identical, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick.<br /><br />The audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's shouting in a gymnasium.<br /><br />There's never quite enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens on-screen. Overacting, exasperation, grimaces, and moodiness best describes the actors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script.<br /><br />This movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends.

{"value":"I am not one of those people who just go online after I see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please look at my other reviews. However, for the first time ever, I have seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over.<br /><br />I LOVE bad movies. To me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good. However, there is not a single good thing I can say about this film.<br /><br />The plot is basically non existent. If someone reading my review wastes their money to see it, they can discern for themselves what the plot might be, but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie.<br /><br />The special effects are bad.<br /><br />The acting is bad.<br /><br />The two leads are attractive, but that's all there is.<br /><br />I am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but I INVITE anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it. I will tell you anything.<br /><br />I love bad movies, and I love horror and I love new inventive movies. I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel (Which some reviewers claimed this was like, but obviously they only thought so cause Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But this may be the Number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie EVER made.<br /><br />And before you disregard this review, this is coming from someone who not only sat through the ENTIRE

{"value":"What's happening to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Has he run out of creative ideas? If he has, time to take a back seat. Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after watching Aag. I am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! So Veeru becomes Heero (how corny is that?), guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) doesn't exists at all. In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha.

{"value":"Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are very few things to like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but sadly, that's it. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are dismal. As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan. This movie only contains the latter kind. This leaves little left. I'm so glad I did not pay for this.<br /><br />Despite any hype, I can read and think, so as I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but was somewhat worried going in. Yet, like a train wreck, one cannot merely look away. And even with no expectations, I was let down. Bad. Not even 'so bad, it's good' material. I'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes \"Six String Samurai\" (which I liked) Oscar worthy.<br /><br />No, this piece of over CGI'd rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answers.<br /><br />I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight, I witnessed a train wreck.

{"value":"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend \"Kelly The Second\" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","big","movi","fan","and","will","watch","much","anyth","that","i","see","on","turner","classic","movi","that","new","for","me","so","i","give","thi","a","shoot","after","all","it","the","great","harold","lloyd","who","rival","chaplin","a","a","great","silent","film","comedian","i","have","watch","much","littl","of","lloyd","silent","film","then","of","chaplin","but","i","have","to","sai","i","be","a","much","big","chaplin","fan","anywai","thi","film","fall","so","flat","for","me","that","i","do","not","finish","it","i","can","understand","why","hi","sound","career","be","so","limit","he","do","not","get","veri","good","materi","to","work","with","after","you","have","see","chaplin","abbott","and","costello","the","three","stoog","martin","and","lewi","the","marx","brother","and","laurel","and","hardi","do","box","spoof","or","violenc","in","gener","thi","on","be","veri","forgett","i","be","conjur","interest","in","watch","adolph","menjou","a","i","realli","enjoi","him","in","path","of","glori","but","hi","role","here","conjur","do","noth","special","for","me","mayb","thei","should","have","get","into","the","box","soon","becaus","at","littl","half","the","film","at","littl","it","seem","that","wai","be","befor","he","get","in","a","ring","i","can","tell","there","be","a","lot","of","lloyd","fan","here","and","thi","wont","be","a","popular","review","but","i","must","rate","thi","a","compar","to","what","els","be","out","there","at","the","time","out","of","do","not","watch","thi","with","anyon","your","try","to","get","to","like","old","movi","a","thei","mai","not","watch","anoth","on","with","you","again","veri","flat","for","a","altern","to","anyon","who","realli","like","thi","or","be","look","for","much","littl","know","comedi","in","gener","i","recommend","kelli","the","make","a","few","year","earli","anoth","nobodi","becom","a","boxer","comedi","with","patsi","kelli","and","in","a","support","role","charl","chase","thi","have","both","be","show","on","the","turner","classic","movi","channel"],"filtered":["big","movi","fan","watch","much","anyth","see","turner","classic","movi","new","give","thi","shoot","great","harold","lloyd","rival","chaplin","great","silent","film","comedian","watch","much","littl","lloyd","silent","film","chaplin","sai","much","big","chaplin","fan","anywai","thi","film","fall","flat","finish","understand","hi","sound","career","limit","get","veri","good","materi","work","see","chaplin","abbott","costello","three","stoog","martin","lewi","marx","brother","laurel","hardi","box","spoof","violenc","gener","thi","veri","forgett","conjur","interest","watch","adolph","menjou","realli","enjoi","path","glori","hi","role","conjur","noth","special","mayb","thei","get","box","soon","becaus","littl","half","film","littl","seem","wai","befor","get","ring","tell","lot","lloyd","fan","thi","wont","popular","review","must","rate","thi","compar","els","time","watch","thi","anyon","try","get","like","old","movi","thei","mai","watch","anoth","veri","flat","altern","anyon","realli","like","thi","look","much","littl","know","comedi","gener","recommend","kelli","make","year","earli","anoth","nobodi","becom","boxer","comedi","patsi","kelli","support","role","charl","chase","thi","show","turner","classic","movi","channel"],"filtered2":["big","fan","watch","anyth","see","turner","classic","new","give","shoot","great","harold","lloyd","rival","chaplin","great","silent","comedian","watch","littl","lloyd","silent","chaplin","big","chaplin","fan","anywai","fall","flat","finish","understand","sound","career","limit","get","veri","good","materi","work","see","chaplin","abbott","costello","three","stoog","martin","lewi","marx","brother","laurel","hardi","box","spoof","violenc","gener","veri","forgett","conjur","interest","watch","adolph","menjou","realli","enjoi","path","glori","role","conjur","noth","special","mayb","get","box","soon","becaus","littl","half","littl","seem","wai","befor","get","ring","tell","lot","lloyd","fan","wont","popular","review","must","rate","compar","els","time","watch","anyon","try","get","like","old","mai","watch","anoth","veri","flat","altern","anyon","realli","like","look","littl","know","comedi","gener","recommend","kelli","make","year","earli","anoth","nobodi","becom","boxer","comedi","patsi","kelli","support","role","charl","chase","show","turner","classic","channel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,8,13,14,15,16,22,26,28,30,33,35,36,39,46,48,49,51,57,60,67,72,73,79,82,87,90,104,115,117,127,128,140,141,158,163,169,176,178,196,200,202,203,206,212,224,225,266,298,332,381,386,449,453,459,482,511,530,537,573,593,654,728,866,951,1027,1084,1224,1225,1233,1391,1547,1633,1786,1996,2096,2155,2237,2433,2485,2864,2868,2920,3025,3129,3192,3306,6151,6880,7983,8256],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2

{"value":"I am a big fan of Stephen King. I loved The Running Man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it. And when a local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was all ready for a night of fun!<br /><br />The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger. I could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part, as was described in the book. I still was convinced that this would be a good film, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents?<br /><br />Well, he didn't. I soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re-written the entire story to MAKE it about fightin' an' shootin'. Yup, it was a standard Arnold-film: hero is done wrong, hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl.<br /><br />I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can't be put on screen literally, but this didn't even have ties to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I don't say it often, but this film was BAD. If I weren't at home watching, I'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen. Once again: bad.<br /><br />(Note that I used 'someone' a lot.

{"value":"\"Igor and the Lunatics\" is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. There's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. \"Igor and the Lunatics\" is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. Maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole

{"value":"Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.","finished_norm":["hei","arnold","be","a","slowpac","and","slightli","bore","movi","the","plot","be","not","veri","creativ","the","paul","sorvino","charact","shenk","be","bui","all","of","the","decrepit","lowpric","build","in","order","to","build","a","gigant","mall","shop","complex","and","offic","build","thi","plot","go","back","to","mani","kid","movi","it","be","bore","paul","sorvino","be","not","veri","excit","either","so","the","idea","of","him","a","the","bad","gui","be","not","veri","scari","gramp","rememb","someth","about","a","histor","docum","and","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","about","the","last","hour","when","arnold","and","jamal","must","find","the","docum","with","the","undercov","aid","of","helga","whose","father","be","hope","to","becom","rich","thank","to","shenk","mall","the","kid","must","move","around","town","on","bu","and","so","the","excit","chase","scene","involv","a","bu","be","not","onli","silli","but","underscor","how","thi","movi","be","write","for","veri","young","kid","hei","arnold","the","tv","cartoon","be","usual","veri","entertain","and","it","have","enough","humor","to","appeal","to","adult","the","tv","cartoon","be","usual","fast","pace","and","much","imagin","than","thi","movi","hei","arnold","the","movi","be","about","five","time","much","sedat","and","a","good","wai","to","put","anyon","includ","kiddi","to","sleep","hei","arnold","be","a","tough","on","to","stai","awak","all","the","wai","until","the","predict","and","total","bore","end","if","you","want","to","send","your","kid","to","a","total","nonoffens","movi","thi","be","it","i","get","the","feel","that","instead","of","try","to","make","a","minut","movi","the","produc","start","out","with","a","minut","tv","cartoon","script","and","try","to","expand","it","into","minut","thi","mall","stori","definit","can","have","be","cover","in","the","tv","cartoon","hopefulli","arnold","will","bet","a","well","writer","if","there","be","ever","a","sequel"],"filtered":["hei","arnold","slowpac","slightli","bore","movi","plot","veri","creativ","paul","sorvino","charact","shenk","bui","decrepit","lowpric","build","order","build","gigant","mall","shop","complex","offic","build","thi","plot","go","back","mani","kid","movi","bore","paul","sorvino","veri","excit","either","idea","bad","gui","veri","scari","gramp","rememb","someth","histor","docum","rest","movi","last","hour","arnold","jamal","must","find","docum","undercov","aid","helga","whose","father","hope","becom","rich","thank","shenk","mall","kid","must","move","around","town","bu","excit","chase","scene","involv","bu","onli","silli","underscor","thi","movi","write","veri","young","kid","hei","arnold","tv","cartoon","usual","veri","entertain","enough","humor","appeal","adult","tv","cartoon","usual","fast","pace","much","imagin","thi","movi","hei","arnold","movi","five","time","much","sedat","good","wai","put","anyon","includ","kiddi","sleep","hei","arnold","tough","stai","awak","wai","predict","total","bore","end","want","send","kid","total","nonoffens","movi","thi","get","feel","instead","try","make","minut","movi","produc","start","minut","tv","cartoon","script","try","expand","minut","thi","mall","stori","definit","cover","tv","cartoon","hopefulli","arnold","bet","well","writer","ever","sequel"],"filtered2":["hei","arnold","slowpac","slightli","bore","plot","veri","creativ","paul","sorvino","charact","shenk","bui","decrepit","lowpric","build","order","build","gigant","mall","shop","complex","offic","build","plot","go","back","mani","kid","bore","paul","sorvino","veri","excit","either","idea","bad","gui","veri","scari","gramp","rememb","someth","histor","docum","rest","last","hour","arnold","jamal","must","find","docum","undercov","aid","helga","whose","father","hope","becom","rich","thank","shenk","mall","kid","must","move","around","town","bu","excit","chase","scene","involv","bu","onli","silli","underscor","write","veri","young","kid","hei","arnold","tv","cartoon","usual","veri","entertain","enough","humor","appeal","adult","tv","cartoon","usual","fast","pace","imagin","hei","arnold","five","time","sedat","good","wai","put","anyon","includ","kiddi","sleep","hei","arnold","tough","stai","awak","wai","predict","total","bore","end","want","send","kid","total","nonoffens","get","feel","instead","try","make","minut","produc","start","minut","tv","cartoon","script","try","expand","minut","mall","stori","definit","cover","tv","cartoon","hopefulli","arnold","bet","well","writer","ever","sequel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,8,9,10,11,15,17,19,20,24,32,33,36,37,38,43,44,50,53,55,59,63,65,71,77,93,98,108,114,115,123,135,141,144,152,158,159,172,174,181,184,195,207,226,241,261,265,275,287,290,301,337,340,343,347,366,369,385,387,392,396,439,450,477,491,504,524,530,542,546,587,598,651,653,690,721,732,734,840,937,953,965,974,1109,1125,1433,1451,1472,1839,1951,2048,2150,2542,2761,3136,3908,4308,4330,4894,7635,7663],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"First thing I noticed in this movie of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. It's not oozing nudity or anything, but a lot that was not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately this is not the film I was searching for.<br /><br />Instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no thrill or twist, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. They fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first I was excited upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. She has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light. The idea is great, but hideously executed throughout the film.

{"value":"I realize several Ben Stiller movies are out or will be out this year, but perhaps he should insist on quality, not quantity.<br /><br />I was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in \"Along Came Polly.\" <br /><br />Stiller's Reuben is grating, charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. He undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. Because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.<br /><br />There's absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she's a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she keeps making more movies such as \"The Good Girl\" (in which she's terrific) and less like \"Along Came Polly,\" she'll have a career of which she could be proud.<br /><br />Aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working, but it's a daunting task for any actress. With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin, as Reuben's boss Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend Sandy, there's nothing funny in this awful film. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not only stupid, it's terribly unfunny.<br /><br />The premise of \"Along Came Polly\" certainly showed promise. Unfortunately, it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy, instead of this lame, dull, boring excuse for a comedy.","finished_norm":["i","realiz","sever","ben","still","movi","be","out","or","will","be","out","thi","year","but","perhap","he","should","insist","on","qualiti","not","quantitybr","br","i","be","dumbfound","at","what","the","filmmak","think","pass","for","comedi","in","along","come","polli","br","br","still","reuben","be","grate","charmless","and","rank","a","on","of","the","wrong","perform","of","the","year","still","schtick","be","get","tiresom","he","undoubtedli","have","comic","talent","but","he","ne","to","either","find","anoth","schtick","or","take","a","break","find","some","materi","that","be","actual","funni","becaus","hi","movi","be","go","from","painfulli","humorless","to","excruciatingli","badbr","br","there","absolut","no","chemistri","between","still","and","jennif","aniston","which","be","a","shame","becaus","she","a","good","smart","actress","with","a","promis","career","a","long","a","she","keep","make","much","movi","such","a","the","good","girl","in","which","she","terrif","and","littl","like","along","come","polli","she","will","have","a","career","of","which","she","can","be","proudbr","br","aniston","try","desper","to","overcom","the","limp","materi","with","which","she","work","but","it","a","daunt","task","for","ani","actress","with","the","except","of","a","few","moment","with","alec","baldwin","a","reuben","boss","stan","and","philip","seymour","hoffman","a","reuben","well","friend","sandi","there","noth","funni","in","thi","aw","film","other","support","charact","includ","debra","mess","a","lisa","and","hank","azaria","a","claud","be","annoi","azaria","accent","be","not","onli","stupid","it","terribli","unfunnybr","br","the","premis","of","along","come","polli","certainli","show","promis","unfortun","it","ne","a","writer","who","can","actual","turn","it","into","a","good","comedi","instead","of","thi","lame","dull","bore","excus","for","a","comedi"],"filtered":["realiz","sever","ben","still","movi","thi","year","perhap","insist","qualiti","quantitybr","br","dumbfound","filmmak","think","pass","comedi","along","come","polli","br","br","still","reuben","grate","charmless","rank","wrong","perform","year","still","schtick","get","tiresom","undoubtedli","comic","talent","ne","either","find","anoth","schtick","take","break","find","materi","actual","funni","becaus","hi","movi","go","painfulli","humorless","excruciatingli","badbr","br","absolut","chemistri","still","jennif","aniston","shame","becaus","good","smart","actress","promis","career","long","keep","make","much","movi","good","girl","terrif","littl","like","along","come","polli","career","proudbr","br","aniston","try","desper","overcom","limp","materi","work","daunt","task","ani","actress","except","moment","alec","baldwin","reuben","boss","stan","philip","seymour","hoffman","reuben","well","friend","sandi","noth","funni","thi","aw","film","support","charact","includ","debra","mess","lisa","hank","azaria","claud","annoi","azaria","accent","onli","stupid","terribli","unfunnybr","br","premis","along","come","polli","certainli","show","promis","unfortun","ne","writer","actual","turn","good","comedi","instead","thi","lame","dull","bore","excus","comedi"],"filtered2":["realiz","sever","ben","still","year","perhap","insist","qualiti","quantitybr","dumbfound","filmmak","think","pass","comedi","along","come","polli","still","reuben","grate","charmless","rank","wrong","perform","year","still","schtick","get","tiresom","undoubtedli","comic","talent","ne","either","find","anoth","schtick","take","break","find","materi","actual","funni","becaus","go","painfulli","humorless","excruciatingli","badbr","absolut","chemistri","still","jennif","aniston","shame","becaus","good","smart","actress","promis","career","long","keep","make","good","girl","terrif","littl","like","along","come","polli","career","proudbr","aniston","try","desper","overcom","limp","materi","work","daunt","task","ani","actress","except","moment","alec","baldwin","reuben","boss","stan","philip","seymour","hoffman","reuben","well","friend","sandi","noth","funni","aw","support","charact","includ","debra","mess","lisa","hank","azaria","claud","annoi","azaria","accent","onli","stupid","terribli","unfunnybr","premis","along","come","polli","certainli","show","promis","unfortun","ne","writer","actual","turn","good","comedi","instead","lame","dull","bore","excus","comedi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,10,11,12,14,20,22,25,27,28,31,34,36,38,48,49,52,57,62,64,73,84,96,99,105,108,110,127,134,136,138,152,161,188,207,222,227,232,271,276,287,301,316,318,319,323,324,355,360,367,373,389,405,407,459,480,484,487,511,537,559,574,617,683,788,854,1119,1132,1152,1241,1251,1576,1629,1655,1912,2119,2166,2171,2359,2387,2495,2514,2535,2604,3207,3699,3746,3904,4064,4111,4176,5029,5442,5461,6892,6945,7118,7154,8100],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie \"Our Gang\" release schedule, \"A Tough Winter\" features two storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!<br /><br />The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang.<br /><br />\"A Tough Winter,\" to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slow-moving character. \"Our Gang\" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a \"skilled comic\" and used this \"Our Gang\" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved.<br /><br />Although there are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, \"A Tough Winter\" is a plodding and meandering effort. If one positive came out of this film, it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 \"Our Gang\" films.<br /><br />3 out of

{"value":"***SLIGHT SPOILERS***<br /><br />A hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time. After the act, he lays in the bed with her not touching her. The next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years.<br /><br />This is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality, or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency.<br /><br />However, as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother.<br /><br />At one point, his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they might be, \"Every step of the way in this, my son has been amazing... I have never been more proud of him...\"<br /><br />The young father's older sister, who otherwise is cold towards her brother, begins to show pride in her sibling, \"You have been cool about this,\" as she gives him an encouraging warm hug.<br /><br />The 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a parent.<br /><br />Why not? We see the \"new\" baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy, happy 4-month-old infant. Just as babies were born on TV in the 1960's and 1970's.<br /><br />Once the young father is a parent, he has found happiness. He insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper.

{"value":"This movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured. There's male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, the female loosing control of her bladder. All shot in a gray cold color. Effective, but a little too much. We then move on to seeing the BTK killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes. The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it's creepy. Here we don't see fancy or good imagery, it looks as if shot with your home camera. It doesn't look horrifying, but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling. What this movie doesn't have is any drama, really. There are some cop scenes every once in a while, but there's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer. There isn't much of an arc to this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage. It's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again. Sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away. And that I have to reject. I'm all for low budget horror movies but I don't tolerate animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. I'm glad that Lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does, but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore.

{"value":"Make no bones about it. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. It's clichéd the whole way, not very funny, predictable, and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: characters. There's the boring, luckless guy - giving Stiller another notch in his boring, luckless guy belt - the allegedly wild, but in reality just fairly normal, love interest - whom Aniston plays well, but really needed no effort to do so - the fat, jovial friend, and then the assortment of clichés: an annoying daredevil Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The storyline: the beginning is slightly unusual, but thereafter goes into the standard any-movie style, with every plot turn as predictable as your average knock-knock joke. The biggest problem was that Stiller's character's \"development\" really seemed to come from nothing - like your average school play, the writers knew where he started and where he ended, but didn't put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit. Finally, the alleged 'jokes' were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard gross-out humour; there was a regulation chunder scene, sweaty fat men, etc.<br /><br />In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only good thing. Hamburg really dished up a dog's dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have lured the viewers, but the taste left at the end was just as rancid.<br /><br />Final comment: This film may have been dreadful, but Aniston still picked a better between-Friends-seasons movie than Kudrow's odious 'Marci
