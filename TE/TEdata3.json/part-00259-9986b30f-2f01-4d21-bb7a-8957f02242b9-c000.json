{"value":"Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you've basically seen The Grudge. It's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for instance, how would the care center have known that Yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more.","finished_norm":["okai","if","you","have","see","the","ring","you","have","basic","see","the","grudg","it","try","to","be","scari","by","just","have","freaki","camera","work","and","loud","sound","but","it","fail","miser","the","plot","if","you","can","call","it","that","be","weak","and","rather","full","of","hole","for","instanc","how","would","the","care","center","have","know","that","yoko","do","not","show","up","for","work","when","the","peopl","who","live","in","the","hous","be","not","there","and","it","not","realli","clear","what","bill","pullman","charact","have","to","do","with","anyth","he","just","kind","of","come","out","of","nowher","to","advanc","the","plot","it","do","not","make","a","lot","of","sens","what","happen","to","the","origin","famili","who","be","hang","in","the","room","the","littl","boi","or","the","dad","and","be","yoko","aliv","or","dead","when","the","care","center","gui","find","her","there","be","too","mani","unansw","question","and","i","be","too","bore","to","think","about","it","much"],"filtered":["okai","see","ring","basic","see","grudg","try","scari","freaki","camera","work","loud","sound","fail","miser","plot","call","weak","rather","full","hole","instanc","care","center","know","yoko","show","work","peopl","live","hous","realli","clear","bill","pullman","charact","anyth","kind","come","nowher","advanc","plot","make","lot","sens","happen","origin","famili","hang","room","littl","boi","dad","yoko","aliv","dead","care","center","gui","find","mani","unansw","question","bore","think","much"],"filtered2":["okai","see","ring","basic","see","grudg","try","scari","freaki","camera","work","loud","sound","fail","miser","plot","call","weak","rather","full","hole","instanc","care","center","know","yoko","show","work","peopl","live","hous","realli","clear","bill","pullman","charact","anyth","kind","come","nowher","advanc","plot","make","lot","sens","happen","origin","famili","hang","room","littl","boi","dad","yoko","aliv","dead","care","center","gui","find","mani","unansw","question","bore","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,12,13,14,23,26,28,32,34,36,38,48,50,55,69,72,94,104,108,116,122,142,160,173,178,182,191,205,213,215,228,231,282,286,336,378,379,396,513,590,722,799,810,848,956,1016,1048,1084,1216,1315,1330,1763,3517,4421,4584,7147],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,12,13,14,23,26,28,32,34,36,38,48,50,55,69,72,94,104,108,116,122,142,160,173,178,182,191,205,213,215,228,231,282,286,336,378,379,396,513,590,722,799,810,848,956,1016,1048,1084,1216,1315,1330,1763,3517,4421,4584,7147],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,3.3910232448024944,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,2.08112281984698,2.0728240170322856,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.2844323215331563,2.3722295531801256,2.4368824319140248,2.532833256045391,2.7365296724240786,2.5460113484259455,5.143705159219666,2.8432628718938773,2.605934685587711,2.7742700004069256,2.7049353070058615,2.918851229218033,2.780700890737216,2.9233055795674137,3.130944944345658,3.1272886331425473,3.291526514503207,3.454678155189441,3.4986697244709752,3.850067611308864,3.7636829971100436,3.8425769395797067,3.827761853794566,3.969732115064953,4.34596758485818,4.160564361526816,4.224077767249142,4.280272325592784,8.927501241029125,4.370968887063596,4.74221603786142,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,6.032366538428407,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.025023006620755E-5,6.977651634170801E-5,7.031896222092727E-5,6.991265850808177E-5,6.991380394827856E-5,6.981607842180644E-5,7.002372122117075E-5,6.978656370412781E-5,6.994346933955452E-5,7.759846116868362E-5,0.8725091751289182,6.967391280407158E-5,7.097434183547009E-5,7.198680641737308E-5,6.972471829445705E-5,6.953202925647448E-5,7.126641874884522E-5,7.003028191528795E-5,0.08768044503532556,6.987087581388486E-5,7.054691751747679E-5,7.009966420367719E-5,7.017948330594273E-5,7.025509382793625E-5,7.079426557972931E-5,7.042403150085835E-5,7.338452399915854E-5,6.969462621951065E-5,6.96964907139783E-5,6.987306637906742E-5,7.135820204749262E-5,7.002622425845796E-5,7.516721969948048E-5,7.022319769376581E-5,6.977048568590094E-5,7.009252247051908E-5,6.970057391569198E-5,6.974176182667822E-5,6.95316799219376E-5,6.954971964760912E-5,6.970626761394962E-5,7.044152103396123E-5,7.008357806383223E-5,6.980648718726311E-5,7.065470920316029E-5,6.983327929850135E-5,7.215349239105376E-5,7.109245425390676E-5,6.956700655508179E-5,6.972

{"value":"Let me confess. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of \"invisible-man\" genre special effects (highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia), the script wasted no chance -- in fact it went out of its way -- in insulting all non-WASP races and real-or-imagined homosexuals. Every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It starts to grate on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid- camera style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat of a surprise. But by the time you get there, you hardly care less.

{"value":"Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism.<br /><br />Then something happened, and he turned into just another dull \"holier-than-thou\" director.<br /><br />Il Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summarized in one line \"working class = kind and warm, while upper-class = snob and devious. But love wins in the end\".<br /><br />Such a trite clichè for such a smart director.<br /><br />There isn't really too much to talk about in the movie. Every character is a walking stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but who'll become \"good\" again, the scorned wife, the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest-but-poor guy...

{"value":"To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me, that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy, who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks. Also, the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies, other than a few names and Mr. Levenstein who is a minor character in this one. The only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls.

{"value":"The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest. But, throughout watching this film, we were saying aloud, \"These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good...why is the sound so bad?\" Throughout the film the sound was echoy, garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.<br /><br />There is some good acting in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget film.<br /><br />I just can't reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it's worth doing right.

{"value":"Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor? The answer is Yes; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss

{"value":"Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman comic now and then. So as can be imagined--I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was SEVERELY disappointed. This series is nothing. It doesn't even begin to compare with the original series. It's like one long TOY commercial. No depth whatsoever. And what the heck was with the Joker? Who,in my most humble opinion, is the best Batman villain of ALL time and they KILLED him. I wish I could say his design was the worst part. Actually, I wish I could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting.

{"value":"This movie is very very very poor. I have seen better movies. <br /><br />There was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair. It begins slowly with the building of tension. Which is not a success. At least if you ask me. Though at some points or moments I must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went down.<br /><br />They should had made it something like Scary Movie, then it might be a better movie. Because I watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie. I must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so I sure can say it is not worth it.<br /><br />Don't waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is.

{"value":"This film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of the mother/wife by moving to Genova, Italy.<br /><br />The plot of \"Genova\" sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film only consists of a collection of scenes depicting the daily life of the family, such as swimming, taking piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of such scenes are redundant and tiresome, completely failing to engage viewers emotionally. The ending is very disappointing as it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by \"Genova\" The only thing good about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. \"Genova\" can serve as an extended tourism advertisement for the city, but not as a film to be enjoyed.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","about","a","famili","try","to","come","to","term","with","the","death","of","the","motherwif","by","move","to","genova","italybr","br","the","plot","of","genova","sound","promis","but","unfortun","it","be","empti","and","without","focu","the","film","onli","consist","of","a","collect","of","scene","depict","the","daili","life","of","the","famili","such","a","swim","take","piano","lesson","or","cook","egg","much","of","such","scene","be","redund","and","tiresom","complet","fail","to","engag","viewer","emotion","the","end","be","veri","disappoint","a","it","be","not","spectacular","move","or","emot","i","can","safe","sai","that","i","be","disappoint","and","bore","by","genova","the","onli","thing","good","about","the","film","be","the","sunni","weather","and","the","beauti","of","genova","genova","can","serv","a","a","extend","tourism","advertis","for","the","citi","but","not","a","a","film","to","be","enjoi"],"filtered":["thi","film","famili","try","come","term","death","motherwif","move","genova","italybr","br","plot","genova","sound","promis","unfortun","empti","without","focu","film","onli","consist","collect","scene","depict","daili","life","famili","swim","take","piano","lesson","cook","egg","much","scene","redund","tiresom","complet","fail","engag","viewer","emotion","end","veri","disappoint","spectacular","move","emot","safe","sai","disappoint","bore","genova","onli","thing","good","film","sunni","weather","beauti","genova","genova","serv","extend","tourism","advertis","citi","film","enjoi"],"filtered2":["famili","try","come","term","death","motherwif","move","genova","italybr","plot","genova","sound","promis","unfortun","empti","without","focu","onli","consist","collect","scene","depict","daili","life","famili","swim","take","piano","lesson","cook","egg","scene","redund","tiresom","complet","fail","engag","viewer","emotion","end","veri","disappoint","spectacular","move","emot","safe","disappoint","bore","genova","onli","thing","good","sunni","weather","beauti","genova","genova","serv","extend","tourism","advertis","citi","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,15,19,24,29,31,32,34,36,75,103,108,125,178,182,187,200,215,227,245,275,279,325,506,595,619,683,815,828,858,943,1011,1026,1144,1272,1530,1606,2292,2293,2388,2430,2757,2829,2866,3299,3480,3578,3620,4577],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,15,19,24,29,31,32,34,36,75,103,108,125,178,182,187,200,215,227,245,275,279,325,506,595,619,683,815,828,858,943,1011,1026,1144,1272,1530,1606,2292,2293,2388,2430,2757,2829,2866,3299,3480,3578,3620,4577],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.982619630677639,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.9742250248702675,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.2242236634876535,2.532833256045391,5.473059344848157,4.946432381978511,2.5308211829319704,2.605934685587711,2.6005321873043625,2.7502029743242886,5.566569743006283,2.7910771187233068,2.973659465713028,3.449627639403373,3.6284289511740746,3.5929222627171646,3.6105180246075443,3.7881170224473255,3.827761853794566,3.8767358583910254,3.9911462095687695,4.086456389373095,4.062925891962901,4.229557233013768,4.416284083275639,4.573751515728891,4.679973728984199,5.089758498236879,5.0768550934009715,5.089758498236879,5.129498826886393,5.3560264761848435,5.322690055917252,5.444579873526289,5.541743621979936,5.822646007446338,5.7446844659766265,5.9370563586240825,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.846853649042184E-5,6.800683714222978E-5,6.853552545314918E-5,6.813952645694747E-5,6.814064284637194E-5,6.804539584477498E-5,6.824777238605962E-5,6.801662968240827E-5,6.816955586093668E-5,7.563040099827847E-5,0.638303460676506,6.790683584609046E-5,6.917428326235654E-5,7.016106961317633E-5,6.795635280239212E-5,6.776855076365176E-5,6.945895249094964E-5,6.82541666871764E-5,6.804240840091727E-5,6.809880345974742E-5,6.875769932397174E-5,6.832178929481611E-5,6.839958401678287E-5,6.847327689692425E-5,6.89987741191747E-5,6.863792995517293E-5,7.152333813758671E-5,6.792702392575218E-5,6.792884113271897E-5,6.810093846759005E-5,6.954840797211642E-5,0.041711366245463295,0.16673318662897235,6.844218971579625E-5,6.800095943653688E-5,0.07302300368788205,6.793282077584991E-5,6.797296407479239E-5,6.77682102889734E-5,6.778579248926304E-5,6.793837006994548E-5,6.865497591693457E-5,6.830611113330795E-5,6.803604786411073E-5,6.88627571858126E-5,6.806216047106223E-5,7.032352808001185E-5,6.928940010146271E-5,6.780264096440659E-5,6.7952488947354E-5,6.792892046406543E-5,6.98406956336028E-5,6.795349995084389E-5,6.777977465986971E-5,6.852375468709237E-5,6.797100296850763E-5,0.07509325345563048,6.79

{"value":"I enjoy quality crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. I quite enjoyed some of this, but the acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. I don't know who wasted more time, me watching this, or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. I can assure you, it wont. However, on a brighter note, I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.","finished_norm":["i","enjoi","qualiti","crap","and","thi","rank","up","there","with","some","of","the","fine","the","cg","be","out","of","thi","world","or","at","littl","predat","our","world","and","the","insan","of","a","foot","bloke","in","a","rat","outfit","chase","after","peopl","be","laughabl","bad","i","quit","enjoi","some","of","thi","but","the","act","be","so","goddamn","aw","and","even","the","obligatori","nude","scene","doe","not","realli","have","ani","bap","out","in","it","just","a","complet","wast","of","time","if","ever","i","see","on","i","do","not","know","who","wast","much","time","me","watch","thi","or","the","poor","sap","who","get","drag","into","make","it","in","the","faint","hope","that","thi","will","launch","their","act","career","i","can","assur","you","it","wont","howev","on","a","bright","note","i","have","manag","to","successfulli","do","the","degre","of","kevin","bacon","from","thi","movi","so","i","think","it","be","almost","worthwhil","watch","the","minut","of","it"],"filtered":["enjoi","qualiti","crap","thi","rank","fine","cg","thi","world","littl","predat","world","insan","foot","bloke","rat","outfit","chase","peopl","laughabl","bad","quit","enjoi","thi","act","goddamn","aw","even","obligatori","nude","scene","doe","realli","ani","bap","complet","wast","time","ever","see","know","wast","much","time","watch","thi","poor","sap","get","drag","make","faint","hope","thi","launch","act","career","assur","wont","howev","bright","note","manag","successfulli","degre","kevin","bacon","thi","movi","think","almost","worthwhil","watch","minut"],"filtered2":["enjoi","qualiti","crap","rank","fine","cg","world","littl","predat","world","insan","foot","bloke","rat","outfit","chase","peopl","laughabl","bad","quit","enjoi","act","goddamn","aw","even","obligatori","nude","scene","doe","realli","ani","bap","complet","wast","time","ever","see","know","wast","time","watch","poor","sap","get","drag","make","faint","hope","launch","act","career","assur","wont","howev","bright","note","manag","successfulli","degre","kevin","bacon","think","almost","worthwhil","watch","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,8,9,12,13,14,18,19,21,23,26,27,44,59,89,103,113,120,131,138,146,165,181,200,313,319,345,464,511,530,552,560,764,981,1285,1329,1485,1630,1654,1660,1867,1942,2016,2517,2682,2892,3125,3127,3376,3634,3713,4699,4734,5033],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,8,9,12,13,14,18,19,21,23,26,27,44,59,89,103,113,120,131,138,146,165,181,200,313,319,345,464,511,530,552,560,764,981,1285,1329,1485,1630,1654,1660,1867,1942,2016,2517,2682,2892,3125,3127,3376,3634,3713,4699,4734,5033],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,2.324031090670098,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.604729392502474,1.8693254449200722,3.9880092219144876,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,2.2044500422972613,2.2512118082053005,2.2907365189289424,2.326138445979858,4.897695199944596,2.4442286541160034,5.061642365863941,2.907069060519773,2.9056060024680126,3.0022328381570844,3.2872346624216657,3.3909310864081816,3.5784919978881358,3.424750734647968,3.4623020803001006,3.7465885637507435,4.039936373738201,4.449957298382227,4.416284083275639,4.679973728984199,4.654440426979034,4.637773374493822,5.259176650194926,4.8184434032493035,4.85885294158718,4.900964426937307,5.156897801074508,5.426230734858092,5.695894301807195,5.444579873526289,5.482320201509136,5.719991853386255,6.0662680901040895,5.695894301807195,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.376864083953658E-5,6.333863398646433E-5,6.38310314692088E-5,6.346221508936495E-5,6.346325484630871E-5,6.337454589841514E-5,6.356303067751266E-5,6.334775433589136E-5,6.349018318063386E-5,7.04388924463724E-5,0.5365508950822054,6.324549709375613E-5,0.12749174569234664,6.534499316640497E-5,6.32916150504662E-5,6.311670433422733E-5,6.469107157132566E-5,6.356898605369326E-5,6.337176352209813E-5,6.342428744675026E-5,6.403795462689007E-5,6.36319668328985E-5,6.370442148051615E-5,6.377305584962998E-5,6.426248129006641E-5,6.39264066041924E-5,0.07870574694998879,6.326429940014644E-5,6.326599186831262E-5,6.342627590094082E-5,6.477438654696342E-5,6.356530277378374E-5,0.12837064881389149,6.374410259037136E-5,6.333315974497323E-5,6.362548402684504E-5,6.326969833622468E-5,6.330708607289311E-5,6.311638723080157E-5,6.313276253357433E-5,6.327486670932323E-5,6.394228247753598E-5,6.361736486969782E-5,6.336583959253935E-5,6.413580098672918E-5,6.339015974803598E-5,6.54962

{"value":"An interesting idea for a film, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together. When he was younger, Einon got stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart. Now grown up Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for \"killing\" dragons. But because Einon has half of Draco's hear, they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt, or killed. Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

{"value":"It is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, but Hostel is definitely much more worse. This movie is more funny and ridiculous, than scary. I laughed most of the time when watched it. Low quality effects (when you gonna watch it, you'll understand what i'm talking about and HOW LOW quality is that), bad actors (i hear of them for the first time), and it seems like it's shot by an amateur camcorder (so it looks more like a TV show, than a movie). But at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end. Like comedies? Watch it. Wanna horror? Go watch Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie.<br /><br />If i'm talking about the Legend of Diablo, i don't even know if i can classify it to a Horror genre.

{"value":"I first heard about White Noise when I saw the TV advert. Before then I didn't even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and decided that I would go and see it. Now being a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought that this film would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton in it, and he rocks. Unfortunately the film did not deliver. It tried to be another Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the middle just drags on repeating itself, and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out. Unfortunately like most \"Scary\" films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump. This film could have been so much more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.","finished_norm":["i","hear","about","white","nois","when","i","see","the","tv","advert","befor","then","i","do","not","even","know","it","exist","i","watch","the","trailer","onlin","and","decid","that","i","would","go","and","see","it","now","be","a","fan","of","film","like","the","sens","i","think","that","thi","film","would","give","me","everyth","i","want","it","have","michael","keaton","in","it","and","he","rock","unfortun","the","film","do","not","deliv","it","try","to","be","anoth","sens","or","stir","of","echo","and","fail","miser","it","have","a","veri","promis","start","but","the","middl","just","drag","on","repeat","itself","and","end","with","a","complet","poor","twist","which","ani","monkei","can","have","figur","out","unfortun","like","much","scari","film","nowadai","it","reli","on","loud","nois","and","bang","to","make","the","audienc","jump","thi","film","can","have","be","so","much","much","it","a","shame","becaus","it","be","a","good","idea"],"filtered":["hear","white","nois","see","tv","advert","befor","even","know","exist","watch","trailer","onlin","decid","go","see","fan","film","like","sens","think","thi","film","give","everyth","want","michael","keaton","rock","unfortun","film","deliv","try","anoth","sens","stir","echo","fail","miser","veri","promis","start","middl","drag","repeat","end","complet","poor","twist","ani","monkei","figur","unfortun","like","much","scari","film","nowadai","reli","loud","nois","bang","make","audienc","jump","thi","film","much","much","shame","becaus","good","idea"],"filtered2":["hear","white","nois","see","tv","advert","befor","even","know","exist","watch","trailer","onlin","decid","go","see","fan","like","sens","think","give","everyth","want","michael","keaton","rock","unfortun","deliv","try","anoth","sens","stir","echo","fail","miser","veri","promis","start","middl","drag","repeat","end","complet","poor","twist","ani","monkei","figur","unfortun","like","scari","nowadai","reli","loud","nois","bang","make","audienc","jump","shame","becaus","good","idea"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,12,15,22,24,26,27,30,36,37,71,73,79,103,123,140,146,168,172,173,193,215,216,227,249,359,396,415,435,466,517,528,554,574,582,674,683,764,950,956,988,1274,1330,1428,1499,1583,2428,3203,3518,3611,4143,7392],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,12,15,22,24,26,27,30,36,37,71,73,79,103,123,140,146,168,172,173,193,215,216,227,249,359,396,415,435,466,517,528,554,574,582,674,683,764,950,956,988,1274,1330,1428,1499,1583,2428,3203,3518,3611,4143,7392],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,1.9469506069506084,2.098582041218749,2.2619070973220485,2.317169775997098,2.326138445979858,2.4894767118610357,2.5001408943598484,4.8737648638280495,2.517840471459249,2.605934685587711,2.6070186965339692,5.201064374608725,2.6754694156628323,3.2189558216683714,3.291526514503207,3.1588018988486244,3.2829611516442836,3.4446025032006995,3.4198487640477615,3.4198487640477615,3.439602492783994,3.5039747767006686,3.7099788181381825,3.6405503117064195,3.6105180246075443,3.7465885637507435,4.125296222689358,3.969732115064953,4.039936373738201,5.243909178064138,4.370968887063596,4.449957298382227,9.308880853958067,4.933754249760298,5.243909178064138,5.541743621979936,5.626901430320244,5.695894301807195,5.999576715605417,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.865166569662359E-5,6.818873146538199E-5,6.871883383121873E-5,6.83217756772557E-5,6.832289505262844E-5,6.822739329886809E-5,6.84303111260814E-5,6.819855019715449E-5,6.835188539931795E-5,0.21367434773069988,0.5700680414109505,6.808846270101683E-5,6.935930009246188E-5,7.0348725749018E-5,6.81381120977264E-5,6.794980775471547E-5,6.964473071092155E-5,6.843672252970026E-5,6.822439786465086E-5,6.828094376038927E-5,6.894160193884973E-5,6.850452600398461E-5,6.85825287994171E-5,6.865641878204283E-5,0.02421028830506418,6.882151222919715E-5,7.171463786165585E-5,6.81087047766772E-5,6.811052684403222E-5,6.828308447862547E-5,0.10847458318928742,6.843275720602883E-5,7.345676780403423E-5,0.07842297155397222,6.818283803889772E-5,6.849754678303684E-5,6.811451713130608E-5,6.815476779942639E-5,6.794946636938735E-5,6.796709559586664E-5,6.812008126780774E-5,6.883860378289935E-5,6.848880590891954E-5,6.821802031564987E-5,6.904694079344772E-5,6.824420276462266E-5,7.051161873500052E-5,6.94747248285445E-5,6.798398913474365E-5,6.81342379082377E-5,6.811060638756208E

{"value":"Horrible ending - and I can't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks.

Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was. Were we to think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism, I would reread Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. Absurd to think 38K people would give up everything for a \"fresh start\". Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara, and a reappearing Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve. Just absurd.","finished_norm":["horribl","end","and","i","ca","not","believ","moor","spend","a","year","come","up","with","it","smack","of","l","ron","hubbard","and","dianetitc","which","hubbard","claim","to","pen","in","just","three","week","thi","be","actual","disappoint","enough","for","me","to","toss","my","disc","from","the","year","now","the","hour","be","action","pack","though","absurd","in","the","premis","and","then","it","deterior","into","a","slow","pain","sophomor","dissolut","of","the","seri","unbeliev","how","slow","and","draw","out","that","last","hour","be","be","we","to","think","much","deepli","if","i","want","a","lesson","in","amateri","i","would","reread","daniel","quinn","ishmael","absurd","to","think","k","peopl","would","give","up","everyth","for","a","fresh","start","absurd","to","throw","in","a","disappear","kara","and","a","reappear","baltar","and","six","absurd","to","throw","in","the","mitochondri","ev","just","absurd"],"filtered":["horribl","end","ca","believ","moor","spend","year","come","smack","l","ron","hubbard","dianetitc","hubbard","claim","pen","three","week","thi","actual","disappoint","enough","toss","disc","year","hour","action","pack","though","absurd","premis","deterior","slow","pain","sophomor","dissolut","seri","unbeliev","slow","draw","last","hour","think","much","deepli","want","lesson","amateri","reread","daniel","quinn","ishmael","absurd","think","k","peopl","give","everyth","fresh","start","absurd","throw","disappear","kara","reappear","baltar","six","absurd","throw","mitochondri","ev","absurd"],"filtered2":["horribl","end","ca","believ","moor","spend","year","come","smack","l","ron","hubbard","dianetitc","hubbard","claim","pen","three","week","actual","disappoint","enough","toss","disc","year","hour","action","pack","though","absurd","premis","deterior","slow","pain","sophomor","dissolut","unbeliev","slow","draw","last","hour","think","deepli","want","lesson","amateri","reread","daniel","quinn","ishmael","absurd","think","k","peopl","give","everyth","fresh","start","absurd","throw","disappear","kara","reappear","baltar","six","absurd","throw","mitochondri","ev","absurd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,23,24,30,34,37,52,57,71,81,86,91,93,129,144,174,187,193,224,230,283,310,390,459,484,571,576,751,857,928,1203,1272,1348,1514,1658,1756,1859,1877,2140,2199,2258,2775,3444,3599,3791,3820,4087,4412,4749,6564,6902],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,23,24,30,34,37,52,57,71,81,86,91,93,129,144,174,187,193,224,230,283,310,390,459,484,571,576,751,857,928,1203,1272,1348,1514,1658,1756,1859,1877,2140,2199,2258,2775,3444,3599,3791,3820,4087,4412,4749,6564,6902],"values":[2.133457220525776,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.7122153074726136,3.668325173349496,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,2.031112399272319,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.4106958340079214,2.2931108769894046,4.912565156919632,2.4732161909892554,2.517840471459249,2.689504733779216,2.7121382192999195,2.7678802023081546,5.708625416160924,6.265556250854638,3.2829611516442836,3.291526514503207,3.467417180966871,3.587125145032839,3.8023521382691974,3.9612932464190886,20.087317589430715,4.3521595551061,4.416284083275639,4.470719289830655,4.550761997504193,4.637773374493822,5.185068678041204,5.051537285416681,5.00274712124725,5.170884043049248,4.979216623837056,5.0768550934009715,5.408212229355414,5.719991853386255,5.770002273960917,5.770002273960917,6.032366538428407,5.822646007446338,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.543192162194399,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.772173146827445E-5,5.7332500338744644E-5,5.7778205859521685E-5,5.744436277053353E-5,0.04159010633196974,5.7365006876611E-5,5.7535618444643326E-5,5.7340755844171645E-5,5.746967876649409E-5,6.375947144527098E-5,0.6483940841735141,5.7248195221998924E-5,5.831670439660503E-5,5.914860499910363E-5,5.7289940008747375E-5,5.713161533284486E-5,0.0313776536413593,5.754100909779452E-5,5.736248834122276E-5,5.7410031645180875E-5,5.7965507373008555E-5,5.759801767720107E-5,5.766360175831609E-5,5.7725727821712214E-5,5.816874312633039E-5,5.786453697553413E-5,6.02970521835224E-5,5.72652145855318E-5,5.726674656413008E-5,5.741183154270595E-5,5.863210658189094E-5,5.753767508767512E-5,6.176182009113852E-5,5.769952007705818E-5,5.7327545196323825E-5,5.759214960811174E-5,5.7270101563432224E-5,5.73039439798264E-5,5.713132829899014E-5,5.7146150801350504E-5,5.7274779841661056E-5,5.787890740723689E-5,5.758480035615293E-5,5.7357126152743796E-5,5.805407537811931E-5,5.7379140131187775E-5,0.049612703529355574,5.841375252432853E-5,5.716035474388726E-5,5.728668262346685E-5,5.726681344364749E-5,5.8878516842320075E-5,5.728753494009209E-5,5.714107752

However, one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that Satan tainted it (or something along those lines). Evil?! Wow, what a shocker. . I mean, TBN basically made this film. Open your eyes please.<br /><br />Anway, this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years.<br /><br />The most terrifying thing about Omega Code is how much money they spent to make it. If this movie can be made, there are no limits, and therefore, we have no choice but to get ready for \"Yentl 2\", and \"Ernest Loses the Omega Codes.\"<br /><br />For those of you who are into the

{"value":"Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Rip Off was actually in theaters. Along with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Director Stanley Kramer's 1967 master piece. This present day rip off is a joke. So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home (Insert GASP here) to his grand father's funeral. His family members reactions were of course....predictable. This movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original.

{"value":"Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut-job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.<br /><br />My Grade:F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /><br />ANTI-eye candy: seeing John

{"value":"... but the keyword here is \"usually.\" I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS one is Z-rated. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously. The makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly, even if it's a heavy topic. I get the impression, however, that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously, like they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots. Nevertheless, despite all this, I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars, as I am biased towards movies like this.

{"value":"First of all, I would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie, that the actor who played the \"Transvestite\" Is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he's a terrific actor, although it doesn't say much about his filmography, he's been in several plays and musicals. He is currently residing in Terrace B.C. that is where I am from, he comes over to our house almost every saturday *laughs* Okay, now about the movie, I wouldn't recomend this to anyone who HASN'T seen it, for it is not a movie worth watching, the main reason I found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place, it keeps bouncing back between time, so kinda hard to follow at some points, and second, its really boring *laughs* Although the acting is great, the movie just doesn't compare.","finished_norm":["of","all","i","would","just","like","to","sai","to","everyon","who","have","see","thi","movi","that","the","actor","who","plai","the","transvestit","be","on","of","my","friend","hi","name","be","robert","dugdal","he","a","terrif","actor","although","it","doe","not","sai","much","about","hi","filmographi","he","be","in","sever","plai","and","music","he","be","current","resid","in","terrac","bc","that","be","where","i","be","from","he","come","over","to","our","hous","almost","everi","saturdai","laugh","okai","now","about","the","movi","i","would","not","recomend","thi","to","anyon","who","hasn","t","see","it","for","it","be","not","a","movi","worth","watch","the","main","reason","i","find","it","to","be","a","bad","movi","be","it","never","stai","in","place","it","keep","bounc","back","between","time","so","kinda","hard","to","follow","at","some","point","and","it","realli","bore","laugh","although","the","act","be","great","the","movi","just","doe","not","compar"],"filtered":["like","sai","everyon","see","thi","movi","actor","plai","transvestit","friend","hi","name","robert","dugdal","terrif","actor","although","doe","sai","much","hi","filmographi","sever","plai","music","current","resid","terrac","bc","come","hous","almost","everi","saturdai","laugh","okai","movi","recomend","thi","anyon","hasn","see","movi","worth","watch","main","reason","find","bad","movi","never","stai","place","keep","bounc","back","time","kinda","hard","follow","point","realli","bore","laugh","although","act","great","movi","doe","compar"],"filtered2":["like","everyon","see","actor","plai","transvestit","friend","name","robert","dugdal","terrif","actor","although","doe","filmographi","sever","plai","music","current","resid","terrac","bc","come","hous","almost","everi","saturdai","laugh","okai","recomend","anyon","hasn","see","worth","watch","main","reason","find","bad","never","stai","place","keep","bounc","back","time","kinda","hard","follow","point","realli","bore","laugh","although","act","great","doe","compar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,9,13,18,21,34,38,40,41,42,51,63,66,85,95,108,118,131,133,134,143,158,161,164,171,179,191,213,219,237,246,260,316,365,482,539,1359,1397,1793,1964,2341,3718,4746,6270,7873],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,9,13,18,21,34,38,40,41,42,51,63,66,85,95,108,118,131,133,134,143,158,161,164,171,179,191,213,219,237,246,260,316,365,482,539,1359,1397,1793,1964,2341,3718,4746,6270,7873],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,2.430631986809635,1.162015545335049,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,3.2569937516641474,3.1375198335242067,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.8729627573220065,1.929723173391612,2.011190219103739,2.0323326556775485,2.138507503627933,2.354379525480895,2.2512118082053005,4.642472950759303,2.2443961816702407,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.4323182980210873,2.3930275298746078,2.373087554090762,2.507968722980095,2.5460113484259455,2.8432628718938773,2.5792094178355414,5.280195575021108,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.878207028279898,3.008694896185175,3.3154667220492153,3.6105180246075443,4.403125998698128,4.422928625994308,4.77960356993304,4.911775343041523,5.129498826886393,5.770002273960917,6.101359409915359,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.858241767452897E-5,8.798508572327091E-5,8.866908586666605E-5,8.815675494390504E-5,8.815819929308138E-5,8.803497174784405E-5,8.829680008866318E-5,8.799775500070329E-5,8.819560603293132E-5,9.784821048510102E-5,0.801431640983238,8.78557072227702E-5,8.949549043069507E-5,9.077216326707258E-5,8.791977068797513E-5,8.76767983756028E-5,8.986378643640636E-5,8.830507283233928E-5,8.803110668787419E-5,8.810406882365418E-5,8.895652736359835E-5,8.839256081413689E-5,8.849320915434344E-5,8.858855066188736E-5,8.926842227612445E-5,8.880157355860449E-5,9.253462301281384E-5,8.788182591898175E-5,8.788417696363355E-5,8.810683102898452E-5,8.99795210964732E-5,8.829995630742889E-5,9.478252305475927E-5,8.854833105439815E-5,8.797748133434506E-5,8.838355540605587E-5,8.788932569950686E-5,8.794126182456561E-5,8.767635788027879E-5,8.769910517253197E-5,8.789650519993976E-5,8.882362708248323E-5,8.837227690677924E-5,8.802287762739019E-5,8.909244788818679E-5,8.805666128882235E-5,0.04736568366117541,8.96444249405557E-5,8.772090319449719E-5,8.791477175505842E-5,8.788427960000973E-5,9.035767358866967E-5,8.791607975926009E-5,8.769131949601338E-5,8.865385722342872E-5,8.793872460754703E-5,9.456843359959634E-5,8.786625167193536E-5,8.771988875257562E-5,8.813872547558231E-5,8.90129875570241E-5,8.813289459755073E-5,8.770366037704768E-5,8.790786491777913E-5,8.767741834134749E-5

{"value":"Well then, what is it?! I found Nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Huston's character drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a filthy no good slut. It's not that I \"don't get it\". It's not that I don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more. This is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the movie has going for it. That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd, but then again, it is intended to be so. This however does not strike me as a.)funny, or b.)...even remotely interesting!!!

concoction to feel no pain he calls it \"my son\" there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak. you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening. there is some really stupid scenes in this. and they dub over the hits and slaps with stupid fake slapping sound which makes me laugh! i would not recommend it. keep looking gore hounds.<br /><br />check this out if you want the like 20-10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum.. yeah

minutes into the movie, the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie, was i wanted to see the twist at the ned, and to my surprise, well, folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one,

{"value":"I have nothing more to say but it was awful. I cannot imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one seen that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think what was going on that was cut from the film. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind. Like I stated before its a degrading mess. Its not even funny. As Ebert said of the film Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, Its not a good film, not a good story and its not even good porn.

{"value":"This program didn't do it for me, although I'm a fan of the genre. The major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character. This made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the program was over.<br /><br />I was hoping to leave my critique there as I'm no movie critic, however, the guidelines on IMDb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary. It did remind me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene, and I would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers. I don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after watching things like \"the wire\", I've come to expect great things from cop

{"value":"Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this.Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to.I lost count of the amount of times a major Hollywood film was quoted most notably James Camerons Aliens.The amount of blood and gore on show here isn't funny either,the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out.Maybe it would have worked better as a short film.The actors a poor,the direction is weak and the plot is non existent.I can see what the director was trying to do,the homage he was trying to pay,but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here.

{"value":"Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies. If you like them so god damn awful they're hysterical, watch away. Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie i've seen in my life (and i've seen 'Long Time Dead'), and i say this as a fan of the low-budget horror/gore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to. I'm not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is, the only good thing about it is it's so so terrible it's one of the funniest things i've seen in years. If you can find this to rent cheap it's definitely worth watching, if you were involved in making it - shame on you. :o) IMDb need to introduce a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie, it thoroughly

I think they took out the topless scene. They may have taken out other stuff too, who knows? All we know is that whatever they took out, isn't there any more.<br /><br />The acting seemed OK to me.

{"value":"Well, I just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit, I did chuckle a few times, but I don't even remember what parts they were at. I don't understand why this movie was made. It claims to be a comedy but seriousuly, I don't find a singing penis, or a naked 70 year old woman very funny. This movie was trying to fit itself into the 'gross-out' comedies of recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed miserably. It was way to much gross-out then it was comedy. Also, why on earth did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done.

{"value":"Wow...sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.<br /><br />After watching this, I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either not written in depth or too much depth.<br /><br />If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog, messed up plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and lousy development overall, then this is the one to watch.<br /><br />Be sure to keep focused for the classic \"food processor\" scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes.<br /><br />This is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid, daring or

{"value":"About three minutes into this thing I started fast-forwarding, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). In ten minutes I was done, and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store. The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injury, the \"twist\" at the end was so formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies.<br /><br />This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Run away!","finished_norm":["about","three","minut","into","thi","thing","i","start","fastforward","paus","onli","dure","the","nuditi","why","be","it","that","bad","movi","alwai","includ","such","good","look","woman","in","ten","minut","i","be","do","and","wish","i","can","get","my","monei","back","from","the","rental","store","the","peopl","who","write","thi","movi","should","be","sanction","by","the","mpaa","come","on","writer","the","bad","gui","alwai","get","into","the","car","with","the","bomb","activ","by","the","good","gui","remot","control","that","the","wai","it","be","do","sinc","the","dai","of","the","ottoman","empir","conjur","to","add","insult","to","injuri","the","twist","at","the","end","be","so","formula","that","it","can","have","come","from","ani","action","movi","write","in","the","past","year","burt","reynold","be","fine","but","he","should","concentr","on","real","moviesbr","br","thi","movi","be","just","a","wast","of","time","run","awai","run","awai"],"filtered":["three","minut","thi","thing","start","fastforward","paus","onli","dure","nuditi","bad","movi","alwai","includ","good","look","woman","ten","minut","wish","get","monei","back","rental","store","peopl","write","thi","movi","sanction","mpaa","come","writer","bad","gui","alwai","get","car","bomb","activ","good","gui","remot","control","wai","sinc","dai","ottoman","empir","conjur","add","insult","injuri","twist","end","formula","come","ani","action","movi","write","past","year","burt","reynold","fine","concentr","real","moviesbr","br","thi","movi","wast","time","run","awai","run","awai"],"filtered2":["three","minut","thing","start","fastforward","paus","onli","dure","nuditi","bad","alwai","includ","good","look","woman","ten","minut","wish","get","monei","back","rental","store","peopl","write","sanction","mpaa","come","writer","bad","gui","alwai","get","car","bomb","activ","good","gui","remot","control","wai","sinc","dai","ottoman","empir","conjur","add","insult","injuri","twist","end","formula","come","ani","action","write","past","year","burt","reynold","fine","concentr","real","moviesbr","wast","time","run","awai","run","awai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,11,16,23,24,27,29,33,34,39,55,57,59,63,65,70,71,80,89,126,129,132,137,155,162,197,224,239,284,287,299,301,399,435,440,464,545,612,709,793,823,883,1078,1176,1504,1699,2361,2506,2531,2770,3258,3278,3780,4070,6148],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,11,16,23,24,27,29,33,34,39,55,57,59,63,65,70,71,80,89,126,129,132,137,155,162,197,224,239,284,287,299,301,399,435,440,464,545,612,709,793,823,883,1078,1176,1504,1699,2361,2506,2531,2770,3258,3278,3780,4070,6148],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,2.7965700178917925,1.5538940054862738,3.9073995778510735,1.834162586674748,3.7386508898401445,1.8729627573220065,3.8147700134888347,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,2.253494045787767,4.587807168251287,4.614953293582877,2.3586007221245198,5.116663665627972,2.689504733779216,2.6593400337329487,3.110998680163279,2.841890188081905,2.7949961309240425,2.8309760279012264,3.129115117668582,3.2829611516442836,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.442099372982581,3.5929222627171646,3.6497387377608255,3.770603439954617,3.9081109809587793,3.8614098879127985,4.280272325592784,4.358390104856736,4.535724120139652,4.733083554298147,5.339219357868463,5.156897801074508,5.156897801074508,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.7959777603641776,5.719991853386255,5.878215858601149,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.593812990191993E-5,6.549349367691489E-5,6.600264313898798E-5,6.562127916378122E-5,6.5622354294559E-5,6.553062735710728E-5,6.57255246245579E-5,6.550292431205707E-5,6.565019876455863E-5,7.283531182613211E-5,0.810147484869073,6.539718815041781E-5,6.66177942369711E-5,6.756811171009103E-5,6.544487509780018E-5,6.526401369983471E-5,6.689194288299448E-5,6.573168261009816E-5,6.55277503208617E-5,6.558206117524207E-5,6.621660608176478E-5,6.579680607432582E-5,6.587172571983986E-5,6.594269511618864E-5,6.644877142335048E-5,6.610126305556715E-5,6.888003458048034E-5,6.541663013483048E-5,6.541838018288432E-5,0.040508046433857255,6.697809233849569E-5,6.572787402039103E-5,7.055330483956189E-5,6.591275683077209E-5,6.548783319486913E-5,6.579010271508757E-5,6.542221274947888E-5,6.546087246379498E-5,6.526368580815307E-5,6.528061821924415E-5,6.542755695710612E-5,6.611767904601408E-5,6.578170733404103E-5,6.552162485179674E-5,6.631778129736545E-5,6.554677240945611E-5

{"value":"Not since Caligula have I considered turning off the movie half-way through....but then with this one, I was only 15 minutes in when I considered. Unfortunately, I did make it all the way through. Make sure that you do not.<br /><br />It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual. It's that it's not any of those things, yet it so desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, trite, ordinary, predictable, and unexceptionally poorly executed (shot on video, high school special effects, no sense of even basic visual storytelling, dialog barely

{"value":"**May Contain Spoilers**<br /><br />A dude in a dopey-looking Kong suit (the same one used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) provides much of the laffs in this much-mocked monster flick. Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around. The vampire-like villain is named Dr. Who-funny, he doesn't look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally dukes it out with Who's pride and joy, a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's flicks this may have had some merit before American audiences diddled around with it and added new footage. The Rankin/Bass animation company had a hand in this mess.
