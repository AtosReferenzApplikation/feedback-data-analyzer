{"value":"I don't know where to begin. This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. Sort of like Captain Power or the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding \"secret agencies\" and villains.<br /><br />The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. For some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as being \"remote detonated\" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. This chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. Standing up on the bikes, doing wheelies and so on. At one point, a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. Then, a few seconds later the rider and bike return...apparently unscathed by the crash. At this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up her car. Which was also clearly done with cgi. Sound confusing? It is, and so is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I might point out that when I say cgi, we aren't talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here. We're talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type cgi, actually I think it would have been done better on Power Rangers.<br /><br />Why Savini and Todd did this movie I will never know, I can only assume they did for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it...probably the last one.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","know","where","to","begin","thi","movi","feel","a","lot","like","on","of","that","cheap","saturdai","morn","kid","show","that","thei","us","to","make","back","in","the","late","eighti","earli","nineti","sort","of","like","captain","power","or","the","power","ranger","it","full","of","bad","digit","overlai","and","realli","cheesi","sound","secret","agenc","and","villainsbr","br","the","act","be","so","bad","that","it","not","even","funni","the","direct","be","terribl","and","there","be","littl","to","now","continu","it","seem","a","if","someon","just","throw","a","bunch","of","scene","togeth","and","forget","that","there","be","suppos","to","be","a","plotbr","br","perhap","on","of","the","much","ridicul","scene","in","the","movi","come","earli","on","when","sever","villain","plant","a","explos","devic","in","a","agent","car","for","some","reason","even","though","the","devic","be","clearli","state","a","be","remot","deton","the","bad","gui","decid","to","chase","her","down","on","their","motorcycl","a","she","drive","awai","thi","chase","carri","on","all","the","while","with","the","bad","gui","do","ludicr","and","complet","pointless","bike","stunt","stand","up","on","the","bike","do","wheeli","and","so","on","at","on","point","a","crash","happen","and","on","of","the","attack","be","throw","from","hi","bike","we","see","the","bike","clearli","cgi","throw","over","the","agent","car","but","the","rider","have","vanish","then","a","few","second","late","the","rider","and","bike","returnappar","unscath","by","the","crash","at","thi","point","even","though","the","car","have","a","explos","devic","plant","in","it","the","attack","choos","to","shoot","the","agent","while","drive","past","then","blow","up","her","car","which","be","conjur","clearli","do","with","cgi","sound","confus","it","be","and","so","be","the","rest","of","the","moviebr","br","i","mai","point","out","that","when","i","sai","cgi","we","be","not","talk","about","lord","of","the","ring","typ","cgi","here","we","re","talk","the","cheap","cheesi","power","ranger","typ","cgi","actual","i","think","it","would","have","be","do","well","on","power","rangersbr","br","why","savini","and","todd","do","thi","movi","i","will","never","know","i","can","onli","assum","thei","do","for","monei","a","a","favor","to","someon","or","becaus","thei","be","blackmail","into","itprob","the","last","on"],"filtered":["know","begin","thi","movi","feel","lot","like","cheap","saturdai","morn","kid","show","thei","us","make","back","late","eighti","earli","nineti","sort","like","captain","power","power","ranger","full","bad","digit","overlai","realli","cheesi","sound","secret","agenc","villainsbr","br","act","bad","even","funni","direct","terribl","littl","continu","seem","someon","throw","bunch","scene","togeth","forget","suppos","plotbr","br","perhap","much","ridicul","scene","movi","come","earli","sever","villain","plant","explos","devic","agent","car","reason","even","though","devic","clearli","state","remot","deton","bad","gui","decid","chase","motorcycl","drive","awai","thi","chase","carri","bad","gui","ludicr","complet","pointless","bike","stunt","stand","bike","wheeli","point","crash","happen","attack","throw","hi","bike","see","bike","clearli","cgi","throw","agent","car","rider","vanish","second","late","rider","bike","returnappar","unscath","crash","thi","point","even","though","car","explos","devic","plant","attack","choos","shoot","agent","drive","past","blow","car","conjur","clearli","cgi","sound","confus","rest","moviebr","br","mai","point","sai","cgi","talk","lord","ring","typ","cgi","re","talk","cheap","cheesi","power","ranger","typ","cgi","actual","think","well","power","rangersbr","br","savini","todd","thi","movi","never","know","onli","assum","thei","monei","favor","someon","becaus","thei","blackmail","itprob","last"],"filtered2":["know","begin","feel","lot","like","cheap","saturdai","morn","kid","show","us","make","back","late","eighti","earli","nineti","sort","like","captain","power","power","ranger","full","bad","digit","overlai","realli","cheesi","sound","secret","agenc","villainsbr","act","bad","even","funni","direct","terribl","littl","continu","seem","someon","throw","bunch","scene","togeth","forget","suppos","plotbr","perhap","ridicul","scene","come","earli","sever","villain","plant","explos","devic","agent","car","reason","even","though","devic","clearli","state","remot","deton","bad","gui","decid","chase","motorcycl","drive","awai","chase","carri","bad","gui","ludicr","complet","pointless","bike","stunt","stand","bike","wheeli","point","crash","happen","attack","throw","bike","see","bike","clearli","cgi","throw","agent","car","rider","vanish","second","late","rider","bike","returnappar","unscath","crash","point","even","though","car","explos","devic","plant","attack","choos","shoot","agent","drive","past","blow","car","conjur","clearli","cgi","sound","confus","rest","moviebr","mai","point","cgi","talk","lor

{"value":"We purchased this series on DVD because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here. I gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting, directing and writing are brilliant. In fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series. If one watches it with discernment, one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid giving away any spoilers I will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances. A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide \"Infomercials\" and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world. We watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us. The series also manages to demean male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people. All in all the complete litany of the radical religious right wing.<br /><br />No doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America lost its way in the early part of the this century. As a student of history myself I would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during WWII.<br /><br />So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so. Just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wingers at Faux Network who produced this travesty.","finished_norm":["we","purchas","thi","seri","on","dvd","becaus","of","all","of","the","glow","review","we","have","see","here","i","give","it","three","star","becaus","there","can","be","littl","doubt","that","sometim","the","act","direct","and","write","be","brilliant","in","fact","thei","be","so","brilliant","we","do","not","see","the","propaganda","that","be","be","transmit","so","smoothli","on","the","seri","if","on","watch","it","with","discern","on","will","see","the","entir","litani","of","the","radic","right","wing","belief","be","promulg","by","the","fox","faux","new","network","to","avoid","give","awai","ani","spoiler","i","will","refrain","from","point","out","all","of","the","dozen","of","specif","instanc","a","brief","look","at","the","plot","find","here","on","imdb","will","disclos","that","everyth","from","tortur","to","gun","control","to","the","right","of","a","network","to","provid","infomerci","and","call","them","new","be","justifi","with","cute","plot","twist","and","impass","speech","give","by","some","of","the","well","actor","in","the","world","we","watch","mani","show","and","final","give","up","in","disgust","when","thei","justifi","tortur","us","attornei","gener","gonzal","a","a","shine","exampl","of","why","all","kind","of","tortur","should","be","us","in","the","name","of","protect","all","of","u","the","seri","conjur","manag","to","demean","male","and","femal","gai","in","subtl","wai","by","us","them","a","plot","devic","depict","evil","peopl","all","in","all","the","complet","litani","of","the","radic","religi","right","wingbr","br","no","doubt","the","popular","of","thi","program","will","be","us","by","futur","historian","a","proof","that","america","lose","it","wai","in","the","earli","part","of","the","thi","centuri","a","a","student","of","histori","myself","i","would","character","thi","program","a","be","in","a","leagu","with","the","propaganda","produc","by","goebbel","for","hitler","and","some","of","the","propaganda","produc","by","hollywood","for","the","american","audienc","dure","wwiibr","br","so","if","you","want","to","us","thi","a","a","teach","tool","to","help","your","student","understand","how","subtl","propaganda","can","be","then","by","all","mean","do","so","just","be","sure","to","purchas","a","inexpens","us","copi","so","you","can","avoid","enrich","the","ultra","right","winger","at","faux","network","who","produc","thi","travesti"],"filtered":["purchas","thi","seri","dvd","becaus","glow","review","see","give","three","star","becaus","littl","doubt","sometim","act","direct","write","brilliant","fact","thei","brilliant","see","propaganda","transmit","smoothli","seri","watch","discern","see","entir","litani","radic","right","wing","belief","promulg","fox","faux","new","network","avoid","give","awai","ani","spoiler","refrain","point","dozen","specif","instanc","brief","look","plot","find","imdb","disclos","everyth","tortur","gun","control","right","network","provid","infomerci","call","new","justifi","cute","plot","twist","impass","speech","give","well","actor","world","watch","mani","show","final","give","disgust","thei","justifi","tortur","us","attornei","gener","gonzal","shine","exampl","kind","tortur","us","name","protect","u","seri","conjur","manag","demean","male","femal","gai","subtl","wai","us","plot","devic","depict","evil","peopl","complet","litani","radic","religi","right","wingbr","br","doubt","popular","thi","program","us","futur","historian","proof","america","lose","wai","earli","part","thi","centuri","student","histori","character","thi","program","leagu","propaganda","produc","goebbel","hitler","propaganda","produc","hollywood","american","audienc","dure","wwiibr","br","want","us","thi","teach","tool","help","student","understand","subtl","propaganda","mean","sure","purchas","inexpens","us","copi","avoid","enrich","ultra","right","winger","faux","network","produc","thi","travesti"],"filtered2":["purchas","dvd","becaus","glow","review","see","give","three","star","becaus","littl","doubt","sometim","act","direct","write","brilliant","fact","brilliant","see","propaganda","transmit","smoothli","watch","discern","see","entir","litani","radic","right","wing","belief","promulg","fox","faux","new","network","avoid","give","awai","ani","spoiler","refrain","point","dozen","specif","instanc","brief","look","plot","find","imdb","disclos","everyth","tortur","gun","control","right","network","provid","infomerci","call","new","justifi","cute","plot","twist","impass","speech","give","well","actor","world","watch","mani","show","final","give","disgust","justifi","tortur","us","attornei","gener","gonzal","shine","exampl","kind","tortur","us","name","protect","u","conjur","manag","demean","male","femal","gai","subtl","wai","us","plot","devic","depict","evil","peopl","complet","litani","radic","religi","right","wingbr","doubt","popular","program","us","futur","historian","proof","america","lose","wai","earli","part","centuri","student","histori","

{"value":"Creep - \"Your journey terminates here.\" Some very graphic scenes and...well, yeah, that's about all for this film.<br /><br />No real plot, no storyline. No likable characters, well, 'characters' isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is. I mean, they are being chased by some weird looking 'thing' in the sewers (who is this thing? why is he there?), that's quite scary I guess, but do I really care? No, I don't. Why don't I? Because I don't have a clue who these people are and I don't know if I should want them to live or die. It's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.<br /><br />This film lacks any meaning, any purpose. It feels like I fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up. It jumps right into the action. Basically, some women and her friends get locked in the London Underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.<br /><br />Creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are OK, but that isn't what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.<br /><br />It's nothing new. Another predictable modern 'horror', where Kate (the lead 'character') consistently does the stupid \"hey, I know you lot sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! I'm going to do the total opposite because I'm a dumb blond\" thing. I wish they wouldn't do that, it's done so many times, it's boring and gets predictable. In fact, I'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the, erm, grey alien-looking creature.<br /><br />\"Your journey terminates here\" is the films tag line. Well, Creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film. If you've had a few beers, got a couple of mates back at yours,then sure, watch it by all means.

{"value":"Just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick. Something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?<br /><br />The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical English literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter).<br /><br />The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space. <br /><br />This flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian \"philosophy\" about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. It is trite, overwrought and tedious.<br /><br />There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film. \"Nil by Mouth\" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Ditto for \"In the Warzone.\" And although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.","finished_norm":["just","email","a","friend","who","in","film","school","about","thi","flick","someth","to","avoid","when","make","a","film","charact","blabber","senseless","overwrought","convolut","monologu","on","screen","that","be","ultim","trite","and","unconvinc","if","the","film","be","a","attempt","at","social","realism","thi","verbal","barrag","be","so","overthetop","that","thei","actual","draw","attent","to","the","film","construct","a","film","and","effect","neutral","that","intent","be","it","the","act","or","the","script","that","be","bad","or","bothbr","br","the","protagonist","be","conjur","highli","unbeliev","for","social","realism","raven","consum","canon","english","literatur","and","the","bibl","while","high","or","hungov","and","abl","to","produc","such","profoundli","sophomor","soliloqui","while","intox","and","how","be","such","a","unattract","unwash","and","verbal","noxiou","charact","abl","to","bed","much","of","the","woman","he","meet","within","minut","of","encount","them","i","have","to","applaud","when","on","chick","final","throw","him","out","onto","the","street","despit","hi","whine","and","selfpiti","banterbr","br","the","viewer","encount","pretenti","refer","to","ancient","greek","literatur","nostradamu","and","the","book","of","revel","the","impend","doom","of","mankind","in","the","form","of","bar","code","imprint","on","our","forehead","or","right","hand","in","spooki","biblic","fashion","be","present","to","a","charact","who","be","ohsocleverli","expos","in","hi","role","a","a","guardian","of","empti","space","br","br","thi","flick","be","overscript","and","over","the","top","a","melodrama","clumsili","infus","with","pedestrian","philosophi","about","the","mean","of","mankind","life","etc","it","be","trite","overwrought","and","tediousbr","br","there","be","some","veri","fine","english","film","avail","with","content","similar","to","thi","film","nil","by","mouth","be","a","excel","far","much","interest","excurs","into","the","live","of","individu","in","a","similar","social","milieu","ditto","for","in","the","warzon","and","although","the","comparison","be","not","even","warrant","check","out","anyth","by","peter","greenawai","who","far","much","deftli","handl","dialogu","wit","and","absurd","charact","and","situat"],"filtered":["email","friend","film","school","thi","flick","someth","avoid","make","film","charact","blabber","senseless","overwrought","convolut","monologu","screen","ultim","trite","unconvinc","film","attempt","social","realism","thi","verbal","barrag","overthetop","thei","actual","draw","attent","film","construct","film","effect","neutral","intent","act","script","bad","bothbr","br","protagonist","conjur","highli","unbeliev","social","realism","raven","consum","canon","english","literatur","bibl","high","hungov","abl","produc","profoundli","sophomor","soliloqui","intox","unattract","unwash","verbal","noxiou","charact","abl","bed","much","woman","meet","within","minut","encount","applaud","chick","final","throw","onto","street","despit","hi","whine","selfpiti","banterbr","br","viewer","encount","pretenti","refer","ancient","greek","literatur","nostradamu","book","revel","impend","doom","mankind","form","bar","code","imprint","forehead","right","hand","spooki","biblic","fashion","present","charact","ohsocleverli","expos","hi","role","guardian","empti","space","br","br","thi","flick","overscript","top","melodrama","clumsili","infus","pedestrian","philosophi","mean","mankind","life","etc","trite","overwrought","tediousbr","br","veri","fine","english","film","avail","content","similar","thi","film","nil","mouth","excel","far","much","interest","excurs","live","individu","similar","social","milieu","ditto","warzon","although","comparison","even","warrant","check","anyth","peter","greenawai","far","much","deftli","handl","dialogu","wit","absurd","charact","situat"],"filtered2":["email","friend","school","flick","someth","avoid","make","charact","blabber","senseless","overwrought","convolut","monologu","screen","ultim","trite","unconvinc","attempt","social","realism","verbal","barrag","overthetop","actual","draw","attent","construct","effect","neutral","intent","act","script","bad","bothbr","protagonist","conjur","highli","unbeliev","social","realism","raven","consum","canon","english","literatur","bibl","high","hungov","abl","produc","profoundli","sophomor","soliloqui","intox","unattract","unwash","verbal","noxiou","charact","abl","bed","woman","meet","within","minut","encount","applaud","chick","final","throw","onto","street","despit","whine","selfpiti","banterbr","viewer","encount","pretenti","refer","ancient","greek","literatur","nostradamu","book","revel","impend","doom","mankind","form","bar","code","imprint","forehead","right","hand","spooki","biblic","fashion","present","charact","ohsocleverli","expos","role","guardian","empti","space","flick","overscript","top","melodrama","clumsili","infus","pedestrian","philosophi","mean","mankind","life",

{"value":"Liongate has yet to prove itself. Every single movie from lionsgate has been abysmal. i've tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep slapping me over and over again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception.<br /><br />I couldn't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad.<br /><br />here's the plot. Guy cuts up dead dog for some reason. Gets infected by random virus, transfers it to kids at a camp, kids start to get infected and die, town finds out about it and rather than help them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. the end.<br /><br />Seriously, that's the whole movie.<br /><br />all the characters are completely retarded, you don't care for any of them, and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world. Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls$@t, because this film will make you do that.<br /><br />and i'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him? that was part of the two of their's plan? wow. best plan ever. i cannot believe this movie got a theatrical release. i could barely stomach the DVD, let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half. It wasn't scary, or funny, or cool, or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to...i don't know, plant a tree or something. it's more productive than this piece of garbage.

{"value":"OK, I am not Japanese. I do know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor.<br /><br />Good, with that point set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this. It may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases, I am afraid it is, but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible. The jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked- I mean, give the audience a break, and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action.<br /><br />However, I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene.<br /><br />I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke.<br /><br />Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation.

{"value":"These kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries.<br /><br />Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops wants Carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife. It seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. And the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the \"shocking\" moment our main, naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.","finished_norm":["thi","kind","of","movi","where","a","psycho","of","on","varieti","or","anoth","try","to","damag","the","reput","and","eventu","elimin","altogeth","some","naiv","person","in","order","to","take","over","their","life","fatal","attract","pacif","height","the","hand","that","rock","the","cradl","singl","white","femal","and","a","thousand","madefortv","movi","be","some","exampl","of","thi","but","while","a","few","especi","fatal","attract","and","pacif","height","can","offer","at","littl","some","extrem","paranoid","suspens","charact","or","a","few","plot","twist","unlaw","entri","plai","everyth","by","the","book","and","be","it","not","for","the","notorieti","of","it","star","kurt","russel","rai","liota","and","madelin","stowe","thi","movi","would","sink","to","mediocr","fast","than","a","daniel","steel","miniseriesbr","br","russel","plai","michael","carr","a","incessantli","naiv","gui","who","call","on","the","help","of","a","pair","of","offic","when","someon","break","into","hi","hous","and","try","to","attack","hi","wife","madelin","stowe","unfortun","he","quietli","vent","hi","anger","about","feel","so","helpless","in","the","situat","to","the","wrong","cop","rai","liotta","a","typic","psychopath","villain","with","no","limit","for","hi","power","at","empath","with","carr","probabl","onli","pretend","to","do","so","the","cop","befriend","the","coupl","but","soon","enough","the","cop","want","carr","out","of","the","wai","so","destroi","the","gui","life","nearli","ani","wai","he","can","which","be","pretti","easi","when","you","re","a","cop","and","when","you","re","the","cop","who","have","instal","the","gui","secur","system","in","hi","hous","in","order","to","take","over","and","presum","get","hi","wife","it","seem","littl","endsori","and","much","like","the","cop","just","want","to","prove","hi","power","the","wife","be","much","like","a","trophi","in","other","word","than","a","end","and","the","stori","plai","out","entir","by","the","book","you","can","probabl","predict","everi","occurr","befor","it","happen","on","the","screen","if","you","have","see","enough","of","thi","movi","from","the","shock","moment","our","main","naiv","charact","realiz","he","be","a","victim","of","credit","card","fraud","perpetr","by","the","psychopath","villain","to","the","turnaroundhesnotreallydead","final"],"filtered":["thi","kind","movi","psycho","varieti","anoth","try","damag","reput","eventu","elimin","altogeth","naiv","person","order","take","life","fatal","attract","pacif","height","hand","rock","cradl","singl","white","femal","thousand","madefortv","movi","exampl","thi","especi","fatal","attract","pacif","height","offer","littl","extrem","paranoid","suspens","charact","plot","twist","unlaw","entri","plai","everyth","book","notorieti","star","kurt","russel","rai","liota","madelin","stowe","thi","movi","sink","mediocr","fast","daniel","steel","miniseriesbr","br","russel","plai","michael","carr","incessantli","naiv","gui","call","help","pair","offic","someon","break","hi","hous","try","attack","hi","wife","madelin","stowe","unfortun","quietli","vent","hi","anger","feel","helpless","situat","wrong","cop","rai","liotta","typic","psychopath","villain","limit","hi","power","empath","carr","probabl","onli","pretend","cop","befriend","coupl","soon","enough","cop","want","carr","wai","destroi","gui","life","nearli","ani","wai","pretti","easi","re","cop","re","cop","instal","gui","secur","system","hi","hous","order","take","presum","get","hi","wife","seem","littl","endsori","much","like","cop","want","prove","hi","power","wife","much","like","trophi","word","end","stori","plai","entir","book","probabl","predict","everi","occurr","befor","happen","screen","see","enough","thi","movi","shock","moment","main","naiv","charact","realiz","victim","credit","card","fraud","perpetr","psychopath","villain","turnaroundhesnotreallydead","final"],"filtered2":["kind","psycho","varieti","anoth","try","damag","reput","eventu","elimin","altogeth","naiv","person","order","take","life","fatal","attract","pacif","height","hand","rock","cradl","singl","white","femal","thousand","madefortv","exampl","especi","fatal","attract","pacif","height","offer","littl","extrem","paranoid","suspens","charact","plot","twist","unlaw","entri","plai","everyth","book","notorieti","star","kurt","russel","rai","liota","madelin","stowe","sink","mediocr","fast","daniel","steel","miniseriesbr","russel","plai","michael","carr","incessantli","naiv","gui","call","help","pair","offic","someon","break","hous","try","attack","wife","madelin","stowe","unfortun","quietli","vent","anger","feel","helpless","situat","wrong","cop","rai","liotta","typic","psychopath","villain","limit","power","empath","carr","probabl","onli","pretend","cop","befriend","coupl","soon","enough","cop","want","carr","wai","destroi","gui","life","nearli","ani","wai","pretti","easi","re","cop","re","cop","instal","gui","secur","system","hous","order","take","presum","get","wife",

{"value":"I saw \"Shiner\" on DVD. While I was watching it, I thought, \"This is a really bad porn flick without the porn.\" I also thought, \"Whoever wrote this has some real issues.\" Then I watched the director/writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yeah, it was real special.<br /><br />The emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. They are marginally attractive. There is frontal and full nudity. These factors probably account for the film being seen at all.<br /><br />The most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants, the two drunken losers. Not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view, but the acting is horrendously bad.<br /><br />Then there's the boxer-stalker theme. This is really insane, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy momma's boy who works at his gym's parking lot. This is in LA, mind you. The boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalker's house, strips in front of him and gets excited in the process.<br /><br />Well, all I can say is, why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It simply makes no sense. And, I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics actually do make sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts seldom make sense at all.<br /><br />The director/writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, he may be correct, I suppose. We may never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or DVD store, the only two places they could possibly find this turkey.

{"value":"When childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie; it's touch and go whether you should revisit it. Anyway, I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by Jeff Kober.<br /><br />\"The First Power\" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It's chock full of those cop clichés and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through (along with countless convenient \"twists\" that help the story run along). Lou Diamond Phillips is the over-confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer Kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across. Through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case.<br /><br />Ahhh, this is trash. But enjoyable as such, especially if you have fond memories of it. It scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good. As for any kind of logic here; forget it, just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a Steven Segal action flick and a 70's demonic flick. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here? Needless to say he's not convincing at all but he tries his best and I've never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as the psychic, the less said the better. But Kober is pretty good as the killer; always liked that actor.<br /><br />\"The First Power\" may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a \"brain switch-off\" is needed. Beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and I'll definitely have loads of it the next time I give this movie a spin. All in all; not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids. \"See you around, buddy

{"value":"The film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims. On the surface, it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface, what lies is a not-so-positive message about rape. Aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a WOMAN. She needs a MAN to help her. When the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her, she does not stand up for herself. It is all left to Anil Kapoor to do all the talking while Aishwarya does all the crying.<br /><br />The director (Satish Kaushik) went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. What would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. His films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He needs to learn that just because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the character herself is strong.<br /><br />The most degrading scene in the film is when Aishwarya 'cleans' herself after just being raped. She does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty. Though it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light, what he does not show us is whether Ash's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing. Thus we are left with a confusing message about rape.<br /><br />The comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this. Even more so, the comedy is simply not funny. Ash is wooden in her role while Anil Kapoor does nothing but shout. The music is mediocre except for the title track, which is beautifully picturised (the only bright point of this film). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and pointless. Overall, what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish-mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion.","finished_norm":["the","film","be","sever","aw","and","be","demean","to","rape","victim","on","the","surfac","it","mai","be","a","dare","film","about","rape","but","if","you","dig","beneath","the","surfac","what","lie","be","a","notsoposit","messag","about","rape","aishwarya","the","rape","victim","be","show","to","be","a","helpless","victim","who","cannot","cope","all","becaus","she","be","a","woman","she","ne","a","man","to","help","her","when","the","societi","make","jibe","about","her","and","throw","comment","at","her","she","doe","not","stand","up","for","herself","it","be","all","leav","to","anil","kapoor","to","do","all","the","talk","while","aishwarya","doe","all","the","cryingbr","br","the","director","satish","kaushik","go","down","the","wrong","path","by","portrai","a","rape","victim","a","weak","and","submiss","what","would","have","be","much","effect","be","portrai","a","strong","woman","who","rebel","against","her","enemi","in","a","courag","wai","the","director","be","famou","for","be","chauvinist","hi","film","be","usual","full","of","weak","woman","but","he","try","to","hide","them","in","controversi","role","he","ne","to","learn","that","just","becaus","the","role","be","controversi","it","doe","not","mean","that","the","charact","herself","be","strongbr","br","the","much","degrad","scene","in","the","film","be","when","aishwarya","clean","herself","after","just","be","rape","she","doe","it","to","pleas","her","father","who","think","that","she","be","now","dirti","though","it","be","commend","that","shah","show","the","stigma","against","rape","victim","in","such","a","stark","light","what","he","doe","not","show","u","be","whether","ash","father","be","wrong","for","make","hi","daughter","do","such","a","thing","thu","we","be","leav","with","a","confus","messag","about","rapebr","br","the","comedi","too","be","not","ne","in","a","strong","subject","film","like","thi","even","much","so","the","comedi","be","simpli","not","funni","ash","be","wooden","in","her","role","while","anil","kapoor","doe","noth","but","shout","the","music","be","mediocr","except","for","the","titl","track","which","be","beautifulli","picturis","the","onli","bright","point","of","thi","film","sonali","bendr","role","be","disappoint","and","pointless","overal","what","can","have","be","a","great","movi","to","rememb","end","up","be","a","aw","mishmash","that","will","give","some","viewer","sever","indigest"],"filtered":["film","sever","aw","demean","rape","victim","surfac","mai","dare","film","rape","dig","beneath","surfac","lie","notsoposit","messag","rape","aishwarya","rape","victim","show","helpless","victim","cope","becaus","woman","ne","man","help","societi","make","jibe","throw","comment","doe","stand","leav","anil","kapoor","talk","aishwarya","doe","cryingbr","br","director","satish","kaushik","go","wrong","path","portrai","rape","victim","weak","submiss","much","effect","portrai","strong","woman","rebel","enemi","courag","wai","director","famou","chauvinist","hi","film","usual","full","weak","woman","try","hide","controversi","role","ne","learn","becaus","role","controversi","doe","mean","charact","strongbr","br","much","degrad","scene","film","aishwarya","clean","rape","doe","pleas","father","think","dirti","though","commend","shah","show","stigma","rape","victim","stark","light","doe","show","u","whether","ash","father","wrong","make","hi","daughter","thing","thu","leav","confus","messag","rapebr","br","comedi","ne","strong","subject","film","like","thi","even","much","comedi","simpli","funni","ash","wooden","role","anil","kapoor","doe","noth","shout","music","mediocr","except","titl","track","beautifulli","picturis","onli","bright","point","thi","film","sonali","bendr","role","disappoint","pointless","overal","great","movi","rememb","end","aw","mishmash","give","viewer","sever","indigest"],"filtered2":["sever","aw","demean","rape","victim","surfac","mai","dare","rape","dig","beneath","surfac","lie","notsoposit","messag","rape","aishwarya","rape","victim","show","helpless","victim","cope","becaus","woman","ne","man","help","societi","make","jibe","throw","comment","doe","stand","leav","anil","kapoor","talk","aishwarya","doe","cryingbr","director","satish","kaushik","go","wrong","path","portrai","rape","victim","weak","submiss","effect","portrai","strong","woman","rebel","enemi","courag","wai","director","famou","chauvinist","usual","full","weak","woman","try","hide","controversi","role","ne","learn","becaus","role","controversi","doe","mean","charact","strongbr","degrad","scene","aishwarya","clean","rape","doe","pleas","father","think","dirti","though","commend","shah","show","stigma","rape","victim","stark","light","doe","show","u","whether","ash","father","wrong","make","daughter","thing","thu","leav","confus","messag","rapebr","comedi","ne","strong","subject","like","even","comedi","simpli","funni","ash","wooden","role","anil","kapoor","doe","noth","shout","music","mediocr","except","titl"

{"value":"In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities. When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.<br /><br />In spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, \"Alone in the Dark\" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. The reason may be explained by the \"brilliant\" interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD, where he says that \"videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore\". Further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says.

{"value":"After seeing the poster from the film Smother,I knew I was about to live one of those intolerable film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out.However,I felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which I thought it was going to rescue the movie.Unfortunately that did not happen.Smother is a horrible movie,but it is not execrable.That is the best I can say about it.<br /><br />The screenplay from Smother (written by the same guys from License to Wed,something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor.Seriously,I did not laugh even once watching this film.Besides,the solid cast I previously mentioned is absolutely wasted.After the big number of garbage she has been involved in (like the monumentally atrocious and execrable Because I Said So),some people may think the career from Diane Keaton is extinguishing.However,it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades,on films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother,she makes her best effort with her performance,but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it.Dax Shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However,he does what he can with his character.Mike White also makes a good effort,but he does not reach too far away.He is a very talented screenwriter (like he has shown on films like The Good Girl and School of Rock),so I would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie,instead of only acting on it.Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors : being wasted.<br /><br />The worst fail from Smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny.Its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit-coms.Stay far away from this crappy comedy.","finished_norm":["after","see","the","poster","from","the","film","smotheri","know","i","be","about","to","live","on","of","that","intoler","film","experi","which","make","me","want","to","take","my","ey","outhoweveri","feel","a","slight","optim","becaus","the","movi","have","a","solid","cast","which","i","think","it","be","go","to","rescu","the","movieunfortun","that","do","not","happensmoth","be","a","horribl","moviebut","it","be","not","execrablethat","be","the","well","i","can","sai","about","itbr","br","the","screenplai","from","smother","write","by","the","same","gui","from","licens","to","wedsometh","which","explain","thei","have","anyth","but","talent","for","write","movi","be","full","of","cheap","and","predict","humorseriouslyi","do","not","laugh","even","onc","watch","thi","filmbesidesth","solid","cast","i","previous","mention","be","absolut","wastedaft","the","big","numb","of","garbag","she","have","be","involv","in","like","the","monument","atroci","and","execr","becaus","i","sai","sosom","peopl","mai","think","the","career","from","dian","keaton","be","extinguishinghoweverit","be","imposs","for","me","to","forget","the","excel","perform","she","have","bring","in","previou","decadeson","film","like","anni","hall","or","babi","boomon","smothersh","make","her","well","effort","with","her","performancebut","her","charact","be","so","horribli","write","she","cannot","do","anyth","with","itdax","shepard","have","leav","on","me","a","good","impress","with","hi","solid","perform","on","the","film","babi","mama","and","idiocracyhoweverh","doe","what","he","can","with","hi","charactermik","white","conjur","make","a","good","effortbut","he","doe","not","reach","too","far","awayh","be","a","veri","talent","screenwrit","like","he","have","show","on","film","like","the","good","girl","and","school","of","rockso","i","would","have","like","to","see","he","be","on","of","the","screenwrit","from","thi","movieinstead","of","onli","act","on","itliv","tyler","suffer","from","the","same","situat","of","all","the","previous","mention","actor","be","wastedbr","br","the","wrong","fail","from","smother","be","be","absolut","bore","and","unfunnyit","screenplai","be","noth","much","than","a","collect","of","forc","scene","and","situat","we","have","see","on","sitcomsstai","far","awai","from","thi","crappi","comedi"],"filtered":["see","poster","film","smotheri","know","live","intoler","film","experi","make","want","take","ey","outhoweveri","feel","slight","optim","becaus","movi","solid","cast","think","go","rescu","movieunfortun","happensmoth","horribl","moviebut","execrablethat","well","sai","itbr","br","screenplai","smother","write","gui","licens","wedsometh","explain","thei","anyth","talent","write","movi","full","cheap","predict","humorseriouslyi","laugh","even","onc","watch","thi","filmbesidesth","solid","cast","previous","mention","absolut","wastedaft","big","numb","garbag","involv","like","monument","atroci","execr","becaus","sai","sosom","peopl","mai","think","career","dian","keaton","extinguishinghoweverit","imposs","forget","excel","perform","bring","previou","decadeson","film","like","anni","hall","babi","boomon","smothersh","make","well","effort","performancebut","charact","horribli","write","anyth","itdax","shepard","leav","good","impress","hi","solid","perform","film","babi","mama","idiocracyhoweverh","doe","hi","charactermik","white","conjur","make","good","effortbut","doe","reach","far","awayh","veri","talent","screenwrit","like","show","film","like","good","girl","school","rockso","like","see","screenwrit","thi","movieinstead","onli","act","itliv","tyler","suffer","situat","previous","mention","actor","wastedbr","br","wrong","fail","smother","absolut","bore","unfunnyit","screenplai","noth","much","collect","forc","scene","situat","see","sitcomsstai","far","awai","thi","crappi","comedi"],"filtered2":["see","poster","smotheri","know","live","intoler","experi","make","want","take","ey","outhoweveri","feel","slight","optim","becaus","solid","cast","think","go","rescu","movieunfortun","happensmoth","horribl","moviebut","execrablethat","well","itbr","screenplai","smother","write","gui","licens","wedsometh","explain","anyth","talent","write","full","cheap","predict","humorseriouslyi","laugh","even","onc","watch","filmbesidesth","solid","cast","previous","mention","absolut","wastedaft","big","numb","garbag","involv","like","monument","atroci","execr","becaus","sosom","peopl","mai","think","career","dian","keaton","extinguishinghoweverit","imposs","forget","excel","perform","bring","previou","decadeson","like","anni","hall","babi","boomon","smothersh","make","well","effort","performancebut","charact","horribli","write","anyth","itdax","shepard","leav","good","impress","solid","perform","babi","mama","idiocracyhoweverh","doe","charactermik","white","conjur","make","good","effortbut","doe","reach","far","awayh","veri","talent","screenwrit","like","show","like","good","girl","school","rockso","like","see","

{"value":"This 2003 made for TV movie was shown on a women's channel, naturally. As a man, why do I even attempt to watch this? I don't know, but I should have my head examined. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does. He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in. Number one bore is Joyce Hyser as the wife. I couldn't wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you'd ever want to meet. Her looks didn't warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious, only a fool could miss. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, by David DeLuise. Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say victim, was not that good. At first I thought he just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout. Although, as a man, I became enraged when the two women got away with it. Men, beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder. LMN is the channel. Beware. Note: Having watched this a second time by mistake, I am convinced on my initial thoughts. Especially on the writer/director, Simon Gornick. I still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped. Only saving grace in this film is Tembi Locke who doesn't have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise around her. Plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and his vacant stars in it.

{"value":"(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy \"actioner\" (and I use the term loosely) that I've been trying to watch for over a year. I've finally gotten to the end and now I wish I didn't put in the repeated effort.<br /><br />In an effort to save two hours of your life I'm going to tell you he plot- a guy who has the ability to project a long blade out of his arm returns home to see his mom. Things turn ugly after he is beaten up by the mafia boyfriend of an old girl friend. He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. The guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well.<br /><br />Very little is said. no explanation is really given for anything (like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part is all off screen. The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intense and not saying anything, killing people (off screen-most of the action happens off screen). It looks good, is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film. Hell, I would have liked some sense of real character development or back story (all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid). The movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six. If they weren't going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace so it seemed like it was moving too fast. No instead we get the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the hero walking, the hero looking disturbed.Hero with his girl. It really annoyed me since I think this could have been a good film if they had simply done something or had someone actually say something meaningful other than give instructions to \"get this guy\".<br /><br />4 out of 10.

{"value":"This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story,' theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the phoniest, uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen. If the film I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV, I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature. Even as a made-for-TV documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed Infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of this \"The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury\" -- or, uhm, was it \"The Untold Story of Princess Diana\" are the original concert, video and TV footage -- unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights, such as: \"He was a free spirit,\" (really.. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man...) belittle those Freddy testimonials, by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe that shed new and affectionate light into Mercury's complex life and character. And... what up with the Harry Potter-like boarding school segments? How did the interview with the first girl-crush (\"...who now works in a travel agency\") and members of Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, Queen, the band remain unexplored. These filmmakers don't ask a single, provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject, instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend, who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a Sunday night.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","review","of","freddi","mercuri","the","untold","stori","theatric","releas","chicago","int","film","festiv","on","of","the","phoni","uninspir","and","much","tediou","biograph","documentari","i","have","see","if","the","film","i","see","in","a","movi","theater","be","origin","releas","on","tv","i","would","plead","with","it","produc","and","distributor","to","not","fool","a","pai","audienc","with","the","fals","promis","of","a","cinemat","worthi","documentari","featur","even","a","a","madefortv","documentari","the","sentiment","piano","solo","accompani","interviewe","sit","in","front","of","flower","arrang","in","hotel","room","and","the","pompou","pseudoliterari","narrat","ring","much","true","of","a","sleepaped","bed","infomerci","the","onli","redeem","aspect","of","thi","the","untold","stori","of","freddi","mercuri","or","uhm","be","it","the","untold","stori","of","princess","diana","be","the","origin","concert","video","and","tv","footag","unabridg","freddi","mercuri","and","queen","testimoni","interview","with","irrelev","ey","wit","with","insight","such","a","he","be","a","free","spirit","realli","i","think","freddi","mercuri","be","a","compani","man","belittl","that","freddi","testimoni","by","brian","mai","or","montserrat","cabal","that","shed","new","and","affection","light","into","mercuri","complex","life","and","charact","and","what","up","with","the","harri","potterlik","board","school","segment","how","do","the","interview","with","the","girlcrush","who","now","work","in","a","travel","agenc","and","member","of","freddi","school","band","contribut","to","what","i","realli","want","to","know","about","mercuri","vital","mileston","of","hi","person","life","hi","sexual","hi","artist","styl","and","growth","queen","the","band","remain","unexplor","thi","filmmak","do","not","ask","a","singl","provoc","question","nor","do","thei","engag","in","independ","or","visionari","research","of","their","subject","instead","deliv","a","tediou","montag","of","polit","clean","and","vastli","empti","comment","about","a","enigmat","and","brilliant","rock","legend","who","doe","not","deserv","to","be","rememb","by","thi","histori","channel","biographi","your","grandpar","can","doze","off","to","on","a","sundai","night"],"filtered":["thi","review","freddi","mercuri","untold","stori","theatric","releas","chicago","int","film","festiv","phoni","uninspir","much","tediou","biograph","documentari","see","film","see","movi","theater","origin","releas","tv","plead","produc","distributor","fool","pai","audienc","fals","promis","cinemat","worthi","documentari","featur","even","madefortv","documentari","sentiment","piano","solo","accompani","interviewe","sit","front","flower","arrang","hotel","room","pompou","pseudoliterari","narrat","ring","much","true","sleepaped","bed","infomerci","onli","redeem","aspect","thi","untold","stori","freddi","mercuri","uhm","untold","stori","princess","diana","origin","concert","video","tv","footag","unabridg","freddi","mercuri","queen","testimoni","interview","irrelev","ey","wit","insight","free","spirit","realli","think","freddi","mercuri","compani","man","belittl","freddi","testimoni","brian","mai","montserrat","cabal","shed","new","affection","light","mercuri","complex","life","charact","harri","potterlik","board","school","segment","interview","girlcrush","work","travel","agenc","member","freddi","school","band","contribut","realli","want","know","mercuri","vital","mileston","hi","person","life","hi","sexual","hi","artist","styl","growth","queen","band","remain","unexplor","thi","filmmak","ask","singl","provoc","question","thei","engag","independ","visionari","research","subject","instead","deliv","tediou","montag","polit","clean","vastli","empti","comment","enigmat","brilliant","rock","legend","doe","deserv","rememb","thi","histori","channel","biographi","grandpar","doze","sundai","night"],"filtered2":["review","freddi","mercuri","untold","stori","theatric","releas","chicago","int","festiv","phoni","uninspir","tediou","biograph","documentari","see","see","theater","origin","releas","tv","plead","produc","distributor","fool","pai","audienc","fals","promis","cinemat","worthi","documentari","featur","even","madefortv","documentari","sentiment","piano","solo","accompani","interviewe","sit","front","flower","arrang","hotel","room","pompou","pseudoliterari","narrat","ring","true","sleepaped","bed","infomerci","onli","redeem","aspect","untold","stori","freddi","mercuri","uhm","untold","stori","princess","diana","origin","concert","video","tv","footag","unabridg","freddi","mercuri","queen","testimoni","interview","irrelev","ey","wit","insight","free","spirit","realli","think","freddi","mercuri","compani","man","belittl","freddi","testimoni","brian","mai","montserrat","cabal","shed","new","affection","light","mercuri","complex","life","charact","harri","potterlik","board","school","segment","interview","girlcrush","work","travel","agenc","member","freddi","s

{"value":"The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of \"Hollywood conventions\". Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a \"Hollywood cliché\". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the \"Hollywood convention\" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isn't it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.","finished_norm":["the","treasur","island","dvd","should","be","requir","view","in","ani","film","product","cours","it","a","textbook","exampl","of","how","not","to","make","a","movi","watch","the","movi","and","then","listen","to","the","writerdirector","commentari","demonstr","graphic","the","vast","chasm","between","what","he","know","about","the","charact","and","what","he","commun","to","hi","audienc","about","them","call","me","oldfashion","but","i","think","of","movi","a","a","mean","of","commun","and","commun","be","not","complet","if","the","audienc","doe","not","know","what","the","hell","the","director","be","talk","about","the","director","avow","purpos","be","to","make","a","movi","void","of","hollywood","convent","among","that","convent","ala","be","consist","of","charact","and","clariti","of","concept","the","director","himself","realiz","that","audienc","often","do","not","understand","point","where","he","have","purpos","avoid","a","hollywood","cliché","howev","he","never","seem","to","grasp","the","idea","that","cliché","exist","for","a","reason","thei","be","shorthand","for","convei","complex","idea","quickli","and","clearli","it","fine","to","avoid","them","but","thei","ne","to","be","replac","with","some","other","wai","of","commun","the","same","idea","not","simpli","elimin","the","film","be","build","on","a","intrigu","premis","rich","with","potenti","two","puppet","be","assign","to","fabric","a","person","and","background","for","a","unidentifi","corps","that","be","to","be","us","in","a","disinform","mission","in","the","close","dai","of","wwii","soon","each","begin","to","popul","their","person","fantasi","with","the","charact","and","their","invent","becom","increasingli","real","to","them","someon","with","littl","disdain","for","the","hollywood","convent","of","tradit","storytel","can","creat","a","wonder","film","with","thi","idea","thi","film","certainli","be","not","it","the","puppet","do","everyth","thei","can","to","bring","consist","to","thi","charact","but","thei","be","all","too","often","defeat","by","the","daze","and","confus","script","in","particular","i","be","becom","increasingli","impress","by","gonzo","who","plai","the","live","corps","in","a","numb","of","muppet","film","he","alwai","stand","out","a","a","veri","charismat","puppet"],"filtered":["treasur","island","dvd","requir","view","ani","film","product","cours","textbook","exampl","make","movi","watch","movi","listen","writerdirector","commentari","demonstr","graphic","vast","chasm","know","charact","commun","hi","audienc","call","oldfashion","think","movi","mean","commun","commun","complet","audienc","doe","know","hell","director","talk","director","avow","purpos","make","movi","void","hollywood","convent","among","convent","ala","consist","charact","clariti","concept","director","realiz","audienc","often","understand","point","purpos","avoid","hollywood","cliché","howev","never","seem","grasp","idea","cliché","exist","reason","thei","shorthand","convei","complex","idea","quickli","clearli","fine","avoid","thei","ne","replac","wai","commun","idea","simpli","elimin","film","build","intrigu","premis","rich","potenti","two","puppet","assign","fabric","person","background","unidentifi","corps","us","disinform","mission","close","dai","wwii","soon","begin","popul","person","fantasi","charact","invent","becom","increasingli","real","someon","littl","disdain","hollywood","convent","tradit","storytel","creat","wonder","film","thi","idea","thi","film","certainli","puppet","everyth","thei","bring","consist","thi","charact","thei","often","defeat","daze","confus","script","particular","becom","increasingli","impress","gonzo","plai","live","corps","numb","muppet","film","alwai","stand","veri","charismat","puppet"],"filtered2":["treasur","island","dvd","requir","view","ani","product","cours","textbook","exampl","make","watch","listen","writerdirector","commentari","demonstr","graphic","vast","chasm","know","charact","commun","audienc","call","oldfashion","think","mean","commun","commun","complet","audienc","doe","know","hell","director","talk","director","avow","purpos","make","void","hollywood","convent","among","convent","ala","consist","charact","clariti","concept","director","realiz","audienc","often","understand","point","purpos","avoid","hollywood","cliché","howev","never","seem","grasp","idea","cliché","exist","reason","shorthand","convei","complex","idea","quickli","clearli","fine","avoid","ne","replac","wai","commun","idea","simpli","elimin","build","intrigu","premis","rich","potenti","two","puppet","assign","fabric","person","background","unidentifi","corps","us","disinform","mission","close","dai","wwii","soon","begin","popul","person","fantasi","charact","invent","becom","increasingli","real","someon","littl","disdain","hollywood","convent","tradit","storytel","creat","wonder","idea","certainli","puppet","everyth","bring","consist","charact","often","defeat","daze","confus","script","particular","bec

{"value":"And it falls squarely into the category of \"awesomely bad\" - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. I was at the sci fi movie festival and all I remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. Other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature, and I felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up, obviously to gauge the audience's reaction. What he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a \"serious\" anime movie, I think it was \"sky blue\", the audience was in a sombre mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. I will bullet point the worst parts;<br /><br />Script: The funniest, and worst part of this movie, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. Rubbish, but eminently laughable.<br /><br />Animation: Poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (I know I can!), then watch out for the montage where she \"trasforms\" from a Swedish peasant girl into LADY DEATH!!!<br /><br />Characters: So one-dimensional its painful, there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain), then slip this movie into the DVD and get in a \"mystery science theatre 3000\" mindset. There is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it, and its not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE. It could possible be even more boring to watch solo than \"New World\" with Colin Farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.","finished_norm":["and","it","fall","squar","into","the","categori","of","awesom","bad","ie","a","movi","drink","student","would","rend","to","get","a","kick","out","of","i","be","at","the","sci","fi","movi","festiv","and","all","i","rememb","be","a","wave","after","wave","of","hyster","laughter","a","thi","movi","premier","other","critiqu","will","well","describ","thi","movi","fecal","natur","and","i","feel","ohsobad","at","the","poor","gui","from","the","product","compani","who","have","turn","up","obvious","to","gaug","the","audienc","reaction","what","he","get","be","the","sci","fi","equival","of","a","drunken","student","audienc","and","after","a","seriou","anim","movi","i","think","it","be","sky","blue","the","audienc","be","in","a","sombr","mood","and","then","thi","movi","open","and","within","second","everyon","in","the","room","be","roll","in","the","isl","i","will","bullet","point","the","wrong","partsbr","br","script","the","funni","and","wrong","part","of","thi","movi","it","clunk","along","a","linear","and","predict","road","with","the","occasion","illthoughtout","asid","rubbish","but","emin","laughablebr","br","anim","poorli","do","and","put","togeth","if","you","can","put","up","with","drab","background","and","gradual","skimpi","costum","for","the","heroin","i","know","i","can","then","watch","out","for","the","montag","where","she","trasform","from","a","swedish","peasant","girl","into","ladi","deathbr","br","charact","so","onedimension","it","pain","there","be","a","brief","backstori","with","sidesplit","line","of","dialogu","and","littl","light","be","shine","on","the","actual","motiv","behind","some","of","the","main","charactersbr","br","so","in","a","nutshel","if","you","have","get","a","captiv","audienc","and","a","few","beverag","lie","around","try","and","make","sure","thei","re","alcohol","to","eas","the","pain","then","slip","thi","movi","into","the","dvd","and","get","in","a","mysteri","scienc","theatr","mindset","there","be","no","other","motiv","to","watch","thi","movi","other","than","to","laugh","at","it","and","it","not","mean","to","be","a","comedi","do","not","watch","thi","movi","alon","it","can","possibl","be","even","much","bore","to","watch","solo","than","new","world","with","colin","farrel","a","you","wo","not","be","abl","to","have","a","laugh","at","the","ridicul","with","a","friend","or","two"],"filtered":["fall","squar","categori","awesom","bad","ie","movi","drink","student","rend","get","kick","sci","fi","movi","festiv","rememb","wave","wave","hyster","laughter","thi","movi","premier","critiqu","well","describ","thi","movi","fecal","natur","feel","ohsobad","poor","gui","product","compani","turn","obvious","gaug","audienc","reaction","get","sci","fi","equival","drunken","student","audienc","seriou","anim","movi","think","sky","blue","audienc","sombr","mood","thi","movi","open","within","second","everyon","room","roll","isl","bullet","point","wrong","partsbr","br","script","funni","wrong","part","thi","movi","clunk","along","linear","predict","road","occasion","illthoughtout","asid","rubbish","emin","laughablebr","br","anim","poorli","put","togeth","put","drab","background","gradual","skimpi","costum","heroin","know","watch","montag","trasform","swedish","peasant","girl","ladi","deathbr","br","charact","onedimension","pain","brief","backstori","sidesplit","line","dialogu","littl","light","shine","actual","motiv","behind","main","charactersbr","br","nutshel","get","captiv","audienc","beverag","lie","around","try","make","sure","thei","re","alcohol","eas","pain","slip","thi","movi","dvd","get","mysteri","scienc","theatr","mindset","motiv","watch","thi","movi","laugh","mean","comedi","watch","thi","movi","alon","possibl","even","much","bore","watch","solo","new","world","colin","farrel","wo","abl","laugh","ridicul","friend","two"],"filtered2":["fall","squar","categori","awesom","bad","ie","drink","student","rend","get","kick","sci","fi","festiv","rememb","wave","wave","hyster","laughter","premier","critiqu","well","describ","fecal","natur","feel","ohsobad","poor","gui","product","compani","turn","obvious","gaug","audienc","reaction","get","sci","fi","equival","drunken","student","audienc","seriou","anim","think","sky","blue","audienc","sombr","mood","open","within","second","everyon","room","roll","isl","bullet","point","wrong","partsbr","script","funni","wrong","part","clunk","along","linear","predict","road","occasion","illthoughtout","asid","rubbish","emin","laughablebr","anim","poorli","put","togeth","put","drab","background","gradual","skimpi","costum","heroin","know","watch","montag","trasform","swedish","peasant","girl","ladi","deathbr","charact","onedimension","pain","brief","backstori","sidesplit","line","dialogu","littl","light","shine","actual","motiv","behind","main","charactersbr","nutshel","get","captiv","audienc","beverag","lie","around","try","make","sure","re","alcohol","eas","pain","slip","dvd","get","mysteri","scienc","theatr","mindset","moti

{"value":"Some gorehound-friends recommended \"Live Feed\" to me, and basically I can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze, but it is of course not a very good film. More than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre (and that includes the role models \"Hostel\" and \"Saw\") with its sick & twisted make-up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co-eds tried up, suffering and begging for their lives. There's no actual plot to describe. Five utterly brainless twenty-something friends take a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than that I don't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to Cancun. They're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market. The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. A simply apology clearly doesn't suffice, as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture. One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat; yikes. \"Live Feed\" is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook, even if you're used to watching independent fan-boy trash cinema like this. The fat bloke depicted on the cover, an oriental S&M executioner, is admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented of the whole bunch, because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time. I wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth, but hey, if you like loud & hideous metal music, nauseating torture footage and dim-witted losers, go right ahead and

{"value":"Margret Laurence probably didn't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film, let alone the Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dare, anyone?), and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc, etc.) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new, and the carnage (so to speak) along the way.<br /><br />While the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it isn't really a plot kind-of storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film. Hagar's defiance (for the sake of defiance) was not there. Bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed, and Hagar's father could have been played more \"traditionally\", so to speak. If the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals, the film would drive the point straight to home.<br /><br />Along the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic produce, and other modernizations? Are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points (e.g., the Muslim girlfriend and the Native people). Hagar and co. are everything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see that in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically-correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems like throwing punches below the intellect.<br /><br />There is also the audience. It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable. Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at, or with, Hagar. These people are frustrated and are full of angst, and all we do is to laugh at them. I don't think it did Hagar and other folks in her situation any

{"value":"As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my \"to rent\" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want \"fair\" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie.

{"value":"I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (Chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example). So this year was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me. I've laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even enjoyed him in Dude Where's My Car?. But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible. Nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; he sure as hell can't act.<br /><br />I'm curious as to who the writers were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremly funny (The Lord of the Rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show), but this year was completly different. Did anyone understand Timberlake's comments regarding Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson (\"They're staring in a movie together, but have never met! Here they are...\") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just went into their lame dialogue, never making a reference to the \"joke\" by Timberlake. And Seann was completly wasted as a talent, not even causing me to smile, yet alone laugh. And what was the point of Harrison Ford's one-liners? Did they make ANY sense to anyone? Perhaps the MTV writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the President from Air Force One. I'm baffled. And would someone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old does he THINK he is? The guy looks 30, trying to act 19 again....give it up, show some class (like in your best actor academy award speech) and act your age!<br /><br />I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the speech by Gollam for Best Visual Performance. This was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening.","finished_norm":["i","usual","check","out","the","mtv","movi","award","to","watch","a","witti","entertain","show","that","deliv","a","uniqu","award","show","chewbacca","win","a","lifetim","achiev","award","a","exampl","so","thi","year","be","no","differ","while","i","be","not","a","fan","of","justin","timberlak","seann","william","scott","have","alwai","be","funnyalbiet","stupidto","me","i","have","laugh","at","stiffler","in","both","american","pie","movi","and","even","enjoi","him","in","dude","where","my","car","but","the","mtv","movi","award","be","simpli","horribl","noth","be","coherr","humor","or","entertain","justin","timberlak","should","stick","to","sing","and","danc","he","sure","a","hell","ca","not","actbr","br","i","be","curiou","a","to","who","the","writer","be","for","thi","show","last","year","perform","by","jack","black","and","sarah","michel","gellar","be","extremli","funni","the","lord","of","the","ring","parodi","alon","be","worth","watch","the","entir","show","but","thi","year","be","completli","differ","do","anyon","understand","timberlak","comment","regard","luke","wilson","and","kate","hudson","thei","re","stare","in","a","movi","togeth","but","have","never","meet","here","thei","be","where","be","the","joke","kate","and","luke","just","go","into","their","lame","dialogu","never","make","a","refer","to","the","joke","by","timberlak","and","seann","be","completli","wast","a","a","talent","not","even","caus","me","to","smile","yet","alon","laugh","and","what","be","the","point","of","harrison","ford","onelin","do","thei","make","ani","sens","to","anyon","perhap","the","mtv","writer","figur","the","young","viewer","would","onli","know","the","ag","ford","a","han","solo","indiania","jone","or","the","presid","from","air","forc","on","i","be","baffl","and","would","someon","tell","me","the","deal","with","adrian","brodi","how","old","be","thi","gui","and","how","old","doe","he","think","he","be","the","gui","look","try","to","act","againg","it","up","show","some","class","like","in","your","well","actor","academi","award","speech","and","act","your","agebr","br","i","give","thi","show","star","out","of","simpli","becaus","of","the","speech","by","gollam","for","well","visual","perform","thi","be","veri","creativ","extrem","good","do","and","caus","the","onli","genuin","laugh","of","the","entir","even"],"filtered":["usual","check","mtv","movi","award","watch","witti","entertain","show","deliv","uniqu","award","show","chewbacca","win","lifetim","achiev","award","exampl","thi","year","differ","fan","justin","timberlak","seann","william","scott","alwai","funnyalbiet","stupidto","laugh","stiffler","american","pie","movi","even","enjoi","dude","car","mtv","movi","award","simpli","horribl","noth","coherr","humor","entertain","justin","timberlak","stick","sing","danc","sure","hell","ca","actbr","br","curiou","writer","thi","show","last","year","perform","jack","black","sarah","michel","gellar","extremli","funni","lord","ring","parodi","alon","worth","watch","entir","show","thi","year","completli","differ","anyon","understand","timberlak","comment","regard","luke","wilson","kate","hudson","thei","re","stare","movi","togeth","never","meet","thei","joke","kate","luke","go","lame","dialogu","never","make","refer","joke","timberlak","seann","completli","wast","talent","even","caus","smile","yet","alon","laugh","point","harrison","ford","onelin","thei","make","ani","sens","anyon","perhap","mtv","writer","figur","young","viewer","onli","know","ag","ford","han","solo","indiania","jone","presid","air","forc","baffl","someon","tell","deal","adrian","brodi","old","thi","gui","old","doe","think","gui","look","try","act","againg","show","class","like","well","actor","academi","award","speech","act","agebr","br","give","thi","show","star","simpli","becaus","speech","gollam","well","visual","perform","thi","veri","creativ","extrem","good","caus","onli","genuin","laugh","entir","even"],"filtered2":["usual","check","mtv","award","watch","witti","entertain","show","deliv","uniqu","award","show","chewbacca","win","lifetim","achiev","award","exampl","year","differ","fan","justin","timberlak","seann","william","scott","alwai","funnyalbiet","stupidto","laugh","stiffler","american","pie","even","enjoi","dude","car","mtv","award","simpli","horribl","noth","coherr","humor","entertain","justin","timberlak","stick","sing","danc","sure","hell","ca","actbr","curiou","writer","show","last","year","perform","jack","black","sarah","michel","gellar","extremli","funni","lord","ring","parodi","alon","worth","watch","entir","show","year","completli","differ","anyon","understand","timberlak","comment","regard","luke","wilson","kate","hudson","re","stare","togeth","never","meet","joke","kate","luke","go","lame","dialogu","never","make","refer","joke","timberlak","seann","completli","wast","talent","even","caus","smile","yet","alon","laugh","point","harrison","ford","onelin","make","ani","sens","anyon","perhap","mtv","writer",

{"value":"GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium/Netherlands 2005).<br /><br />The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all. We barely know anything about her background or her motivations. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?<br /><br />I almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. I'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding (in large part from publicly financed funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak off. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal. None whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, \"I want to do something from a woman's point of view\". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.<br /><br />To make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film. I cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried directing Maria Kraakman: \"Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness\". A perfect cure for insomnia.

{"value":"I passed this one on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something. The other night it was on one of the movie channels, and I tuned in. I missed nothing.<br /><br />I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that. Given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />The lead character starts the movie in classic \"I don't know how to start my movie\" style, with a long, tiresome monologue about how he doesn't want to get sued. It's not funny. It's not even remotely funny. Others have commented on the \"San Franclisco\" bit; ok, a small chuckle the first time he says it. Then he grinds it into the ground, smiling at the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written. Get over yourself. In fact, I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film. Don't assume familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is _earned_, much like respect.<br /><br />From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp. I didn't realize he's Jewish; it's a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this \"Jewish humor\". It's just unfunny humor. Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you have a knack for the comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity.<br /><br />If one of the bits I had seen had worked, I might have stuck around. But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, then listing them for five long minutes, doesn't make a great movie.<br /><br />This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of \"Office Space\".

{"value":"When Ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny, witty, well directed and original. If one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider - has Ritchie been found out? Is he really that talented? Does he really have any genuine original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? After watching Revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? What happened to his great sense of humour? Where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? Revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. However, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. Its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. So what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces.<br /><br />Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty.<br /><br />Revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur. However, it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve.","finished_norm":["when","ritchi","burst","on","to","movi","scene","hi","film","be","hail","a","funni","witti","good","direct","and","origin","if","on","can","compar","the","hyp","he","have","gener","with","hi","two","attempt","and","the","almost","univers","loath","hi","last","two","out","have","creat","on","should","consid","have","ritchi","be","find","out","be","he","realli","that","talent","doe","he","realli","have","ani","genuin","origin","idea","or","be","he","simpli","a","pretenti","and","egotist","director","who","realli","want","to","be","fincher","tarantino","and","leon","all","roll","into","on","coloss","and","disorganis","heap","after","watch","revolv","on","can","be","excus","for","think","be","do","it","all","go","wrong","what","happen","to","hi","great","sens","of","humour","where","do","he","get","all","thi","mix","and","convolut","idea","from","revolv","try","to","be","clever","philosoph","and","succinct","it","try","to","be","a","intellig","psychoanalysi","it","try","to","be","a","intric","and","complic","thriller","ritchi","doe","make","a","gargantuan","effort","to","fulfil","all","thi","mani","object","and","invest","great","chunk","of","a","script","into","existenti","muse","and","numer","plot","twist","howev","in","the","end","all","it","serv","be","to","construct","a","sever","disjoint","unstructur","and","ultim","unfriendli","film","to","the","audienc","it","plagiar","be","so","sin","and","blatant","that","although","ritchi","doe","at","littl","attempt","to","give","hi","own","spin","he","should","be","punish","for","even","try","to","pass","it","off","a","hi","own","work","so","what","the","audienc","get","ultim","be","a","terribl","screenplai","intertwin","with","mani","pretenti","onelin","and","clumsi","setpiecesbr","br","revolv","be","ultim","a","unorigin","and","bland","movi","that","have","steal","countless","theme","from","masterpiec","like","fight","club","usual","suspect","and","pulp","fiction","it","aim","high","but","inevit","shot","blank","aplentybr","br","revolv","deserv","to","be","lambast","it","be","a","truli","poor","film","masquerad","a","a","wannab","masterpiec","from","a","wannab","auteur","howev","it","fall","flat","on","it","farcic","face","and","just","fail","at","everyth","it","want","to","be","and","achiev"],"filtered":["ritchi","burst","movi","scene","hi","film","hail","funni","witti","good","direct","origin","compar","hyp","gener","hi","two","attempt","almost","univers","loath","hi","last","two","creat","consid","ritchi","find","realli","talent","doe","realli","ani","genuin","origin","idea","simpli","pretenti","egotist","director","realli","want","fincher","tarantino","leon","roll","coloss","disorganis","heap","watch","revolv","excus","think","go","wrong","happen","hi","great","sens","humour","get","thi","mix","convolut","idea","revolv","try","clever","philosoph","succinct","try","intellig","psychoanalysi","try","intric","complic","thriller","ritchi","doe","make","gargantuan","effort","fulfil","thi","mani","object","invest","great","chunk","script","existenti","muse","numer","plot","twist","howev","end","serv","construct","sever","disjoint","unstructur","ultim","unfriendli","film","audienc","plagiar","sin","blatant","although","ritchi","doe","littl","attempt","give","hi","spin","punish","even","try","pass","hi","work","audienc","get","ultim","terribl","screenplai","intertwin","mani","pretenti","onelin","clumsi","setpiecesbr","br","revolv","ultim","unorigin","bland","movi","steal","countless","theme","masterpiec","like","fight","club","usual","suspect","pulp","fiction","aim","high","inevit","shot","blank","aplentybr","br","revolv","deserv","lambast","truli","poor","film","masquerad","wannab","masterpiec","wannab","auteur","howev","fall","flat","farcic","face","fail","everyth","want","achiev"],"filtered2":["ritchi","burst","scene","hail","funni","witti","good","direct","origin","compar","hyp","gener","two","attempt","almost","univers","loath","last","two","creat","consid","ritchi","find","realli","talent","doe","realli","ani","genuin","origin","idea","simpli","pretenti","egotist","director","realli","want","fincher","tarantino","leon","roll","coloss","disorganis","heap","watch","revolv","excus","think","go","wrong","happen","great","sens","humour","get","mix","convolut","idea","revolv","try","clever","philosoph","succinct","try","intellig","psychoanalysi","try","intric","complic","thriller","ritchi","doe","make","gargantuan","effort","fulfil","mani","object","invest","great","chunk","script","existenti","muse","numer","plot","twist","howev","end","serv","construct","sever","disjoint","unstructur","ultim","unfriendli","audienc","plagiar","sin","blatant","although","ritchi","doe","littl","attempt","give","spin","punish","even","try","pass","work","audienc","get","ultim","terribl","screenplai","intertwin","mani","pretenti","onelin","clumsi","setpiecesbr","revolv","ultim","unorigin","bland","steal","countless","theme","masterpiec","like","fight","club","

{"value":"I hate this movie. I hate the show. i hate just about everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everyone's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big. WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING???!!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like Jane Hudson from \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\". i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one, barely 30 seconds of the show, and i managed to survive about half an hour of 'Battle of the Bands'. How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, i have no clue. days before the movie premiere on Nick, most of the teen girl actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are. first off, they didn;t trick me, and second of all, nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing, because i don't see how anyone could find this show/movie entertaining. the music is just awful. nat's singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movie/TV show character EVER. he's not funny, he's annoying, he's really weird, and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy's lucky if he ever manages to get laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist!! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex's cousin jesse Draper (they mustve had some budget problem). Their father is not single, he's married to Polly Draper, but she doesn't appear on the show, making it seem the Wolff's are mom-less. Rosalina doesn't exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell ya, the Naked Brothers are gonna be in some deep sh** when their \"fans\" find out the whole thing is staged.

{"value":"Typical Troma-trash, this smutty 80's flick is considered one of the \"highlights\" of Lloyd Kaufman's notorious production studio, alongside \"The Toxic Avenger\" released one year earlier. \"The Toxic Avenger\" is far superior if you ask me, but this demented splatter-flick is nevertheless endurable as well; just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly aren't lying. The safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard, to say the least (even Homer Simpson never was this nonchalant) and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school. The first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd, who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities, but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than TWO microwave ovens in his house! Oh, the humanity! Shortly after, however, the nuclear leaks also affect the school's weed plantation and thing really start to get messy. After smoking a joint at a party, the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. \"Class of Nuke 'em High\" is bottom-of-the-barrel horror film-making, with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless. If you enjoy watching faces melting away, getting crushed or splitting in half, this is definitely a must-see! Unlike the aforementioned \"The Toxic Avenger\", this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens, like for example when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what's wrong with their hormones. The crude humor isn't as effective as in \"Toxic Avenger\" and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish.

Me, personally, I'm tempted to opt for the latter because I didn't bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80's slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butchering people. Wrong! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling; who's obsessed with Christmas, works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment. Harry's issues all started when he witnessed Santa  his daddy in a costume obviously  caress his mommy's naked legs at a tenderly young age. After that he just developed into a social outcast, much to the irritation of his younger brother, who's bound to snap one (holi)day. I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie, but did it really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed, but this movie doesn't even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists (with the notable exception of the finale, I must admit). Also, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children! He doesn't and exclusively kills misbehaving adults. How are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa doesn't even commit one miserable child murder?

{"value":"There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was... well, just awful.<br /><br />Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.<br /><br />Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn't going to spy this film. So, what was the studio thinking?<br /><br />The Cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York Accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to sneak in his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said \"as long as you don't say fahklempt', you can keep the accents.\" Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make-up, or dialogue.<br /><br />The jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: \"dirty ho\", everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn't have helped.<br /><br />The same folks who created 'Whoville', clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in 'Cat'. The sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and Myers.<br /><br />There was some fun to be had with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.<br /><br />Call the SPCA.

{"value":"All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop. Many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. Yet really, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would.<br /><br />Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. The action is poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. Nothing really to write home about.<br /><br />As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are 'bad', you revel in that fact. This film, however, is a void. It's nothing.<br /><br />Furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like 'Go' (overall, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'.<br /><br />On a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by 'Loaded' is vile.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.","finished_norm":["all","i","can","think","of","while","watch","thi","movi","be","bgrade","slop","mani","have","speak","about","it","redeem","qualiti","be","how","thi","film","portrai","such","a","realist","represent","of","the","effect","of","drug","and","a","individu","and","their","subsequ","spiral","into","a","self","perpetu","state","of","unfortun","event","yet","realli","the","techniqu","us","a","mani","have","alreadi","mention","be","overus","and","thu","unconvinc","and","irrelev","to","the","film","a","a","wholebr","br","a","far","a","the","plot","be","concern","it","be","lacklustr","unimagin","implaus","and","convolut","you","can","read","much","other","report","on","thi","film","and","thei","will","sai","pretti","much","the","same","a","i","wouldbr","br","grant","some","of","the","actor","and","actress","be","attract","but","when","confront","with","such","bore","action","look","can","onli","carri","a","film","so","far","the","action","be","poor","and","intermitt","a","few","punch","throw","here","and","there","and","a","final","gunfight","toward","the","end","noth","realli","to","write","home","aboutbr","br","a","other","have","sai","bad","movi","be","great","to","watch","for","the","veri","reason","that","thei","be","bad","you","revel","in","that","fact","thi","film","howev","be","a","void","it","nothingbr","br","furthermor","if","on","be","realli","in","ne","of","a","educ","movi","to","scare","peopl","awai","from","drug","us","then","i","would","serious","recommend","ani","numb","of","other","movi","out","there","that","board","such","issu","in","a","much","much","effect","wai","requiem","for","a","dream","trainspot","fear","and","loath","in","la","vega","and","candi","be","just","a","few","exampl","though","on","should","conjur","check","out","some","much","lightheart","film","on","the","same","subject","like","go","overal","both","seriou","and","funni","and","halfbakedbr","br","on","a","final","note","the","on","possibli","redeem","line","in","thi","movi","deliv","by","vinni","jone","be","steal","from","lock","stock","and","two","smokl","barrel","to","think","that","a","bite","of","that","great","movi","have","be","taint","by","load","be","vilebr","br","overal","i","strongli","suggest","that","you","save","you","monei","and","your","time","by","not","see","thi","movi"],"filtered":["think","watch","thi","movi","bgrade","slop","mani","speak","redeem","qualiti","thi","film","portrai","realist","represent","effect","drug","individu","subsequ","spiral","self","perpetu","state","unfortun","event","yet","realli","techniqu","us","mani","alreadi","mention","overus","thu","unconvinc","irrelev","film","wholebr","br","far","plot","concern","lacklustr","unimagin","implaus","convolut","read","much","report","thi","film","thei","sai","pretti","much","wouldbr","br","grant","actor","actress","attract","confront","bore","action","look","onli","carri","film","far","action","poor","intermitt","punch","throw","final","gunfight","toward","end","noth","realli","write","home","aboutbr","br","sai","bad","movi","great","watch","veri","reason","thei","bad","revel","fact","thi","film","howev","void","nothingbr","br","furthermor","realli","ne","educ","movi","scare","peopl","awai","drug","us","serious","recommend","ani","numb","movi","board","issu","much","much","effect","wai","requiem","dream","trainspot","fear","loath","la","vega","candi","exampl","though","conjur","check","much","lightheart","film","subject","like","go","overal","seriou","funni","halfbakedbr","br","final","note","possibli","redeem","line","thi","movi","deliv","vinni","jone","steal","lock","stock","two","smokl","barrel","think","bite","great","movi","taint","load","vilebr","br","overal","strongli","suggest","save","monei","time","see","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["think","watch","bgrade","slop","mani","speak","redeem","qualiti","portrai","realist","represent","effect","drug","individu","subsequ","spiral","self","perpetu","state","unfortun","event","yet","realli","techniqu","us","mani","alreadi","mention","overus","thu","unconvinc","irrelev","wholebr","far","plot","concern","lacklustr","unimagin","implaus","convolut","read","report","pretti","wouldbr","grant","actor","actress","attract","confront","bore","action","look","onli","carri","far","action","poor","intermitt","punch","throw","final","gunfight","toward","end","noth","realli","write","home","aboutbr","bad","great","watch","veri","reason","bad","revel","fact","howev","void","nothingbr","furthermor","realli","ne","educ","scare","peopl","awai","drug","us","serious","recommend","ani","numb","board","issu","effect","wai","requiem","dream","trainspot","fear","loath","la","vega","candi","exampl","though","conjur","check","lightheart","subject","like","go","overal","seriou","funni","halfbakedbr","final","note","possibli","redeem","line","deliv","vinni","jone","steal","lock","stock","two","smokl","barrel","think","bite","great","taint","load","vilebr","overal","strongli","suggest","save","monei","time

{"value":"I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception, it may have been a brilliant horror/thriller movie.<br /><br />Beginning on Halloween night 1968, 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again.<br /><br />From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the movie, thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow.<br /><br />For the horror/thriller enthusiast, there is a severe lack of blood/gore compared to modern day films although I am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age. A happier medium could have been found.<br /><br />From a half hour into the movie, not one scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.<br /><br />A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive would be the character of Michael's doctor, who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead.<br /><br />However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim.<br /><br />It is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day, but from other horror/thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent, the 90s, it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film.<br /><br />I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s.

{"value":"I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said \"Watch it again, it's better\". So I did. And to my surprise, it was WORSE on the second time! There's a word limit, so I'm going to get the ball rolling here.<br /><br />-The bombing scenes were all so stupid. Why on earth would anyone WAIT to trigger the explosion??? -None of the characters here are even remotely likable. Not on the first time, not even the second.<br /><br />-Oh, and last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single gun shot, nor can a fire THAT huge be put out with a tiny fire extinguisher... did the above 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie??? -The camera is so shaky, I can barely tell what is going on. That opening scene with the robot had my stomach off-put, the rest of the movie was not much better.<br /><br />-The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from \"The Boondock Saints\") would roll their eyes, it was so stupid. First off, why did the guy plant his gun where one person had gotten shot? Furthermore, why would he spend THAT much time cleaning the bullets, reloading, aiming and NOT get shot, when there was so much chaos going on around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back?????? Huh????? Are the soldiers... gay...??? I didn't mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, that scene was so ridiculous.<br /><br />-Too long for its own good, yet too short for the amount of material crammed into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better. Looks like she is wrong- the movie is full of superfluous action scenes thrown in there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know Watchmen is longer at 163 minutes, but at least that movie didn't drag. This movie, on the other hand, does, and for it, feels longer.<br /><br />The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favour, just skip this, and don't give into the

{"value":"I saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and I hadn't seen an Almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together don't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.<br /><br />Or so I thought. Then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie's hidden little details, like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.<br /><br />Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film--you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention, something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange, off-beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies, and Almodovar doesn't seem to be using them to make any kind of point. What is the significance, for example, of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film? Why is that even in there? Just to surprise us?<br /><br />There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And that's it, that's the only entertaining moment. The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than self-indulgent trickery for a movie to be
