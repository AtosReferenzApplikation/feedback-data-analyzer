{"value":"And that is the only reason I posses this DVD. Now I haven't seen the first Nemesis film, but I did check the info out of it and I here by say: What? Why? Because in the first film Alex was male. But then again the first one was set in the future, so maybe this Alex is brand new one and the scientist just happened to make Alex female this time. Who knows, at least it wasn't addressed in the film in any way.<br /><br />Here's a quick summary of the plot: Alex, still a baby then (or how ever you want, as it was, is, in the future) escapes with her mom using a special time vessel and ends up in the 80's Africa. There mommy gets killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in a African tribe. Then the tribe gets slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and Alex then runs and hides and finally she kills the cyborg. So there. Does sound familiar, doesn't it?.<br /><br />Terminator isn't the only film being ripped here, Predator gets its fair share too and I think the first Fly movie, the Vincent Price one, gets special nomination for giving a solid base to build up your cyborgs head from.<br /><br />Lets see, what else? Okay, the film was quite standard small budget flick, but it did have bad special effects for a mid 90's film. It would have looked okay for a 80's flick how ever. Biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is barely interested. Nemesis 2 isn't the crappiest piece of cinema I've had pleasure (?) to watch but it does come damn close.<br /><br />I won't say a thing about acting, because let's be honest here: did anyone expect Oscar worthy performances here? Oh well... at least I did find Sue Price hot in that amazonian warrior way.<br /><br />A \"real\" movie rating: 2/10 There isn't a lot of pros about the over all quality. And despite of the very basic plot the film it self makes very little sense.<br /><br />A camp movie rating: 4/10 I did get occasional laughs from the sheer badness of the film, so it does have small merits in it.","finished_norm":["and","that","be","the","onli","reason","i","poss","thi","dvd","now","i","have","not","see","the","nemesi","film","but","i","do","check","the","info","out","of","it","and","i","here","by","sai","what","why","becaus","in","the","film","alex","be","male","but","then","again","the","on","be","set","in","the","futur","so","mayb","thi","alex","be","brand","new","on","and","the","scientist","just","happen","to","make","alex","femal","thi","time","who","know","at","littl","it","be","not","address","in","the","film","in","ani","waybr","br","here","a","quick","summari","of","the","plot","alex","still","a","babi","then","or","how","ever","you","want","a","it","be","be","in","the","futur","escap","with","her","mom","us","a","special","time","vessel","and","end","up","in","the","africa","there","mommi","get","kill","and","alex","sue","price","grow","up","in","a","african","tribe","then","the","tribe","get","slaughter","by","a","cyborg","from","the","futur","and","alex","then","run","and","hide","and","final","she","kill","the","cyborg","so","there","doe","sound","familiar","doe","not","itbr","br","termin","be","not","the","onli","film","be","rip","here","predat","get","it","fair","share","too","and","i","think","the","fly","movi","the","vincent","price","on","get","special","nomin","for","give","a","solid","base","to","build","up","your","cyborg","head","frombr","br","let","see","what","els","okai","the","film","be","quit","standard","small","budget","flick","but","it","do","have","bad","special","effect","for","a","mid","film","it","would","have","look","okai","for","a","flick","how","ever","big","problem","be","the","plot","thing","just","happen","and","the","viewer","be","bare","interest","nemesi","be","not","the","crappi","piec","of","cinema","i","have","have","pleasur","to","watch","but","it","doe","come","damn","closebr","br","i","wo","not","sai","a","thing","about","act","becaus","let","be","honest","here","do","anyon","expect","oscar","worthi","perform","here","oh","good","at","littl","i","do","find","sue","price","hot","in","that","amazonian","warrior","waybr","br","a","real","movi","rate","there","be","not","a","lot","of","pro","about","the","over","all","qualiti","and","despit","of","the","veri","basic","plot","the","film","it","self","make","veri","littl","sensebr","br","a","camp","movi","rate","i","do","get","occasion","laugh","from","the","sheer","bad","of","the","film","so","it","doe","have","small","merit","in","it"],"filtered":["onli","reason","poss","thi","dvd","see","nemesi","film","check","info","sai","becaus","film","alex","male","set","futur","mayb","thi","alex","brand","new","scientist","happen","make","alex","femal","thi","time","know","littl","address","film","ani","waybr","br","quick","summari","plot","alex","still","babi","ever","want","futur","escap","mom","us","special","time","vessel","end","africa","mommi","get","kill","alex","sue","price","grow","african","tribe","tribe","get","slaughter","cyborg","futur","alex","run","hide","final","kill","cyborg","doe","sound","familiar","doe","itbr","br","termin","onli","film","rip","predat","get","fair","share","think","fly","movi","vincent","price","get","special","nomin","give","solid","base","build","cyborg","head","frombr","br","let","see","els","okai","film","quit","standard","small","budget","flick","bad","special","effect","mid","film","look","okai","flick","ever","big","problem","plot","thing","happen","viewer","bare","interest","nemesi","crappi","piec","cinema","pleasur","watch","doe","come","damn","closebr","br","wo","sai","thing","act","becaus","let","honest","anyon","expect","oscar","worthi","perform","oh","good","littl","find","sue","price","hot","amazonian","warrior","waybr","br","real","movi","rate","lot","pro","qualiti","despit","veri","basic","plot","film","self","make","veri","littl","sensebr","br","camp","movi","rate","get","occasion","laugh","sheer","bad","film","doe","small","merit"],"filtered2":["onli","reason","poss","dvd","see","nemesi","check","info","becaus","alex","male","set","futur","mayb","alex","brand","new","scientist","happen","make","alex","femal","time","know","littl","address","ani","waybr","quick","summari","plot","alex","still","babi","ever","want","futur","escap","mom","us","special","time","vessel","end","africa","mommi","get","kill","alex","sue","price","grow","african","tribe","tribe","get","slaughter","cyborg","futur","alex","run","hide","final","kill","cyborg","doe","sound","familiar","doe","itbr","termin","onli","rip","predat","get","fair","share","think","fly","vincent","price","get","special","nomin","give","solid","base","build","cyborg","head","frombr","let","see","els","okai","quit","standard","small","budget","flick","bad","special","effect","mid","look","okai","flick","ever","big","problem","plot","thing","happen","viewer","bare","interest","nemesi","crappi","piec","cinema","pleasur","watch","doe","come","damn","closebr","wo","thing","act","becaus","let","honest","anyon","expec

{"value":"Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen, one should simply read them. I agree with that. However, we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers' strike brings to mind that without good writers, it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade & kissing in the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows a twitty Anne who seems angst-ridden. The other characters were not very developed which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in Bath - - twittering away, as many of the characters seemed to do. The strength of character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which caused Anne to love him in the first place, didn't seem to be written into the Rupert Penry-Jones' Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look, than P-J was able to do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel into a hand- wringing, costumed melodrama of debatable worth. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare: adapt it to the present.

{"value":"Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror film. Okay maybe it's not that bad. But it is close.<br /><br />Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is quite menacing and brutal). I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream.. Or was it? (Cue music)<br /><br />The basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot (Done quite well the first time) is repeated over and over again. And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality I just stopped caring what happened to Claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together.<br /><br />I was rooting for a séance (which honestly would have made more sense) but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings (Think the Village or Below) Yup the film collapses faster than Donnie Darko's directors cut. All the great twist endings in horror movies The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience wasn't expecting a left field explanation. (Heck even the canoe ending in the original Friday the 13th was worth a jolt)<br /><br />Salvage on the other hand screams twist ending with every scene change. Other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack (Though the featured songs were decent) the obvious time padding (Claire doing the dishes, Claire's mother's subplots), the way Claire says \"hello is anyone there\" every time she thinks there is a serial killer around.<br /><br />Also some of the secondary acting roles (In particular Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander who resembles a Mary Kay zombie) shows the first time actor low budget roots.<br /><br />Both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough Salvage keeps your interest if only to see how they are going to fix this mess. Problem is they really don't.","finished_norm":["salvag","out","of","groundhog","dai","meet","a","christian","coalit","horror","film","okai","mayb","it","not","that","bad","but","it","be","closebr","br","clair","plai","by","alicia","silverstonesqu","lauren","curri","lewi","be","stalk","and","possibli","kill","by","a","serial","killer","chri","ferri","who","be","quit","menac","and","brutal","i","sai","possibli","becaus","she","wake","up","and","it","be","all","a","dream","or","be","it","cue","musicbr","br","the","basic","problem","with","the","film","be","that","thi","fifteen","minut","of","plot","do","quit","good","the","time","be","repeat","over","and","over","again","and","sinc","clair","wake","up","everi","time","and","everi","scene","be","clearli","a","dream","or","altern","realiti","i","just","stop","care","what","happen","to","clair","and","start","wonder","what","lame","twist","at","the","end","be","go","to","pull","thi","togetherbr","br","i","be","root","for","a","séanc","which","honestli","would","have","make","much","sens","but","instead","get","on","of","that","too","obviou","by","half","surpris","end","think","the","villag","or","below","yup","the","film","collaps","fast","than","donni","darko","director","cut","all","the","great","twist","end","in","horror","movi","the","sens","the","origin","invas","of","the","bodi","snatcher","happi","birthdai","to","me","work","becaus","the","audienc","be","not","expect","a","leav","field","explan","heck","even","the","cano","end","in","the","origin","fridai","the","th","be","worth","a","joltbr","br","salvag","on","the","other","hand","scream","twist","end","with","everi","scene","chang","other","nag","fault","be","the","on","note","piano","soundtrack","though","the","featur","song","be","decent","the","obviou","time","pad","clair","do","the","dish","clair","mother","subplot","the","wai","clair","sai","hello","be","anyon","there","everi","time","she","think","there","be","a","serial","killer","aroundbr","br","conjur","some","of","the","secondari","act","role","in","particular","clair","mother","plai","by","maureen","oland","who","resembl","a","mari","kai","zombi","show","the","time","actor","low","budget","rootsbr","br","both","too","clever","by","half","and","not","nearli","clever","enough","salvag","keep","your","interest","if","onli","to","see","how","thei","be","go","to","fix","thi","mess","problem","be","thei","realli","do","not"],"filtered":["salvag","groundhog","dai","meet","christian","coalit","horror","film","okai","mayb","bad","closebr","br","clair","plai","alicia","silverstonesqu","lauren","curri","lewi","stalk","possibli","kill","serial","killer","chri","ferri","quit","menac","brutal","sai","possibli","becaus","wake","dream","cue","musicbr","br","basic","problem","film","thi","fifteen","minut","plot","quit","good","time","repeat","sinc","clair","wake","everi","time","everi","scene","clearli","dream","altern","realiti","stop","care","happen","clair","start","wonder","lame","twist","end","go","pull","thi","togetherbr","br","root","séanc","honestli","make","much","sens","instead","get","obviou","half","surpris","end","think","villag","yup","film","collaps","fast","donni","darko","director","cut","great","twist","end","horror","movi","sens","origin","invas","bodi","snatcher","happi","birthdai","work","becaus","audienc","expect","leav","field","explan","heck","even","cano","end","origin","fridai","th","worth","joltbr","br","salvag","hand","scream","twist","end","everi","scene","chang","nag","fault","note","piano","soundtrack","though","featur","song","decent","obviou","time","pad","clair","dish","clair","mother","subplot","wai","clair","sai","hello","anyon","everi","time","think","serial","killer","aroundbr","br","conjur","secondari","act","role","particular","clair","mother","plai","maureen","oland","resembl","mari","kai","zombi","show","time","actor","low","budget","rootsbr","br","clever","half","nearli","clever","enough","salvag","keep","interest","onli","see","thei","go","fix","thi","mess","problem","thei","realli"],"filtered2":["salvag","groundhog","dai","meet","christian","coalit","horror","okai","mayb","bad","closebr","clair","plai","alicia","silverstonesqu","lauren","curri","lewi","stalk","possibli","kill","serial","killer","chri","ferri","quit","menac","brutal","possibli","becaus","wake","dream","cue","musicbr","basic","problem","fifteen","minut","plot","quit","good","time","repeat","sinc","clair","wake","everi","time","everi","scene","clearli","dream","altern","realiti","stop","care","happen","clair","start","wonder","lame","twist","end","go","pull","togetherbr","root","séanc","honestli","make","sens","instead","get","obviou","half","surpris","end","think","villag","yup","collaps","fast","donni","darko","director","cut","great","twist","end","horror","sens","origin","invas","bodi","snatcher","happi","birthdai","work","becaus","audienc","expect","leav","field","explan","heck","even","cano","end","origin","fridai","th","worth","joltbr","salvag","hand","scream","twis

{"value":"This is without doubt Rajnikanth's worst movies ever. The first part is held in place with solid comedy from Goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also takes a dig at Saints with the same name (Baba) through a corny and utterly lame one-liner. The first half has Rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half, becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the Himalayas where Babaji (not the famous Saints he took a dig at earlier) gives him special powers for no apparent reason (other than karma). This is really starting to get interesting now isn't it? <br /><br />The rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a Param Vir...er....Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd, overworked and in the end, completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />But despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with and yell Baba related one-liners during public events. Its also fun to watch others curse about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone. Thats how important he considered it.<br /><br />Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko...why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese may stop watching Rajni movies after seeing that. This movie was probably promotional material for Rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams.<br /><br />Fun if you turn your brain

{"value":"I must admit I do not hold much of New Age mumbo jumbo. When people \"exchange energy\" I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem. When energy \"is enforced\" I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without Nobel prizes. When people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station.<br /><br />But then again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them I find perfectly acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with \"The Celestine Prophecy\" I wouldn't burn this movie down, but unfortunately it isn't. Every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location. This results in many \"Ah-s\" and \"Oh-s\", like I tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand.<br /><br />The direction is uninspired as well. You might expect something more from the guy who did \"What dreams may come\", but hey, I supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: \"It's your money, buddy..\" The only one who seems to be having fun is all-time bad guy Jürgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring New Age chatter.<br /><br />This movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up. At one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurts.<br /><br />If you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids, take my advise: choose the

{"value":"One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended. But I'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis.<br /><br />It is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand. They're getting close to Earth, so much so that it's become unseasonably hot, as if the entire Earth were Death Valley. The answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. That will divert the flares off in say the direction of say Mercury providing it's not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /><br />Who to deliver it, but captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son, Corin Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father, and Nemec's grandfather.<br /><br />There's a villain here too, Peter Boyle who is the CEO of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors. The idea he might not survive doesn't enter into his thinking. He's doing his best to sabotage Matheson's mission.<br /><br />Solar Crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and overacts accordingly.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are stalwart, true blue and dull. Except possibly desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares for him. <br /><br />The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films, Allen Smithee. The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving

{"value":"One can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this film was just too much. Practically nothing was even close to truth, and even for the era, it was seen as silly.<br /><br />In defense of ford, it was revealed on an old talk show, that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile, and replayed the scene his own way. Earp told the director about the stagecoach, and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated.<br /><br />This movie portrays Earp as an honest man, and also his brothers. History doesn't exactly say they were or weren't. Most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters, but that is nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career, and believe me, in the old West, you didn't have time to think about too much else.<br /><br />Characters that don't exist, characters depicted dying at the corral who really didn't, all make this a weaker film. It is further weakened by Mature, who really didn't make a convincing Doc. He may be the worst cast choice ever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth. After all, ford did get information first hand from Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />It is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro Nazi in those days, and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to Hitler idealism. This occurs in most movies until the eighties. It is no excuse, and does cheapen the art, however.<br /><br />The actors who play the Earps do well, and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, Mature may be the only acting downside of this flick. Still, it is the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.","finished_norm":["on","can","deal","with","histor","inaccuraci","but","thi","film","be","just","too","much","practic","noth","be","even","close","to","truth","and","even","for","the","era","it","be","see","a","sillybr","br","in","defens","of","ford","it","be","reveal","on","a","old","talk","show","that","he","be","oper","on","the","stori","a","tell","to","him","by","the","real","wyatt","earp","who","be","obvious","old","senil","and","replai","the","scene","hi","own","wai","earp","tell","the","director","about","the","stagecoach","and","how","it","be","plan","to","happen","dure","the","stagecoach","arriv","so","despit","what","other","historian","claim","wyat","himself","assert","that","it","be","premeditatedbr","br","thi","movi","portrai","earp","a","a","honest","man","and","conjur","hi","brother","histori","doe","not","exactli","sai","thei","be","or","be","not","much","peopl","like","to","interject","a","bite","of","deceit","and","lawless","into","their","charact","but","that","be","noth","new","the","truth","be","probabl","close","to","them","be","the","law","abid","sort","of","gunfight","at","the","okai","corral","man","who","see","it","a","a","career","and","believ","me","in","the","old","west","you","do","not","have","time","to","think","about","too","much","elsebr","br","charact","that","do","not","exist","charact","depict","dye","at","the","corral","who","realli","do","not","all","make","thi","a","weak","film","it","be","far","weaken","by","matur","who","realli","do","not","make","a","convinc","doc","he","mai","be","the","wrong","cast","choic","ever","for","doc","but","at","the","same","time","we","must","rememb","that","old","movi","be","close","to","the","era","and","close","to","a","feel","for","the","truth","after","all","ford","do","get","inform","hand","from","wyatt","earpbr","br","it","be","conjur","weaken","by","the","all","so","predict","event","involv","the","mexican","girl","hollywood","be","veri","pro","nazi","in","that","dai","and","readi","to","kill","off","brunett","woman","in","veri","predict","fashion","to","show","their","patronag","to","hitler","ideal","thi","occur","in","much","movi","until","the","eighti","it","be","no","excus","and","doe","cheapen","the","art","howeverbr","br","the","actor","who","plai","the","earp","do","good","and","brennan","be","alwai","a","thrill","in","fact","matur","mai","be","the","onli","act","downsid","of","thi","flick","still","it","be","the","weak","of","the","old","okai","corral","movi"],"filtered":["deal","histor","inaccuraci","thi","film","much","practic","noth","even","close","truth","even","era","see","sillybr","br","defens","ford","reveal","old","talk","show","oper","stori","tell","real","wyatt","earp","obvious","old","senil","replai","scene","hi","wai","earp","tell","director","stagecoach","plan","happen","dure","stagecoach","arriv","despit","historian","claim","wyat","assert","premeditatedbr","br","thi","movi","portrai","earp","honest","man","conjur","hi","brother","histori","doe","exactli","sai","thei","much","peopl","like","interject","bite","deceit","lawless","charact","noth","new","truth","probabl","close","law","abid","sort","gunfight","okai","corral","man","see","career","believ","old","west","time","think","much","elsebr","br","charact","exist","charact","depict","dye","corral","realli","make","thi","weak","film","far","weaken","matur","realli","make","convinc","doc","mai","wrong","cast","choic","ever","doc","time","must","rememb","old","movi","close","era","close","feel","truth","ford","get","inform","hand","wyatt","earpbr","br","conjur","weaken","predict","event","involv","mexican","girl","hollywood","veri","pro","nazi","dai","readi","kill","brunett","woman","veri","predict","fashion","show","patronag","hitler","ideal","thi","occur","much","movi","eighti","excus","doe","cheapen","art","howeverbr","br","actor","plai","earp","good","brennan","alwai","thrill","fact","matur","mai","onli","act","downsid","thi","flick","still","weak","old","okai","corral","movi"],"filtered2":["deal","histor","inaccuraci","practic","noth","even","close","truth","even","era","see","sillybr","defens","ford","reveal","old","talk","show","oper","stori","tell","real","wyatt","earp","obvious","old","senil","replai","scene","wai","earp","tell","director","stagecoach","plan","happen","dure","stagecoach","arriv","despit","historian","claim","wyat","assert","premeditatedbr","portrai","earp","honest","man","conjur","brother","histori","doe","exactli","peopl","like","interject","bite","deceit","lawless","charact","noth","new","truth","probabl","close","law","abid","sort","gunfight","okai","corral","man","see","career","believ","old","west","time","think","elsebr","charact","exist","charact","depict","dye","corral","realli","make","weak","far","weaken","matur","realli","make","convinc","doc","mai","wrong","cast","choic","ever","doc","time","must","rememb","old","close","era","close","feel","truth","ford","get","inform","hand","wyatt","earpbr","conjur","weaken",

{"value":"These reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. I haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.<br /><br />Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.<br /><br />The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopi's career.<br /><br />Don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didn't see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney.

{"value":"I watched the Canadian videotape of this movie as \"The Witching\" which somehow made its way to New York State. Audio was quite bad, I had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog. Orson Welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted. Some closed captions would really have helped!<br /><br />A group of witches or satanists (the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group!) have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll. The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named \"Lilith,\" where he's been offered a job at a toy factory. Despite one of the AKAs of this movie apparently being \"The Toy Factory,\" we never see it, and it's only occasionally referred to at all.<br /><br />On the way to Lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion. He drives aggressively, and causes another car to go off the road and blow up. After the police arrive, she takes a doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie.<br /><br />It turns out Mr. Cato and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, though she doesn't realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware.<br /><br />Some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involving. The movie does seem a bit of a mess, and this is no doubt largely due to its re- editing and the addition of new footage. The original version, according to the end credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of DVD could let us see both versions on one disc, but re-releasing this movie probably isn't a priority.","finished_norm":["i","watch","the","canadian","videotap","of","thi","movi","a","the","witch","which","somehow","make","it","wai","to","new","york","state","audio","be","quit","bad","i","have","to","rais","it","to","about","just","to","hear","it","and","the","soundtrack","often","be","overwhelm","the","dialog","orson","well","be","a","mumbler","wrong","than","usual","and","some","of","hi","dialog","and","of","other","be","run","through","a","echo","chamber","a","ghostli","figur","who","keep","reappear","have","her","voic","distort","some","close","caption","would","realli","have","helpedbr","br","a","group","of","witch","or","satanist","the","end","credit","sai","the","group","be","not","mean","to","repres","ani","real","group","have","a","ritual","in","which","thei","get","nake","and","caus","a","miscarriag","by","stab","a","doll","the","woman","who","have","the","miscarriag","and","her","husband","move","to","a","town","name","lilith","where","he","be","offer","a","job","at","a","toi","factori","despit","on","of","the","aka","of","thi","movi","appar","be","the","toi","factori","we","never","see","it","and","it","onli","occasion","refer","to","at","allbr","br","on","the","wai","to","lilith","her","husband","get","impati","with","some","of","her","question","about","what","hi","new","boss","mr","cato","want","to","know","about","their","religi","persuas","he","drive","aggress","and","caus","anoth","car","to","go","off","the","road","and","blow","up","after","the","polic","arriv","she","take","a","doll","that","fall","out","of","the","car","the","of","mani","handmad","doll","in","the","moviebr","br","it","turn","out","mr","cato","and","all","the","townspeopl","be","witch","and","that","thei","be","the","on","who","caus","her","miscarriag","though","she","doe","not","realiz","it","thei","want","her","becaus","she","have","a","innat","talent","for","necrom","of","which","she","be","not","realli","awarebr","br","some","imag","in","the","movi","have","some","impact","but","on","the","whole","the","movi","be","not","veri","involv","the","movi","doe","seem","a","bite","of","a","mess","and","thi","be","no","doubt","larg","due","to","it","re","edit","and","the","addit","of","new","footag","the","origin","version","accord","to","the","end","credit","be","call","necrom","a","life","for","a","life","the","magic","of","dvd","can","let","u","see","both","version","on","on","disc","but","rereleas","thi","movi","probabl","be","not","a","prioriti"],"filtered":["watch","canadian","videotap","thi","movi","witch","somehow","make","wai","new","york","state","audio","quit","bad","rais","hear","soundtrack","often","overwhelm","dialog","orson","well","mumbler","wrong","usual","hi","dialog","run","echo","chamber","ghostli","figur","keep","reappear","voic","distort","close","caption","realli","helpedbr","br","group","witch","satanist","end","credit","sai","group","mean","repres","ani","real","group","ritual","thei","get","nake","caus","miscarriag","stab","doll","woman","miscarriag","husband","move","town","name","lilith","offer","job","toi","factori","despit","aka","thi","movi","appar","toi","factori","never","see","onli","occasion","refer","allbr","br","wai","lilith","husband","get","impati","question","hi","new","boss","mr","cato","want","know","religi","persuas","drive","aggress","caus","anoth","car","go","road","blow","polic","arriv","take","doll","fall","car","mani","handmad","doll","moviebr","br","turn","mr","cato","townspeopl","witch","thei","caus","miscarriag","though","doe","realiz","thei","want","becaus","innat","talent","necrom","realli","awarebr","br","imag","movi","impact","whole","movi","veri","involv","movi","doe","seem","bite","mess","thi","doubt","larg","due","re","edit","addit","new","footag","origin","version","accord","end","credit","call","necrom","life","life","magic","dvd","let","u","see","version","disc","rereleas","thi","movi","probabl","prioriti"],"filtered2":["watch","canadian","videotap","witch","somehow","make","wai","new","york","state","audio","quit","bad","rais","hear","soundtrack","often","overwhelm","dialog","orson","well","mumbler","wrong","usual","dialog","run","echo","chamber","ghostli","figur","keep","reappear","voic","distort","close","caption","realli","helpedbr","group","witch","satanist","end","credit","group","mean","repres","ani","real","group","ritual","get","nake","caus","miscarriag","stab","doll","woman","miscarriag","husband","move","town","name","lilith","offer","job","toi","factori","despit","aka","appar","toi","factori","never","see","onli","occasion","refer","allbr","wai","lilith","husband","get","impati","question","new","boss","mr","cato","want","know","religi","persuas","drive","aggress","caus","anoth","car","go","road","blow","polic","arriv","take","doll","fall","car","mani","handmad","doll","moviebr","turn","mr","cato","townspeopl","witch","caus","miscarriag","though","doe","realiz","want","becaus","innat","talent","necrom","realli","awarebr","imag","impact","whole",

{"value":"Warning: This review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very dull movie. Where the heck are the Graboids??? <br /><br />Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a \"character study\". Unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago's character who is given too few lines, too little to do and in the end too little screen time. What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch. However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /><br />On the plus side when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long. Pretty good for straight to video. But after watching it I'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any. Was there a rush to get this movie made? I think not, more time could have and should have been spent on the script.<br /><br />I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with....Tremors!!! What luck I thought, pay for #4 get #1 for free. Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists.<br /><br />Tremors 4: The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10.","finished_norm":["warn","thi","review","contain","minor","spoilersbr","br","good","the","writer","of","the","tremor","be","offici","out","of","idea","i","be","a","big","fan","of","the","movi","and","the","two","sequel","be","pretti","good","for","straight","to","video","fare","tremor","the","legend","begin","howev","be","a","veri","dull","movi","where","the","heck","be","the","graboid","br","br","due","to","the","rel","lack","of","graboid","through","the","minut","i","be","convinc","that","thi","entri","into","the","seri","be","suppos","to","be","a","charact","studi","unfortun","there","be","not","on","interest","charact","in","the","movi","except","for","billi","drago","charact","who","be","give","too","few","line","too","littl","to","do","and","in","the","end","too","littl","screen","time","what","save","the","nd","and","rd","movi","be","the","presenc","of","michael","gross","a","burt","gummer","whenev","there","be","not","ani","action","on","the","screen","you","can","rest","assur","that","burt","gummer","be","go","to","be","interest","to","listen","too","andor","watch","howev","in","thi","movi","gross","plai","hiram","gummer","a","veri","poor","and","bore","substitut","br","br","on","the","plu","side","when","the","graboid","dirt","dragon","in","thi","movi","be","on","the","screen","thei","do","look","good","but","that","be","about","a","good","a","it","getsbr","br","i","be","impress","when","i","see","that","tremor","be","list","at","minut","long","pretti","good","for","straight","to","video","but","after","watch","it","i","be","sure","that","thi","movi","be","a","good","minut","too","long","there","be","long","stretch","of","dialogu","that","be","bore","and","doe","not","far","the","plot","ani","be","there","a","rush","to","get","thi","movi","make","i","think","not","much","time","can","have","and","should","have","be","spend","on","the","scriptbr","br","i","think","i","have","hit","a","gold","mine","when","i","see","tremor","packag","for","sale","withtremor","what","luck","i","think","pai","for","get","for","free","good","after","watch","tremor","i","like","to","think","i","pai","for","the","origin","and","get","thi","mess","for","free","i","ca","not","imagin","pai","a","singl","dime","for","tremor","for","fan","of","the","seri","it","well","to","forget","that","tremor","the","legend","begin","even","existsbr","br","tremor","the","legend","begin","rate","a","out","of"],"filtered":["warn","thi","review","contain","minor","spoilersbr","br","good","writer","tremor","offici","idea","big","fan","movi","two","sequel","pretti","good","straight","video","fare","tremor","legend","begin","howev","veri","dull","movi","heck","graboid","br","br","due","rel","lack","graboid","minut","convinc","thi","entri","seri","suppos","charact","studi","unfortun","interest","charact","movi","except","billi","drago","charact","give","line","littl","end","littl","screen","time","save","nd","rd","movi","presenc","michael","gross","burt","gummer","whenev","ani","action","screen","rest","assur","burt","gummer","go","interest","listen","andor","watch","howev","thi","movi","gross","plai","hiram","gummer","veri","poor","bore","substitut","br","br","plu","side","graboid","dirt","dragon","thi","movi","screen","thei","look","good","good","getsbr","br","impress","see","tremor","list","minut","long","pretti","good","straight","video","watch","sure","thi","movi","good","minut","long","long","stretch","dialogu","bore","doe","far","plot","ani","rush","get","thi","movi","make","think","much","time","spend","scriptbr","br","think","hit","gold","mine","see","tremor","packag","sale","withtremor","luck","think","pai","get","free","good","watch","tremor","like","think","pai","origin","get","thi","mess","free","ca","imagin","pai","singl","dime","tremor","fan","seri","well","forget","tremor","legend","begin","even","existsbr","br","tremor","legend","begin","rate"],"filtered2":["warn","review","contain","minor","spoilersbr","good","writer","tremor","offici","idea","big","fan","two","sequel","pretti","good","straight","video","fare","tremor","legend","begin","howev","veri","dull","heck","graboid","due","rel","lack","graboid","minut","convinc","entri","suppos","charact","studi","unfortun","interest","charact","except","billi","drago","charact","give","line","littl","end","littl","screen","time","save","nd","rd","presenc","michael","gross","burt","gummer","whenev","ani","action","screen","rest","assur","burt","gummer","go","interest","listen","andor","watch","howev","gross","plai","hiram","gummer","veri","poor","bore","substitut","plu","side","graboid","dirt","dragon","screen","look","good","good","getsbr","impress","see","tremor","list","minut","long","pretti","good","straight","video","watch","sure","good","minut","long","long","stretch","dialogu","bore","doe","far","plot","ani","rush","get","make","think","time","spend","scriptbr","think","hit","gold","mine","see","tremor","packag","sale","withtremor","luck","think","pai","get","free","good","wat

{"value":"I don't know if this is one of the SyFy Channel original movies, but that's exactly what it feels like. A cheap, low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly, it contains laughable effects, lame dialog, and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it (funny how many of the kids from 90210 are doing cheap TV movies now).<br /><br />Ian Ziering plays Cortes, who we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of native people while conquering parts of North America. Here, he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably be killed off if this weren't loosely based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a brief surveying mission, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves financing to further explore America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs.<br /><br />The actual hero of the story turns out to be Lt. Rios, who proves to be honorable, resourceful, and wise. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, which puts him at opposition with Cortes, as well as with the young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who is supposed to marry the headstrong, scheming shaman falls for Rios, furthering his anger towards the Spanish outsiders. So it's all pretty cliché. The dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease. Despite taking place in an area that seems wide open, the story pretty much takes place in either the woods, or the Aztec village for 95% of the time, so it isn't visually exciting either.<br /><br />I didn't even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared into it. He doesn't look or sound Spanish for a second, however, making the casting choice wrong in every way. If this movie had been released theatrically, he would have been singled out for a Razzie, no question.<br /><br />Overall,

{"value":"Normally, I am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film I have to say it was incredibly bad. I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.<br /><br />There were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. It might have worked if \"Daggers\" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. This may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word \"flirt\" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, I was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just cringed a lot.<br /><br />*******spoiler*****<br /><br />Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones I have ever seen. The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. Wow, cool.<br /><br />Well, then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank.

{"value":"We have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. Basically, Dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named Neweyes(which I needed after I watched this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that Dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation. The dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter(Too bad the screenwriters didn't have it). By the way, does it seem weird that out of ALL the wishes of the children in the world, Neweyes grants the wish of bringing Dinosaurs to modern times? Why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine? Disease? War? I mean come on! Doesn't Neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has??? Finally, when the Dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing, dancing and wrecking havoc(basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad LSD trip, I mean where else could you see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of Spider-man?). They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes(???) makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. Why? Why would kids sign a blank contract??? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some...\"Brain-Drain\" That he will let the children go. The dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil Screweyes limb from limb, give in and agree to his terms. What?! This is stupid! They could have just menaced him, made him drop the contract, eaten it then walked off with the kids. I think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop Screweyes and apparently completely eat him.

{"value":"Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had \"jumped the shark\", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with \"The Brady Bunch\" they introduced the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and with \"Family Ties\" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! With the Moto films, they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you kept hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! Although he's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon \"act\". It's so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot.<br /><br />As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.<br /><br />Overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here. With WWII approaching, the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the US or in allied countries.","finished_norm":["between","and","centuryfox","make","a","ton","of","mr","moto","film","howev","toward","the","end","of","the","seri","it","be","obviou","that","the","studio","have","jump","the","shark","so","to","speak","thi","phrase","indic","that","a","tv","show","have","pass","it","prime","and","the","execut","in","charg","decid","to","invigor","the","show","by","fundament","chang","the","formula","for","exampl","with","the","bradi","bunch","thei","introduc","the","annoi","cousin","oliv","and","with","famili","tie","thei","introduc","a","freak","babi","who","grow","up","six","year","in","onli","on","season","with","the","moto","film","thei","have","jump","the","shark","by","introduc","comic","relief","becaus","thei","think","that","thi","intellig","film","ne","to","be","retool","in","the","previou","film","warren","hymer","plai","a","annoi","wrestler","and","in","thi","film","the","charact","archibald","featherston","appear","featherston","mai","just","be","on","of","the","much","annoi","exampl","of","comic","relief","ever","a","you","keep","hope","someon","prefer","moto","would","kill","him","just","to","shut","him","up","although","he","suppos","to","work","for","the","fame","scotland","yard","he","show","all","the","intellig","and","acumen","of","a","brain","damag","turnip","again","and","again","hi","scene","be","boorish","and","unnecessari","and","peter","lorr","just","look","pain","a","he","stand","there","and","watch","thi","buffoon","act","it","so","bad","that","it","truli","destroi","what","can","have","be","on","of","the","well","moto","film","due","to","it","clever","plotbr","br","a","for","the","plot","the","crown","of","the","queen","of","sheba","be","discov","in","the","open","scene","moto","now","much","of","a","intern","policeman","than","the","amor","charact","he","origin","be","be","on","hand","to","protect","the","preciou","item","from","be","steal","in","a","great","twist","sever","thiev","all","try","to","steal","the","crown","independ","of","each","otherbr","br","overal","the","film","be","watchabl","but","be","conjur","ampl","evid","that","the","moto","seri","should","have","end","here","with","wwii","approach","the","film","can","not","have","surviv","much","long","anywai","a","have","a","sympathet","japanes","lead","charact","simpli","would","not","have","be","accept","in","the","u","or","in","alli","countri"],"filtered":["centuryfox","make","ton","mr","moto","film","howev","toward","end","seri","obviou","studio","jump","shark","speak","thi","phrase","indic","tv","show","pass","prime","execut","charg","decid","invigor","show","fundament","chang","formula","exampl","bradi","bunch","thei","introduc","annoi","cousin","oliv","famili","tie","thei","introduc","freak","babi","grow","six","year","onli","season","moto","film","thei","jump","shark","introduc","comic","relief","becaus","thei","think","thi","intellig","film","ne","retool","previou","film","warren","hymer","plai","annoi","wrestler","thi","film","charact","archibald","featherston","appear","featherston","mai","much","annoi","exampl","comic","relief","ever","keep","hope","someon","prefer","moto","kill","shut","although","suppos","work","fame","scotland","yard","show","intellig","acumen","brain","damag","turnip","hi","scene","boorish","unnecessari","peter","lorr","look","pain","stand","watch","thi","buffoon","act","bad","truli","destroi","well","moto","film","due","clever","plotbr","br","plot","crown","queen","sheba","discov","open","scene","moto","much","intern","policeman","amor","charact","origin","hand","protect","preciou","item","steal","great","twist","sever","thiev","try","steal","crown","independ","otherbr","br","overal","film","watchabl","conjur","ampl","evid","moto","seri","end","wwii","approach","film","surviv","much","long","anywai","sympathet","japanes","lead","charact","simpli","accept","u","alli","countri"],"filtered2":["centuryfox","make","ton","mr","moto","howev","toward","end","obviou","studio","jump","shark","speak","phrase","indic","tv","show","pass","prime","execut","charg","decid","invigor","show","fundament","chang","formula","exampl","bradi","bunch","introduc","annoi","cousin","oliv","famili","tie","introduc","freak","babi","grow","six","year","onli","season","moto","jump","shark","introduc","comic","relief","becaus","think","intellig","ne","retool","previou","warren","hymer","plai","annoi","wrestler","charact","archibald","featherston","appear","featherston","mai","annoi","exampl","comic","relief","ever","keep","hope","someon","prefer","moto","kill","shut","although","suppos","work","fame","scotland","yard","show","intellig","acumen","brain","damag","turnip","scene","boorish","unnecessari","peter","lorr","look","pain","stand","watch","buffoon","act","bad","truli","destroi","well","moto","due","clever","plotbr","plot","crown","queen","sheba","discov","open","scene","moto","intern","policeman","amor","charact","origin","hand","protect","preciou","item","steal","great","twist","sever","thiev","

{"value":"This isn't a film, it's a 111-minute Evangelical Christian sermon draped over red state America's #1 sport, high school football. Another of the long, earnest messages to the converted who are then presumed to be fired up enough by the spirit to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbours.<br /><br />Dialogue like \"You won the big one when you accepted Christ\" loses any possible camp appeal by the disturbing intensity in director/Coach Alex Kendrick's sunken black eyes. Then there are the \"parables\".<br /><br />Two farmers prayed for rain but only one prepared his field to receive it. Which one do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is meant to foreshadow the miraculous climax, in the course of which Coach asks his trepidous back-up kicker, \"Son, do you think God could help you make that kick?\" It's the kind of entertainment we could have expected would receive faith-based funding ad infinitum, if only the Evangelical Christian Bush Administration's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us all to become \"devout\" after their example. Behold that poor Giants coach in the apocalyptic finale, urging his team on crying \"Who's with me!\" while the devout Eagles on the other side were quietly going about doing the Lord's work.<br /><br />So, do you think our terrified back-up makes his kick to vanquish those self-centrist Goliaths? Well, we all know zealots can't lose. Put it this way: Transfer the playing ground to the deserts of the Middle East, replace the Christian proselytizing, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban-vs-Superpower parable, which the devout worshippers of this garbage might want to think about a minute.<br /><br />Luckily they won't care, nor need to: like Coach tells his team of earnest empty vessels pregame, the answers are all right here in this Book. And the Christian Right will devour this on their way to their Rapture, that final victory they have prepared their fields

{"value":"Surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end. For the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one, with a small budget, insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it.<br /><br />It's silly that with all the money going around in the Christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with. I'm not a religious, so I couldn't care less really but film-making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance. In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />The low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy B-movie like feeling.<br /><br />But what's hurting this movie more is its writing. The stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then I'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it's being insulting to its viewers.<br /><br />I also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times. Seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up. I just couldn't cared less really at times.<br /><br />Still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end, when its story gets more focused on its essence. Still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned, there are far worser one to watch out there, though I don't think this movie will win over any new souls.<br /><br

{"value":"First some background; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I have been to many games at 'The Den' and most other London club grounds. I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak. Have to say this is a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen. I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.<br /><br />a) People just don't talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately hooligan types do exist, but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately sounded about as 'English' or 'Cockney' as Osama Bin Laden. He's from up north in Newcastle and I'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously. Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done 'a bang up job' myself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans. He'd be dead. Simple as that. Honestly (as a Brit) it was hard to watch this film. I'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK. It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /><br />Please my American and foreign friends, don't believe a word of this nonsense. Yes these firms do exist but it's all extremely underground and hush hush, and on a vastly smaller scale. The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London. Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and expect us all not to notice.","finished_norm":["some","background","i","be","english","and","have","live","in","london","all","my","life","i","have","be","to","mani","game","at","the","den","and","much","other","london","club","ground","i","be","familiar","with","the","typ","of","person","who","get","into","hooligan","and","i","know","just","how","thei","act","and","how","thei","speak","have","to","sai","thi","be","a","bad","bad","movi","i","can","tell","you","that","green","street","be","on","of","the","much","unrealist","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","spend","much","of","the","movi","cring","with","embarrass","i","feel","i","should","write","a","mini","review","becaus","i","feel","i","ne","to","point","out","a","few","thingsbr","br","a","peopl","just","do","not","talk","like","that","in","london","in","real","life","the","filmmak","take","the","whole","slang","thing","too","far","and","make","it","sound","stupid","unfortun","hooligan","typ","do","exist","but","that","you","see","in","green","street","be","much","like","parodi","b","the","actor","who","plai","pete","dunham","charli","hunnam","unfortun","sound","about","a","english","or","cocknei","a","osama","bin","lade","he","from","up","north","in","newcastl","and","i","be","just","amaz","ani","of","the","other","actor","can","keep","straight","face","act","alongsid","him","how","be","we","suppos","to","take","him","serious","why","thei","do","not","just","get","someon","from","east","london","to","plai","that","part","be","beyond","me","i","can","have","do","a","bang","up","job","myself","hehe","c","mr","frodo","i","mean","how","can","i","be","expect","to","take","serious","elijah","wood","kick","the","ass","of","peopl","twice","hi","size","and","who","be","genuin","nasti","hooligan","he","have","be","dead","simpl","a","that","honestli","a","a","brit","it","be","hard","to","watch","thi","film","i","be","pretti","sure","thi","film","will","bomb","here","in","the","uk","it","mai","do","a","littl","well","in","the","state","becaus","the","american","just","wont","know","or","care","how","inaccur","it","be","br","br","pleas","my","american","and","foreign","friend","do","not","believ","a","word","of","thi","nonsens","ye","thi","firm","do","exist","but","it","all","extrem","underground","and","hush","hush","and","on","a","vastli","small","scale","the","movi","onli","get","a","from","me","becaus","thei","actual","film","some","of","it","in","london","usual","thei","try","to","film","thi","thing","in","cardiff","wale","or","someth","and","expect","u","all","not","to","notic"],"filtered":["background","english","live","london","life","mani","game","den","much","london","club","ground","familiar","typ","person","get","hooligan","know","thei","act","thei","speak","sai","thi","bad","bad","movi","tell","green","street","much","unrealist","movi","ever","see","spend","much","movi","cring","embarrass","feel","write","mini","review","becaus","feel","ne","point","thingsbr","br","peopl","talk","like","london","real","life","filmmak","take","whole","slang","thing","far","make","sound","stupid","unfortun","hooligan","typ","exist","see","green","street","much","like","parodi","b","actor","plai","pete","dunham","charli","hunnam","unfortun","sound","english","cocknei","osama","bin","lade","north","newcastl","amaz","ani","actor","keep","straight","face","act","alongsid","suppos","take","serious","thei","get","someon","east","london","plai","part","beyond","bang","job","hehe","c","mr","frodo","mean","expect","take","serious","elijah","wood","kick","ass","peopl","twice","hi","size","genuin","nasti","hooligan","dead","simpl","honestli","brit","hard","watch","thi","film","pretti","sure","thi","film","bomb","uk","mai","littl","well","state","becaus","american","wont","know","care","inaccur","br","br","pleas","american","foreign","friend","believ","word","thi","nonsens","ye","thi","firm","exist","extrem","underground","hush","hush","vastli","small","scale","movi","onli","get","becaus","thei","actual","film","london","usual","thei","try","film","thi","thing","cardiff","wale","someth","expect","u","notic"],"filtered2":["background","english","live","london","life","mani","game","den","london","club","ground","familiar","typ","person","get","hooligan","know","act","speak","bad","bad","tell","green","street","unrealist","ever","see","spend","cring","embarrass","feel","write","mini","review","becaus","feel","ne","point","thingsbr","peopl","talk","like","london","real","life","filmmak","take","whole","slang","thing","far","make","sound","stupid","unfortun","hooligan","typ","exist","see","green","street","like","parodi","b","actor","plai","pete","dunham","charli","hunnam","unfortun","sound","english","cocknei","osama","bin","lade","north","newcastl","amaz","ani","actor","keep","straight","face","act","alongsid","suppos","take","serious","get","someon","east","london","plai","part","beyond","bang","job","hehe","c","mr","frodo","mean","expect","take","serious","elijah","wood","kick","ass","peopl","twice","si

{"value":"If Mr Cranky had rated this, I'd be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here. But as he hasn't, I'll have to give it a go myself.<br /><br />The only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent. However not even he can save this film from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad '70's movies. Even worse, both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was.<br /><br />It's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the Proxate Corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container/slave ship to Nigeria. This ship's computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via USB 12 or something. The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name.<br /><br />I honestly can't find one scene that I could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie. I only watched it to the end as I had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I won't hold this against him as he's a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie.<br /><br />So, unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you're male and you're doctor isn't doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you're really

{"value":"This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen, as it's absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!. The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring, and there isn't one character to root for either, plus I hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end, it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late, and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks, plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee's, as it was rather gory. I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen, as It's absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say avoid it like the plague!, you don't want to go through the torture. The Direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! job here, making every thing look cheap, wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace. The Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled!!). Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura, as she didn't convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she did have a creepy smile at the end though. Rest of the cast, I didn't pay enough attention too, as I had a lot of trouble getting through it, but they were all really bad. Overall please avoid this,It's not worth the agony!.

{"value":"If you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium.<br /><br />Unfortunately the Butcher Brothers haven't grasped this yet.<br /><br />This film sucks, unlike the majority of its characters who (if you didn't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you) preference stringing up the plentiful supply of 'no one knows where I am' cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger, past their isolated door.<br /><br />The only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy.<br /><br />Forced to up sticks (as opposed stakes) on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are none too bright. If they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate, thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy.<br /><br />Why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother I am not sure. It added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate given that there wasn't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all.<br /><br />One was never told why the parents had died, unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again, it was for the viewer to write their own reason.<br /><br />The only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like Pugsley from the Adams Family.

{"value":"I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. Me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it's always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a 'Lexicon' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesn't exist! In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. Talk about ego!

{"value":"Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist. Cinema was one of his biggest passions (he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life. But the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews: \"Tiré à Part\" (1996) in spite of Terence Stamp's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters, \"une Affaire De Goût\" (2000) was a slick affair even if Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverse performance, \"Pas Si Grave\" (2003) was another let-down and \"un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence\" is as underwhelming as its predecessors. Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way.<br /><br />And however, the starting idea let predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion. To play with their guests, they pretend to part company with each other. And things don't go as planned because the announcement of their separation doesn't surprise them. The two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple.<br /><br />In spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal, Rapp's undistinguished directing can't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters who have specific well-known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. A bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences. Even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable. They seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor.<br /><br />It's regrettable to say it: Bernard Rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as \"un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence\" bears

{"value":"I think I agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake. Even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average. \"Dark Remains\" is basically a Ghost Movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you. The movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter-webbed which even later are not tied together. A couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed. They move to a country house to flee their past and guess what... the house is haunted, kind of. From here on Dark Remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed (The first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good). OK, then... Woman sees ghost of daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear, man tries to solve secret of houses past, woman gets depressed, strange neighbors appear. Its pretty much all been there, but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice, so you wait for the twist. There is no twist, you are just confused by a haunted house history story, the strange neighbor, a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo-idea reminding me a lot of \"The shutter\". The end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick, of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music. <br /><br />To make it short... Dark Remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere.Too many stories mushed together which just don't make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie. And beside... please never use abandoned prisons again. Its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all. \"Hey, there is this creepy prison uphill, lets shoot there\". I guess a lot of ingredients in Dark Remains were thrown in the mix like this.","finished_norm":["i","think","i","agre","that","a","lot","of","the","comment","here","must","be","fake","even","if","the","movi","be","not","necessarili","bad","it","definit","below","averag","dark","remain","be","basic","a","ghost","movi","with","a","premis","of","your","own","ghost","and","bad","emot","haunt","you","the","movi","start","off","alreadi","with","stori","loos","interweb","which","even","late","be","not","tie","togeth","a","coupl","lose","it","child","which","be","find","slash","in","it","bed","thei","move","to","a","countri","hous","to","flee","their","past","and","guess","what","the","hous","be","haunt","kind","of","from","here","on","dark","remain","start","off","veri","slow","with","some","scari","moment","ind","the","ghost","appear","be","nice","and","the","flashlight","sequenc","conjur","work","veri","good","okai","then","woman","see","ghost","of","daughter","other","ghost","of","peopl","die","in","accid","or","suicid","appear","man","try","to","solv","secret","of","hous","past","woman","get","depress","strang","neighbor","appear","it","pretti","much","all","be","there","but","the","premis","of","it","be","their","own","emot","be","nice","so","you","wait","for","the","twist","there","be","no","twist","you","be","just","confus","by","a","haunt","hous","histori","stori","the","strang","neighbor","a","total","pointless","creepi","prison","and","the","dead","daughter","throw","togeth","with","a","photoidea","remind","me","a","lot","of","the","shutter","the","end","be","ridicul","becaus","when","you","start","and","end","a","movi","thi","slow","and","with","piano","music","it","pretti","lame","to","includ","some","hoard","of","ghost","at","onc","which","look","like","a","zombi","flick","of","cours","just","to","return","to","slow","pace","and","piano","music","br","br","to","make","it","short","dark","remain","can","have","be","a","nice","scari","ghost","stori","if","the","script","be","not","try","to","go","everywher","and","arriv","nowheretoo","mani","stori","mush","togeth","which","just","do","not","make","ani","sens","and","contradict","in","the","basic","atmospher","of","the","movi","and","besid","pleas","never","us","abandon","prison","again","it","so","wear","off","and","in","thi","case","it","even","make","no","sens","at","all","hei","there","be","thi","creepi","prison","uphil","let","shoot","there","i","guess","a","lot","of","ingredi","in","dark","remain","be","throw","in","the","mix","like","thi"],"filtered":["think","agre","lot","comment","must","fake","even","movi","necessarili","bad","definit","averag","dark","remain","basic","ghost","movi","premis","ghost","bad","emot","haunt","movi","start","alreadi","stori","loos","interweb","even","late","tie","togeth","coupl","lose","child","find","slash","bed","thei","move","countri","hous","flee","past","guess","hous","haunt","kind","dark","remain","start","veri","slow","scari","moment","ind","ghost","appear","nice","flashlight","sequenc","conjur","work","veri","good","okai","woman","see","ghost","daughter","ghost","peopl","die","accid","suicid","appear","man","try","solv","secret","hous","past","woman","get","depress","strang","neighbor","appear","pretti","much","premis","emot","nice","wait","twist","twist","confus","haunt","hous","histori","stori","strang","neighbor","total","pointless","creepi","prison","dead","daughter","throw","togeth","photoidea","remind","lot","shutter","end","ridicul","becaus","start","end","movi","thi","slow","piano","music","pretti","lame","includ","hoard","ghost","onc","look","like","zombi","flick","cours","return","slow","pace","piano","music","br","br","make","short","dark","remain","nice","scari","ghost","stori","script","try","go","everywher","arriv","nowheretoo","mani","stori","mush","togeth","make","ani","sens","contradict","basic","atmospher","movi","besid","pleas","never","us","abandon","prison","wear","thi","case","even","make","sens","hei","thi","creepi","prison","uphil","let","shoot","guess","lot","ingredi","dark","remain","throw","mix","like","thi"],"filtered2":["think","agre","lot","comment","must","fake","even","necessarili","bad","definit","averag","dark","remain","basic","ghost","premis","ghost","bad","emot","haunt","start","alreadi","stori","loos","interweb","even","late","tie","togeth","coupl","lose","child","find","slash","bed","move","countri","hous","flee","past","guess","hous","haunt","kind","dark","remain","start","veri","slow","scari","moment","ind","ghost","appear","nice","flashlight","sequenc","conjur","work","veri","good","okai","woman","see","ghost","daughter","ghost","peopl","die","accid","suicid","appear","man","try","solv","secret","hous","past","woman","get","depress","strang","neighbor","appear","pretti","premis","emot","nice","wait","twist","twist","confus","haunt","hous","histori","stori","strang","neighbor","total","pointless","creepi","prison","dead","daughter","throw","togeth","photoidea","remind","lot","shutter","end","ridicul","becaus","start","end","slow","piano","

{"value":"JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is as the name implies a ghost story. The theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy!<br /><br />A woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot. There is really nothing more to it. The movie comprises of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death.<br /><br />Immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of a \"straight-to-DVD\" effort. Unlike gems such as VACANCY 2, the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives \"straight-to-DVD\" movies a bad name! The direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense, scares or tension. Even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring.<br /><br />The acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career.<br /><br />Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerating!<br /><br />The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs. I stress the word \"few\" in that sentence. This is not overall one of the \"so-bad-it's-good\" movies like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. If you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE EYE (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE.<br /><br />I advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing JESSICA: A GHOST STORY to keep up the good work!

{"value":"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!!!<br /><br />I had read the book \"1st to die\" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I watched it. For the most part it did. There were some MINOR differences(location of the last violent scene for instance) but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies.<br /><br />This may have been a mistake-although the movie was perfectly cast-with Pollen and Bellows especially-I was not that impressed with the book. Or let me take that back. I started off very impressed, gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped. No difference with The movie. Here is why.<br /><br />There is no \"payoff\" in the book, or the movie. Rarely have I read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it's final resolution and I had hoped the movie would vary a little.<br /><br />The whole-(he did it, NO she did it, NO they BOTH did it)-was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing then anything else. Add to that, that the love of Lindsay's life dies at the end(after HER disease cleares and she cries at his grave).. and then cut to where she's contemplating suicide....then all of a sudden she's in a fight for her life with the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested.. but it turns out he and the wife were in it together....HELLO!!! This whole thing has now become \"GENERAL HOSPITAL\" instead of a good old fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie(I must admit it held my attention nicely -the acting was very good for a TV movie)was hoping it wouldn't follow the book which it wound up doing.<br /><br />I still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book(or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen)But I have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at

{"value":"Because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot, I'd like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers here; I don't care enough to filter them out.<br /><br />- Given the film's low budget, the creature design was quite good. It's actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror film that's not slathered with awful CGI. Unfortunately the digital film quality's quite grainy in places, and it's most noticeable in the well-lit white halls of the asylum.<br /><br />- Ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film, to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time. I understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia, but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established. As-is, it merely seems amateurish.<br /><br />- Plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable. I neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists, nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil-trumps-good development would surface at the end.<br /><br />- This may seem like quibbling, but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense. First of all, regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest-induced. Why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies? Why wasn't a plot point made of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion? What's the background? What's supposed to make us care about anyone in this? And just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency? This film didn't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Bottom line: See The Wicker Man

{"value":"As hard as it is for me to believe, with all of the awful reality shows out there over the past few years, this one has to take over the top spot for worst one yet. I am still wondering if this was actually just a spoof done by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann were still alive I'd be sure he was behind this. Can a rock band stoop any lower than has INXS to do such a shameful thing as this? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime. So they trot all of these awful singers (I thought American Idol had its share of doozies) who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable. And then they cut to the INXS band members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rock performers at just about any night club in any city in the world.<br /><br />It has all the usual uncreative elements of every other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame host/emcee, lame \"judging\" of performances, and the lame booting of one participant at the end of each show. Can these shows get any more predictable? It's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band; a last gasp of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are finally buried into oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of dignity when alive, has to be rolling over in his grave. Not that INXS were ever a great band, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If INXS are at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.","finished_norm":["a","hard","a","it","be","for","me","to","believ","with","all","of","the","aw","realiti","show","out","there","over","the","past","few","year","thi","on","have","to","take","over","the","top","spot","for","wrong","on","yet","i","be","still","wonder","if","thi","be","actual","just","a","spoof","do","by","the","sctv","gang","if","andi","kaufmann","be","still","aliv","i","have","be","sure","he","be","behind","thi","can","a","rock","band","stoop","ani","low","than","have","inx","to","do","such","a","shame","thing","a","thi","the","premis","be","simpl","and","moron","audit","a","bunch","of","karaok","reject","to","becom","the","new","lead","singer","of","inx","to","take","the","place","of","michael","hutchenc","who","commit","suicid","in","eight","year","and","no","hit","late","the","band","commit","the","ultim","act","of","pathet","by","subject","themselv","to","audit","a","bunch","of","talentless","wannab","to","be","the","new","lead","singer","of","a","band","that","be","year","past","it","prime","so","thei","trot","all","of","thi","aw","singer","i","think","american","idol","have","it","share","of","doozi","who","do","atroci","rendit","of","just","about","everi","classic","and","predict","rock","song","imagin","and","then","thei","cut","to","the","inx","band","member","who","be","serious","discuss","the","merit","of","each","of","thi","candid","you","can","see","well","and","much","origin","rock","perform","at","just","about","ani","night","club","in","ani","citi","in","the","worldbr","br","it","have","all","the","usual","uncr","elem","of","everi","other","realiti","show","lame","realiti","particip","lame","interview","lame","hostemce","lame","judg","of","perform","and","the","lame","boot","of","on","particip","at","the","end","of","each","show","can","thi","show","get","ani","much","predict","it","clearli","a","public","stunt","on","the","part","of","the","band","a","last","gasp","of","hope","at","rekindl","their","lose","stardom","befor","thei","be","final","buri","into","oblivion","michael","hutchenc","if","he","have","ani","shred","of","digniti","when","aliv","have","to","be","roll","over","in","hi","grave","not","that","inx","be","ever","a","great","band","but","i","have","no","idea","thei","be","thi","pathet","if","inx","be","at","all","repres","of","what","rock","and","roll","have","becom","thi","show","would","be","the","final","proof","that","rock","and","roll","be","onc","and","for","all","dead"],"filtered":["hard","believ","aw","realiti","show","past","year","thi","take","top","spot","wrong","yet","still","wonder","thi","actual","spoof","sctv","gang","andi","kaufmann","still","aliv","sure","behind","thi","rock","band","stoop","ani","low","inx","shame","thing","thi","premis","simpl","moron","audit","bunch","karaok","reject","becom","new","lead","singer","inx","take","place","michael","hutchenc","commit","suicid","eight","year","hit","late","band","commit","ultim","act","pathet","subject","themselv","audit","bunch","talentless","wannab","new","lead","singer","band","year","past","prime","thei","trot","thi","aw","singer","think","american","idol","share","doozi","atroci","rendit","everi","classic","predict","rock","song","imagin","thei","cut","inx","band","member","serious","discuss","merit","thi","candid","see","well","much","origin","rock","perform","ani","night","club","ani","citi","worldbr","br","usual","uncr","elem","everi","realiti","show","lame","realiti","particip","lame","interview","lame","hostemce","lame","judg","perform","lame","boot","particip","end","show","thi","show","get","ani","much","predict","clearli","public","stunt","part","band","last","gasp","hope","rekindl","lose","stardom","befor","thei","final","buri","oblivion","michael","hutchenc","ani","shred","digniti","aliv","roll","hi","grave","inx","ever","great","band","idea","thei","thi","pathet","inx","repres","rock","roll","becom","thi","show","final","proof","rock","roll","onc","dead"],"filtered2":["hard","believ","aw","realiti","show","past","year","take","top","spot","wrong","yet","still","wonder","actual","spoof","sctv","gang","andi","kaufmann","still","aliv","sure","behind","rock","band","stoop","ani","low","inx","shame","thing","premis","simpl","moron","audit","bunch","karaok","reject","becom","new","lead","singer","inx","take","place","michael","hutchenc","commit","suicid","eight","year","hit","late","band","commit","ultim","act","pathet","subject","themselv","audit","bunch","talentless","wannab","new","lead","singer","band","year","past","prime","trot","aw","singer","think","american","idol","share","doozi","atroci","rendit","everi","classic","predict","rock","song","imagin","cut","inx","band","member","serious","discuss","merit","candid","see","well","origin","rock","perform","ani","night","club","ani","citi","worldbr","usual","uncr","elem","everi","realiti","show","lame","realiti","particip","lame","interview","lame","hostemce","lame","judg","perform","lame","boot","particip","end","show","show",

{"value":"It's boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated Prizzi's Honor disappoints. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston had lost it by this point in his career but I don't buy it. Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark character study set in Mexico, that ranks among the finest he ever did. Prizzi's Honor on the other hand, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a major letdown.<br /><br />The overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit-man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught Hollywood by storm in the early 90's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake, the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga etc. Jack Nicholson (doing a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode, just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts. Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivations: she starts out the victim of her bigot father's disdain, she proves to be supportive to her ex-husband, then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate.<br /><br />The colours of the movie have a washed-up quality like it was made in the early 70's and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else. There's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could've been morphed to something better but what's left looks like a film nobody was really

{"value":"Flame in, flame out. That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster films, but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci-fi collection put out by Mill Creek/Treeline Films. It's a great value at about twenty five bucks, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.<br /><br />Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast, and he's not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out on Tokyo, setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and wouldn't you know it, there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'Z Plan' building; that was a nice touch.<br /><br />By the mid 1960's, this country still wasn't quite politically correct. One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. I guess there weren't any privates around.<br /><br />Good old Gammera was quite the sight though, walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. That's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, whisking him off to Mars to save the world. High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save, now let's get back to the Cold War.<br /><br />Like Godzilla, Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles.

{"value":"\"Nat\" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), along with his brainiac friend \"IQ\" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the always hungry \"Scooter\" (David Gore) are kids with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, the Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is the animation of the film. I found it done very well done. The scenery had depth to it, as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes. I didn't see the movie in 3-D, as it was broadcast on HBO. However, I could see that there really wasn't any scenes which took advantage of the 3-D effects except a fight between characters near the end. I also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters. To me, they didn't look like anything resembling a fly, especially in the coloring. The flies were an unusual blue-gray that was kind of distracting to me.<br /><br />The performances from the cast was not bad, but it wasn't good either. There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh. I saw nothing for adults, like jokes that they'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning.<br /><br />History was not followed in this film. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies. I also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction, and no flies were on Apollo 11. I did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though.<br /><br />If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not made for the entire family. This is certainly just for kids. But, save this one for a rainy day.","finished_norm":["nat","voic","by","trevor","gagnon","along","with","hi","brainiac","friend","iq","voic","by","philip","bolden","and","the","alwai","hungri","scooter","david","gore","be","kid","with","big","dream","thei","want","to","be","the","fly","in","space","and","what","encourag","their","dream","be","the","spacecraft","to","land","on","the","moon","the","apollo","be","wait","for","it","histor","trip","on","the","launch","pad","near","where","the","three","hang","outbr","br","the","thing","you","notic","be","the","anim","of","the","film","i","find","it","do","veri","good","do","the","sceneri","have","depth","to","it","a","thing","in","the","distanc","actual","look","like","thei","be","behind","the","focu","of","the","scene","i","do","not","see","the","movi","in","have","a","it","be","broadcast","on","hbo","howev","i","can","see","that","there","realli","be","not","ani","scene","which","take","advantag","of","the","have","effect","except","a","fight","between","charact","near","the","end","i","conjur","be","not","realli","impress","with","the","design","of","the","charact","to","me","thei","do","not","look","like","anyth","resembl","a","fly","especi","in","the","color","the","fly","be","a","unusu","bluegrai","that","be","kind","of","distract","to","mebr","br","the","perform","from","the","cast","be","not","bad","but","it","be","not","good","either","there","be","mani","time","i","focu","much","on","my","comput","than","the","stori","the","write","be","certainli","write","for","a","young","audienc","with","comed","moment","that","will","make","young","kid","laugh","i","see","noth","for","adult","like","joke","that","thei","will","get","the","punchlin","for","the","adult","to","understand","the","meaningbr","br","histori","be","not","follow","in","thi","film","in","fact","i","think","it","be","complet","ignor","a","the","main","focu","be","the","fly","i","conjur","hate","when","a","good","know","astronaut","pop","up","on","the","screen","and","explain","that","the","stori","about","the","fly","in","the","film","be","a","work","of","fiction","and","no","fly","be","on","apollo","i","do","like","how","he","thank","the","man","and","woman","who","sacrific","their","live","for","space","explor","thoughbr","br","if","you","be","a","adult","thi","be","not","for","you","it","be","not","make","for","the","entir","famili","thi","be","certainli","just","for","kid","but","save","thi","on","for","a","raini","dai"],"filtered":["nat","voic","trevor","gagnon","along","hi","brainiac","friend","iq","voic","philip","bolden","alwai","hungri","scooter","david","gore","kid","big","dream","thei","want","fly","space","encourag","dream","spacecraft","land","moon","apollo","wait","histor","trip","launch","pad","near","three","hang","outbr","br","thing","notic","anim","film","find","veri","good","sceneri","depth","thing","distanc","actual","look","like","thei","behind","focu","scene","see","movi","broadcast","hbo","howev","see","realli","ani","scene","take","advantag","effect","except","fight","charact","near","end","conjur","realli","impress","design","charact","thei","look","like","anyth","resembl","fly","especi","color","fly","unusu","bluegrai","kind","distract","mebr","br","perform","cast","bad","good","either","mani","time","focu","much","comput","stori","write","certainli","write","young","audienc","comed","moment","make","young","kid","laugh","see","noth","adult","like","joke","thei","get","punchlin","adult","understand","meaningbr","br","histori","follow","thi","film","fact","think","complet","ignor","main","focu","fly","conjur","hate","good","know","astronaut","pop","screen","explain","stori","fly","film","work","fiction","fly","apollo","like","thank","man","woman","sacrific","live","space","explor","thoughbr","br","adult","thi","make","entir","famili","thi","certainli","kid","save","thi","raini","dai"],"filtered2":["nat","voic","trevor","gagnon","along","brainiac","friend","iq","voic","philip","bolden","alwai","hungri","scooter","david","gore","kid","big","dream","want","fly","space","encourag","dream","spacecraft","land","moon","apollo","wait","histor","trip","launch","pad","near","three","hang","outbr","thing","notic","anim","find","veri","good","sceneri","depth","thing","distanc","actual","look","like","behind","focu","scene","see","broadcast","hbo","howev","see","realli","ani","scene","take","advantag","effect","except","fight","charact","near","end","conjur","realli","impress","design","charact","look","like","anyth","resembl","fly","especi","color","fly","unusu","bluegrai","kind","distract","mebr","perform","cast","bad","good","either","mani","time","focu","comput","stori","write","certainli","write","young","audienc","comed","moment","make","young","kid","laugh","see","noth","adult","like","joke","get","punchlin","adult","understand","meaningbr","histori","follow","fact","think","complet","ignor","main","focu","fly","conjur","hate","good","know","astronaut","pop","screen","explain","stori","fly","work","fict

{"value":"The '80's were not very kind to one-time major star Charles Bronson. Starting with 1982's \"Death Wish II\" and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89, Bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness. \"D.W. II\" left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson's character's daughter, (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail). \"10 to Midnight\" was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeeming about it. Other films like \"The Evil that Men Do\" and the remaining \"Death Wish\" films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out of showing a weary looking, senior citizen-aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the shoddy craftsmanship (and terrible scripts) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated.<br /><br />\"Kinjite\" -- the last of these films -- is fairly well-made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness. In this film Bronson: sodomizes a perverse john; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I've thankfully forgotten. Also depicted is the gang-rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, though well-implied).<br /><br />What were people thinking when they made this film? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films?

{"value":"I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, appealing and talented actress. I'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it. Nothing does. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I scanned through the remaining 20-odd minutes. Excruciating.<br /><br />Freeman plays an actor - who hasn't worked in a while - researching a part that he might play, as a checkout clerk in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to give him a ride home and they go to an Arby's, a Target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They converse about their lives. Nothing happens. Ever.<br /><br />I don't get it. But I also don't get the Bill Murray flicks \"Lost In Translation\" and \"Broken Flowers\". If you like those movies, maybe you'll like this. Lots of people find movies like this whimsical, charming, or - for reasons that escape me - find the dialog fascinating. A common device in movies of this ilk is to have a LONG take of stillness/silence after an actor delivers a line that's supposed to be meaningful. We know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be a philistine. I don't get it. To me, these kinds of movies aren't funny, or charming, or thought-provoking. They're just boring. Why? Because there's no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laughs. No suspense. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I go to the movies for. I can be bored for free. I see oddball/quirky characters in real life. I go to Target, and fast-food restaurants, and car-washes. These elements do not a movie make, even if stars are doing this stuff. I pay to be entertained.<br /><br />If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing, have fun. If you wanna drool over Paz Vega, you can look and listen to her.
