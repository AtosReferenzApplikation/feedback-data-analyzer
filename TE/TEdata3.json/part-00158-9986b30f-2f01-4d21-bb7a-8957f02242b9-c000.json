{"value":"I don't remember \"Barnaby Jones\" being no more than a very bland, standard detective show in which, as per any Quinn Martin show, Act I was the murder, Act II was the lead character figuring out the murder, Act III was the plot twist (another character murdered), Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show.<br /><br />One thing I do remember was the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith's excellent theme song. Strangely, the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air. I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being badly miscast. I just wished the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered it.<br /><br />Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of American Television channel. Let's just say that I was more kind than Goldsmith about the show \"Barnaby Jones.\"","finished_norm":["i","do","not","rememb","barnabi","jone","be","no","much","than","a","veri","bland","standard","detect","show","in","which","a","per","ani","quinn","martin","show","act","i","be","the","murder","act","ii","be","the","lead","charact","figur","out","the","murder","act","iii","be","the","plot","twist","anoth","charact","murder","act","iv","be","the","resolut","and","the","epilogu","be","betti","lee","meriweth","ask","her","fatherinlaw","barnabi","jone","buddi","ebsen","how","he","figur","out","the","crime","and","then","someon","sai","someth","witti","at","the","end","of","the","showbr","br","on","thing","i","do","rememb","be","the","late","great","compos","jerri","goldsmith","excel","theme","song","strang","the","open","credit","sequenc","make","me","want","to","see","the","show","off","and","on","for","the","seven","season","the","show","be","on","the","air","i","will","conjur","admit","that","it","be","nice","to","see","ebsen","in","a","role","other","than","jed","clampett","despit","ebsen","be","badli","miscast","i","just","wish","the","show","be","much","entertain","than","when","i","rememb","itbr","br","updat","i","watch","a","interview","with","compos","jerri","goldsmith","on","youtub","through","their","archiv","of","american","televis","channel","let","just","sai","that","i","be","much","kind","than","goldsmith","about","the","show","barnabi","jone"],"filtered":["rememb","barnabi","jone","much","veri","bland","standard","detect","show","per","ani","quinn","martin","show","act","murder","act","ii","lead","charact","figur","murder","act","iii","plot","twist","anoth","charact","murder","act","iv","resolut","epilogu","betti","lee","meriweth","ask","fatherinlaw","barnabi","jone","buddi","ebsen","figur","crime","someon","sai","someth","witti","end","showbr","br","thing","rememb","late","great","compos","jerri","goldsmith","excel","theme","song","strang","open","credit","sequenc","make","want","see","show","seven","season","show","air","conjur","admit","nice","see","ebsen","role","jed","clampett","despit","ebsen","badli","miscast","wish","show","much","entertain","rememb","itbr","br","updat","watch","interview","compos","jerri","goldsmith","youtub","archiv","american","televis","channel","let","sai","much","kind","goldsmith","show","barnabi","jone"],"filtered2":["rememb","barnabi","jone","veri","bland","standard","detect","show","per","ani","quinn","martin","show","act","murder","act","ii","lead","charact","figur","murder","act","iii","plot","twist","anoth","charact","murder","act","iv","resolut","epilogu","betti","lee","meriweth","ask","fatherinlaw","barnabi","jone","buddi","ebsen","figur","crime","someon","someth","witti","end","showbr","thing","rememb","late","great","compos","jerri","goldsmith","excel","theme","song","strang","open","credit","sequenc","make","want","see","show","seven","season","show","air","conjur","admit","nice","see","ebsen","role","jed","clampett","despit","ebsen","badli","miscast","wish","show","entertain","rememb","itbr","updat","watch","interview","compos","jerri","goldsmith","youtub","archiv","american","televis","channel","let","kind","goldsmith","show","barnabi","jone"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,10,15,21,24,27,28,29,32,37,39,51,53,73,122,124,128,139,150,157,195,223,242,262,273,290,306,328,349,356,391,399,415,417,431,435,448,533,570,580,616,663,679,691,728,753,817,1028,1063,1091,1169,1195,1232,1302,1432,1508,1541,1943,2275,2376,2497,2559,2571,2640,3026,3257,3820,3940,4996,7369,7682],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,10,15,21,24,27,28,29,32,37,39,51,53,73,122,124,128,139,150,157,195,223,242,262,273,290,306,328,349,356,391,399,415,417,431,435,448,533,570,580,616,663,679,691,728,753,817,1028,1063,1091,1169,1195,1232,1302,1432,1508,1541,1943,2275,2376,2497,2559,2571,2640,3026,3257,3820,3940,4996,7369,7682],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.2000607798565692,4.648062181340196,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,9.271376516111456,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.8950689206770979,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,2.2939035841256437,2.332712011146513,2.3360150694757706,2.51289241584188,2.825563294794476,2.689504733779216,2.726701583487816,8.90225758755883,8.583844132189668,2.8739486825973213,3.1550424959247185,3.0568369721919364,3.028335462059722,3.109204957709252,3.129115117668582,6.317603797697249,3.1932880749197934,3.1419947805322432,3.2829611516442836,3.2681460658591432,3.4933926673701317,3.944626193933877,3.5039747767006686,3.5173618574831282,3.7297814454343

{"value":"This movie was slower then Molasses in January... in Alaska. The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview. I had to wake up the people I was watching it with, several times. After it was over, I felt bad for having woken them up. <br /><br />Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen, but nothing ever does. It was easy to loose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninteristing. By the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would died. Everyone runs around either being contemptible, petty, or pitiful, and usually all three. <br /><br />And worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are. If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back, it might have been worth watching. <br /><br />I was brought in expecting the excitement of '24.'

{"value":"**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br /><br />The titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father (an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next) from a moth-eaten, dime-store mummy and nasty Nazis out to--what else?--build a Fourth Reich. Misty's costume, like those of some other wimmen, gets skimpier as the movie rolls on. The last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action; this footage actually gets real boring, real fast, which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it. MISTY gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast, then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: if this wonder-work had been cranked out four decades ago, it would have played for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to home video.

{"value":"This movie is not just bad, not just corny, it is repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the creepy call-girl, about the whole damn (and I use the word literally) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress. This film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean.<br /><br />One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the cliché Worst Nightmare and the overdone Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating film idea.<br /><br />Thought: The reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights. During the day, bright lights don't show up well, so they could go anywhere.<br /><br />Count the Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio, and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie.<br /><br />Discussion Question: If you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead?

{"value":"I liked Boyle's performance, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded, stone-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. The raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. And what's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung, or thereabouts. I wasted $4 renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same

{"value":"Just finished watching, can't say I was impressed.<br /><br />It starts of quite good, the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should. But it all ends when the first lordi monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the band lordi, but they are seriously malplaced in the movie. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's.<br /><br />As for the storyline, it starts of as similar horror movies, people trapped inside a hell hole. But there is no clear story on why and what is happening. The viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess.<br /><br />With all the money spent on this film, with an intriguing start and some good effects, I had thought someone would have taken better care of the product. I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary (except they aren't).<br /><br />So the movie gets cred for the visuals, i guess the money had to go somewhere.

{"value":"Oh my God what the hell happened here?!! I'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in \"King Kong vs Godzilla\",Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.Its about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong.When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes.Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him.<br /><br />Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning.As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight.The ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.<br /><br />Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do... beware of the

{"value":"I have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should. I could let this slide, it is after all a movie. However I have serious issues with the setting of the movie. Nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on. First of all, the \"small\" town that is talked about as the setting, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of around 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second the scenery for the movie is wrong. Grand Island is in the Platte river valley. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried watching this movie, but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad. This was a real event. Large sections of the city were wiped out. In the book they talk about riding bikes from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I guess you could if you don't mind a 15 mile ride each way.

{"value":"Stephen King adaptation (scripted by King himself) in which a young family, newcomers to rural Maine, find out about the pet cemetery close to their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out about the Micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite RIGHT.<br /><br />Below average \"horror\" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and inept, and continues that way for a while, with the absolute worst element being Midkiff's worthless performance. It gets a little better toward the end, with genuinely disturbing finale. In point of fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why I can't completely dismiss it - at least it has SOMETHING to make it memorable. Decent supporting performances by Fred Gwynne, as the wise old aged neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as the disfigured spirit Victor Pascow are not enough to really redeem film.<br /><br />King has his usual cameo as the minister.<br /><br />Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since?).<br /><br

{"value":"I found Darkness to be just too DARK. It had a kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and a few splashy moments to make you go UGH! BUT, it was underlit to the point of confusion. You don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty grain to deal with. As with Nathan Schiff movies, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it. The camera is never pointed in the right place, lack of fundamentals such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to light a movie hurt as well. The actors are all pretty uneven and hammy. But despite these negatives, the music is good, the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances. Is this a classic like it says? Is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise? NO. But it is a good first try. Now if these guys would stop patting themselves on the back about this movie (from what I understand here the only one they have ever finished) for a while and try again, they may do better.","finished_norm":["i","find","dark","to","be","just","too","dark","it","have","a","kind","of","cool","idea","and","some","ambiti","idea","not","bad","action","scene","and","a","few","splashi","moment","to","make","you","go","ugh","but","it","be","underlit","to","the","point","of","confus","you","do","not","realli","know","what","be","alwai","go","on","in","the","dark","scene","and","for","a","film","that","be","shoot","on","super","film","you","alreadi","have","all","that","nasti","grain","to","deal","with","a","with","nathan","schiff","movi","it","just","too","much","director","leif","jonker","seem","to","want","to","make","a","origin","film","but","he","lack","the","knowhow","to","do","it","the","camera","be","never","point","in","the","right","place","lack","of","fundament","such","a","how","to","shoot","simpl","dialogu","scene","and","how","to","light","a","movi","hurt","a","good","the","actor","be","all","pretti","uneven","and","hammi","but","despit","thi","neg","the","music","be","good","the","gore","be","plenti","and","rang","from","silli","putti","to","realli","good","applianc","be","thi","a","classic","like","it","sai","be","it","worthi","of","the","two","disc","worth","of","prais","no","but","it","be","a","good","try","now","if","thi","gui","would","stop","pat","themselv","on","the","back","about","thi","movi","from","what","i","understand","here","the","onli","on","thei","have","ever","finish","for","a","while","and","try","again","thei","mai","do","well"],"filtered":["find","dark","dark","kind","cool","idea","ambiti","idea","bad","action","scene","splashi","moment","make","go","ugh","underlit","point","confus","realli","know","alwai","go","dark","scene","film","shoot","super","film","alreadi","nasti","grain","deal","nathan","schiff","movi","much","director","leif","jonker","seem","want","make","origin","film","lack","knowhow","camera","never","point","right","place","lack","fundament","shoot","simpl","dialogu","scene","light","movi","hurt","good","actor","pretti","uneven","hammi","despit","thi","neg","music","good","gore","plenti","rang","silli","putti","realli","good","applianc","thi","classic","like","sai","worthi","two","disc","worth","prais","good","try","thi","gui","stop","pat","themselv","back","thi","movi","understand","onli","thei","ever","finish","try","thei","mai","well"],"filtered2":["find","dark","dark","kind","cool","idea","ambiti","idea","bad","action","scene","splashi","moment","make","go","ugh","underlit","point","confus","realli","know","alwai","go","dark","scene","shoot","super","alreadi","nasti","grain","deal","nathan","schiff","director","leif","jonker","seem","want","make","origin","lack","knowhow","camera","never","point","right","place","lack","fundament","shoot","simpl","dialogu","scene","light","hurt","good","actor","pretti","uneven","hammi","despit","neg","music","good","gore","plenti","rang","silli","putti","realli","good","applianc","classic","like","worthi","two","disc","worth","prais","good","try","gui","stop","pat","themselv","back","understand","onli","ever","finish","try","mai","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,9,11,13,19,20,26,35,36,37,38,41,42,44,46,47,55,58,63,66,69,78,117,118,121,122,123,129,164,183,188,197,212,219,231,248,315,330,332,353,358,368,385,391,427,436,468,481,573,737,863,887,1052,1147,1337,1342,1553,1645,2182,2978,3221,3352,3394,3444,3476,7654,7753,8158],"values":[2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,9,11,13,19,20,26,35,36,37,38,41,42,44,46,47,55,58,63,66,69,78,117,118,121,122,123,129,164,183,188,197,212,219,231,248,315,330,332,353,358,368,385,391,427,436,468,481,573,737,863,887,1052,1147,1337,1342,1553,1645,2182,2978,3221,3352,3394,3444,3476,7654,7753,8158],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,2.714457859969082,1.9416538289407692,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,3.9371420340352055,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.463169012899134,2.9360366939211433,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,1.8729627573220065,3.859446346783224,2.127032521151058,2.0064197866819473,4.5594602370234405,2.354379525480895,2.2190595059394194,2.2489347673732487,4.523814194644097,2.4106958340079214,2.3930275298746078,4.977025712729459,2.5378812223426954,2.558331832813986,2.5983793339432615,2.5792094178355414,2.7049353070058615,2.689504733779216,2.854312708080462,2.9292757465539174,2.9705344631698933,3.0266839340212486,3.2030824725120812,9.403844019703861,3.09496984188738,3.109204957709252,3.233054746047873,3.2070272508030975,3.304513710030018,3.353630724994973,3.4623020803001006,3

{"value":"yeah cheap shot i know, but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of 'deepness' (political turmoil, love/lust) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim (see also 'american beauty'). kaufman's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences (in one scene i counted three different 'generic European' accents affected by the actors) and displays of state might run amok, yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered. and in its over-long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz,the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot, and in this manner sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs. it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas' son, used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel. combined with the overweening soundtrack, these flaws make this movie's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in

{"value":"Obvious attack on Microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally.<br /><br />Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates, and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left.<br /><br />While microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times, it's unlikely they actually murder people. Therefore, the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning.<br /><br />The \"deeper\" point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property.<br /><br />It's one thing to be opposed to anti-competitive conduct -- that's common sense. It's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place, which is what the film's mantra (\"knowledge belongs to mankind\") represents.<br /><br />Yet another example of Hollywood

{"value":"Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) on trial for her life. Because the faithful dog sleeps on her master's grave, she must be put to death, according to law. Oddly, it is also explained that Lassie had no \"legal\" owner, which is, apparently, also against an old Scottish law. If, after three days, no owner is located, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) pleads Lassie's case, which leads to an extended flashback, showing Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp (as John \"Jock\" Gray).<br /><br />Although it's based on an interesting, original story (\"Greyfriars Bobby\"), \"Challenge to Lassie\" revisits several earlier Lassie situations; and, it does not improve upon them. Comparatively speaking, this one is sloppy and unexciting; and, it's a disappointing follow-up to \"The Sun Comes Up\" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and several of the other performers may be charming, but can't elevate this one.

{"value":"TV version of \"Twister\" springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable. My sister bought this at a Wal-Mart a few years back when it was released, I saw it back then and thought it was okay. Later \"Twister\" with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt comes out (or was it before? I think it was '97) and did a better job overall. But \"Twister\" was more silly fun; this is realistic with a message. It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters, or a low-budget character study?<br /><br />John Schneider and Devon Sawa (he's the reason my sister bought it) star, and Devon Sawa, who went on to \"Wild America,\" \"Final Destination\" and \"Slackers\" got his big break here. So in a way, I was one of the first people to see him really take off. I don't know if it's an honor or a shame, I haven't seen how he acts in recent films.<br /><br />\"Night of the Twisters\" all depends on personal taste, like I said, it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters, or a low-budget character study. \"Night of the Twister\" has the latter.

{"value":"This is just plain bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they stray from the original, are good on their own. They can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. This was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be. This wasn't any good even standing on it's own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired. The original \"Vanishing Point\" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever. This was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making, stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film-going audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film, and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily.

{"value":"This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks. First thing, what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school? I think the kids doesn't seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity. Oh yea and none of them knows how to aim. The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy. They all want to look professional but they all suck. One more thing I don't believe that there's no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked. What happens if there's a fire and the dumass security guard is dead? It is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school. Anyway there's a lot more to say but it would be too long.

{"value":"The second in the Vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe.<br /><br />The tasteless, below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here. That fault surely lies with director Hackerling, who's obviously nowhere near as good a director as Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around.<br /><br />The cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it's simply not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments aren't played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (like how the English are SOOO polite).<br /><br />Apart from a few scenes, there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick.

{"value":"A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the leading roles, talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have. They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects take place, the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is definitely the worst in the movie. Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again. Another problem with the movie is the ending. It seems like Franklin did not know when to end the picture.

{"value":"Can I Do it 'till I Need Glasses? at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world, lack any semblance of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience must consist of the recently labotimized, and infants who play with their own feces. Anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film. It consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious. It ends at the ludicrous. The jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell (usually potty or sexually related) where they don't know the meaning of all of the terms they use. You know, like the one about daddy's car and mommy's garage. To apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless, since the usual standards of acting, writing, direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative \"minds.\" behind this mess. Not to be judgemental, but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth.<br /><br

{"value":"Plot Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered along with his wife by his associates. His twin sons, Chad & Alex, are split apart. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, & Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge their parents' murder & rightfully claim the tunnel.<br /><br />This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich have worked together, having previously done \"Lionheart\". This is also the first of three films to feature Van Damme playing dual roles (\"Maximum Risk\" & \"Replicant\" are the others). The plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story, the film's sole redeeming feature being Van Damme's performance as two very different people  the prissy rich kid & the rough-&-tumble, cigar chomping tough guy. As it goes, Van Damme doesn't do a very good job in either role, although his take on Alex is mildly amusing. It is puzzling as to have the brothers mistaken for each other, with them wearing different clothes & having different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes a very worthy henchman for the

{"value":"An interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital. It recalled - Stephen Kings \"Langoliers\", \"Kingdom Hospital\" and old twilight zone episodes. Atmospherically strong, the set up was great. There were also some very clever 'time loop' moments which always have that head-melt appeal. The story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of - time slips / ghosts / a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul-thing would be explained.

{"value":"SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Not really a very good movie... but I did like the idea behind it... and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with. The movie is ostensibly an \"episode\" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off \"danger zone\" and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune... everyone else just winds up dead. The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad.

The movie pretends to be done all in one take... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the \"danger zone\" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly (to hide the \"cuts\" from one take to another, I would imagine).","finished_norm":["slasher","outta","starsbr","br","not","realli","a","veri","good","movi","but","i","do","like","the","idea","behind","it","and","the","the","filmmak","do","make","it","look","pretti","good","consid","the","tini","budget","thei","have","to","work","with","the","movi","be","ostensibli","a","episod","of","a","live","japanes","realiti","show","that","send","sever","contest","into","a","seal","off","danger","zone","and","have","three","costum","creep","send","after","to","them","to","kill","them","the","survivor","if","there","be","on","win","fame","and","fortun","everyon","els","just","wind","up","dead","the","main","drawback","to","thi","movi","be","that","the","act","be","pretti","bad","none","of","the","real","peopl","seem","real","at","all","the","actor","plai","the","killer","be","kind","of","fun","becaus","thei","be","portrai","cheesi","and","overthetop","caricatur","of","popular","modern","horror","movi","typ","and","that","exactli","how","thei","would","be","do","if","thi","be","a","actual","show","the","movi","pretend","to","be","do","all","in","on","take","there","be","on","cameraman","who","follow","the","contest","around","the","danger","zone","and","everyth","be","see","from","the","point","of","view","of","hi","camera","but","the","light","keep","flicker","on","and","off","constantli","to","hide","the","cut","from","on","take","to","anoth","i","would","imagin"],"filtered":["slasher","outta","starsbr","br","realli","veri","good","movi","like","idea","behind","filmmak","make","look","pretti","good","consid","tini","budget","thei","work","movi","ostensibli","episod","live","japanes","realiti","show","send","sever","contest","seal","danger","zone","three","costum","creep","send","kill","survivor","win","fame","fortun","everyon","els","wind","dead","main","drawback","thi","movi","act","pretti","bad","none","real","peopl","seem","real","actor","plai","killer","kind","fun","becaus","thei","portrai","cheesi","overthetop","caricatur","popular","modern","horror","movi","typ","exactli","thei","thi","actual","show","movi","pretend","take","cameraman","follow","contest","around","danger","zone","everyth","see","point","view","hi","camera","light","keep","flicker","constantli","hide","cut","take","anoth","imagin"],"filtered2":["slasher","outta","starsbr","realli","veri","good","like","idea","behind","filmmak","make","look","pretti","good","consid","tini","budget","work","ostensibli","live","japanes","realiti","show","send","sever","contest","seal","danger","zone","three","costum","creep","send","kill","survivor","win","fame","fortun","everyon","els","wind","dead","main","drawback","act","pretti","bad","none","real","peopl","seem","real","actor","plai","killer","kind","fun","becaus","portrai","cheesi","overthetop","caricatur","popular","modern","horror","typ","exactli","actual","show","pretend","take","cameraman","follow","contest","around","danger","zone","everyth","see","point","view","camera","light","keep","flicker","constantli","hide","cut","take","anoth","imagin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,9,13,15,16,21,22,23,28,31,35,40,41,48,52,66,73,76,78,80,83,98,116,122,123,134,179,193,196,224,228,231,246,252,256,259,260,303,312,316,317,323,340,353,370,384,393,462,469,489,543,656,707,721,729,731,776,843,951,978,1009,1157,1368,1464,1889,1910,1921,1953,1973,2133,2202,2680,4055,4503,5558,5645,5705,6371],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,9,13,15,16,21,22,23,28,31,35,40,41,48,52,66,73,76,78,80,83,98,116,122,123,134,179,193,196,224,228,231,246,252,256,259,260,303,312,316,317,323,340,353,370,384,393,462,469,489,543,656,707,721,729,731,776,843,951,978,1009,1157,1368,1464,1889,1910,1921,1953,1973,2133,2202,2680,4055,4503,5558,5645,5705,6371],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,3.0904588387038183,2.814133962290301,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.929723173391612,1.8950689206770979,2.1337665533324026,4.012839573363895,3.9903607800925114,2.292318797740072,2.0881990796736947,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.2619070973220485,2.2443961816702407,2.507968722980095,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.689504733779216,2.7742700004069256,2.7049353070058615,2.673149229007135,3.0433232530252132,2.748952192422636,2.7464553122240485,2.6754694156628323,2.868298950055202,2.8824835850471584,2.878207028279898,2.8529247828056143,3.0433232530252132,2.948928684455311,3.0266839340212486,2.99581227035

{"value":"As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face. Talk about insulting. I was writing better stories than this in 8th grade. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure. <br /><br />The only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time. Who would green light something so poorly written? It's not artistic, clever, smart, suspenseful, mysterious, scary, dramatic-NOTHING.<br /><br />The characters are flat and boring with no development. The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next \"Pulp Fiction\". This script should have been used to line a bird cage, not a movie. <br /><br />Oh and last but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a

{"value":"i was given the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday, and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least with the movie it's over soon.<br /><br />The acting in this is terrible, which i expected from a film with Shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster (which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there). The kid in the film that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor.

About a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father.<br /><br />Even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea. It's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made. i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know just by reading the

{"value":"I watched this film alone, in the dark, and it was full moon outside! I didn't do it in purpose, it just happened in this way. So all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me!! Well, it didn't, in fact i wanted to shut off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but i thought come on give it a chance, unfortunately i did. The acting was awful, the only one with some decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before. Some scenes didn't make sense at all, and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie. The (scary) scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology, yet some good movies were made back then! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie, i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent?!!

{"value":"Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend, \"Don't try to doctor me, doctor! I'm disgustingly healthy!\" He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by \"shrinking the brain\" (?)<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Morteval/Karloff ends up dying, and murderous \"toys\" (designed by his dead brother) start killing off the relatives. A mini cannon fires real bullets into a guys face, a life-sized knight in armor attacks with an axe and a dancing Sheik stabs people with a knife. One guy getting strangled makes some hilarious faces. At the end, Julissa and her boyfriend find Karloff is still alive and hiding out in the dungeon where steel gates seal off the room. He plays the recurring organ theme music (sort of a death rattle used for the killings), the brother's spirit starts talking (\"The whole house will go with me!\") and the mansion goes up in

{"value":"There's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture just plain sucks. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.","finished_norm":["there","realli","no","wai","to","beat","around","the","bush","in","sai","thi","ladi","death","the","motion","pictur","just","plain","suck","asid","from","the","fact","that","the","main","charact","be","a","good","endow","blond","run","around","hell","in","a","leather","bikini","with","occasion","spurt","of","graphic","violenc","the","movi","seem","to","have","be","make","with","the","mental","of","a","cartoon","base","on","a","line","of","action","figur","the","bad","gui","himself","even","talk","like","a","skeletor","wannab","have","the","obligatori","inept","henchman","and","live","in","a","lair","that","look","to","have","be","pattern","after","the","domain","of","the","villain","from","the","old","saturdai","morn","blackstar","cartoon","just","do","not","expect","ani","humor","other","than","the","sometim","howlingli","bad","dialogu","at","other","time","it","feel","like","the","kind","of","anim","tale","well","suit","to","hentai","yet","there","be","no","sex","no","tentacl","rape","thank","good","and","veri","littl","sex","appeal","thi","despit","the","physic","appear","of","the","titl","charact","there","be","simpli","no","adult","edg","to","thi","materi","unless","you","count","the","halfnak","heroin","and","bloodi","death","essenti","what","we","have","here","be","a","featur","length","episod","of","shera","princess","of","power","but","with","skimpi","cloth","and","much","gore"],"filtered":["realli","wai","beat","around","bush","sai","thi","ladi","death","motion","pictur","plain","suck","asid","fact","main","charact","good","endow","blond","run","around","hell","leather","bikini","occasion","spurt","graphic","violenc","movi","seem","make","mental","cartoon","base","line","action","figur","bad","gui","even","talk","like","skeletor","wannab","obligatori","inept","henchman","live","lair","look","pattern","domain","villain","old","saturdai","morn","blackstar","cartoon","expect","ani","humor","sometim","howlingli","bad","dialogu","time","feel","like","kind","anim","tale","well","suit","hentai","yet","sex","tentacl","rape","thank","good","veri","littl","sex","appeal","thi","despit","physic","appear","titl","charact","simpli","adult","edg","thi","materi","unless","count","halfnak","heroin","bloodi","death","essenti","featur","length","episod","shera","princess","power","skimpi","cloth","much","gore"],"filtered2":["realli","wai","beat","around","bush","ladi","death","motion","pictur","plain","suck","asid","fact","main","charact","good","endow","blond","run","around","hell","leather","bikini","occasion","spurt","graphic","violenc","seem","make","mental","cartoon","base","line","action","figur","bad","gui","even","talk","like","skeletor","wannab","obligatori","inept","henchman","live","lair","look","pattern","domain","villain","old","saturdai","morn","blackstar","cartoon","expect","ani","humor","sometim","howlingli","bad","dialogu","time","feel","like","kind","anim","tale","well","suit","hentai","yet","sex","tentacl","rape","thank","good","veri","littl","sex","appeal","despit","physic","appear","titl","charact","simpli","adult","edg","materi","unless","count","halfnak","heroin","bloodi","death","essenti","featur","length","shera","princess","power","skimpi","cloth","gore"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,9,10,13,14,15,16,20,27,33,35,43,55,67,97,98,107,116,122,129,130,137,169,179,186,194,201,245,248,254,264,277,305,311,334,358,366,369,391,394,415,421,452,460,472,500,520,537,586,651,653,678,689,734,746,820,879,884,888,911,936,970,985,1021,1099,1146,1179,1197,1308,1414,1552,1650,1695,1793,1920,2147,2969,3405,3516,3713,3748,4232,5105,7068,7931],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,9,10,13,14,15,16,20,27,33,35,43,55,67,97,98,107,116,122,129,130,137,169,179,186,194,201,245,248,254,264,277,305,311,334,358,366,369,391,394,415,421,452,460,472,500,520,537,586,651,653,678,689,734,746,820,879,884,888,911,936,970,985,1021,1099,1146,1179,1197,1308,1414,1552,1650,1695,1793,1920,2147,2969,3405,3516,3713,3748,4232,5105,7068,7931],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.9536997889255368,1.9570915389266579,2.0545557924622586,4.176398159347389,2.1439533986393955,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.4214486257841834,2.507968722980095,2.571852579609833,2.5378812223426954,2.56143

{"value":"Where do I start? Per the title of this film I expected some degree of authenticity, in the end I was severally let down. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it is a Hollywood (or pick your film making hub) story loosely based on some real life characters. I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the intro to the movie in German; the blood red text (title, artists) should have been the 2nd clue. The story line is contrived (Lale was not tricked out of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann's parents, there is no info that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the NS regime not while under control, the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt. was there on leave, etc, etc) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames (SS black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions, these went away from daily use once the war started, etc), the characters are stereo types (SA bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power). Don't waste your time.","finished_norm":["where","do","i","start","per","the","titl","of","thi","film","i","expect","some","degre","of","authent","in","the","end","i","be","sever","let","down","thi","be","not","the","stori","of","lale","andersen","or","the","song","lili","marlen","rather","it","be","a","hollywood","or","pick","your","film","make","hub","stori","loos","base","on","some","real","life","charact","i","should","have","have","a","clue","when","i","hear","a","heavi","english","accent","give","the","intro","to","the","movi","in","german","the","blood","red","text","titl","artist","should","have","be","the","nd","clue","the","stori","line","be","contriv","lale","be","not","trick","out","of","switzerland","rolf","liebermann","parent","there","be","no","info","that","liebermann","help","smuggl","jew","from","germani","the","origin","song","have","be","record","outsid","of","the","control","of","the","n","regim","not","while","under","control","the","record","plai","at","the","station","be","pick","up","in","vienna","while","a","lt","be","there","on","leav","etc","etc","the","costum","be","poor","and","incorrect","for","the","time","frame","black","uniform","us","everi","where","from","border","guard","to","staff","posit","thi","go","awai","from","daili","us","onc","the","war","start","etc","the","charact","be","stereo","typ","sa","bulli","in","a","club","onc","thei","be","essenti","out","of","power","do","not","wast","your","time"],"filtered":["start","per","titl","thi","film","expect","degre","authent","end","sever","let","thi","stori","lale","andersen","song","lili","marlen","rather","hollywood","pick","film","make","hub","stori","loos","base","real","life","charact","clue","hear","heavi","english","accent","give","intro","movi","german","blood","red","text","titl","artist","nd","clue","stori","line","contriv","lale","trick","switzerland","rolf","liebermann","parent","info","liebermann","help","smuggl","jew","germani","origin","song","record","outsid","control","n","regim","control","record","plai","station","pick","vienna","lt","leav","etc","etc","costum","poor","incorrect","time","frame","black","uniform","us","everi","border","guard","staff","posit","thi","go","awai","daili","us","onc","war","start","etc","charact","stereo","typ","sa","bulli","club","onc","thei","essenti","power","wast","time"],"filtered2":["start","per","titl","expect","degre","authent","end","sever","let","stori","lale","andersen","song","lili","marlen","rather","hollywood","pick","make","hub","stori","loos","base","real","life","charact","clue","hear","heavi","english","accent","give","intro","german","blood","red","text","titl","artist","nd","clue","stori","line","contriv","lale","trick","switzerland","rolf","liebermann","parent","info","liebermann","help","smuggl","jew","germani","origin","song","record","outsid","control","n","regim","control","record","plai","station","pick","vienna","lt","leav","etc","etc","costum","poor","incorrect","time","frame","black","uniform","us","everi","border","guard","staff","posit","go","awai","daili","us","onc","war","start","etc","charact","stereo","typ","sa","bulli","club","onc","essenti","power","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,10,17,24,30,40,56,69,71,74,75,80,85,89,107,124,130,146,155,160,185,216,229,236,264,300,314,316,328,334,355,366,384,429,446,509,559,588,670,724,776,779,791,823,925,940,1020,1035,1038,1177,1181,1197,1259,1400,1436,1591,1630,2162,2188,2389,2415,2640,2666,2712,2714,2727,2757,2912,2953,3959,4276,4459,4880,5711,5999,6446,6791,7366,8100],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,10,17,24,30,40,56,69,71,74,75,80,85,89,107,124,130,146,155,160,185,216,229,236,264,300,314,316,328,334,355,366,384,429,446,509,559,588,670,724,776,779,791,823,925,940,1020,1035,1038,1177,1181,1197,1259,1400,1436,1591,1630,2162,2188,2389,2415,2640,2666,2712,2714,2727,2757,2912,2953,3959,4276,4459,4880,5711,5999,6446,6791,7366,8100],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,2.247774048205673,3.83116108203179,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.6284968758320737,3.7221218701403576,2.127032521151058,3.8429853485101932,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,2.011190219103739,1.9940046109572438,2.1439533986393955,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,2.326138445979858,2.3074766467914385,2.3722295531801256,2.518833027372001,2.6070186965339692,2.8432628718938773,5.235847860032464,5.51548139691143,2.932274249550174,3.189397019426827,2.878207028279898,6.310084991849437,2.942840385588056,3.185521045582134,3.185521045582134,3.109204957709252,9.861703987264997,6.466109492095746,3.360519385990158,3.572777696624

{"value":"I remember watching \"Lost Missile\" (actually throwing a fit until my brother and several cousins at whose home I was an overnight guest agreed to watch it with me - I was, from time to time, the Eric Cartman of the 1960s - sorry, guys) and being somewhat embarrassed when the sustained wave of million-degree heat emerged as a plot device - even as a second-grader I knew that a mere missile just couldn't carry the energy around for that much heat or devastation over more than the duration and limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /><br />My inflicting that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime.<br /><br />The film's production values were very good. The acting isn't bad (apart from the Shatnerism of the actor who played governor's aide that someone else here mentioned).<br /><br />But the idea of a missile Easy-Baking the surface of the Earth by

{"value":"I wasn't at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit \"Hostel\", and most of these lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - yet \"Live Feed\" managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes. Started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese Organized Crime Squad and a 7-foot, leather-aproned butcher... What put me out of the movie was the tough 'hero' with the guns and a grudge saving the day... I would call this movie mediocre, at best, since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater, doubling as a hideout for the mafia, is appealing to me. If only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, then my rating would have differed greatly. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene, leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge-type scenario. So, basically, it IS just a low-budget \"Hostel\" rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the film...
