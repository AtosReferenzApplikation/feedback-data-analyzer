{"value":"What does the \" Executive producer \" do in a movie . If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . You might notice in a great number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player . Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies \" starring Sean Connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major Hollywood player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch <br /><br />PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . Likely ? As things progress Ms Davis ( Who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ?

{"value":"Wow. The only people reviewing this positively are the Carpenter apologists. I know a lot of those. The guys that'll watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror. This \"movie\" is utter crap. It looks and sounds like a porno (good lord, the soundtrack is awful...), and has sub-par porn acting, which is shocking, because normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when making this. Most likely \"Beans, beans, beans..\" until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day... They say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever, when they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it's the devil's baby?) but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. Not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed. It's just awful. Like, Plan 9 From Outerspace awful. Like, good god please would somebody turn it off before I soil myself awful.

{"value":"I had some expectation for the movie, since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /><br />When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way. Well, the very first scene itself pis*ed me off. Then, the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew...you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.<br /><br />The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies.<br /><br />Well, the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this one.And for that, I give a rating of 2 out of 10.<br /><br />Guys, please..please...don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.<br /><br />Thats all.","finished_norm":["i","have","some","expect","for","the","movi","sinc","it","have","a","nice","star","cast","and","it","be","the","return","of","the","duo","of","akshai","and","saif","good","i","be","hesit","to","watch","the","movi","becaus","thi","be","do","by","the","same","man","who","write","the","stori","for","dhoom","franchis","becaus","i","hate","dhoom","but","if","dhoom","be","compar","to","tashan","i","would","sai","dhoom","be","veri","realist","br","br","when","i","see","the","credit","at","the","begin","i","feel","nice","becaus","it","be","put","up","in","a","nice","wai","good","the","veri","scene","itself","pise","me","off","then","the","major","drawback","of","the","movi","be","the","action","sequenc","me","and","my","friend","be","laugh","our","gut","off","watch","thi","crappi","fight","it","be","like","akshai","against","some","thug","and","all","and","the","thug","even","get","machin","gun","phewyou","get","to","see","thi","to","understand","how","bad","the","action","sequenc","arebr","br","the","other","thing","about","the","movi","be","the","far","too","predict","stori","it","remind","me","of","some","of","the","earli","moviesbr","br","good","the","onli","thing","the","movi","be","worth","be","of","sexi","kareena","who","look","realli","hot","in","thi","oneand","for","that","i","give","a","rate","of","out","of","br","br","gui","pleasepleasedont","see","thi","on","think","that","it","be","a","real","gangster","movi","good","you","can","watch","thi","to","have","some","laugh","at","the","terribl","fight","scenesbr","br","that","all"],"filtered":["expect","movi","sinc","nice","star","cast","return","duo","akshai","saif","good","hesit","watch","movi","becaus","thi","man","write","stori","dhoom","franchis","becaus","hate","dhoom","dhoom","compar","tashan","sai","dhoom","veri","realist","br","br","see","credit","begin","feel","nice","becaus","put","nice","wai","good","veri","scene","pise","major","drawback","movi","action","sequenc","friend","laugh","gut","watch","thi","crappi","fight","like","akshai","thug","thug","even","get","machin","gun","phewyou","get","see","thi","understand","bad","action","sequenc","arebr","br","thing","movi","far","predict","stori","remind","earli","moviesbr","br","good","onli","thing","movi","worth","sexi","kareena","look","realli","hot","thi","oneand","give","rate","br","br","gui","pleasepleasedont","see","thi","think","real","gangster","movi","good","watch","thi","laugh","terribl","fight","scenesbr","br"],"filtered2":["expect","sinc","nice","star","cast","return","duo","akshai","saif","good","hesit","watch","becaus","man","write","stori","dhoom","franchis","becaus","hate","dhoom","dhoom","compar","tashan","dhoom","veri","realist","see","credit","begin","feel","nice","becaus","put","nice","wai","good","veri","scene","pise","major","drawback","action","sequenc","friend","laugh","gut","watch","crappi","fight","like","akshai","thug","thug","even","get","machin","gun","phewyou","get","see","understand","bad","action","sequenc","arebr","thing","far","predict","stori","remind","earli","moviesbr","good","onli","thing","worth","sexi","kareena","look","realli","hot","oneand","give","rate","gui","pleasepleasedont","see","think","real","gangster","good","watch","laugh","terribl","fight","scenesbr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,22,29,30,33,43,45,55,65,80,92,100,101,129,130,133,147,159,161,162,166,202,212,219,232,262,266,337,339,349,356,404,482,488,501,644,666,958,1071,1077,1087,1705,1846,2005,2195,2531,2758,3484,3544,3553,3816,4000,4319,5668],"values":[1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,22,29,30,33,43,45,55,65,80,92,100,101,129,130,133,147,159,161,162,166,202,212,219,232,262,266,337,339,349,356,404,482,488,501,644,666,958,1071,1077,1087,1705,1846,2005,2195,2531,2758,3484,3544,3553,3816,4000,4319,5668],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,2.714457859969082,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,2.8828493162168796,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,3.893772050208532,2.6390769554676132,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,1.9536997889255368,1.9073850067444174,1.9951803900462557,2.0489535369135887,2.1405462403177813,2.098582041218749,4.821391668015843,2.2642139034199635,4.642472950759303,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.4323182980210873,2.3586007221245198,2.4423870329693536,2.597304642813496,2.5983793339432615,2.5792094178355414,5.675566812258503,8.180104750463448,2.747702973022204,2.973659465713028,3.003844442051426,6.113673944383873,3.028335462059722,

{"value":"Absolutely laughable film. I live in London and the plot is so ill-researched it's ridiculous. No one could be terrorised on the London Underground. In the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs, etc. That there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely. Or that it's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age...<br /><br />The worst that's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them. Although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.)<br /><br />If it had been set in a city I am not familiar with perhaps I could have enjoyed it through ignorance, but it's not a high quality film so I just couldn't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is.<br /><br />I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating existed!

{"value":"Against All Hope is a very poorly made, sometimes painfully so, movie. This is Michael Madsen's first movie, and it shows, he isn't that good in it. Some people might find the story laughable; an alcoholic realizes his life and family are falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ into his heart. <br /><br />I actually found many of the religious scenes, as when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church but walks away from it, pretty realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows his life is breaking apart and tries to get help, but realizes only God can help him. At the end he realizes with the help of God he can go through life without drinking again.<br /><br />This movie is not well made at all. The acting is bad, the script could use some work, and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian doesn't mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track.

{"value":"The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, the parricide of Caesar being the juncture. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Hence, it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said.<br /><br />Cleopatra being an historic icon, the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela just plays fine. She is strong-willed but also a very supportive, tender soul mate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode. So, it is not really a documentary, nor a peplum but a great love story.<br /><br />After the parricide, a new lover comes (Marc-Antoine) but the flavor is gone: we remember always our first love. So, i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the production is luxurious: the sets are big, tastefully decorated; the Moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid. The producers have a lot of money for sure, but they spend nothing on the special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that it's funny.<br /><br />Finally, I would like very much to hear it in french or English to make a definitive opinion about this two

{"value":"Come on Tina Fey you can do better then this. As soon as the movie started i knew how it would end. Sure it was funny at times. Even laugh out loud funny. But there isn't enough laughs to save this movie. I don't recommend buying this. At the most i recommend renting it but thats all. Baby Mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for.<br /><br />Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did great in that and they do good in this. But this isn't there best. Baby Mama had a great supporting cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the casts greatness.<br /><br />Another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world. After the great Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average when compared. Knocked Up and Juno are Hilarious, Heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. Baby Mama's ending was unfunny and dull.<br /><br />Baby Mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be. I recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious.

{"value":"...however I am not one of them. Caro Diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess. Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but doesn't want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really doesn't want to either. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film. At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside, but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them. Interposed with Moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come. I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again.

{"value":"No matter what anyone tells you, there is a mere fact to the word \"possession\" in film circles -- such as \"what possessed you to greenlight this film?\" Religion doesn't have anything to do with it, but common sense does. That is, if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment.<br /><br />On many levels I tried to rationalize where this film would entertain....or even interest the average consumer. The star? The story? The unique idea? A buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On, my goodness! I am sure when this was an \"idea\", it sounded good. But somewhere during the course of development...someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for...unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a complete mess. Mess, mess - sin and a mess.<br /><br />Who cares about the plot (what plot?) et al. Whoopie got a paycheck, but I would have been embarrassed to take it. I sure hope she fired her agent/manager/publicist over this career move. Obviously not, she went on to make more bad films. And more bad films.

{"value":"Watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy. So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.<br /><br />There are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role. She is dressed up as Grace Kelly, and she is not far off the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue. But the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run-off-the-mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the set design.<br /><br />The finale in Central Station, New York is breath taking. It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof.

{"value":"Greetings again from the darkness. What ever happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my all-time favorites in \"Avalon\" and \"Diner\". He had some fine movies as well (\"Rainman\"), but always provided something of interest ... until now. I believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring. \"Envy\" is the definition of boring. Never of big fan of pure slap stick (\"Dumb and Dumber\"), I was just stunned at how god-awful this movie is. There are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long. The best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a Redbone sound-alike. If the film had been written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize they all want to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes one weaknesses. SNL cast member Amy Poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess. The disaster of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work commute together flashes some promise, but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script. This script is like most of Jack Black's character's ideas - not a bad thought, but no hope for success.","finished_norm":["greet","again","from","the","dark","what","ever","happen","to","the","great","barri","levinson","he","direct","two","of","my","alltim","favorit","in","avalon","and","diner","he","have","some","fine","movi","a","good","rainman","but","alwai","provid","someth","of","interest","until","now","i","believ","the","wrong","thing","you","can","ever","sai","about","a","comedi","be","that","it","be","bore","envi","be","the","definit","of","bore","never","of","big","fan","of","pure","slap","stick","dumb","and","dumb","i","be","just","stun","at","how","godaw","thi","movi","be","there","be","mayb","chuckl","in","the","whole","thing","if","you","can","pai","attent","that","long","the","well","part","of","the","film","be","the","run","gag","of","the","titl","song","by","a","redbon","soundalik","if","the","film","have","be","write","a","good","a","the","song","it","would","have","be","toler","rachel","weisz","be","a","wonder","actress","and","i","realiz","thei","all","want","to","do","comedi","even","juliann","moor","but","the","real","world","expos","on","weak","snl","cast","member","ami","poehler","be","her","usual","over","the","top","in","her","role","a","trailer","park","trash","turn","princess","the","disast","of","the","film","be","jack","black","and","ben","still","the","work","commut","togeth","flash","some","promis","but","after","that","their","chemistri","disappear","due","to","the","poor","script","thi","script","be","like","much","of","jack","black","charact","idea","not","a","bad","think","but","no","hope","for","success"],"filtered":["greet","dark","ever","happen","great","barri","levinson","direct","two","alltim","favorit","avalon","diner","fine","movi","good","rainman","alwai","provid","someth","interest","believ","wrong","thing","ever","sai","comedi","bore","envi","definit","bore","never","big","fan","pure","slap","stick","dumb","dumb","stun","godaw","thi","movi","mayb","chuckl","whole","thing","pai","attent","long","well","part","film","run","gag","titl","song","redbon","soundalik","film","write","good","song","toler","rachel","weisz","wonder","actress","realiz","thei","want","comedi","even","juliann","moor","real","world","expos","weak","snl","cast","member","ami","poehler","usual","top","role","trailer","park","trash","turn","princess","disast","film","jack","black","ben","still","work","commut","togeth","flash","promis","chemistri","disappear","due","poor","script","thi","script","like","much","jack","black","charact","idea","bad","think","hope","success"],"filtered2":["greet","dark","ever","happen","great","barri","levinson","direct","two","alltim","favorit","avalon","diner","fine","good","rainman","alwai","provid","someth","interest","believ","wrong","thing","ever","comedi","bore","envi","definit","bore","never","big","fan","pure","slap","stick","dumb","dumb","stun","godaw","mayb","chuckl","whole","thing","pai","attent","long","well","part","run","gag","titl","song","redbon","soundalik","write","good","song","toler","rachel","weisz","wonder","actress","realiz","want","comedi","even","juliann","moor","real","world","expos","weak","snl","cast","member","ami","poehler","usual","top","role","trailer","park","trash","turn","princess","disast","jack","black","ben","still","work","commut","togeth","flash","promis","chemistri","disappear","due","poor","script","script","like","jack","black","charact","idea","bad","think","hope","success"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,9,10,12,20,25,29,37,42,44,47,48,51,53,60,61,64,65,77,80,82,91,92,94,96,99,102,108,111,123,127,128,137,140,146,163,165,175,181,197,229,264,265,270,322,328,354,364,368,379,392,405,416,420,464,532,568,618,636,671,683,694,725,777,822,854,935,950,998,1034,1132,1203,1455,1491,1555,1673,1756,1791,2050,2401,2443,2673,2796,2969,3083,3911,4885,4969,5387,5819,7439],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,9,10,12,20,25,29,37,42,44,47,48,51,53,60,61,64,65,77,80,82,91,92,94,96,99,102,108,111,123,127,128,137,140,146,163,165,175,181,197,229,264,265,270,322,328,354,364,368,379,392,405,416,420,464,532,568,618,636,671,683,694,725,777,822,854,935,950,998,1034,1132,1203,1455,1491,1555,1673,1756,1791,2050,2401,2443,2673,2796,2969,3083,3911,4885,4969,5387,5819,7439],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,2.6390769554676132,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,3.209458785004948,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.9073

{"value":"A low point in human interaction was reached by the Maysles Brothers with this film. Do remember, you who used words like \"masterpiece\"when reviewing this film, that these Maysles creeps didn't just happen to drive to the Hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). Then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. These wretched Maysles smiled, kissed ass, did whatever they had to to get the Beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done. One would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the film-making process, given the preplanning, actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the Beales as human beings. An exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people. As time accrued their film-making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is execrable.

{"value":"This is only somewhat attractive for fans of \"bad movie\" entertainment. It is more worthwhile for students of 1970's pop culture: the fashions, the furniture, the attitudes, and that great \"women's lib\" moment of the early 1970's, when it was still fresh and novel for a self-employed, independent woman to exist.<br /><br />\"Superchick\" (Joyce Jillson) had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career (after all, what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30,000 feet -- that goes for the male ones too), she slept around with multiple men, could protect herself and others (with karate) and wasn't tied down to anything. This is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband.<br /><br />The \"sexy stewardess\" was a potent archetype of the late 1960's to 1970's, (geez, even on \"The Partridge Family,\" I remember swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses) and from that point of view, this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre-AIDS, free-love, women's lib, swinging Seventies. The plot is quite awful though.

{"value":"Ridiculous-looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror-elements this movie has. All the rest of MUNCHIES plays out like a really retarded comedy that's so stupid you won't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes. I can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers, but adults will be left with only those supposedly \"smart\" references translating to on-screen stuff like Capt. Kirk's log entries from STAR TREK, the most well-known scene from E.T., a blatant statement from the filmmakers going \"Look! We're cashing in on GREMLINS' success here!\" and a cardboard cut-out of Clint Eastwood telling us... what about his western movies exactly? That last one was totally lost on me... Oh yes, and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing. Don't know where they got that idea from.<br /><br />Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most insufferable film to sit through, for that matter. It's just really, really dumb. And if you manage to crack a smile while watching it, you'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film's finished.<br /><br />Good Badness?

{"value":"Okay, let me break it down for you guys...IT'S HORRIBLE! <br /><br />If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this. I'm sorry but this movie is stupid, true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic...this movie a crock! A lot of bad acting *NOTE The Shower scene* \"Kissing Cousins\" ?????? What kind of line is that? \"Slipery when wet\" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie had effort, I'll give you that, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually....WASN'T FUNNY! It was pathetic. Not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look Absolutely NOTHING like the original cast. It's as if they made them look different on purpose or something! I like watching it when I'm really really really board which doesn't happen occasionally. For those of you who did like it...Okay, what were you thinking? Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is gold if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar in it, DUH! But this movie doesn't, no offense Amy Adams. Oh, yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart?????

{"value":"As big as a Texas prairie and equally as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper can't float this overbloated boat. Taylor actually LOOKS bad--wrong wardrobe, wrong hair, and wrong makeup--a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career. Hopper gives the only believable performance, and Dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don't remember him for--a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a, say, Redford could have done with the male lead. There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other. Except for Hopper, there is no character development, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery. To its credit, the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and it does have SIZE, making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests. Those with the DVD version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk.

{"value":"Back in the day, I remembered seeing dumb Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me! I was not estatic, but curious... I was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck. My friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy (i'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations.<br /><br />WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!! First off, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so dumb and I hate how so many fanboys drool over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the King Dedede (who sucks big time in this show) and I hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying Dedede with those awful weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show.<br /><br />I then began to hate Kirby even more since it was obvious Nintendo was just aching to get Kirby some popularity.

{"value":"I liked how this started out, featuring some decent special-effects especially for a film 50 years old. There was some pretty impressive scenery. However, the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with Anne Francis \"Altaira Morbius.\")<br /><br />Viewing this in the '90s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released....and is still acting. It also was interesting to see a young-looking Leslie Nielsen (\"Dr. John J. Adams\"), who I wouldn't have recognized had it not been for this voice <br /><br />I watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciated them re-doing this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one those overrated film where \"elites\" think is so \"heavy\" and \"thought-provoking.\" That's nonsense. It only appeared \"intelligent\" because the rest of the '50s sci-fi films were so stupid!!<br /><br />Some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen, which I didn't have at the time of this writing. Perhaps another look - this time on the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer would make me change this

{"value":"Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time they are portraying an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the dressing room, the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialog, so one can hear neither, diluting any emotional impact the scene may have had. The scenes of Annabella getting beaten by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt was so cartoonish as to be absurd. This entire movie is a cartoon, the rampant prejudice against whites is literally astounding. The discussion by the black women after flipper's wife finds out he has cheated on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an oxford debating team, is ridiculous. The rampant racism might be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and the sound mixing during this 'movie' is too much. It was a technically poorly made movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of movie making, the sound track, the editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat. I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he had accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I have seen by this director and it will be my last.","finished_norm":["who","in","their","right","mind","plai","a","lyric","song","at","the","same","time","thei","be","portrai","a","emot","scene","between","two","peopl","when","flipper","confront","hi","wrong","wife","in","the","dress","room","the","song","sing","with","lyric","content","be","a","loud","a","the","dialog","so","on","can","hear","neither","dilut","ani","emot","impact","the","scene","mai","have","have","the","scene","of","annabella","get","beat","by","her","father","with","hi","fist","a","lamp","and","then","a","belt","be","so","cartoonish","a","to","be","absurd","thi","entir","movi","be","a","cartoon","the","rampant","prejudic","against","white","be","liter","astound","the","discuss","by","the","black","woman","after","flipper","wife","find","out","he","have","cheat","on","her","with","a","white","woman","a","if","it","be","a","discuss","by","a","oxford","debat","team","be","ridicul","the","rampant","racism","mai","be","possibl","to","endur","but","the","soundtrack","and","the","sound","mix","dure","thi","movi","be","too","much","it","be","a","technic","poorli","make","movi","there","be","no","understand","of","the","basic","craft","of","movi","make","the","sound","track","the","edit","and","the","desper","attempt","of","great","actor","try","to","keep","thi","movi","afloat","i","actual","feel","sorri","for","anthoni","quinn","wonder","why","he","have","accept","a","role","in","thi","flick","hi","appear","in","thi","be","pain","thi","be","the","movi","i","have","see","by","thi","director","and","it","will","be","my","last"],"filtered":["right","mind","plai","lyric","song","time","thei","portrai","emot","scene","two","peopl","flipper","confront","hi","wrong","wife","dress","room","song","sing","lyric","content","loud","dialog","hear","neither","dilut","ani","emot","impact","scene","mai","scene","annabella","get","beat","father","hi","fist","lamp","belt","cartoonish","absurd","thi","entir","movi","cartoon","rampant","prejudic","white","liter","astound","discuss","black","woman","flipper","wife","find","cheat","white","woman","discuss","oxford","debat","team","ridicul","rampant","racism","mai","possibl","endur","soundtrack","sound","mix","dure","thi","movi","much","technic","poorli","make","movi","understand","basic","craft","movi","make","sound","track","edit","desper","attempt","great","actor","try","keep","thi","movi","afloat","actual","feel","sorri","anthoni","quinn","wonder","accept","role","thi","flick","hi","appear","thi","pain","thi","movi","see","thi","director","last"],"filtered2":["right","mind","plai","lyric","song","time","portrai","emot","scene","two","peopl","flipper","confront","wrong","wife","dress","room","song","sing","lyric","content","loud","dialog","hear","neither","dilut","ani","emot","impact","scene","mai","scene","annabella","get","beat","father","fist","lamp","belt","cartoonish","absurd","entir","cartoon","rampant","prejudic","white","liter","astound","discuss","black","woman","flipper","wife","find","cheat","white","woman","discuss","oxford","debat","team","ridicul","rampant","racism","mai","possibl","endur","soundtrack","sound","mix","dure","technic","poorli","make","understand","basic","craft","make","sound","track","edit","desper","attempt","great","actor","try","keep","afloat","actual","feel","sorri","anthoni","quinn","wonder","accept","role","flick","appear","pain","see","director","last"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,8,19,23,25,27,36,38,40,41,43,46,47,51,52,58,70,121,128,134,144,169,175,177,178,198,212,216,229,238,239,257,263,274,286,328,342,348,359,398,402,432,437,459,469,506,513,653,659,678,718,723,742,783,788,796,867,873,897,928,944,956,1142,1326,1404,1710,1755,1796,1833,2223,2654,2741,2943,2971,3559,3704,3730,3820,5249,5799,6922,7450,8356],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,8,19,23,25,27,36,38,40,41,43,46,47,51,52,58,70,121,128,134,144,169,175,177,178,198,212,216,229,238,239,257,263,274,286,328,342,348,359,398,402,432,437,459,469,506,513,653,659,678,718,723,742,783,788,796,867,873,897,928,944,956,1142,1326,1404,1710,1755,1796,1833,2223,2654,2741,2943,2971,3559,3704,3730,3820,5249,5799,6922,7450,8356],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,3.9371420340352055,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,3.311542587503466,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.865701314626681,4.189351572503368,2.2190595059394194,2.3409902041158843,2.2443961816702407,2.2931108769894046,2.4214486257841834,2.3791142619576227

{"value":"I knew nothing of this film before I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a \"non-stop epic battle scene from beginning to end\". That couldn't have been further from the truth. This was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateurishly directed, horribly acted films I've ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon. I'd rank it up there with the movie I consider to be the worst film of all time... Battlefield Earth. There basically is no story, it's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact. It also features some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard... like this little gem... Guy tells girl \"You smell like the moon.\". Girl replies \"What does the moon smell like?\" OMG! You have to be kidding me! The scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound FX of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth. If this is playing at a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that I needed to catch up on my sleep... and I did.

{"value":"My brother is in love with this show, let's get this straight. I completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /><br />I've never really liked fairly odd parents, I mean, some things did make me laugh, but most of the time it's downright annoying and not cute at all. This is almost the same way I feel about Johnny Test. Except, NOTHING makes me laugh on that show. The gags are so stupid and pointless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids don't DRESS like that! Yes, I do think Johnny's hair is awesome, but c'Mon!<br /><br />And Dexter's Lab, that used to be one of my favorite shows and I still don't mind watching it. Which makes me disgusted and ashamed of Johnny Test making an absolute JOKE out of that wonderful show!<br /><br />One more thing. The. Dog. Is. So. Annoying. He is more loud and obnoxious than Johnny! And the gay accent? What the fudge!

{"value":"*Spoiler warning*<br /><br />First of all I rated this movie 2 out of 10.<br /><br />The idea is good, but there are too many stupid errors in the movie, failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been. First of all she never fights alone. After an initial very strange doubt from her mother (which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie) the rape victim is not alone. <br /><br />She is also unbelievably naive always falling into the Crew's strange traps. <br /><br />Her friends are unbelievably nasty.<br /><br />The thing that I find most unbelievably is that Ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon. Ethan is very much the leader of the Crew (hey, they even say so) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk, but when Ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the Crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong. Everyone just simply hates him... why?? The movie provides no explanation.

{"value":"I make a point out of watching bad movies frequently, and the sci-fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find. As such, I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of oblivion. The acting was uncharacteristically sub-par, as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has in store for us. There are a few cameos made by people you'd most likely recognize, although you may not know their names by heart. The CGI special effects are minimal, and as such, one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci-fi feature is lacking. Sure, there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer, or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he's known for a couple of days, but overall, it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter, and I consider that a major disappointment.<br /><br />If I was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made-for TV movies, I'd probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I may have to wait 'till the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh, and I really hope that this movie isn't part of some overall quality increase in sci-fi original

{"value":"This series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of Dickens' Bleak House on film and perhaps someone will read the book. Contrary to what is probably received opinion, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. She was clunky and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying: \"I didn't read the book, so I don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book.\" True and not true. For ex, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you've read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (although too old). The series fails not because it's unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plot lines and characters just don't coalesce to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious andcompelling entertainment. It is dull and flat. If you want to make apossibly good Bleak House, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes. But I suggest that producers etc. leave Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television deadens the genius of Dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable

{"value":"this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :D. bill forsythe .. well, i'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film. he's way too good for this kinda stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. I rented this on the strength of those two leads, and I wasn't really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. It ain't Shakespeare folks. Other than the plot, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired. there were shots were they were trying to look \"cool\", but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy. they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, this one is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe ain't bad either, and

do.","finished_norm":["why","watch","thi","there","be","onli","on","reason","and","that","be","for","the","great","of","john","saxon","i","love","hi","act","my","much","favorit","appear","by","him","be","in","nightmar","on","elm","street","and","a","nanci","father","a","cop","black","christma","a","a","cop","and","from","dusk","till","dawn","again","a","a","cop","when","i","be","rummag","through","my","local","mall","video","outlet","i","come","across","the","film","zombi","death","hous","and","i","quickli","toss","it","back","but","befor","move","on","i","notic","that","john","saxon","be","not","onli","a","actor","in","thi","film","but","for","the","time","that","i","have","ever","hear","of","a","director","thi","intrigu","me","conjur","the","cheap","price","tag","and","i","and","i","have","to","have","it","upon","come","home","i","realiz","that","thi","film","do","not","live","up","to","saxon","other","work","even","hi","act","which","mai","have","be","muddl","by","the","add","pressur","of","direct","but","it","be","not","just","him","the","other","actor","suck","too","it","seem","a","if","thei","have","all","be","pull","out","of","a","recent","porno","shoot","and","tell","now","gui","you","realli","have","to","act","the","film","even","look","of","porn","qualiti","i","cannot","in","good","faith","recommend","thi","film","to","casual","viewer","but","if","you","be","a","obsess","fan","of","the","who","miss","out","on","the","cultur","that","come","from","that","era","by","be","bear","to","late","or","a","fan","of","crap","film","than","thi","on","be","for","conjur","if","you","dig","john","saxon","a","i","do"],"filtered":["watch","thi","onli","reason","great","john","saxon","love","hi","act","much","favorit","appear","nightmar","elm","street","nanci","father","cop","black","christma","cop","dusk","till","dawn","cop","rummag","local","mall","video","outlet","come","across","film","zombi","death","hous","quickli","toss","back","befor","move","notic","john","saxon","onli","actor","thi","film","time","ever","hear","director","thi","intrigu","conjur","cheap","price","tag","upon","come","home","realiz","thi","film","live","saxon","work","even","hi","act","mai","muddl","add","pressur","direct","actor","suck","seem","thei","pull","recent","porno","shoot","tell","gui","realli","act","film","even","look","porn","qualiti","good","faith","recommend","thi","film","casual","viewer","obsess","fan","miss","cultur","come","era","bear","late","fan","crap","film","thi","conjur","dig","john","saxon"],"filtered2":["watch","onli","reason","great","john","saxon","love","act","favorit","appear","nightmar","elm","street","nanci","father","cop","black","christma","cop","dusk","till","dawn","cop","rummag","local","mall","video","outlet","come","across","zombi","death","hous","quickli","toss","back","befor","move","notic","john","saxon","onli","actor","time","ever","hear","director","intrigu","conjur","cheap","price","tag","upon","come","home","realiz","live","saxon","work","even","act","mai","muddl","add","pressur","direct","actor","suck","seem","pull","recent","porno","shoot","tell","gui","realli","act","even","look","porn","qualiti","good","faith","recommend","casual","viewer","obsess","fan","miss","cultur","come","era","bear","late","fan","crap","conjur","dig","john","saxon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,11,13,16,21,34,35,39,41,44,46,48,51,54,55,58,63,79,90,95,102,116,117,140,150,169,213,216,229,240,245,255,268,275,279,291,298,299,302,313,319,342,351,405,421,475,476,503,525,544,562,630,664,688,748,771,822,880,971,1017,1054,1072,1122,1204,1653,1800,1925,2199,2315,2530,2539,2542,3206,3312,3384,3663,3743,6998,7860],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,11,13,16,21,34,35,39,41,44,46,48,51,54,55,58,63,79,90,95,102,116,117,140,150,169,213,216,229,240,245,255,268,275,279,291,298,299,302,313,319,342,351,405,421,475,476,503,525,544,562,630,664,688,748,771,822,880,971,1017,1054,1072,1122,1204,1653,1800,1925,2199,2315,2530,2539,2542,3206,3312,3384,3663,3743,6998,7860],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,3.4860466360051467,4.194855026837689,1.463169012899134,3.1077880109725475,3.1375198335242067,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,1.8729627573220065,1.9469506069506084,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,4.634339551994196,2.332712011146513,2.4214486257841834,2.8432628718938773,2.6070186965339692,2.8432628718938773,2.

{"value":"I work at a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies, these are the kind of movies that the Sci-Fi channel shows. The kind of movie that nobody ever wants, and only that idiots rent, when they bring it back I ask them \"was it any good?\", they say \"no we turned it off after 15 minutes!\" Movies with terrible computer generated, super imposed monsters and such like, very unappealing.<br /><br />This is the same type of movie that Grendel is, and absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonably (and only reasonably) good Beowulf based movie then try Beowulf & Grendel , starring Gerard Butler, who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300, as King Leonidas of Sparta.<br /><br />Plus, later this year we have another Beowulf movie, with a star studded cast ranging from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich.<br /><br />But don't let that get your hopes up

{"value":"Rob Schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements, facials and performances of \"not humans\". This time he is The Animal. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day, nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day, his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings, are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character, is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. By the way-his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. Schneider's performance is a so-so. The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, called mindless fun as I have written above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in.

{"value":"I was looking over our DVD tower last night for something to watch. We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled one out that I never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounded like a rip-off of \"The Big Chill\" but, with the all-star cast, felt it might be worth watching. Boy was I wrong!!! Not only was it like \"The Big Chill,\" it was a rip-off almost character by character. The Bill Paxton character was a copy of William Hurt (\"where have you been all this time\" role) -spoiler warning- and, lo and behold, he remains behind to take care of the old place(cabin/camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I found myself wondering why I'm even watching these people. There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them. How did \"Unca Lou\" even find these characters after 20 years? Plus it wasn't even funny, except when Perkins fell, err 'flopped' out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife, \"Were there any endearing characters in this film? ...

{"value":"Without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s, GAOTS seems to really, REALLY want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it's so entirely valueless on every level that one can't help but laugh. Reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, it follows a city couple's day in the wilderness...they walk along a shady path, allthewhile pontificating like a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch. Almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad(\"I feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate....but is it as beautiful?\") After what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening(well...OK...we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene), there is finally a VERY anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair 'Nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar. <br /><br />Nothing at all eventful or interesting happens IN THIS ENTIRE FILM. I thought the Larry Buchanan picture \"Strawberries Need Rain\" was a weak example of a Bergman homage. \"Golden Apples\" is every bit as bad, but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful.

{"value":"This one hearkens back to the days of the matinée, when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below. It didn't matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it. The adults, of course, would never see it.<br /><br />But they put it on video, anyway, along with most of the other creaky, low-budget \"B\" horror flicks of the golden age...of television. This film's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology (the \"bad girls\" harvested to replace poor Jan's crushed body - they had it comin'), overused plot (a mad scientist, trying to play God), violent yet conscientious monster (whose presence in the heretofore-normal-seeming scientist's rural lab is never fully explained), and acting that polarizes at wooden or over-the-top.<br /><br />This is a great party film, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits.

{"value":"Wow. I thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good \"car-crash\" movie: those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get. This is really the only reason I could leave the television on - morbid fascination. It wasn't so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day. The script, too, is groan-inducing. As for cinematography, did anyone else notice that they used a \"curtains drawing\" segue device, like in an old 50's TV show...but without irony? At first I thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Don't even ask me about the score...the only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $8...glad I saw it on TV!!!!! Just silly! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has had trouble finding much work recently? I guess if you don't expect much, and want to watch a mindless thriller, it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails, which is why it merits a
