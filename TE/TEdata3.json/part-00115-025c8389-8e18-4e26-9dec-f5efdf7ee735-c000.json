{"value":"The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring There is a bored sub plot of Tanushree's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in Payal's house<br /><br />The film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep<br /><br />Direction by Priyan is very bad music(Pritam) is routine except the first song<br /><br />Cinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look throughout<br /><br />Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films But No, He becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace, He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, But doesn't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is

{"value":"It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential. Indeed the under-explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and, for at least the opening half, this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's on-again-off-again performance and the overly intricate plot, this would-be thriller loses its way.<br /><br />Dourif, featured here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated, is average guy Sam. Of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies, so after a well-done origin outline, we see Sam's various body parts start to ignite. Soon he's igniting other people, too, much to the consternation of gal pal Lisa, played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain.<br /><br />While the title of the film implies a fire-happy monster on the loose, director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack, but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower. We're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight-up villain-versus-everyone effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.<br /><br />SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done. It will carry added appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror, be it good, bad or in between, but only on a slow night.","finished_norm":["it","not","so","much","that","spontan","combust","have","littl","potenti","ind","the","underexplor","titl","phenomenon","be","quit","intrigu","and","for","at","littl","the","open","half","thi","tobe","hooper","effort","promis","to","entertain","in","a","wai","onli","cheesi","horror","can","but","somewher","between","brad","dourif","onagainoffagain","perform","and","the","overli","intric","plot","thi","wouldb","thriller","lose","it","waybr","br","dourif","featur","here","befor","hi","builtin","horror","fan","base","have","accumul","be","averag","gui","sam","of","cours","averag","gui","do","not","stai","averag","for","long","in","horror","movi","so","after","a","welldon","origin","outlin","we","see","sam","variou","bodi","part","start","to","ignit","soon","he","ignit","other","peopl","too","much","to","the","constern","of","gal","pal","lisa","plai","unmemor","by","cynthia","bainbr","br","while","the","titl","of","the","film","impli","a","firehappi","monster","on","the","loos","director","hooper","opt","to","make","sam","a","unwil","killer","thi","approach","give","the","film","a","add","human","depth","it","would","otherwis","lack","but","it","conjur","prevent","u","from","truli","fear","the","human","flamethrow","we","re","leav","wonder","whether","thi","would","have","work","well","a","a","straightup","villainversuseveryon","effort","ala","nightmar","on","elm","streetbr","br","spontan","combust","be","a","pretti","nomin","effort","when","all","be","sai","and","do","it","will","carri","add","appeal","for","dourif","fan","and","that","who","ca","not","get","enough","horror","be","it","good","bad","or","in","between","but","onli","on","a","slow","night"],"filtered":["much","spontan","combust","littl","potenti","ind","underexplor","titl","phenomenon","quit","intrigu","littl","open","half","thi","tobe","hooper","effort","promis","entertain","wai","onli","cheesi","horror","somewher","brad","dourif","onagainoffagain","perform","overli","intric","plot","thi","wouldb","thriller","lose","waybr","br","dourif","featur","befor","hi","builtin","horror","fan","base","accumul","averag","gui","sam","cours","averag","gui","stai","averag","long","horror","movi","welldon","origin","outlin","see","sam","variou","bodi","part","start","ignit","soon","ignit","peopl","much","constern","gal","pal","lisa","plai","unmemor","cynthia","bainbr","br","titl","film","impli","firehappi","monster","loos","director","hooper","opt","make","sam","unwil","killer","thi","approach","give","film","add","human","depth","otherwis","lack","conjur","prevent","u","truli","fear","human","flamethrow","re","leav","wonder","whether","thi","work","well","straightup","villainversuseveryon","effort","ala","nightmar","elm","streetbr","br","spontan","combust","pretti","nomin","effort","sai","carri","add","appeal","dourif","fan","ca","get","enough","horror","good","bad","onli","slow","night"],"filtered2":["spontan","combust","littl","potenti","ind","underexplor","titl","phenomenon","quit","intrigu","littl","open","half","tobe","hooper","effort","promis","entertain","wai","onli","cheesi","horror","somewher","brad","dourif","onagainoffagain","perform","overli","intric","plot","wouldb","thriller","lose","waybr","dourif","featur","befor","builtin","horror","fan","base","accumul","averag","gui","sam","cours","averag","gui","stai","averag","long","horror","welldon","origin","outlin","see","sam","variou","bodi","part","start","ignit","soon","ignit","peopl","constern","gal","pal","lisa","plai","unmemor","cynthia","bainbr","titl","impli","firehappi","monster","loos","director","hooper","opt","make","sam","unwil","killer","approach","give","add","human","depth","otherwis","lack","conjur","prevent","u","truli","fear","human","flamethrow","re","leav","wonder","whether","work","well","straightup","villainversuseveryon","effort","ala","nightmar","elm","streetbr","spontan","combust","pretti","nomin","effort","carri","add","appeal","dourif","fan","ca","get","enough","horror","good","bad","onli","slow","night"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,9,11,14,20,23,30,32,33,39,40,48,55,58,61,68,69,71,74,78,79,81,83,93,99,105,112,120,140,175,183,195,199,206,210,221,242,252,264,292,299,305,334,342,366,376,390,401,413,449,543,547,597,621,627,643,683,690,714,804,812,829,914,940,942,1017,1054,1058,1078,1559,1650,1716,1807,2095,2119,2202,3062,3206,3327,3337,3647,3667,3793,4027,4613,4850,5060,5629,6433,6650,6674,7005,8035,8106],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,9,11,14,20,23,30,32,33,39,40,48,55,58,61,68,69,71,74,78,79,81,83,93,99,105,112

{"value":"well, the writing was very sloppy, the directing was sloppier, and the editing made it worse (at least i hope it was the editing). the acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. pretty much none of the characters were likable. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. it was a great idea, but yet another wasted good idea goes by. it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending. and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the ending was not worth watching at all. sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the movie looked rushed also. the movie just wasn't really worth seeing, and had i paid for it i would have been very mad. maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one. the movie over all was not horrifibly bad, but i wouldn't reccomend it. i gave it 2 out of 10 b/c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character (justin i believe, the super smart one). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not pretty. anyway, if you see it, wait for the $1.50 theater or video, unless you like pretty much every movie you see, then i guess you'll like this

{"value":"Mulva is put in a sugercoma by Teen Ape. When she awakens she's considerably hotter (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel), and out for revenge on those that did her wrong. As the sub-title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the \"Kill Bill\" films, but this being a Chris Seaver's film, it's a wildly incompetent satire (and I use that last term extremely loosely) I'd love to say this is better than the first film, but truth be told I was so impossibly drunk off my ass when I saw the previous film that I can't even hope to compare the two at this point in time. But I must have enjoyed it since I bought the sequel (see when I'm drunk I like, for lack of a better word, complete and total crappy movies) There are a few laugh out loud moments (very few) but I do remember Bonejack being funnier though. Well at least at slightly over an hour, it IS over mighty quickly for what it's worth.<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Audio commentary by Director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon,

{"value":"Arg. The shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-awful third film. This time, European terrorists(Irish I'd say) hi-jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium. They pull into a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, the cops and some marines. The whole film seems to be (again) largely inspired from Alien(as Carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic marines going through the \"claustrophobic\" shipyard? guns at the ready. This third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot, with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off. The dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures as usual and the T-Rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars(it also appears to have no eyes). One of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck. On opening it, surprise! The Rubber Reptile Gang burst out and devour them. Why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first? How did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene???? Oh bother, who cares?

{"value":"***Comments contain spoilers*** I was barely holding on to this show as appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps was averaging almost a shooting per case, when the very nasally Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we weren't to notice) and when Colby was a f*****g TRIPLE agent. But now, in tonight's episode,David is trapped with a paranoid, nut job who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and....HE CAN'T DISARM HIM. A trained, experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting, CAN'T TAKE OUT A NUT JOB. Not when said nut job blinks, looks away, drops his head, closes his eyes; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds.<br /><br />Then the scene came that let me know that as much as I enjoy learning from the chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest Amita, my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged. Don gives David the \"distress word\" that is the code for \"The s**t is about to go down\"; David is ready, they kill the lights, drop the elevator, startle the nut job and......<br /><br />David CANNOT DISARM/KILL/BEAT INTO SUBMISSION THE NUT JOB. The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS, David ends up SHOT.<br /><br />I'm done.

{"value":"Once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy that got shot into space, supposedly to go to Saturn, but really only to some stock footage of solar flares, and then he gets a nose bleed, and before you know it, he's laying in a hospital bandaged head to foot, and then an overweight nurse with an ill-fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy, whose supposed to be melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass, and then NASA, or at least one guy at NASA, gets upset about it and calls one other guy in to hunt him down, but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy has to go home and have soup first, and his oddly-shaped wife forgot the crackers, so he can't have crackers, and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a geiger counter, and that doesn't really work, so he really only follows the trail of half-eaten corpses, and then there's something about a sheriff, and two ugly old people in a lemon grove, and a women with a meat cleaver, and some kind of industrial plant with trigger-happy security guards, and since I can't tell you how the movies ends, all I can say is Jonathan Demme is in it somewhere with some guy

{"value":"The people who are praising this film are the real disappointments -- I am hoping at least that Leonard will see some good $$ out of this, as his life savings were embezzled away by a manager a couple of years ago and he's over 70 now. But this film is simply terrible. At the beginning Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It is so bloody PRECIOUS with its endless close-ups of over emoting singers. Cohen's interview is all done in lo-fi video closeups and I so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body! I couldn't care less about the comments of the performers, especially those overblown ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as Leonard's own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all, heed them. This would be an acceptable PBS special, maybe, for a one time showing. But I will even hesitate at getting a DVD of this. When the film finally shows Leonard semi-performing \"Tower of Song\" it's ruined by Bono taking a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, Rufus' first number, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blabla. Forget this one, and go buy Leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him.","finished_norm":["the","peopl","who","be","prais","thi","film","be","the","real","disappoint","i","be","hope","at","littl","that","leonard","will","see","some","good","out","of","thi","a","hi","life","save","be","embezzl","awai","by","a","manag","a","coupl","of","year","ago","and","he","over","now","but","thi","film","be","simpli","terribl","at","the","begin","leonard","himself","sai","he","be","not","sentiment","about","hi","past","and","then","for","the","next","hour","and","a","half","the","film","emphas","all","the","wrong","sentiment","elem","of","leonard","song","it","be","so","bloodi","preciou","with","it","endless","closeup","of","over","emot","singer","cohen","interview","be","all","do","in","lofi","video","closeup","and","i","so","want","to","see","a","medium","or","a","long","shoot","of","hi","whole","bodi","i","can","not","care","littl","about","the","comment","of","the","perform","especi","that","overblown","ego","boi","edg","and","bono","none","of","the","perform","in","thi","film","have","do","even","on","song","a","good","a","leonard","own","music","and","if","you","be","think","about","see","thi","and","you","have","ani","doubt","at","all","he","them","thi","would","be","a","accept","pb","special","mayb","for","a","on","time","show","but","i","will","even","hesit","at","get","a","dvd","of","thi","when","the","film","final","show","leonard","semiperform","tower","of","song","it","ruin","by","bono","take","a","vers","even","the","occasion","good","perform","antoni","rufu","numb","martha","the","traitor","be","spoil","by","the","context","of","the","rest","of","thi","turgid","blabla","forget","thi","on","and","go","bui","leonard","much","recent","album","if","you","want","to","pai","tribut","to","him"],"filtered":["peopl","prais","thi","film","real","disappoint","hope","littl","leonard","see","good","thi","hi","life","save","embezzl","awai","manag","coupl","year","ago","thi","film","simpli","terribl","begin","leonard","sai","sentiment","hi","past","next","hour","half","film","emphas","wrong","sentiment","elem","leonard","song","bloodi","preciou","endless","closeup","emot","singer","cohen","interview","lofi","video","closeup","want","see","medium","long","shoot","hi","whole","bodi","care","littl","comment","perform","especi","overblown","ego","boi","edg","bono","none","perform","thi","film","even","song","good","leonard","music","think","see","thi","ani","doubt","thi","accept","pb","special","mayb","time","show","even","hesit","get","dvd","thi","film","final","show","leonard","semiperform","tower","song","ruin","bono","take","vers","even","occasion","good","perform","antoni","rufu","numb","martha","traitor","spoil","context","rest","thi","turgid","blabla","forget","thi","go","bui","leonard","much","recent","album","want","pai","tribut"],"filtered2":["peopl","prais","real","disappoint","hope","littl","leonard","see","good","life","save","embezzl","awai","manag","coupl","year","ago","simpli","terribl","begin","leonard","sentiment","past","next","hour","half","emphas","wrong","sentiment","elem","leonard","song","bloodi","preciou","endless","closeup","emot","singer","cohen","interview","lofi","video","closeup","want","see","medium","long","shoot","whole","bodi","care","littl","comment","perform","especi","overblown","ego","boi","edg","bono","none","perform","even","song","good","leonard","music","think","see","ani","doubt","accept","pb","special","mayb","time","show","even","hesit","get","dvd","final","show","leonard","semiperform","tower","song","ruin","bono","take","vers","even","occasion","good","perform","antoni","rufu","numb","martha","traitor","spoil","context","rest","turgid","blabla","forget","go","bui","leonard","recent","album","want","pai","tribut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,8,12,14,23,25,27,28,31,37,57,75,80,99,105,111,117,118,147,155,156,163,166,174,181,187,189,201,203,205,206,226,240,247,253,267,280,282,297,322,328,345,347,370,372,376,440,479,506,516,562,567,610,710,741,1091,1099,1181,1193,1245,1320,1453,1470,1552,1653,1948,2530,2545,2642,2677,3060,3276,3463,3979,4085,4650,4661,4851,5863,6067,7105,7440],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,8,12,14,23,25,27,28,31,37,57,75,80,99,105,111,117,118,147,155,156,163,166,174,181,187,189,201,203,205,206,226,240,247,253,267,280,282,297,322,328,345,347,370,372,376,440,479,506,516,562,567,610,710,741,1091,1099,1181,1193,1245,1320,1453,1470,1552,1653,1948,2530,2545,2642,2677,3060,3276,3463,3979,4085,4650,4661,4851,5863,6067,7105,7440],"values":[1.967100616408184,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,2.7780513171783934,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936

{"value":"Man, what a scam this turned out to be! Not because it wasn't any good (as I wasn't really expecting anything from it) but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded its \"stars\" as being Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names did not appear in the film's opening credits, much less themselves in the rest of it!! As it turned out, the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975)  but what that one has to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anybody's guess <br /><br />Even so, since I paid $1.50 for its rental and I was in a monster-movie mood anyhow, I elected to watch the movie regardless and, yup, it stunk! Apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew, an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most I could do with it is laugh at the JAWS-like pretensions and, intentionally so, at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on. The creature itself  a plesiosaur i.e. half-dinosaur/half-fish  is imperfectly realized (naturally) but, as had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW (1957) which I've also just seen, this didn't seem to bother the film-makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can, especially during the movie's second half!","finished_norm":["man","what","a","scam","thi","turn","out","to","be","not","becaus","it","be","not","ani","good","a","i","be","not","realli","expect","anyth","from","it","but","becaus","i","be","mislead","by","the","dvd","sleev","which","ignorantli","parad","it","star","a","be","stuart","whitman","stella","steven","and","toni","bill","sure","enough","their","name","do","not","appear","in","the","film","open","credit","much","littl","themselv","in","the","rest","of","it","a","it","turn","out","the","onli","movi","which","connect","that","three","actor","togeth","be","the","equal","obscur","la","vega","ladi","but","what","that","on","have","to","do","with","the","crater","lake","monster","be","anybodi","guess","br","br","even","so","sinc","i","pai","for","it","rental","and","i","be","in","a","monstermovi","mood","anyhow","i","elect","to","watch","the","movi","regardless","and","yup","it","stink","apart","from","the","fact","that","it","have","a","nonam","cast","and","a","anonym","crow","a","unmistak","amateurish","air","be","visibl","from","mile","awai","and","the","much","i","can","do","with","it","be","laugh","at","the","jawslik","pretens","and","intention","so","at","the","resist","antic","of","two","moron","layaboutscumboat","owner","who","frequent","squabbl","among","themselv","with","the","bemus","local","sheriff","look","on","the","creatur","itself","a","plesiosaur","ie","halfdinosaurhalffish","be","imperfectli","realiz","natur","but","a","have","be","the","case","with","the","giant","claw","which","i","have","conjur","just","see","thi","do","not","seem","to","bother","the","filmmak","none","a","thei","flaunt","it","a","much","a","thei","can","especi","dure","the","movi","half"],"filtered":["man","scam","thi","turn","becaus","ani","good","realli","expect","anyth","becaus","mislead","dvd","sleev","ignorantli","parad","star","stuart","whitman","stella","steven","toni","bill","sure","enough","name","appear","film","open","credit","much","littl","themselv","rest","turn","onli","movi","connect","three","actor","togeth","equal","obscur","la","vega","ladi","crater","lake","monster","anybodi","guess","br","br","even","sinc","pai","rental","monstermovi","mood","anyhow","elect","watch","movi","regardless","yup","stink","apart","fact","nonam","cast","anonym","crow","unmistak","amateurish","air","visibl","mile","awai","much","laugh","jawslik","pretens","intention","resist","antic","two","moron","layaboutscumboat","owner","frequent","squabbl","among","themselv","bemus","local","sheriff","look","creatur","plesiosaur","ie","halfdinosaurhalffish","imperfectli","realiz","natur","case","giant","claw","conjur","see","thi","seem","bother","filmmak","none","thei","flaunt","much","thei","especi","dure","movi","half"],"filtered2":["man","scam","turn","becaus","ani","good","realli","expect","anyth","becaus","mislead","dvd","sleev","ignorantli","parad","star","stuart","whitman","stella","steven","toni","bill","sure","enough","name","appear","open","credit","littl","themselv","rest","turn","onli","connect","three","actor","togeth","equal","obscur","la","vega","ladi","crater","lake","monster","anybodi","guess","even","sinc","pai","rental","monstermovi","mood","anyhow","elect","watch","regardless","yup","stink","apart","fact","nonam","cast","anonym","crow","unmistak","amateurish","air","visibl","mile","awai","laugh","jawslik","pretens","intention","resist","antic","two","moron","layaboutscumboat","owner","frequent","squabbl","among","themselv","bemus","local","sheriff","look","creatur","plesiosaur","ie","halfdinosaurhalffish","imperfectli","realiz","natur","case","giant","claw","conjur","see","seem","bother","filmmak","none","flaunt","especi","dure","half"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,11,13,14,16,22,27,35,39,41,45,47,92,93,96,97,100,104,119,130,133,143,155,162,170,206,224,226,239,242,243,247,267,270,288,322,323,356,370,405,413,436,456,472,475,496,572,679,722,761,766,767,768,826,906,907,1129,1188,1194,1206,1209,1387,1409,1416,1438,1456,1505,1644,1763,1774,2084,2174,2528,2787,2899,3112,3210,3428,3435,3442,3820,4220,4286,4549,4590,4749,4882,5482,6381,7287,7598,7903],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,11,13,14,16,22,27,35,39,41,45,47,92,93,96,97,100,104,119,130,133,143,155,162,170,206,224,226,239,242,243,247,267,270,288,322,323,356,370,405,413,436,456,472,475,496,572,679,722,761,766,767,768,826,906,907,1129,1188,1194,1206,1209,1387,1409,1416,1438,1456,1505,1644,1763,1774,2084,2174,2528,2787,2899,3112,3210,3428,3435,3442,3820,4220,4286,4549,4590,4749,4882,5482,6381,7287,7598,7903],"values":[0.655700

{"value":"Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (even though she killed six people) and delivered to the Hope Bartholomew halfway house. Once there, she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food.<br /><br />HOLY MOLY! Does this movie suck! You know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film, apparently filmed off a TV screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style doesn't translate well to video. Seriously, I have made home movies with more production value than this. And Millard tries to pull a SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film (which looks like it was taken off a worn VHS copy). Alden is again good as Ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage. I mean, at least the first film tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if that is at all possible), shaky camera work, horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two VCRs hooked up.

{"value":"I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part in it, and her character isn't very likable. However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie. This is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. She does a very good job.<br /><br />The story itself is, on the face of it, pretty nonsensical. After a car crash, some friends are possibly dead, but keeps on living their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we never really find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them). The final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious, but I can't get anything coherent out of it. The opening scene, where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut a blond girl's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who're trying to pull Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead... but no, that doesn't seem to work. The bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys?<br /><br />3 out of

{"value":"This is the most saccharine romance I ever sat through. The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief, housedress, and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbons. In fact, bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.<br /><br />The only reason I was able to watch to the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican, really. <br /><br />The dialog is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect-mannered and mild. The aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy story.<br /><br />I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for. The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I didn't see his name listed, but the art director surely was Thomas Kinkade, who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias.

{"value":"OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM LEGEND.<br /><br />It is, without doubt, the most disappointing TR game yet. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally unplayable and I've given up. I feel like I've been robbed by Eidos.<br /><br />It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard. In AOD they were 'tacky', but still the same general control sequences. In Legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />I have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'Use the mouse'. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a gamepad'. No, why should I? Others say 'But this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years' Well, I don't care, it is not the standard for any other TR game so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they couldn't care less about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money. Pathetic.<br /><br />My advice to any serious TR fan is keep away from this game, and if you do buy it complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other posts, mainly on the Eidos forums, from people telling them how rubbish it is, perhaps they will listen.","finished_norm":["okai","plain","and","simpl","if","you","be","a","fan","of","the","other","tomb","raider","game","ye","even","aod","keep","awai","from","legendbr","br","it","be","without","doubt","the","much","disappoint","tr","game","yet","it","look","veri","nice","it","sound","veri","nice","but","it","be","total","unplay","and","i","have","give","up","i","feel","like","i","have","be","rob","by","eidosbr","br","it","veri","simpl","tr","be","a","pc","game","befor","anyth","els","you","control","lara","us","the","keyboard","in","tomb","raider","game","the","control","be","standard","in","aod","thei","be","tacki","but","still","the","same","gener","control","sequenc","in","legend","thei","have","chang","her","movem","and","control","method","complet","and","she","be","total","uncontrollablebr","br","i","have","see","comment","elsewher","from","peopl","who","sai","us","the","mous","no","why","should","i","other","sai","us","a","gamepad","no","why","should","i","other","sai","but","thi","have","be","the","standard","for","rd","person","control","for","year","good","i","do","not","care","it","be","not","the","standard","for","ani","other","tr","game","so","why","mess","with","it","oh","i","know","becaus","thei","can","not","care","littl","about","their","origin","loyal","fan","base","thei","want","to","cash","in","on","the","new","kid","who","have","not","even","hear","of","the","seri","until","the","movi","come","out","and","make","lot","much","monei","patheticbr","br","my","advic","to","ani","seriou","tr","fan","be","keep","awai","from","thi","game","and","if","you","do","bui","it","complain","to","eido","i","have","see","mass","of","other","post","mainli","on","the","eido","forum","from","peopl","tell","them","how","rubbish","it","be","perhap","thei","will","listen"],"filtered":["okai","plain","simpl","fan","tomb","raider","game","ye","even","aod","keep","awai","legendbr","br","without","doubt","much","disappoint","tr","game","yet","look","veri","nice","sound","veri","nice","total","unplay","give","feel","like","rob","eidosbr","br","veri","simpl","tr","pc","game","befor","anyth","els","control","lara","us","keyboard","tomb","raider","game","control","standard","aod","thei","tacki","still","gener","control","sequenc","legend","thei","chang","movem","control","method","complet","total","uncontrollablebr","br","see","comment","elsewher","peopl","sai","us","mous","sai","us","gamepad","sai","thi","standard","rd","person","control","year","good","care","standard","ani","tr","game","mess","oh","know","becaus","thei","care","littl","origin","loyal","fan","base","thei","want","cash","new","kid","even","hear","seri","movi","come","make","lot","much","monei","patheticbr","br","advic","ani","seriou","tr","fan","keep","awai","thi","game","bui","complain","eido","see","mass","post","mainli","eido","forum","peopl","tell","rubbish","perhap","thei","listen"],"filtered2":["okai","plain","simpl","fan","tomb","raider","game","ye","even","aod","keep","awai","legendbr","without","doubt","disappoint","tr","game","yet","look","veri","nice","sound","veri","nice","total","unplay","give","feel","like","rob","eidosbr","veri","simpl","tr","pc","game","befor","anyth","els","control","lara","us","keyboard","tomb","raider","game","control","standard","aod","tacki","still","gener","control","sequenc","legend","chang","movem","control","method","complet","total","uncontrollablebr","see","comment","elsewher","peopl","us","mous","us","gamepad","standard","rd","person","control","year","good","care","standard","ani","tr","game","mess","oh","know","becaus","care","littl","origin","loyal","fan","base","want","cash","new","kid","even","hear","come","make","lot","monei","patheticbr","advic","ani","seriou","tr","fan","keep","awai","game","bui","complain","eido","see","mass","post","mainli","eido","forum","peopl","tell","rubbish","perhap","listen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,14,15,16,22,23,26,27,30,34,37,43,56,57,64,69,72,79,87,90,103,104,114,125,126,134,140,153,155,178,184,187,191,194,196,205,209,216,225,234,262,278,280,318,334,347,349,374,407,493,567,586,616,736,824,845,1098,1210,1223,1283,1377,1454,1553,1659,1823,1830,2342,2350,2565,2788,3034,3590,3734,4131,4194,5334,5953,6425,7349],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,14,15,16,22,23,26,27,30,34,37,43,56,57,64,69,72,79,87,90,103,104,114,125,126,134,140,153,155,178,184,187,191,194,196,205,209,216,225,234,262,278,280,318,334,347,349,374,407,493,567,586,616,736,824,845,1098,1210,1223,1283,1377,1454,1553,1659,1823,1830,2342,2350,2565,2788,3034,3590,3734,4131,4194,5334,5953,6425,7349],"values":[0.6199767156205

{"value":"I attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end.<br /><br />I don't understand how this movie *genuinely* got any good reviews. I think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more pitiful. Movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones!! <br /><br />The acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie, and not in a funny way. I don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. <br /><br />I found the lead character to be irritating. His facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish. I thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded, but they were even worse. <br /><br />The script was also very awkward (his bosses overdone business speech) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks. <br /><br />I did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women.<br /><br />Never have I felt that a rating was this misleading. I was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else.

{"value":"The fact that I watched this entire movie says something about it...or me. It is not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in that perverse manner that is akin to watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would have made a great MST3K subject!<br /><br />Most of the things that make a terrible movie enjoyable are here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, contrived plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You'll thrill to slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouths agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their impending doom, facing the outrageously contrived deliverer of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by old action scene cliches like when two women struggle for a gun and it goes off, but WHO'S SHOT? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly 15 minutes later), one finally goes down. You'll sing along (in latin of course) with the street carolers that turn into a ghastly death's-choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical.<br /><br />So if you believe like I do that as movies get worse they get better, then this might be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, \"They Live\" featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than luke-warm movies like Omen II or III.<br /><br />I give it 4 out of 10.","finished_norm":["the","fact","that","i","watch","thi","entir","movi","sai","someth","about","itor","me","it","be","not","a","good","movi","terribl","in","fact","but","terribl","in","the","wai","that","keep","my","attent","in","that","pervers","manner","that","be","akin","to","watch","a","tragedi","and","not","be","abl","to","look","awai","it","would","have","make","a","great","mstk","subjectbr","br","much","of","the","thing","that","make","a","terribl","movi","enjoy","be","here","bad","dialogu","inappropri","music","contriv","plot","sequenc","ridicul","pseudosci","you","will","thrill","to","slomo","death","sequenc","the","poor","victim","with","mouth","agap","and","waaaaaaaai","too","much","time","to","contempl","their","impend","doom","face","the","outrag","contriv","deliver","of","their","death","your","heart","will","be","warm","by","old","action","scene","clich","like","when","two","woman","struggl","for","a","gun","and","it","go","off","but","who","shoot","both","look","at","themselv","then","the","other","then","themselv","then","seemingli","minut","late","on","final","go","down","you","will","sing","along","in","latin","of","cours","with","the","street","carol","that","turn","into","a","ghastli","deathschoir","that","for","a","moment","threaten","to","turn","the","movi","into","a","twist","musicalbr","br","so","if","you","believ","like","i","do","that","a","movi","get","wrong","thei","get","well","then","thi","mai","be","a","decent","choic","for","you","it","not","a","funni","a","my","current","scifi","schlock","favorit","thei","live","featur","rowdi","roddi","piper","but","it","much","fun","to","watch","than","lukewarm","movi","like","omen","ii","or","iiibr","br","i","give","it","out","of"],"filtered":["fact","watch","thi","entir","movi","sai","someth","itor","good","movi","terribl","fact","terribl","wai","keep","attent","pervers","manner","akin","watch","tragedi","abl","look","awai","make","great","mstk","subjectbr","br","much","thing","make","terribl","movi","enjoy","bad","dialogu","inappropri","music","contriv","plot","sequenc","ridicul","pseudosci","thrill","slomo","death","sequenc","poor","victim","mouth","agap","waaaaaaaai","much","time","contempl","impend","doom","face","outrag","contriv","deliver","death","heart","warm","old","action","scene","clich","like","two","woman","struggl","gun","go","shoot","look","themselv","themselv","seemingli","minut","late","final","go","sing","along","latin","cours","street","carol","turn","ghastli","deathschoir","moment","threaten","turn","movi","twist","musicalbr","br","believ","like","movi","get","wrong","thei","get","well","thi","mai","decent","choic","funni","current","scifi","schlock","favorit","thei","live","featur","rowdi","roddi","piper","much","fun","watch","lukewarm","movi","like","omen","ii","iiibr","br","give"],"filtered2":["fact","watch","entir","someth","itor","good","terribl","fact","terribl","wai","keep","attent","pervers","manner","akin","watch","tragedi","abl","look","awai","make","great","mstk","subjectbr","thing","make","terribl","enjoy","bad","dialogu","inappropri","music","contriv","plot","sequenc","ridicul","pseudosci","thrill","slomo","death","sequenc","poor","victim","mouth","agap","waaaaaaaai","time","contempl","impend","doom","face","outrag","contriv","deliver","death","heart","warm","old","action","scene","clich","like","two","woman","struggl","gun","go","shoot","look","themselv","themselv","seemingli","minut","late","final","go","sing","along","latin","cours","street","carol","turn","ghastli","deathschoir","moment","threaten","turn","twist","musicalbr","believ","like","get","wrong","get","well","mai","decent","choic","funni","current","scifi","schlock","favorit","live","featur","rowdi","roddi","piper","fun","watch","lukewarm","like","omen","ii","iiibr","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,8,9,16,19,20,25,29,30,32,33,46,47,51,53,59,62,67,70,91,96,97,116,117,118,129,134,146,150,155,156,166,188,198,199,245,248,251,259,274,305,309,324,349,435,436,454,501,535,614,636,660,664,737,781,809,822,842,941,1046,1169,1180,1205,1218,1360,1548,1581,1639,1739,1875,1922,2072,2328,2438,3234,3283,3496,3618,3705,3858,4860,6311,6467,6966],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,8,9,16,19,20,25,29,30,32,33,46,47,51,53,59,62,67,70,91,96,97,116,117,118,129,134,146,150,155,156,166,188,198,199,245,248,251,259,274,305,309,324,349,435,436,454,501,535,614,636,660,664,737,781,809,822,842,941,1046,1169,1180,1205,1218,1360,1548,1581,1639,1739,1875,1922,2072,2328,2438,3234,3283,3496,3618,3705,3858,4860,6311,6467,6966],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.938

{"value":"What was the deal with the clothes? They were all dressed like something out of the late 70's early 80s. The cars were even were outdated. The school was outdated. The nuns attire was outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40's, with its wards and wooden staircases and things. Nothing in the whole movie implied it took place in 1991. My mother was laughing, saying \"Geeeee-od! WHEN was this movie MADE?\" When we pressed the \"INFO BUTTON\" on our remote, we were sure 1991 had to be typo! Did anybody else notice this? My FAVORITE part, though, was when the woman tells her uppity muck husband, on the telephone, about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just says \"Well, look, I've got a congress meeting. I'll talk to you about it later.\" That line was just classic. JUST LIKE A MAN! My mothers favorite part was when they gave the \"Spawn of the Devil Child\" her very own Rottweiler. My mother said \"Just what the Spawn of the Devil needs... a Rottweiler\" She also enjoyed all of the people collapsing in the churches, clutching their chests. Her OTHER favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles a hour, driving right into the garbage truck/dump truck/front end loader thingee. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car...but he just kept going, with a real dumb vacant look on his face. I mean, how fast can you GO in a school parking lot?!?!

{"value":"The fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in Switzerland's film history makes me shake my head! It's true, but pitiful at the same time. A flick about the Swiss army could be a good deal better.<br /><br />The story sounds interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church, wedding his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter).<br /><br />The Acting in some way doesn't really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally i found her rather annoying. <br /><br />The storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance, which does not work as expected. The romance-part is too trashy, and the comedy-part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever. It's funny for preadolescent 12-13 year olds, but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy. The humor is weak except for some shots.<br /><br />Dope? Cool! Stealing? Cool! If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you did not absolve your military training yet, and even then don't expect too much!<br /><br />I'll give it 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time.

{"value":"Normally, I have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get it off my chest.<br /><br />You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet... well, this movie was just terrible. It is nigh on impossible to \"suspend disbelief\"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it but Justin Timberlake just wouldn't let me. <br /><br />Timberlake should stick to music, what a dreadful performance - NO presence as an actor,NO character. Can't blame everything on Justin: The movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing; its definitely an \"F\".<br /><br />After seeing this, I have to wonder what really motivates actors. I mean, surely Morgan actually read the script before taking the part. Did he not see how poor it was? What then could motivate him to take the part? Money? Of course, acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work. <br /><br />LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets a lot more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the audience goes: \"What the hell is going on here? You expect me to believe this crap?\"<br /><br />In short, apart from Justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing.","finished_norm":["normal","i","have","much","well","thing","to","do","with","my","time","than","write","review","but","i","be","so","disappoint","with","thi","movi","that","i","spend","a","hour","regist","with","imdb","just","to","get","it","off","my","chestbr","br","you","would","think","a","movi","with","name","like","morgan","freeman","or","kevin","spacei","would","be","a","bankabl","bet","good","thi","movi","be","just","terribl","it","be","nigh","on","imposs","to","suspend","disbelief","i","try","realli","i","want","to","enjoi","it","but","justin","timberlak","just","would","not","let","me","br","br","timberlak","should","stick","to","music","what","a","dread","perform","no","presenc","a","a","actorno","charact","ca","not","blame","everyth","on","justin","the","movi","conjur","boast","a","dread","plot","badli","time","edit","it","definit","a","fbr","br","after","see","thi","i","have","to","wonder","what","realli","motiv","actor","i","mean","sure","morgan","actual","read","the","script","befor","take","the","part","do","he","not","see","how","poor","it","be","what","then","can","motiv","him","to","take","the","part","monei","of","cours","act","be","at","time","much","about","who","you","be","see","with","rather","than","realli","develop","qualiti","work","br","br","will","cool","j","be","a","great","actor","he","get","a","lot","much","screen","time","than","freeman","or","spacei","in","thi","movi","and","realli","struggl","to","come","to","term","with","the","poor","script","br","br","meanwhil","the","audienc","go","what","the","hell","be","go","on","here","you","expect","me","to","believ","thi","crapbr","br","in","short","apart","from","justin","a","great","lineup","badli","execut","veri","disappoint"],"filtered":["normal","much","well","thing","time","write","review","disappoint","thi","movi","spend","hour","regist","imdb","get","chestbr","br","think","movi","name","like","morgan","freeman","kevin","spacei","bankabl","bet","good","thi","movi","terribl","nigh","imposs","suspend","disbelief","try","realli","want","enjoi","justin","timberlak","let","br","br","timberlak","stick","music","dread","perform","presenc","actorno","charact","ca","blame","everyth","justin","movi","conjur","boast","dread","plot","badli","time","edit","definit","fbr","br","see","thi","wonder","realli","motiv","actor","mean","sure","morgan","actual","read","script","befor","take","part","see","poor","motiv","take","part","monei","cours","act","time","much","see","rather","realli","develop","qualiti","work","br","br","cool","j","great","actor","get","lot","much","screen","time","freeman","spacei","thi","movi","realli","struggl","come","term","poor","script","br","br","meanwhil","audienc","go","hell","go","expect","believ","thi","crapbr","br","short","apart","justin","great","lineup","badli","execut","veri","disappoint"],"filtered2":["normal","well","thing","time","write","review","disappoint","spend","hour","regist","imdb","get","chestbr","think","name","like","morgan","freeman","kevin","spacei","bankabl","bet","good","terribl","nigh","imposs","suspend","disbelief","try","realli","want","enjoi","justin","timberlak","let","timberlak","stick","music","dread","perform","presenc","actorno","charact","ca","blame","everyth","justin","conjur","boast","dread","plot","badli","time","edit","definit","fbr","see","wonder","realli","motiv","actor","mean","sure","morgan","actual","read","script","befor","take","part","see","poor","motiv","take","part","monei","cours","act","time","see","rather","realli","develop","qualiti","work","cool","j","great","actor","get","lot","screen","time","freeman","spacei","realli","struggl","come","term","poor","script","meanwhil","audienc","go","hell","go","expect","believ","crapbr","short","apart","justin","great","lineup","badli","execut","veri","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,13,15,20,21,29,31,32,34,36,37,39,41,48,51,52,61,65,72,77,79,81,88,91,105,118,119,124,126,130,143,145,146,160,166,168,174,175,176,187,192,193,199,200,272,283,319,320,348,392,394,416,448,481,572,591,662,700,842,858,898,901,902,995,1159,1451,1491,1728,1749,1780,2042,2210,2664,2715,2862,2950,3021,3194,3303,7332],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,13,15,20,21,29,31,32,34,36,37,39,41,48,51,52,61,65,72,77,79,81,88,91,105,118,119,124,126,130,143,145,146,160,166,168,174,175,176,187,192,193,199,200,272,283,319,320,348,392,394,416,448,481,572,591,662,700,842,858,898,901,902,995,1159,1451,1491,1728,1749,1780,2042,2210,2664,2715,2862,2950,3021,3194,3303,7332],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.678614

{"value":"It's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. I am not a dullard as far as quality films go, and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint, as well as for several of the characters portrayed, the film is in an award-worthy class. But there is no sense (for me) of this film actually going anywhere; I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. It is a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more from a film. I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival, none of which did I find in this film. Yes, it might be considered poetry on film . . . but there is much poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere.<br /><br />One thing further to be said is that it documents a mid-century English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally appalled at what a young British boy had to live through, in that time and place. Having grown up in America just a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. I cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its 'filmic magic' (which I acknowledge is there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one's actual

{"value":"Question: how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration ? Answer: by turning it into an existential alienation parable.<br /><br />Yes, we're back in the early 90s, just after the disintegration of the Eastern block and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated upper-class politician, his existentially alienated rich wife, and so on.<br /><br />In the background, immigrants are asking for political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders. I guess that way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with the existentially troubled upper-classes. I mean honestly, the scene where some top-ranking army-officer curses his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you puke.<br /><br />Anyway, it can't be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of the cinematic art after all, right ? Wrong. It's at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial, sort of like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks show up: there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a weird wedding, a walk by the river-shore, and people with yellow water-coats. Also Mastroianni breaks new ground for most sleepwalking performance ever. Avoid really.

{"value":"I thought that I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", but this film compete with it.<br /><br />I´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. I woke up, and started to watching it agian. Why did I deserve that? All the movie was a torture, I have to use fast forward to watch it complete.<br /><br />I can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time (MR. WALKEN) could done this thing. I have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...<br /><br />What about the movie? it´s not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), effects are very poor, lack of deaths & blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. And I mean it. Can´t stand how a director can make a film like this.<br /><br />Anyway, When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by \"Stephen King\", I think he could never present this crap, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I not recommend it in a million years.<br /><br />I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my \"Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" review, there will be always a worse movies, thats why it don´t deserves a 1 out of

{"value":"When I had first heard of \"Solar Crisis\" then got a load of the cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. Then I saw it.<br /><br />Now I know.<br /><br />For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back.<br /><br />And the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency.<br /><br />Don't get me started about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess. Makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in Hollywood....<br /><br />And as far as the end goes.... Well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this. If it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, maybe I would have heard of \"Solar Crisis\" sooner.<br /><br />Two stars.

{"value":"Or maybe that's what it feels like. Anyway, \"The Bat People\" is about as flat as a rug, bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock...and as intelligent as all three combined.<br /><br />Okay, plot in a nutshell (fitting vessel, that...): a doctor (Moss) gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and subsequently turns into a bat - well, not exactly a bat but a bat-like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first-person camera viewpoint....<br /><br />But then there's the business of the sheriff (Pataki), who is about the WORST kind of sheriff: the hick kind. He hassles people, he leers at married women, he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (the FIEND!), he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time, making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and (this is the worst part)... HE'S THE MOST LIKEABLE CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE FILM!<br /><br />The whole film, though, is just TV movie-of-the-week-like crapola (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, for crying out loud!

{"value":"What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and Tears. What we've got, is a film with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so, but he fails miserably. He acts so wooden, that at any given moment he should crack. He tries to play the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake? Cause he brings her coal bricks? The SFX are very, very well done. Too much though. The hundreds or so planes over Berlin, look like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was. Interestingly enough, the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same drapes, hanging deep down the windows, as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, comes across as a small time, insecure, looser General, who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift. He was very much the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion, no suspense and no historic accuracy.

{"value":"Honestly before I watched this movie, I had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace. I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie, and watched it by my own. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie.<br /><br />Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their roles are rather stupid.<br /><br />Well you might think if the players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story. It is indeed story is the core of a movie, but guys... trust me... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story. Imagine this, a smart-ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice (LL Cool J) and an brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). At the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story.<br /><br />Jeez, I could not even carry on with this. Just recalling the movie is making me sick already. My advise guys, don't watch this! Please save your money and time for another movie.","finished_norm":["honestli","befor","i","watch","thi","movi","i","have","hear","mani","peopl","sai","thi","movi","be","a","disgrac","i","do","not","believ","that","sinc","morgan","freeman","and","kevin","spacei","have","take","role","in","thi","movi","and","watch","it","by","my","own","appar","thei","be","right","i","be","realli","disappoint","and","wonder","all","the","time","dure","the","movi","why","the","hell","do","i","watch","thi","moviebr","br","of","cours","i","be","not","expect","much","from","justin","a","he","realli","doe","not","belong","in","the","movietheat","busi","but","morgan","and","kevin","i","can","not","stop","ask","myself","why","the","heck","thei","agre","to","take","part","in","edison","to","be","honest","their","role","be","rather","stupidbr","br","good","you","mai","think","if","the","player","suck","then","i","should","pai","much","attent","to","the","stori","it","be","ind","stori","be","the","core","of","a","movi","but","gui","trust","me","thi","be","not","a","movi","you","want","to","give","a","credit","for","it","stori","imagin","thi","a","smartass","journalist","justin","timberlak","write","a","stori","against","the","system","and","at","the","same","time","learn","how","to","becom","a","real","journalist","from","hi","boss","morgan","freeman","thi","all","be","support","by","on","agent","who","still","have","heart","for","justic","will","cool","j","and","a","brilliant","investig","kevin","spacei","at","the","end","thei","beat","the","system","with","a","happi","end","storybr","br","jeez","i","can","not","even","carri","on","with","thi","just","recal","the","movi","be","make","me","sick","alreadi","my","advis","gui","do","not","watch","thi","pleas","save","your","monei","and","time","for","anoth","movi"],"filtered":["honestli","befor","watch","thi","movi","hear","mani","peopl","sai","thi","movi","disgrac","believ","sinc","morgan","freeman","kevin","spacei","take","role","thi","movi","watch","appar","thei","right","realli","disappoint","wonder","time","dure","movi","hell","watch","thi","moviebr","br","cours","expect","much","justin","realli","doe","belong","movietheat","busi","morgan","kevin","stop","ask","heck","thei","agre","take","part","edison","honest","role","rather","stupidbr","br","good","mai","think","player","suck","pai","much","attent","stori","ind","stori","core","movi","gui","trust","thi","movi","want","give","credit","stori","imagin","thi","smartass","journalist","justin","timberlak","write","stori","system","time","learn","becom","real","journalist","hi","boss","morgan","freeman","thi","support","agent","still","heart","justic","cool","j","brilliant","investig","kevin","spacei","end","thei","beat","system","happi","end","storybr","br","jeez","even","carri","thi","recal","movi","make","sick","alreadi","advis","gui","watch","thi","pleas","save","monei","time","anoth","movi"],"filtered2":["honestli","befor","watch","hear","mani","peopl","disgrac","believ","sinc","morgan","freeman","kevin","spacei","take","role","watch","appar","right","realli","disappoint","wonder","time","dure","hell","watch","moviebr","cours","expect","justin","realli","doe","belong","movietheat","busi","morgan","kevin","stop","ask","heck","agre","take","part","edison","honest","role","rather","stupidbr","good","mai","think","player","suck","pai","attent","stori","ind","stori","core","gui","trust","want","give","credit","stori","imagin","smartass","journalist","justin","timberlak","write","stori","system","time","learn","becom","real","journalist","boss","morgan","freeman","support","agent","still","heart","justic","cool","j","brilliant","investig","kevin","spacei","end","beat","system","happi","end","storybr","jeez","even","carri","recal","make","sick","alreadi","advis","gui","watch","pleas","save","monei","time","anoth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,8,12,13,17,18,23,24,30,31,37,46,50,55,61,64,65,73,79,80,91,115,121,126,128,130,160,162,175,187,189,199,216,239,306,308,315,322,330,340,346,356,394,421,431,459,465,481,605,614,621,622,636,678,757,778,790,829,912,999,1069,1102,1113,1251,1290,1354,1424,1491,1540,1546,1703,1749,1930,2042,2043,2208,2210,2544,2664,2834,2862,2950,3976,5141,6767],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,8,12,13,17,18,23,24,30,31,37,46,50,55,61,64,65,73,79,80,91,115,121,126,128,130,160,162,175,187,189,199,216,239,306,308,315,322,330,340,346,356,394,421,431,459,465,481,605,614,621,622,636,678,757,778,790,829,912,999,1069,1102,1113,1251,1290,1354,1424,1491,1540,1546,1703,1749,1930,2042,2043,2208,2210,2544,2664,2834,2862,2950,3976,5141,6767],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.67861

{"value":"My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and \"Office Space\". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an \"also recommended\" selection if you liked \"Office Space\".<br /><br />Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. \"Haiku Tunnel\" is similar to \"office Space\" in that they are both films. That's where the similarity ends. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. It didn't. We couldn't take it any more, and stopped the tape. Thank GOD it was a free rental. I'd have been p***ed if we'd actually paid for it. We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. I doubt it.<br /><br />Haiku Tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced. The movie is SO unfunny it's painful. Just mail the friggin letters already!!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are awful. We got as far as the \"printer doesn't work\" scene and had to stop.

{"value":"The Priyadarshan/Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie (at an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the slick promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before it, this movie was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />Like others have commented, the premise of the movie, which was already stale to begin with, just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I had been watching this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week. I only remember giggling like twice the entire movie. Definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had a few of his expected classic moments, but overall, because his role and character wasn't given much room to grow, he didn't make much of an impact in this film.<br /><br />Neha Dhupia, who makes only an appearance in the movie, was fun to look at while she was on screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively.

{"value":"First off, I really loved Henry Fool, which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers. Parker Posey is one of best actresses on-screen today. But this film was a full-out travesty. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride, and making pointless analogies to Star Wars - was stomach-turning. This was hype on the producers part (HDNET) realized to the max. A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Mostly I feel that Hal has spoiled HENRY FOOL forever. I don't think I can ever see it again in it's pure, innocent light.<br /><br />Remember Hal, you can FOOL some of the people some of the time... etc. The director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage. Sadly, it's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or its box-office hopes are dim indeed. Never mind a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a straitjacket.<br /><br />The score, I believe Hartley's, is tasteless. With drum hits walking all over dialog. There was one Apple Soundtrack loop I recognized that gave me a smile.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they're just trying to grab a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I'd be happy to spoil this movie for you, but it's been done. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead.

{"value":"Unfortunately, one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering, silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate, clichéd screenplay. Hollow Man is a rather useless film.<br /><br />Practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects. However, it is just the same special effect done over and over again, and by the end of the film that has been done to death also. I was hoping before watching Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not so. It isn't long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clichés piles up so fast that it's almost impressive.<br /><br />On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best. Good points might be a passable Jerry Goldsmith score (but no competition for his better efforts), a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push Hollow Man's merit up one notch.<br /><br

{"value":"I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that, my girl friend turned to me and said \"we have to go see this movie\"...enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall. I would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development.<br /><br />The plot is just...well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, That's brilliant! hmmm The acting was what you expect in a Australian soap opera hopeless, that main character the Blondie god dam she annoyed me. her longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression.<br /><br />Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this, and if your like me and don't have a choice well then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine. Can't believe this film got made!","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","trailer","and","think","to","myself","my","god","be","thi","movi","for","real","who","would","want","to","see","thi","movi","and","at","the","same","time","i","think","that","my","girl","friend","turn","to","me","and","sai","we","have","to","go","see","thi","movieenough","sai","so","i","see","thi","about","minut","go","and","i","try","to","put","on","a","brave","face","and","enjoi","the","cheap","scare","but","there","be","not","even","ani","of","that","it","have","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","the","director","have","no","influenc","no","perspect","the","same","shot","be","us","again","and","again","he","do","not","build","up","suspens","the","cast","probabl","be","simpli","tell","scream","cry","run","fall","i","would","love","to","see","the","script","a","the","min","be","mostli","annoi","girli","giggl","and","bad","music","there","be","absolut","no","charact","developmentbr","br","the","plot","be","justwel","there","be","no","plot","it","be","basic","i","know","we","will","terror","a","high","school","group","on","their","prom","night","with","a","stalker","serial","killer","that","brilliant","hmmm","the","act","be","what","you","expect","in","a","australian","soap","opu","hopeless","that","main","charact","the","blondi","god","dam","she","annoi","me","her","long","line","must","have","be","half","a","sentenc","and","everi","time","she","be","on","camera","she","be","just","pull","anoth","rude","facial","expressionbr","br","pleas","listen","to","me","if","you","have","ani","tast","in","movi","do","not","go","see","thi","and","if","your","like","me","and","do","not","have","a","choic","good","then","i","wish","you","good","luck","mayb","smuggl","in","a","ipod","or","magazin","ca","not","believ","thi","film","get","make"],"filtered":["see","thi","trailer","think","god","thi","movi","real","want","see","thi","movi","time","think","girl","friend","turn","sai","go","see","thi","movieenough","sai","see","thi","minut","go","try","put","brave","face","enjoi","cheap","scare","even","ani","wrong","movi","ever","see","director","influenc","perspect","shot","us","build","suspens","cast","probabl","simpli","tell","scream","cry","run","fall","love","see","script","min","mostli","annoi","girli","giggl","bad","music","absolut","charact","developmentbr","br","plot","justwel","plot","basic","know","terror","high","school","group","prom","night","stalker","serial","killer","brilliant","hmmm","act","expect","australian","soap","opu","hopeless","main","charact","blondi","god","dam","annoi","long","line","must","half","sentenc","everi","time","camera","pull","anoth","rude","facial","expressionbr","br","pleas","listen","ani","tast","movi","go","see","thi","like","choic","good","wish","good","luck","mayb","smuggl","ipod","magazin","ca","believ","thi","film","get","make"],"filtered2":["see","trailer","think","god","real","want","see","time","think","girl","friend","turn","go","see","movieenough","see","minut","go","try","put","brave","face","enjoi","cheap","scare","even","ani","wrong","ever","see","director","influenc","perspect","shot","us","build","suspens","cast","probabl","simpli","tell","scream","cry","run","fall","love","see","script","min","mostli","annoi","girli","giggl","bad","music","absolut","charact","developmentbr","plot","justwel","plot","basic","know","terror","high","school","group","prom","night","stalker","serial","killer","brilliant","hmmm","act","expect","australian","soap","opu","hopeless","main","charact","blondi","god","dam","annoi","long","line","must","half","sentenc","everi","time","camera","pull","anoth","rude","facial","expressionbr","pleas","listen","ani","tast","go","see","like","choic","good","wish","good","luck","mayb","smuggl","ipod","magazin","ca","believ","get","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,21,25,26,27,32,36,37,44,54,56,58,59,73,77,80,81,84,85,90,91,92,96,99,107,118,130,137,141,148,159,161,163,169,179,200,201,206,210,211,222,231,251,252,271,286,296,346,351,352,399,410,441,477,510,526,529,544,623,809,845,856,872,912,950,1134,1200,1343,1448,1792,1801,1826,1893,1924,1980,2118,2228,2348,2369,2891,3289,3313,3761,5307,6798,8139],"values":[1.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,21,25,26,27,32,36,37,44,54,56,58,59,73,77,80,81,84,85,90,91,92,96,99,107,118,130,137,141,148,159,161,163,169,179,200,201,206,210,211,222,231,251,252,271,286,296,346,351,352,399,410,441,477,510,526,529,544,623,809,845,856,872,912,950,1134,1200,1343,1448,1792,1801,1826,1893,1924,1980,2118,2228,2348,2

{"value":"The movie started off strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the Practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.<br /><br />The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. Everything he did in this film was unconvincing.<br /><br />Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.<br /><br />That aside there are a few plot holes, such as Pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery.

{"value":"This film stars, among others, \"SlapChop\" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco--not exactly names that scream out \"quality\". And with such uplifting skits as \"Supermodels taking a dump\" (it's exactly what it sounds like), a guy who robs a sperm bank (the \"Rhymer\"), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar), lots and lots of gay jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions. The skits are painfully unfunny (such as \"Batman and Rhymer\"), the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude...and stupid. I truly believe a group of 8 year-olds could have EASILY made a funnier film with the same budget.<br /><br />Apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by \"Slap Shot\" Vince against the Scientologists. Frankly, I wouldn't know who to root for in this case!!! Apparently, he alleged that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film. No matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny (by comparison, Ebola is funnier)...and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie.<br /><br />By the way, that IS Bobby Lee (from \"Mad TV\") wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film. It's amazing his career could overcome
