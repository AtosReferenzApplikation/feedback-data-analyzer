{"value":"\"Welcome to Collinwood\" is kind of a disaster. Considering the people involved, it should've been multiple times better.<br /><br />Watching it, if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it'll get better, will probably make you cry. It's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but about whom I care so little that I don't even want to know his name.<br /><br />The film's only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces. I found myself thinking of it time and time again as I watched more crime capers. This is the only reason I gave the film a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, needlessly offensive, and highly unlikable. They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they're all so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles. They yell at each other and swear crassly. The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points.<br /><br />I find that Steven \"Traffic\" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes, if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care.","finished_norm":["welcom","to","collinwood","be","kind","of","a","disast","consid","the","peopl","involv","it","should","have","be","multipl","time","betterbr","br","watch","it","if","you","re","at","littl","somewhat","attach","to","the","faith","that","it","will","get","well","will","probabl","make","you","cry","it","on","of","that","movi","that","have","potenti","but","be","rob","of","thi","potenti","thank","to","a","terribl","script","and","some","bad","act","not","to","mention","the","strang","annoi","and","unnecessari","georg","cloonei","charact","and","the","gui","who","remind","me","of","richard","dreyfuss","but","about","whom","i","care","so","littl","that","i","do","not","even","want","to","know","hi","namebr","br","the","film","onli","save","grace","be","the","weird","con","vocabulari","it","introduc","i","find","myself","think","of","it","time","and","time","again","a","i","watch","much","crime","caper","thi","be","the","onli","reason","i","give","the","film","a","the","plot","be","bore","the","charact","be","neurot","needlessli","offens","and","highli","unlik","thei","be","in","a","constant","state","of","agon","stress","and","thei","re","all","so","irrit","that","i","celebr","their","obstacl","thei","yell","at","each","other","and","swear","crassli","the","dialogu","be","insipid","at","well","and","insultingli","stupid","at","it","low","pointsbr","br","i","find","that","steven","traffic","soderbergherabracadabrablahblah","and","georg","cloonei","be","to","blame","for","thi","thei","should","be","try","for","war","crime","if","anyon","actual","rememb","thi","crap","long","enough","to","care"],"filtered":["welcom","collinwood","kind","disast","consid","peopl","involv","multipl","time","betterbr","br","watch","re","littl","somewhat","attach","faith","get","well","probabl","make","cry","movi","potenti","rob","thi","potenti","thank","terribl","script","bad","act","mention","strang","annoi","unnecessari","georg","cloonei","charact","gui","remind","richard","dreyfuss","care","littl","even","want","know","hi","namebr","br","film","onli","save","grace","weird","con","vocabulari","introduc","find","think","time","time","watch","much","crime","caper","thi","onli","reason","give","film","plot","bore","charact","neurot","needlessli","offens","highli","unlik","thei","constant","state","agon","stress","thei","re","irrit","celebr","obstacl","thei","yell","swear","crassli","dialogu","insipid","well","insultingli","stupid","low","pointsbr","br","find","steven","traffic","soderbergherabracadabrablahblah","georg","cloonei","blame","thi","thei","try","war","crime","anyon","actual","rememb","thi","crap","long","enough","care"],"filtered2":["welcom","collinwood","kind","disast","consid","peopl","involv","multipl","time","betterbr","watch","re","littl","somewhat","attach","faith","get","well","probabl","make","cry","potenti","rob","potenti","thank","terribl","script","bad","act","mention","strang","annoi","unnecessari","georg","cloonei","charact","gui","remind","richard","dreyfuss","care","littl","even","want","know","namebr","onli","save","grace","weird","con","vocabulari","introduc","find","think","time","time","watch","crime","caper","onli","reason","give","plot","bore","charact","neurot","needlessli","offens","highli","unlik","constant","state","agon","stress","re","irrit","celebr","obstacl","yell","swear","crassli","dialogu","insipid","well","insultingli","stupid","low","pointsbr","find","steven","traffic","soderbergherabracadabrablahblah","georg","cloonei","blame","try","war","crime","anyon","actual","rememb","crap","long","enough","care"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,20,21,23,26,30,32,36,37,38,52,55,68,77,93,95,99,108,122,136,148,158,166,189,205,217,241,248,271,285,290,313,314,317,417,498,547,596,615,625,641,644,651,680,753,856,896,898,929,958,1034,1072,1081,1145,1149,1194,1458,1539,1553,1597,1663,1949,2011,2127,2169,2279,2773,2823,3814,4782,4991,5184,5203,5218,5517,5589,6661,7370],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,20,21,23,26,30,32,36,37,38,52,55,68,77,93,95,99,108,122,136,148,158,166,189,205,217,241,248,271,285,290,313,314,317,417,498,547,596,615,625,641,644,651,680,753,856,896,898,929,958,1034,1072,1081,1145,1149,1194,1458,1539,1553,1597,1663,1949,2011,2127,2169,2279,2773,2823,3814,4782,4991,5184,5203,5218,5517,5589,6661,7370],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,2.825681057716235,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />In this debut effort for Nick Park's beloved man and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace runs out of cheese.<br /><br />As well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes, this W/G adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows. The plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here, sort of reminiscent of the Mork animation about the little man in the box.<br /><br />Admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is, I've never actually been hugely into Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I've really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (and that was more from when I was younger and less aware of, shall we say, the seedier pleasures of life.) I was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation.<br /><br />As technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this one lacks the emotional angle it's successors were to possess. That being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come.

{"value":"I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since I had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but I came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money I had paid for it. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. If that doesn't thrill you, then stay away.<br /><br />This movie is shot on a home video camera, with grade school props and terrible actors. It's dubbed from German, but even allowing for that, the sound is awful. This film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. If they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film might have been a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />The story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. They are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. I call this a story in the loosest sense, since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog.<br /><br />There is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie, unless you like mindless gore.

{"value":"Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it \"only happening in the movies\" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.","finished_norm":["tiernei","a","authent","tough","gui","but","thi","movi","misfir","from","normal","compet","rko","undercut","hi","impact","at","everi","turn","the","script","be","about","a","plausibl","a","oj","simpson","at","a","ten","cmmandment","dinner","just","count","the","time","tiernei","incred","car","companion","swallow","on","lame","excus","after","anoth","for","hi","evas","and","violent","act","the","old","cliché","about","it","onli","happen","in","the","movi","appli","here","in","spade","then","there","the","gui","plai","the","watchman","who","appear","to","have","wander","in","from","a","boozi","wc","field","comedi","ruin","the","menac","mood","in","the","process","the","static","oneroom","set","do","not","help","either","and","neither","doe","director","feist","obviou","lack","of","feel","for","the","materi","then","add","a","final","car","chase","miss","both","imagin","and","payoff","and","the","result","be","pretti","flat","in","fact","the","movi","onli","pick","up","in","the","stationhous","scene","where","hardbitten","cop","discov","the","hide","power","of","innocentlook","ga","station","attend","too","bad","that","tienei","career","never","realli","gell","i","gather","that","be","due","larg","to","be","a","big","a","tough","gui","offscreen","a","on","and","get","in","on","sleazi","scrape","after","anoth","hi","icecold","manner","and","clariti","of","emot","remind","me","at","time","of","lee","marvin","at","hi","toughgui","well","anywai","thi","project","mai","have","work","a","a","radio","plai","but","a","a","movi","with","a","promis","noir","titl","it","a","disappoint"],"filtered":["tiernei","authent","tough","gui","thi","movi","misfir","normal","compet","rko","undercut","hi","impact","everi","turn","script","plausibl","oj","simpson","ten","cmmandment","dinner","count","time","tiernei","incred","car","companion","swallow","lame","excus","anoth","hi","evas","violent","act","old","cliché","onli","happen","movi","appli","spade","gui","plai","watchman","appear","wander","boozi","wc","field","comedi","ruin","menac","mood","process","static","oneroom","set","help","either","neither","doe","director","feist","obviou","lack","feel","materi","add","final","car","chase","miss","imagin","payoff","result","pretti","flat","fact","movi","onli","pick","stationhous","scene","hardbitten","cop","discov","hide","power","innocentlook","ga","station","attend","bad","tienei","career","never","realli","gell","gather","due","larg","big","tough","gui","offscreen","get","sleazi","scrape","anoth","hi","icecold","manner","clariti","emot","remind","time","lee","marvin","hi","toughgui","well","anywai","thi","project","mai","work","radio","plai","movi","promis","noir","titl","disappoint"],"filtered2":["tiernei","authent","tough","gui","misfir","normal","compet","rko","undercut","impact","everi","turn","script","plausibl","oj","simpson","ten","cmmandment","dinner","count","time","tiernei","incred","car","companion","swallow","lame","excus","anoth","evas","violent","act","old","cliché","onli","happen","appli","spade","gui","plai","watchman","appear","wander","boozi","wc","field","comedi","ruin","menac","mood","process","static","oneroom","set","help","either","neither","doe","director","feist","obviou","lack","feel","materi","add","final","car","chase","miss","imagin","payoff","result","pretti","flat","fact","onli","pick","stationhous","scene","hardbitten","cop","discov","hide","power","innocentlook","ga","station","attend","bad","tienei","career","never","realli","gell","gather","due","larg","big","tough","gui","offscreen","get","sleazi","scrape","anoth","icecold","manner","clariti","emot","remind","time","lee","marvin","toughgui","well","anywai","project","mai","work","radio","plai","promis","noir","titl","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,9,11,13,18,19,20,21,40,42,43,46,48,55,58,67,73,77,78,82,85,94,96,97,109,127,156,170,183,185,187,207,255,264,284,299,340,365,373,383,386,446,447,476,506,511,523,530,537,545,564,568,570,593,617,644,659,683,700,707,710,718,783,885,966,1046,1109,1129,1242,1258,1282,1361,1418,1492,1765,1795,1820,1864,1871,2007,2201,2224,2352,2389,2424,2539,2705,2935,3290,3850,3977,4089,4208,4485,5881,6114,6782,7147],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,9,11,13,18,19,20,21,40,42,43,46,48,55,58,67,73,77,78,82,85,94,96,97,109,127,156,170,183,185,187,207,255,264,284,299,340,365,373,383,386,446,447,476,506,511,523,530,537,545,564,568,570,593,617,644,659,683,700,707,710,718,783,885,966,1046,1109,1129,1242,1258,1282,1361,1418,1492,1765,1795,1820,1864,18

{"value":"THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music) but, sadly, the movie is all downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can. Her husband assures her that it's all merely in her mind and... well, you can probably see where this all is going. You will have figured out what's going on long before our hapless heroine... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done better, too). To add to the movie's myriad transgressions, most cuts of this movie (on numerous cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window... she goes to open it... you know she is going to see something scary... and then... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband's arms.

{"value":"This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant plays. I can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to Shakespeare before. By doing this, though - by making every line clear and every intent obvious - they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature. Somehow, it is actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful material.<br /><br />The acting is forgettable at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not fare so well. April Shawnham's Hero is a pouty, breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces. Jerry Mayer's Don John is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash (though Snidley was much more enjoyable).<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) is not in this version, unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits.<br /><br />Given that the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically a theater god, this production is not only disappointing but head-scratching as well.<br /><br />Don't bother with this. Watch Branagh's Much Ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor, to say nothing of wonderful performances.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","veri","bland","and","inert","product","of","on","of","shakespear","much","vibrant","plai","i","can","onli","guess","that","the","intent","be","to","make","the","plai","a","access","and","understand","a","possibl","to","a","audienc","that","have","not","be","expos","to","shakespear","befor","by","do","thi","though","by","make","everi","line","clear","and","everi","intent","obviou","thei","have","drain","the","plai","of","life","and","turn","it","into","a","flat","caricatur","somehow","it","be","actual","bore","a","veri","hard","feat","give","such","wonder","materialbr","br","the","act","be","forgett","at","well","sam","waterston","a","benedick","and","dougla","watson","a","don","pedro","other","howev","do","not","fare","so","good","april","shawnham","hero","be","a","pouti","breathless","airhead","that","frequent","provok","winc","jerri","mayer","don","john","be","a","nonsens","cartoon","charact","on","the","level","of","snide","whiplash","though","snidlei","be","much","much","enjoyablebr","br","f","murrai","abraham","you","know","the","gui","who","kill","mozart","be","not","in","thi","version","unless","he","be","in","disguis","and","have","hi","name","remov","from","the","creditsbr","br","give","that","the","produc","joseph","papp","be","basic","a","theater","god","thi","product","be","not","onli","disappoint","but","headscratch","a","wellbr","br","do","not","bother","with","thi","watch","branagh","much","ado","instead","hi","version","be","overflow","with","vital","and","humor","to","sai","noth","of","wonder","perform"],"filtered":["thi","veri","bland","inert","product","shakespear","much","vibrant","plai","onli","guess","intent","make","plai","access","understand","possibl","audienc","expos","shakespear","befor","thi","though","make","everi","line","clear","everi","intent","obviou","thei","drain","plai","life","turn","flat","caricatur","somehow","actual","bore","veri","hard","feat","give","wonder","materialbr","br","act","forgett","well","sam","waterston","benedick","dougla","watson","pedro","howev","fare","good","april","shawnham","hero","pouti","breathless","airhead","frequent","provok","winc","jerri","mayer","john","nonsens","cartoon","charact","level","snide","whiplash","though","snidlei","much","much","enjoyablebr","br","f","murrai","abraham","know","gui","kill","mozart","thi","version","unless","disguis","hi","name","remov","creditsbr","br","give","produc","joseph","papp","basic","theater","god","thi","product","onli","disappoint","headscratch","wellbr","br","bother","thi","watch","branagh","much","ado","instead","hi","version","overflow","vital","humor","sai","noth","wonder","perform"],"filtered2":["veri","bland","inert","product","shakespear","vibrant","plai","onli","guess","intent","make","plai","access","understand","possibl","audienc","expos","shakespear","befor","though","make","everi","line","clear","everi","intent","obviou","drain","plai","life","turn","flat","caricatur","somehow","actual","bore","veri","hard","feat","give","wonder","materialbr","act","forgett","well","sam","waterston","benedick","dougla","watson","pedro","howev","fare","good","april","shawnham","hero","pouti","breathless","airhead","frequent","provok","winc","jerri","mayer","john","nonsens","cartoon","charact","level","snide","whiplash","though","snidlei","enjoyablebr","f","murrai","abraham","know","gui","kill","mozart","version","unless","disguis","name","remov","creditsbr","give","produc","joseph","papp","basic","theater","god","product","onli","disappoint","headscratch","wellbr","bother","watch","branagh","ado","instead","version","overflow","vital","humor","noth","wonder","perform"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,10,11,15,20,21,26,30,40,49,52,55,75,76,79,85,86,96,105,107,108,113,143,152,168,171,175,187,190,212,220,243,261,286,291,352,369,375,383,402,424,445,460,496,549,590,593,653,811,905,1028,1058,1096,1391,1431,1527,1763,1776,1790,1845,1904,2137,2275,2341,2540,2640,2742,2871,2874,3109,4367,4561,5098,5552,6369,6604,6864,7418,7514,7686,8299],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,10,11,15,20,21,26,30,40,49,52,55,75,76,79,85,86,96,105,107,108,113,143,152,168,171,175,187,190,212,220,243,261,286,291,352,369,375,383,402,424,445,460,496,549,590,593,653,811,905,1028,1058,1096,1391,1431,1527,1763,1776,1790,1845,1904,2137,2275,2341,2540,2640,2742,2871,2874,3109,4367,4561,5098,5552,6369,6604,6864,7418,7514,7686,8299],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,2.4001215597131385,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,2.6728839783437044,4

{"value":"DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie fans; this barely 80-minute travesty of film-making features everything hecklers can ask for--non-existent plotting, terrible acting (save for at least a raspy-sounding old lady), laughable scripting and schlock editing, and bargain-basement style background settings. There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting (in particular, the lead doesn't have ANYTHING appealing about him), and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F-grade material. If that's not enough, then how about the lack of a compelling plot (which this movie has nothing of the sort) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey? I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1) be topless and/or scantily clad; 2) get raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. In addition, the background music is hideous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy choral bursts, and blaring orchestral cacophony. Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there's plenty of that in here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this 100th-grade CONAN wanna-be to anyone in the least.","finished_norm":["deathstalk","be","perfect","for","bfantasi","movi","fan","thi","bare","minut","travesti","of","filmmak","featur","everyth","heckler","can","ask","fornonexist","plot","terribl","act","save","for","at","littl","a","raspysound","old","ladi","laughabl","script","and","schlock","edit","and","bargainbas","styl","background","set","there","be","no","charact","that","come","across","a","likabl","or","interest","in","particular","the","lead","doe","not","have","anyth","appeal","about","him","and","the","actor","assembl","bare","do","anyth","to","rise","abov","the","fgrade","materi","if","that","not","enough","then","how","about","the","lack","of","a","compel","plot","which","thi","movi","have","noth","of","the","sort","to","make","deathstalk","qualifi","a","a","major","turkei","i","be","conjur","offend","that","the","woman","in","thi","movi","bare","serv","ani","purpos","other","than","to","be","topless","andor","scantili","cloth","get","rape","have","sex","with","the","hero","all","of","the","abov","in","addit","the","background","music","be","hideou","a","bizarr","mess","of","electron","nois","cheesi","choral","burst","and","blare","orchestr","cacophoni","ear","numb","and","ey","numb","all","in","on","pack","with","nari","a","thing","to","keep","on","interest","deathstalk","be","probabl","well","suit","for","folk","look","for","someth","to","laugh","at","and","believ","me","there","plenti","of","that","in","here","otherwis","i","do","not","recommend","thi","thgrade","conan","wannab","to","anyon","in","the","littl"],"filtered":["deathstalk","perfect","bfantasi","movi","fan","thi","bare","minut","travesti","filmmak","featur","everyth","heckler","ask","fornonexist","plot","terribl","act","save","littl","raspysound","old","ladi","laughabl","script","schlock","edit","bargainbas","styl","background","set","charact","come","across","likabl","interest","particular","lead","doe","anyth","appeal","actor","assembl","bare","anyth","rise","abov","fgrade","materi","enough","lack","compel","plot","thi","movi","noth","sort","make","deathstalk","qualifi","major","turkei","conjur","offend","woman","thi","movi","bare","serv","ani","purpos","topless","andor","scantili","cloth","get","rape","sex","hero","abov","addit","background","music","hideou","bizarr","mess","electron","nois","cheesi","choral","burst","blare","orchestr","cacophoni","ear","numb","ey","numb","pack","nari","thing","keep","interest","deathstalk","probabl","well","suit","folk","look","someth","laugh","believ","plenti","otherwis","recommend","thi","thgrade","conan","wannab","anyon","littl"],"filtered2":["deathstalk","perfect","bfantasi","fan","bare","minut","travesti","filmmak","featur","everyth","heckler","ask","fornonexist","plot","terribl","act","save","littl","raspysound","old","ladi","laughabl","script","schlock","edit","bargainbas","styl","background","set","charact","come","across","likabl","interest","particular","lead","doe","anyth","appeal","actor","assembl","bare","anyth","rise","abov","fgrade","materi","enough","lack","compel","plot","noth","sort","make","deathstalk","qualifi","major","turkei","conjur","offend","woman","bare","serv","ani","purpos","topless","andor","scantili","cloth","get","rape","sex","hero","abov","addit","background","music","hideou","bizarr","mess","electron","nois","cheesi","choral","burst","blare","orchestr","cacophoni","ear","numb","ey","numb","pack","nari","thing","keep","interest","deathstalk","probabl","well","suit","folk","look","someth","laugh","believ","plenti","otherwis","recommend","thgrade","conan","wannab","anyon","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,10,14,16,18,20,21,27,29,32,34,39,41,49,53,59,60,67,70,77,91,93,104,109,118,133,134,140,148,157,158,166,183,189,193,254,269,281,298,305,306,323,348,375,380,404,407,472,503,516,537,543,552,594,627,677,690,704,746,794,801,815,823,832,879,884,888,922,1008,1185,1253,1439,1501,1507,1520,1630,1788,1920,2114,2300,2330,2465,2826,2828,3496,4006,4197,5080,5411,6374,7488,7550],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,10,14,16,18,20,21,27,29,32,34,39,41,49,53,59,60,67,70,77,91,93,104,109,118,133,134,140,148,157,158,166,183,189,193,254,269,281,298,305,306,323,348,375,380,404,407,472,503,516,537,543,552,594,627,677,690,704,746,794,801,815,823,832,879,884,888,922,1008,1185,1253,1439,1501,1507,1520,1630,1788,1920,2114,2300,2330,2465,2826,2828,3496,4006,4197,5080,5411,6374,7488,7550],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,2.2350163994518417,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.31

{"value":"It just seems bizarre that someone read this script, and thought, \"This is funny! I mean, it's so hilarious it just has to be made!\" Who was this person? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Are they the one's who owe me for my time, more so than the director/writer?<br /><br />This film stinks in most every way possible. There's no one shred of good dialogue, and not one likable character. And the story...<br /><br />I prefer the 2nd worst movie ever, Hulk Hogan's \"No Hold's Barred\" to this by quite a considerable degree. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison.<br /><br />The ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes, and it's still under 80 minutes. The outtakes include cast members laughing at the 'hilarious' mistakes they've made, and things that went wrong on the set of this 'comedy.' Glad to see someone laughing in someway, with some connection to this 'film.'<br /><br />Nothing in this film is funny. Nothing. It just goes on, and on. It's truly that lame. I love films that are so bad they're good.

{"value":"The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a top notch comedian, in other situations away from the Stooges. He had a definite track record for being very funny and clever. Moe and Larry and Shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work. So what on Earth was going on when he joined the troop as the \"third stooge\"? Obviously, nothing. In most of these \"late Stooge\" era shorts, more often than not, the boys are pitted against each other or Joe against the other two and this is not accurate Stooge etiquette. \"One for all, all for one, every man for himself\", to quote Curly from \"Restless Knights\". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all try to take advantage of each other or slap each other around, when the chips are actually down, they stick together and come to each other's aid. In this particular one, none of that happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight as one tries to cheat the others or be mean and nasty, and not for comedic effect either. One might assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here, art imitates life. Maybe there really was hence why Besser did not stay very long with Moe and Larry.

{"value":"Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.","finished_norm":["not","a","bad","a","some","be","make","it","out","to","be","though","obvious","pathet","compar","to","the","origin","in","my","opinion","amitabh","be","great","a","the","villain","babban","singh","try","not","to","compar","to","gabbar","in","the","origin","a","thei","be","clearli","not","go","for","the","same","effect","other","than","some","mediocr","action","scene","howev","the","rest","of","the","film","be","flaw","charact","develop","be","poor","and","the","develop","of","the","stori","be","hopeless","with","mani","loophol","and","miss","piec","of","inform","which","i","would","not","have","know","if","i","have","not","read","the","back","of","the","dvd","case","the","wrong","part","of","the","movi","be","the","support","role","from","nisha","kothari","and","especi","thi","new","dude","call","prashant","raj","nisha","be","just","plain","annoi","from","the","time","her","lip","open","a","for","prashant","raj","serious","who","be","thi","gui","where","be","he","from","and","why","on","earth","be","he","present","in","the","film","studio","for","anyth","other","than","to","serv","drink","hi","act","abil","be","zero","and","he","have","the","same","tone","dialog","deliveri","and","staunch","express","in","everi","scene","whether","it","be","action","comedi","or","even","a","scene","when","someon","have","just","die","ajai","devgan","be","averag","at","littl","hi","express","chang","which","be","much","than","i","can","sai","for","hi","mistak","of","a","companion","overal","rgv","aag","be","worth","watch","for","amitabh","solid","perform","and","conjur","a","veri","sexi","urmilla","matondkar","in","a","special","appear"],"filtered":["bad","make","though","obvious","pathet","compar","origin","opinion","amitabh","great","villain","babban","singh","try","compar","gabbar","origin","thei","clearli","go","effect","mediocr","action","scene","howev","rest","film","flaw","charact","develop","poor","develop","stori","hopeless","mani","loophol","miss","piec","inform","know","read","back","dvd","case","wrong","part","movi","support","role","nisha","kothari","especi","thi","new","dude","call","prashant","raj","nisha","plain","annoi","time","lip","open","prashant","raj","serious","thi","gui","earth","present","film","studio","anyth","serv","drink","hi","act","abil","zero","tone","dialog","deliveri","staunch","express","everi","scene","whether","action","comedi","even","scene","someon","die","ajai","devgan","averag","littl","hi","express","chang","much","sai","hi","mistak","companion","overal","rgv","aag","worth","watch","amitabh","solid","perform","conjur","veri","sexi","urmilla","matondkar","special","appear"],"filtered2":["bad","make","though","obvious","pathet","compar","origin","opinion","amitabh","great","villain","babban","singh","try","compar","gabbar","origin","clearli","go","effect","mediocr","action","scene","howev","rest","flaw","charact","develop","poor","develop","stori","hopeless","mani","loophol","miss","piec","inform","know","read","back","dvd","case","wrong","part","support","role","nisha","kothari","especi","new","dude","call","prashant","raj","nisha","plain","annoi","time","lip","open","prashant","raj","serious","gui","earth","present","studio","anyth","serv","drink","act","abil","zero","tone","dialog","deliveri","staunch","express","everi","scene","whether","action","comedi","even","scene","someon","die","ajai","devgan","averag","littl","express","chang","mistak","companion","overal","rgv","aag","worth","watch","amitabh","solid","perform","conjur","veri","sexi","urmilla","matondkar","special","appear"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,17,19,21,25,26,36,39,50,51,55,61,63,69,85,86,87,104,105,106,113,127,128,129,139,142,145,146,170,203,218,219,226,242,247,255,267,271,278,288,293,320,341,371,411,412,432,459,482,494,520,522,538,586,592,597,602,643,667,787,815,846,847,923,932,964,967,1043,1087,1427,1519,2113,2423,3087,3289,3290,3516,4489,4848,5695,6277,6824,7271],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,17,19,21,25,26,36,39,50,51,55,61,63,69,85,86,87,104,105,106,113,127,128,129,139,142,145,146,170,203,218,219,226,242,247,255,267,271,278,288,293,320,341,371,411,412,432,459,482,494,520,522,538,586,592,597,602,643,667,787,815,846,847,923,932,964,967,1043,1087,1427,1519,2113,2423,3087,3289,3290,3516,4489,4848,5695,6277,6824,7271],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,3.9371420340352055,1.162015545

{"value":"It is unbelievable that a script as cliché and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one. The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman seem like a high culture classic. Billy Zane plays the bad ass harmonica playing, Elvis impersonating, gunslinging, martial arts master who gambles on the life of a down-an-out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of NBC's craptastic show \"Next Action Star.\" His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. The \"film\" takes place in Vegas, and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an omnipresent, wealthy gambler who has offered his target $2.4 million if he can make it through the day. And so the hunt ensues. A hunt reeking with unimpressive explosions, construction yard settings, shoddy cinematography, and one-liners containing the word \"bet\" or \"gamble.\" The female winner is also tossed in the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh but don't worry \"NAS\" fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well. The surprise ending will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reevaluate his decision to sell out even more.

{"value":"Oh my god. oh my god, i cant get over this movie. It was god-awful. horrible, terrible! Don't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bin. No, avoid it at all costs I'm warning you!!!<br /><br />It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life!!<br /><br />First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Get real that sounds like some kind of new Barbie doll.. Super Women? Are you kidding me. It was so fake fake fake fake. The people of the town didn't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just zooming her way around the town saving a fire.. Ohh big!<br /><br />Jesus, was it just me or did this movie seem offensive?? I guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double D's, blonde flowing hair, no glasses and a leather skin tight suit?!<br /><br />If it was trying to be romantic ... than.. god, i don't know. It was horrid, if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed AND in the air.. than they totally had love!<br /><br />It was pathetic, everything went too fast.

{"value":"for the most part, On Demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies, and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen, and already have an opinion on. It was either this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I haven't seen, and I was actually in a movie watching mood, which doesn't happen often anymore because I've already watched all the movies i own a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I don't have much interest in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret it. I'm not going to put in any spoilers, I'm just going to tell you that only a FEW of the very FEW actors in this movie ,are half way decent. I think the main girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying looking, but convincing; I'd take her for psycho bitch anyday, so she fits her roll well, though it is lame. The blood isn't that great, only a few of the kills, or may I say \"woundings\" are alright, but you don't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing. Towards the end of the movie I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a band member, the 'recording' parts weren't very interesting either, though what happened would truly happen when going about recording.

{"value":"\"The Secretary\" is one of those cheesy, cliched, \"thrillers\" that one is subjected to watching on a Sunday afternoon, when there is virtually nothing else on. While the plot (a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them) may be one of a kind, I recognized countless plot twists, probably taken from other TV movies that I had been subjected to for the very same reason.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I was not wild about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many TV movies as either a \"mom\" or some sort of \"victim\" of foul play or abuse, that one must wonder the kind of life she leads. In this one, she gets the joy of playing a mom AND a victim of psycho secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves(Singles, Breaking In, and I guess, Law and Order), she is also beset by a string of pitiful TV movie roles, and this one just adds to it. As for the others, I don't have any clear memories of them, so that must say something.<br /><br />This one WILL play on the Lifetime network(I think that's where I saw it), but don't bother watching it, unless you are too bored for words.

{"value":"I didn't like this film at all! First of all,I don't know why, but everyone here says, that Clémence Poésy's play is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! She is not like Natasha: another appearance, another character... What's worse, she is a very unexperienced actress and that's why she wasn't able to play this role! She disfigured the heroine completely! That was really disgusting to watch her play! To my mind, that would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because that would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk man, who hasn't shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye...( Thank's God, in this film there're some actors, whose play was awesome! I suppose, that Alessio Boni coped with his task very well! I was pleasantly amazed! He is one of the few people who's read the book, which is very important for the play. In addition, I liked plays of our Russian actors, that was really wonderful to watch them)) The only thing I liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses! My advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense, the aim, with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and maybe realize the whole idea of the book... 1 from

{"value":"After viewing this film, I felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in \"Kill Me Later\". The story, while not exactly original, certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though...at all.<br /><br />I don't know what her deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down, sped footage up, reversed footage, used awkward camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a zillion quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious \"modern\" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats.<br /><br />There are a couple of good scenes in \"Kill Me Later\" which show what could have and should have been. Unfortunately, just when things would start to show promise, Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart.

{"value":"I had high hopes for this film, because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely terrific, the most assuredly cinematic low budget film I'd ever seen.<br /><br />But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is utterly pointless and flat. Scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix, without much thought for narrative or character.<br /><br />Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? Hard to tell. Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life? Why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The filmmaker doesn't seem to know.<br /><br />It feels as if everything is improvised (though I understand this wasn't the case) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary.<br /><br />After the screening I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric.

{"value":"This move reminded my of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve. I think that's always the them in a Crypt story. The same goes for the bad acting. Very bad acting. I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and I wasn't expecting much. Whenever I watch a stephen King movie I don't expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels. I have read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies. The endings were very different then the movie versions. I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy. I ending of Thinner is the worst. So Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real ending. I suggest everyone who intends to read stephen King's novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare. And that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. I intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies.

{"value":"Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example), and a real unfunny time. (Charles Dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and I heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! I'll never understand why or how ?! In one TV interview I've heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! <br /><br />One of the comments said (Hey...It's the 1980s !). Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! <br /><br />There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!!

{"value":"This movie made me very angry. I wanted desperately to throttle the \"scientists\" and unseen film-makers during the course of it. Very, very painful to sit through. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. The little good information on brain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh*t. The worst offenders were the crack-pot charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, is living on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes that I basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preachy manner that I felt the desire to disavow them. I think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they've taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum. Much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Fittingly, the dramatized portions with Marlee Matlin are amateurish and cliché ridden.<br /><br />I would refer people instead to Bill Bryson's excellent survey of science: \"A Brief History of

{"value":"After watching this movie I was honestly disappointed - not because of the actors, story or directing - I was disappointed by this film advertisements.<br /><br />The trailers were suggesting that the battalion \"have chosen the third way out\" other than surrender or die (Polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or German guns, they even translated the title wrong as \"misplaced battalion\"). This have tickled the right spot and I bought the movie.<br /><br />The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies... Then I began to think \"hey, this story can't be that simple... I bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops\". Well, he didn't, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And so was I.<br /><br />The story was based on real events of World War I, so the writers couldn't make much use of their imagination, but even thought I found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring. And as I wrote in the first place - it isn't fault of actors, writers or director - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with.","finished_norm":["after","watch","thi","movi","i","be","honestli","disappoint","not","becaus","of","the","actor","stori","or","direct","i","be","disappoint","by","thi","film","advertisementsbr","br","the","trailer","be","suggest","that","the","battalion","have","choos","the","wai","out","other","than","surrend","or","die","polish","info","be","even","misguid","that","thei","have","the","choic","between","be","kill","by","own","artilleri","or","german","gun","thei","even","translat","the","titl","wrong","a","misplac","battalion","thi","have","tickl","the","right","spot","and","i","bui","the","moviebr","br","the","disappoint","start","when","i","realiz","that","the","wai","be","to","just","sit","down","and","count","dead","bodi","follow","by","sit","down","and","count","dead","bodi","then","i","begin","to","think","hei","thi","stori","ca","not","be","that","simpl","i","bet","thi","clever","offic","will","find","some","cun","wai","to","save","what","leav","of","hi","troop","good","he","do","not","thei","be","just","sit","and","wait","for","someth","to","happen","and","so","be","ibr","br","the","stori","be","base","on","real","event","of","world","war","i","so","the","writer","can","not","make","much","us","of","their","imagin","but","even","think","i","find","thi","movi","realli","unchalleng","and","even","a","littl","bite","bore","and","a","i","write","in","the","place","it","be","not","fault","of","actor","writer","or","director","their","market","peopl","have","rais","my","expect","high","abov","the","level","that","thi","movi","can","cope","with"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","honestli","disappoint","becaus","actor","stori","direct","disappoint","thi","film","advertisementsbr","br","trailer","suggest","battalion","choos","wai","surrend","die","polish","info","even","misguid","thei","choic","kill","artilleri","german","gun","thei","even","translat","titl","wrong","misplac","battalion","thi","tickl","right","spot","bui","moviebr","br","disappoint","start","realiz","wai","sit","count","dead","bodi","follow","sit","count","dead","bodi","begin","think","hei","thi","stori","ca","simpl","bet","thi","clever","offic","find","cun","wai","save","leav","hi","troop","good","thei","sit","wait","someth","happen","ibr","br","stori","base","real","event","world","war","writer","make","much","us","imagin","even","think","find","thi","movi","realli","unchalleng","even","littl","bite","bore","write","place","fault","actor","writer","director","market","peopl","rais","expect","high","abov","level","thi","movi","cope"],"filtered2":["watch","honestli","disappoint","becaus","actor","stori","direct","disappoint","advertisementsbr","trailer","suggest","battalion","choos","wai","surrend","die","polish","info","even","misguid","choic","kill","artilleri","german","gun","even","translat","titl","wrong","misplac","battalion","tickl","right","spot","bui","moviebr","disappoint","start","realiz","wai","sit","count","dead","bodi","follow","sit","count","dead","bodi","begin","think","hei","stori","ca","simpl","bet","clever","offic","find","cun","wai","save","leav","troop","good","sit","wait","someth","happen","ibr","stori","base","real","event","world","war","writer","make","us","imagin","even","think","find","realli","unchalleng","even","littl","bite","bore","write","place","fault","actor","writer","director","market","peopl","rais","expect","high","abov","level","cope"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,12,13,14,17,22,23,25,33,38,41,53,56,58,65,71,74,76,80,81,94,102,108,121,130,147,154,164,165,187,189,211,228,244,260,264,287,293,314,331,334,340,347,376,405,445,465,470,501,584,587,646,704,736,757,809,885,924,950,955,974,1005,1044,1243,1298,1432,1451,3107,3126,3175,4269,4867,5270,5453,7970,8315],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,12,13,14,17,22,23,25,33,38,41,53,56,58,65,71,74,76,80,81,94,102,108,121,130,147,154,164,165,187,189,211,228,244,260,264,287,293,314,331,334,340,347,376,405,445,465,470,501,584,587,646,704,736,757,809,885,924,950,955,974,1005,1044,1243,1298,1432,1451,3107,3126,3175,4269,4867,5270,5453,7970,8315],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,3.704068422904524,0.9609497720722932,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,3.83116108203179,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,4.205560634305565,3.038623282696244,3.1375198335242067,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,1.9486336368009016,2.1337665533324026,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.08112281984698,2.087553710177271,2.138507503627933,2.2190595059394194,2.2642139034199635,2.2844323215331563,2.348499626138

{"value":"Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined. We have the submissive, heroin-addicted, part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now, she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor, the release so gained somehow akin to Helen Keller placing her hands in running water. We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up. We have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom. You see, it's all circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors. It's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be. If that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious, no wonder most people think artists are insane. We saw this lousy movie, then put on \"Zero Woman, The Accused.\" Oh my God, it was a tossup as to which one was worse. What is going on in Japan these days?

{"value":"I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November! It looked awesome and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together. It has a multi cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's directorial Debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' , 'Salaam-e-Ishq' falls quite behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors of this film is the songs! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years. I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude watching this with family! Although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents!

{"value":"I saw this recent Woody Allen film because I'm a fan of his work and I make it a point to try to see everything he does, though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confused movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about female mid-life crisis. It fails at all three.<br /><br />Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children. This rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old Chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs, and the ghost of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, how about something more prosaic, like an affair with a saxophone player?<br /><br />I was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say. There are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film, and the endingis a really preposterous touch of Pollyanna.<br /><br />Rent 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead, a superbly well-done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals.

{"value":"Relying on the positive reviews above, we saw a free screening of this last night. Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews, because there is no way an objective individual could have written these. \"Destined to become a 'cult classic'\"?? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and families of the production crew, because only a few of us walked out by the first hour.<br /><br />The songs were the most literal I've ever heard in a musical  \"don't take the short cut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods..\". Debi Mazar's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines.<br /><br />Now, whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, ex N'Syncer, living up to his last name as he's not aged well. He's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school-quality makeup and out-of-tune singing. Seriously, this guy was in vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but can't do much about the unimaginative script.

{"value":"EXTREMITIES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A woman turns the tables on a would-be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home, and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and attack her again.<br /><br />Exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough 'n' ready rape fantasy in the style of DAY OF THE WOMAN (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed by EXTREMITIES. True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo), but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production. Would their final solution hold up in a court of law? Maybe...<br /><br />Based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance, the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine, though Fawcett's overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation.","finished_norm":["extrem","br","br","aspect","ratio","br","br","sound","format","monobr","br","a","woman","turn","the","tabl","on","a","wouldb","rapist","when","he","mount","a","assault","in","her","home","and","be","forc","to","decid","whether","to","kill","him","or","inform","the","polic","in","which","case","he","can","be","releas","and","attack","her","againbr","br","exploit","fan","who","mai","be","expect","anoth","rough","n","readi","rape","fantasi","in","the","styl","of","dai","of","the","woman","will","almost","certainli","be","disappoint","by","extrem","true","farrah","fawcett","charact","be","subject","to","two","uncomfort","prolong","assault","befor","gain","the","upper","hand","on","her","attack","a","suitabl","slimi","jame","russo","but","scriptwrit","william","mastrosimon","and","director","robert","be","young","take","thi","unpleas","scene","onli","so","far","befor","unveil","the","dilemma","which","inform","the","moral","core","of","thi","product","would","their","final","solut","hold","up","in","a","court","of","law","maybebr","br","base","on","a","stage","plai","which","reportedli","leav","it","actor","batter","and","bruis","after","everi","perform","the","film","make","no","attempt","to","open","up","the","narr","and","reli","instead","on","a","confin","set","for","the","main","action","ac","and","technic","credit","be","fine","though","fawcett","overli","subdu","perform","wo","not","plai","effect","to","viewer","who","mai","be","reli","on","her","to","provid","a","outlet","for","their","outrag","indign"],"filtered":["extrem","br","br","aspect","ratio","br","br","sound","format","monobr","br","woman","turn","tabl","wouldb","rapist","mount","assault","home","forc","decid","whether","kill","inform","polic","case","releas","attack","againbr","br","exploit","fan","mai","expect","anoth","rough","n","readi","rape","fantasi","styl","dai","woman","almost","certainli","disappoint","extrem","true","farrah","fawcett","charact","subject","two","uncomfort","prolong","assault","befor","gain","upper","hand","attack","suitabl","slimi","jame","russo","scriptwrit","william","mastrosimon","director","robert","young","take","thi","unpleas","scene","onli","far","befor","unveil","dilemma","inform","moral","core","thi","product","final","solut","hold","court","law","maybebr","br","base","stage","plai","reportedli","leav","actor","batter","bruis","everi","perform","film","make","attempt","open","narr","reli","instead","confin","set","main","action","ac","technic","credit","fine","though","fawcett","overli","subdu","perform","wo","plai","effect","viewer","mai","reli","provid","outlet","outrag","indign"],"filtered2":["extrem","aspect","ratio","sound","format","monobr","woman","turn","tabl","wouldb","rapist","mount","assault","home","forc","decid","whether","kill","inform","polic","case","releas","attack","againbr","exploit","fan","mai","expect","anoth","rough","n","readi","rape","fantasi","styl","dai","woman","almost","certainli","disappoint","extrem","true","farrah","fawcett","charact","subject","two","uncomfort","prolong","assault","befor","gain","upper","hand","attack","suitabl","slimi","jame","russo","scriptwrit","william","mastrosimon","director","robert","young","take","unpleas","scene","onli","far","befor","unveil","dilemma","inform","moral","core","product","final","solut","hold","court","law","maybebr","base","stage","plai","reportedli","leav","actor","batter","bruis","everi","perform","make","attempt","open","narr","reli","instead","confin","set","main","action","ac","technic","credit","fine","though","fawcett","overli","subdu","perform","wo","plai","effect","viewer","mai","reli","provid","outlet","outrag","indign"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,11,19,31,40,41,46,47,58,70,73,74,76,79,85,86,96,101,105,106,109,129,130,131,132,135,140,152,156,177,178,179,187,190,235,242,249,279,288,302,304,327,329,334,338,356,380,389,406,414,464,471,495,539,550,597,620,645,669,695,720,746,878,918,944,996,1029,1043,1198,1334,1426,1716,1739,1755,2005,2059,2108,2208,2281,2338,2413,2439,2512,2644,2767,2814,2849,3553,3574,3667,3843,4084,4101,4364,4899,4997,5817,6226,6656,6975,7251,7284,7495,8304,8380,8534],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,11,19,31,40,41,46,47,58,70,73,74,76,79,85,86,96,101,105,106,109,129,130,131,132,135,140,152,156,177,178,179,187,190,235,242,249,279,288,302,304,327,329,334,338,356,380,389,406,414,464,471,495,539,550,597,620,645,669,695,720,746,878,918,944,996,1029,1043,1198,1334,1426,1716,1739,1755,2005,2059,2108,2208,2281,2338

{"value":"Generally I don't do minus's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion(Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit). Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing.<br /><br />Now to the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they've could have done better. The start looked OK but that's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring. I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths. I'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this. Sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this.. this.. thing of disaster. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.<br /><br />Well sorry i couldn't explain the plot(if there was one) but that was the best i could.

{"value":"I am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film.<br /><br />Often with foreign films I skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming \"absence of action\" as many of the best international films do not live up to the Western Hollywood model of cinematic storytelling.<br /><br />I enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of cliché in the foreign film arena. I enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow.<br /><br />That said, this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time I wasted watching it. No meaningful character development, no engaging story arc, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen. <br /><br />Synopsis: A bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves, and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the \"house-boy\" finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her. <br /><br />While the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario. I was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it, and I wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings. <br /><br />Unless you have an academic interest in the period I

{"value":"How this film gains a 6.7 rating is beyond belief. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly should rank among IMDb's worst 100 films of all time. National Treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on American audiences by Hollywood. Critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through.<br /><br />I love the justifications for this movie being good... \"Nicholas Cage is cute.\" Come on people, no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid. This has to be the most stupid, insulting movie I have ever seen. If you wanted to see an actually decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. National Treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films. I bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some haven't been widely released yet.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies. Time after time I've seen Cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is put to good use like in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation he is an incredible actor.<br /><br />Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual

{"value":"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say \"partly\" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film \"Howl's Moving Castle\". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.<br /><br />The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. From then on things go down hill. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films.<br /><br />Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. What is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version I saw was an Nth-generation copy, with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.","finished_norm":["i","be","partli","a","fan","of","miyazaki","work","i","sai","partli","becaus","much","of","hi","film","fall","into","two","categori","brilliant","and","bore","sadli","thi","film","fall","into","the","late","categorybr","br","thi","film","suffer","from","the","same","fundament","problem","a","miyazaki","recent","film","howl","move","castl","a","intrigu","premis","be","set","up","but","then","immedi","reduc","to","littl","much","than","a","backdrop","for","some","unfathom","event","that","onli","serv","to","confus","the","plot","rather","than","explain","itbr","br","the","of","the","film","reveal","the","postapocalypt","world","the","stori","be","set","in","and","actual","look","like","a","veri","interest","stori","be","about","to","unfold","from","then","on","thing","go","down","hill","the","middl","part","of","the","film","be","mostli","make","up","of","thinlyveil","ecopropaganda","and","the","end","be","heavili","mar","by","the","relianc","on","the","kind","of","impenetr","spiritu","which","ruin","a","larg","numb","of","japanes","anim","filmsbr","br","overal","the","film","feel","a","though","someon","rip","out","everi","other","page","from","the","script","befor","pass","it","on","the","the","anim","what","be","leav","be","someth","which","be","visual","stun","although","sadli","the","version","i","see","be","a","nthgener","copi","with","poor","colour","which","give","rise","to","the","common","myth","that","nausicaa","show","her","bare","bottom","when","fly","but","which","make","littl","sens","and","ultim","leav","me","confus"],"filtered":["partli","fan","miyazaki","work","sai","partli","becaus","much","hi","film","fall","two","categori","brilliant","bore","sadli","thi","film","fall","late","categorybr","br","thi","film","suffer","fundament","problem","miyazaki","recent","film","howl","move","castl","intrigu","premis","set","immedi","reduc","littl","much","backdrop","unfathom","event","onli","serv","confus","plot","rather","explain","itbr","br","film","reveal","postapocalypt","world","stori","set","actual","look","like","veri","interest","stori","unfold","thing","go","hill","middl","part","film","mostli","make","thinlyveil","ecopropaganda","end","heavili","mar","relianc","kind","impenetr","spiritu","ruin","larg","numb","japanes","anim","filmsbr","br","overal","film","feel","though","someon","rip","everi","page","script","befor","pass","anim","leav","someth","visual","stun","although","sadli","version","see","nthgener","copi","poor","colour","give","rise","common","myth","nausicaa","show","bare","bottom","fly","make","littl","sens","ultim","leav","confus"],"filtered2":["partli","fan","miyazaki","work","partli","becaus","fall","two","categori","brilliant","bore","sadli","fall","late","categorybr","suffer","fundament","problem","miyazaki","recent","howl","move","castl","intrigu","premis","set","immedi","reduc","littl","backdrop","unfathom","event","onli","serv","confus","plot","rather","explain","itbr","reveal","postapocalypt","world","stori","set","actual","look","like","veri","interest","stori","unfold","thing","go","hill","middl","part","mostli","make","thinlyveil","ecopropaganda","end","heavili","mar","relianc","kind","impenetr","spiritu","ruin","larg","numb","japanes","anim","filmsbr","overal","feel","though","someon","rip","everi","page","script","befor","pass","anim","leav","someth","visual","stun","although","sadli","version","see","nthgener","copi","poor","colour","give","rise","common","myth","nausicaa","show","bare","bottom","fly","make","littl","sens","ultim","leav","confus"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,11,14,15,16,17,22,24,28,29,30,32,43,47,48,52,53,60,61,74,77,79,85,86,108,109,122,139,140,146,150,160,165,167,169,173,220,237,275,277,395,412,427,430,470,484,487,510,516,554,562,564,594,633,635,652,706,710,735,747,815,825,833,843,860,912,922,939,988,1017,1018,1338,1473,1556,1958,2013,2098,2334,2405,2444,2709,3001,3052,3069,3369,3591,3652,6925,7632,8497],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,11,14,15,16,17,22,24,28,29,30,32,43,47,48,52,53,60,61,74,77,79,85,86,108,109,122,139,140,146,150,160,165,167,169,173,220,237,275,277,395,412,427,430,470,484,487,510,516,554,562,564,594,633,635,652,706,710,735,747,815,825,833,843,860,912,922,939,988,1017,1018,1338,1473,1556,1958,2013,2098,2334,2405,2444,2709,3001,3052,3069,3369,3591,3652,6925,7632,8497],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.2979240167361772,1.32103615661192

{"value":"This film essentially deals with Inspector Gadget's arch-nemesis Doctor Claw who has returned after many years to the now-peaceful city of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to foil Gadget once and for all by using a newer \"cooler\" crimefighter to help destroy Gadget's popularity. Sadly the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget it just doesn't cut it anymore; Dr. Claw is not only visually less frightening, but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold, than his original intimidating self. Granted this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (heaven forbid I mention the animation) that it pales in comparison to the original series. Someone has decided to updated Penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed, she now has some quasi-punk rebellious clothing style and doesn't play half the role that she did in the TV series. The Gadgetmobile talks, as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire ON talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show who's grown up jaded, but I thought that the live-action version was more pain than I could bear, but now they go and spring this complete watering-down of the quality TV series on us.

{"value":"This film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony, it certainly can't promote winning bridge, so the satire didn't work for me. But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering between the contestants, and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. At one point he even enumerates \"One... Two... Three... Four...\" as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches. That spoof worked very well indeed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh weren't given good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film, but she practically disappears thereafter.
