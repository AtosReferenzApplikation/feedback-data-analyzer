{"value":"I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. He basically exploits the mentally challenged. Not only is Shirly Temple the anti-Christ (which I admit is a little funny) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are, mentally challenged. PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing. It's not 'counter-culture' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's exploitation.","finished_norm":["i","see","hi","film","at","the","ann","arbor","film","festiv","i","be","a","film","student","at","the","univeristi","of","michigan","so","i","know","a","thing","or","two","about","film","and","crispin","glover","film","be","outrag","he","basic","exploit","the","mental","challeng","not","onli","be","shirli","templ","the","antichrist","which","i","admit","be","a","littl","funni","tell","the","mental","challeng","to","kill","each","other","but","there","be","a","obsess","with","kill","snail","crispin","conjur","plai","with","the","idea","of","be","in","love","with","on","of","hi","actor","who","be","a","thei","all","be","mental","challeng","peta","and","human","right","should","be","all","over","thi","thing","it","not","countercultur","a","crispin","state","at","the","ann","arbor","film","festiv","it","exploit"],"filtered":["see","hi","film","ann","arbor","film","festiv","film","student","univeristi","michigan","know","thing","two","film","crispin","glover","film","outrag","basic","exploit","mental","challeng","onli","shirli","templ","antichrist","admit","littl","funni","tell","mental","challeng","kill","obsess","kill","snail","crispin","conjur","plai","idea","love","hi","actor","thei","mental","challeng","peta","human","right","thi","thing","countercultur","crispin","state","ann","arbor","film","festiv","exploit"],"filtered2":["see","ann","arbor","festiv","student","univeristi","michigan","know","thing","two","crispin","glover","outrag","basic","exploit","mental","challeng","onli","shirli","templ","antichrist","admit","littl","funni","tell","mental","challeng","kill","obsess","kill","snail","crispin","conjur","plai","idea","love","actor","mental","challeng","peta","human","right","thing","countercultur","crispin","state","ann","arbor","festiv","exploit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,11,14,26,29,39,40,41,47,54,62,76,90,121,123,286,292,498,626,691,911,918,1122,1217,1286,1463,1738,3398,3890,4249,4759],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,11,14,26,29,39,40,41,47,54,62,76,90,121,123,286,292,498,626,691,911,918,1122,1217,1286,1463,1738,3398,3890,4249,4759],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.3324924169710188,2.6390769554676132,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,2.0226120445069267,4.267533106664805,2.0477128419653545,2.2190595059394194,2.2619070973220485,2.780700890737216,2.9752256367457734,3.386191741044285,3.6528204042982337,3.5929222627171646,11.909196345194859,8.079872747476402,4.263079925052412,8.955473724978605,9.466167108596293,13.652285992512578,4.751432692966343,5.822646007446338,6.342521466732247,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.449261937040371E-5,9.3855433547418E-5,9.458507004748073E-5,9.403855650509789E-5,9.404009722097063E-5,9.390864795785791E-5,9.418794543470383E-5,9.386894811657907E-5,9.407999973123533E-5,1.0437662407697386E-4,0.5785345509327946,9.371742293850186E-5,9.546661216345319E-5,9.682846436341906E-5,9.378576070565786E-5,9.352657732781304E-5,9.585948080710641E-5,9.419677013423063E-5,9.390452502183784E-5,9.39823551771407E-5,9.489168958523911E-5,9.429009529717504E-5,9.439745887508443E-5,9.449916154948702E-5,9.522439406572845E-5,9.472639729248324E-5,0.09464114093469857,9.374528426904982E-5,9.374779217494399E-5,9.398530167627397E-5,9.598293726120592E-5,9.419131223577235E-5,1.0110639457693608E-4,9.445625849760073E-5,9.384732179514054E-5,9.428048905001659E-5,9.375328443347438E-5,9.380868572670598E-5,9.35261074427266E-5,9.355037242989915E-5,9.37609429487812E-5,9.474992222319023E-5,9.426845805145962E-5,9.389574692003724E-5,9.503667870081902E-5,9.393178462079608E-5,9.705267137669932E-5,9.562548355487405E-5,9.357362481165458E-5,9.378042824490823E-5,9.374790165919926E-5,9.638632001420754E-5,9.378182351889609E-5,9.3542067294556E-5,9.456882535212552E-5,9.380597922706089E-5,1.0087802111492179E-4,9.372867091126653E-5,9.357254268636512E-5,9.401932411415176E-5,0.24121605162957374,9.401310420107084E-5,9.355523155677509E-5,9.377306058478766E-5,9.352723865755176E-5,9.569126510699109E-5,9.433293191497423E-5,9.413198895843867E-5,9.404966627975437E-5,9.439249226338714E-5,9.352382663555611E-5,9.405163798695081E-5,9.557709311942677E-5,9.369142652775335E-5,9.601024051798546E-5,9.393913714093115E-5,0.07841837565012824,9.409574394187041E-5,9.349450416141242E-5,9.361039702057743E-5]}}
{"value":"In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, Valentine fails. Why did people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that's ever been done. Why did they like Scream? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it's not funny.

{"value":"Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.<br /><br />If one forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie, he is again disappointed. The acting is OK but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning, while one is trying to get what's happening. But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand. \"Scary\" elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason...<br /><br />So... (yawn) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting the carrots or looking at the

{"value":"This is the crappiest film I have ever seen but in all fairness it's watchable and rather funny. I don't think the film-makers intended it to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow (as it's the middle of winter). He then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it's own. This film is really stupid but it's funny. The killings are hilarious.I wouldn't advise you to go and buy it (like I did -the cover looked good!)but if it happens to be on TV one night and you're up for a laugh then stick it

{"value":"Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect \"catch\" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He's a \"hero\" whom it's very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. However, it's troubles don't end there. It has the production values of a TV-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that I can't reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows.

{"value":"This is one of those awful, sex-driven B-movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater. Women run around dressed in scantily clad \"bunny\" outfits, an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man, who has an oddball son (Jim Hanks, who is of course Tom's brother), whom the man wants to get \"laid.\" Hanks is actually sort of good, but this movie goes nowhere and has no point. One must wonder why it was even made? Nevertheless, because of Hank's performance and a few entertaining moments(but no more than a few), it received a stellar \"2\" out of 10. I think I was being nice,

{"value":"This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis's career. As is the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy retread with Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', when this kind of thing was done properly. Shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.","finished_norm":["thi","straighttovideo","duffer","be","anoth","nail","in","the","coffin","of","rick","morani","career","a","be","the","disnei","tradit","qualiti","be","sacrific","in","the","name","of","a","quick","cashin","thi","be","a","lazi","retread","with","morani","accident","shrink","himself","and","a","few","rel","so","thei","can","repeat","all","the","well","scene","from","the","origin","movi","instantli","date","visual","effect","and","crummi","dialogu","abound","in","thi","cheesi","lame","which","do","noth","but","make","me","pine","for","the","dai","of","the","incred","shrink","man","when","thi","kind","of","thing","be","do","properli","shockingli","thi","be","direct","by","top","cinematograph","dean","cundei","who","should","either","stick","to","the","dai","job","or","pick","well","materi","next","time"],"filtered":["thi","straighttovideo","duffer","anoth","nail","coffin","rick","morani","career","disnei","tradit","qualiti","sacrific","name","quick","cashin","thi","lazi","retread","morani","accident","shrink","rel","thei","repeat","well","scene","origin","movi","instantli","date","visual","effect","crummi","dialogu","abound","thi","cheesi","lame","noth","make","pine","dai","incred","shrink","man","thi","kind","thing","properli","shockingli","thi","direct","top","cinematograph","dean","cundei","either","stick","dai","job","pick","well","materi","next","time"],"filtered2":["straighttovideo","duffer","anoth","nail","coffin","rick","morani","career","disnei","tradit","qualiti","sacrific","name","quick","cashin","lazi","retread","morani","accident","shrink","rel","repeat","well","scene","origin","instantli","date","visual","effect","crummi","dialogu","abound","cheesi","lame","noth","make","pine","dai","incred","shrink","man","kind","thing","properli","shockingli","direct","top","cinematograph","dean","cundei","either","stick","dai","job","pick","well","materi","next","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,19,20,29,45,49,69,73,102,106,122,132,143,207,248,289,297,319,364,372,416,446,511,537,543,635,647,841,988,1165,1173,1418,1448,1531,1623,1847,1986,2084,2265,2661,3102,3210,3787,4132,4267,4383,4615,5875,6038,6546,8422],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,19,20,29,45,49,69,73,102,106,122,132,143,207,248,289,297,319,364,372,416,446,511,537,543,635,647,841,988,1165,1173,1418,1448,1531,1623,1847,1986,2084,2265,2661,3102,3210,3787,4132,4267,4383,4615,5875,6038,6546,8422],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9418936859054116,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.3195384777338066,1.8162961064622165,1.6920303308087352,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.2489347673732487,4.506988091575534,2.3409902041158843,2.5531798379045583,2.689504733779216,2.8282659991423613,2.813490713560207,2.9056060024680126,2.9878441007049847,3.070535816550098,3.1401446412440817,3.233054746047873,3.3909310864081816,3.424750734647968,3.477726550625732,3.587125145032839,3.6746621462132825,4.30366520516749,4.039936373738201,4.246178114249808,4.2574141875167335,4.550761997504193,4.484804029712395,4.605250182788262,4.613282354485526,5.156897801074508,4.933754249760298,4.944927550358424,5.051537285416681,5.541743621979936,5.482320201509136,5.482320201509136,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453,12.275454108172468,5.907203395474402,6.137727054086234,6.342521466732247,6.600350576034347,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.989622754750261E-5,5.949233328255487E-5,5.995482944496319E-5,5.960840980171E-5,5.960938641839302E-5,5.952606440841161E-5,5.970310326433569E-5,5.9500899789813014E-5,5.9634679503191126E-5,0.19686705137698896,0.16697669765440185,5.94048522190529E-5,6.051361432702912E-5,6.137685433242549E-5,5.944816961758557E-5,5.928388052623262E-5,6.07626427679097E-5,5.970869699445363E-5,5.9523450994626836E-5,5.9572785352412E-5,0.14133047741997878,5.9767853204037734E-5,5.983590797207805E-5,5.990037445177557E-5,6.0360079052061526E-5,6.004441283128196E-5,6.256856587909041E-5,5.9422512736936684E-5,5.942410242831265E-5,5.957465305577054E-5,6.084089835989372E-5,5.9705237385331076E-5,6.408851459973952E-5,5.9873179407597666E-5,5.948719146975027E-5,5.976176407274353E-5,5.942758381732353E-5,5.946270114699367E-5,5.928358267922355E-5,5.929896357566614E-5,5.943243833589387E-5,6.0059324626637544E-5,5.975413795938151E-5,5.951788680150374E-5,6.0241091534457593E-5,5.9540730091692136E-5,6.151897288490776E-5,6.061431845688324E-5,5.931370260986716E-5,5.944478951991682E-5,5.942417182731872E-5,6.109659140050902E-5,5.944567394505843E-5,5.9293699182746974E-5,5.994453238709857E-5,5.946098557259559E-5,0.19891492202654157,5.9411981994273966E-5,5.9313016680923664E-5,5.959621892720501E-5,6.018736333193995E-5,5.9592276298334074E-5,5.93020436402

{"value":"This movie is unbelievably ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst one I've ever seen. I am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. It just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. The graphics look so obviously fake. The actors are awful as well. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but I had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. If I could rate this a -10, I would.

I am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want.

{"value":"I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie was pain for me. I had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep. It was boring! How can somebody ruin this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were sh.t. They can't live the role. The main actor(Tom ... ) is a null. Watch the other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable,somehow they were not to follow the situation. Like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors.Maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title. French can't do right thing with big films,like Alien 4.

{"value":"This \"screwy comedy\" seems very forced. Indeed, the actors TRY very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script. And, as a result it doesn't really go anywhere. The idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn't all that funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy. It's really a shame, too, as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess. Considering that Cooper made so many GOOD comedies, I recommend you see them instead.","finished_norm":["thi","screwi","comedi","seem","veri","forc","ind","the","actor","try","veri","hard","to","make","a","go","of","a","essenti","unfunni","script","and","a","a","result","it","doe","not","realli","go","anywher","the","idea","of","a","woman","find","out","she","be","pregnant","after","get","a","quicki","divorc","just","be","not","all","that","funni","and","then","when","cooper","sneak","off","with","the","babi","becaus","he","doe","not","want","it","put","up","for","adopt","just","seem","terribli","unfunni","and","it","realli","push","hard","to","turn","thi","into","a","comedi","it","realli","a","shame","too","a","the","actor","be","much","capabl","than","the","script","and","i","find","myself","just","bore","by","the","whole","mess","consid","that","cooper","make","so","mani","good","comedi","i","recommend","you","see","them","instead"],"filtered":["thi","screwi","comedi","seem","veri","forc","ind","actor","try","veri","hard","make","go","essenti","unfunni","script","result","doe","realli","go","anywher","idea","woman","find","pregnant","get","quicki","divorc","funni","cooper","sneak","babi","becaus","doe","want","put","adopt","seem","terribli","unfunni","realli","push","hard","turn","thi","comedi","realli","shame","actor","much","capabl","script","find","bore","whole","mess","consid","cooper","make","mani","good","comedi","recommend","see","instead"],"filtered2":["screwi","comedi","seem","veri","forc","ind","actor","try","veri","hard","make","go","essenti","unfunni","script","result","doe","realli","go","anywher","idea","woman","find","pregnant","get","quicki","divorc","funni","cooper","sneak","babi","becaus","doe","want","put","adopt","seem","terribli","unfunni","realli","push","hard","turn","comedi","realli","shame","actor","capabl","script","find","bore","whole","mess","consid","cooper","make","mani","good","comedi","recommend","see","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,13,15,18,22,35,36,37,38,41,50,62,70,77,96,108,111,123,127,152,159,171,298,317,338,407,447,574,698,829,948,1153,1197,1257,1292,1539,1812,2286,2380,2659,2785,5622],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,13,15,18,22,35,36,37,38,41,50,62,70,77,96,108,111,123,127,152,159,171,298,317,338,407,447,574,698,829,948,1153,1197,1257,1292,1539,1812,2286,2380,2659,2785,5622],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,3.3953824709201923,2.4001215597131385,2.430631986809635,1.2979240167361772,2.926338025798268,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,3.038623282696244,3.1375198335242067,1.717994385570355,2.0226120445069267,2.094675786251684,3.8927804517536475,2.0390708128715254,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,2.2619070973220485,7.30790381132591,2.3131195476980753,2.300267965194495,4.746175108181524,2.7819920465008363,2.8529247828056143,2.9720957437368454,3.120015873813468,3.2070272508030975,3.5039747767006686,3.90413483257914,3.8240921249056035,8.098137714602949,4.213208095012239,4.240607069200353,4.3215761317340196,4.3336974922663645,4.5432147918688095,4.869215728622727,10.781025304512026,5.170884043049248,5.373120909544144,5.426230734858092,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.888642561190899E-5,7.835447600186708E-5,7.896360733793797E-5,7.850735477351189E-5,7.850864102813044E-5,7.839890163699731E-5,7.863207095516842E-5,7.836575853442787E-5,7.854195332732055E-5,8.713800978036333E-5,0.7673478848431673,7.823925892241202E-5,7.969955589157927E-5,8.083648756923653E-5,7.829631017383412E-5,7.807993295419064E-5,8.002753921175071E-5,7.863943818667716E-5,7.839545963604722E-5,7.846043553361013E-5,7.921958626536847E-5,7.871734997040574E-5,7.880698161527503E-5,7.889188729904428E-5,7.949734200360227E-5,7.908159328513797E-5,8.240603323389927E-5,7.826251873671671E-5,7.826461244237415E-5,7.84628953954093E-5,8.01306058686761E-5,7.863488170275709E-5,8.440788421174773E-5,0.0980517327778929,7.834770396880374E-5,7.870933026995798E-5,7.826919761153219E-5,7.831544894868886E-5,7.807954067429445E-5,7.809979810940753E-5,7.827559126324884E-5,7.910123288988813E-5,7.869928628473431E-5,7.838813130628642E-5,7.934062929663312E-5,7.841821709943173E-5,8.102366504397104E-5,7.983218843245587E-5,7.811921017879318E-5,7.829185841060589E-5,7.826470384444996E-5,8.046736681095723E-5,7.829302324420225E-5,7.809286463200146E-5,7.895004558083709E-5,7.831318944858882E-5,0.05065623994469782,7.824864920466577E-5,7.811830677494303E-5,7.849129876207078E-5,7.926986647859408E-5,7.848610611619177E-5,7.810385471354647E-5,7.828570757707086E-5,7.808048506016025E-5,7.988710564770815E-5,7.87531117863655E-5,7.85853561277903E-5,7.851662968215388E-5,7.880283527827208E-5,7.807763656023359E-5,7.851827574651443E-5,7.979179005518921E-5,7.821755602184314E-5,0.07794423918

I will think twice before I rent another movie of yours.","finished_norm":["steven","seagalhow","can","you","be","a","part","of","such","a","aw","film","i","rent","thi","movi","becaus","your","movi","usual","have","be","pretti","clean","i","have","lose","a","lot","of","respect","for","you","be","in","a","aw","movi","such","a","thi","on","veri","veri","poor","tast","i","be","embarrass","that","i","even","rent","thi","movi","steven","if","you","keep","act","in","movi","like","thi","on","i","believ","that","your","career","be","over","my","husband","and","i","have","enjoi","watch","mani","of","your","movi","becaus","you","alwai","can","get","the","bad","gui","with","a","few","hand","maneuv","and","make","it","cleanand","conjur","the","languag","be","pretti","clean","in","your","moviesbut","thi","on","be","someth","els","i","will","think","twice","befor","i","rend","anoth","movi","of","your"],"filtered":["steven","seagalhow","part","aw","film","rent","thi","movi","becaus","movi","usual","pretti","clean","lose","lot","respect","aw","movi","thi","veri","veri","poor","tast","embarrass","even","rent","thi","movi","steven","keep","act","movi","like","thi","believ","career","husband","enjoi","watch","mani","movi","becaus","alwai","get","bad","gui","hand","maneuv","make","cleanand","conjur","languag","pretti","clean","moviesbut","thi","someth","els","think","twice","befor","rend","anoth","movi"],"filtered2":["steven","seagalhow","part","aw","rent","becaus","usual","pretti","clean","lose","lot","respect","aw","veri","veri","poor","tast","embarrass","even","rent","steven","keep","act","like","believ","career","husband","enjoi","watch","mani","becaus","alwai","get","bad","gui","hand","maneuv","make","cleanand","conjur","languag","pretti","clean","moviesbut","someth","els","think","twice","befor","rend","anoth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,9,12,15,21,22,39,50,53,55,61,72,73,78,79,91,134,138,146,196,197,200,221,235,265,511,531,536,557,661,695,872,1094,1194,1256,1495],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,9,12,15,21,22,39,50,53,55,61,72,73,78,79,91,134,138,146,196,197,200,221,235,265,511,531,536,557,661,695,872,1094,1194,1256,1495],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,2.4001215597131385,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,1.5538940054862738,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,4.012839573363895,1.9469506069506084,2.0105926690411424,2.2443961816702407,4.581473037857885,2.326138445979858,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.6423424573643777,2.6457189377809835,2.73529586597515,3.3909310864081816,3.424750734647968,3.6254214301101193,3.43462735814388,7.145555393249395,3.6284289511740746,3.857614816944247,4.218628162481577,8.998179973919743,4.291900363587903,9.086429583737619]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0872685869477752E-4,1.0799368806833406E-4,1.088332360157764E-4,1.0820439641863796E-4,1.0820616922584872E-4,1.0805491862499528E-4,1.083762890928812E-4,1.08009238453764E-4,1.0825208259584548E-4,1.2009977639173752E-4,0.8660900938880896,1.0783488772949294E-4,1.0984757243395863E-4,1.1141457219219835E-4,1.0791351980470254E-4,1.0761529339626207E-4,1.1029962227434514E-4,1.0838644313311067E-4,1.0805017461551551E-4,1.0813972899927784E-4,1.0918604430257213E-4,1.0849382667133548E-4,1.086173633522117E-4,1.0873438637879652E-4,1.0956886693230033E-4,1.0899585260424112E-4,1.1357783118603753E-4,1.0786694605288074E-4,1.0786983174629884E-4,1.0814311935502249E-4,1.1044167604033524E-4,1.0838016306427145E-4,1.1633692397935676E-4,1.0868502046968005E-4,1.0798435437275536E-4,1.0848277335220492E-4,1.0787615135116456E-4,1.07939898219659E-4,1.0761475272832698E-4,1.0764267296007755E-4,1.0788496353477345E-4,1.0902292129842935E-4,1.0846893002043174E-4,1.0804007419243017E-4,1.0935287438080442E-4,1.0808154056328746E-4,1.1167255344421279E-4,1.1003037599513359E-4,1.0766942804891184E-4,1.0790738406933736E-4,1.0786995772311301E-4,0.12541608809350727,1.0790898952549605E-4,1.0763311675047184E-4,1.0881454424166543E-4,1.0793678401659816E-4,1.1607414865045268E-4,1.0784783008153626E-4,1.0766818291374445E-4,1.081822668865465E-4,1.0925534405339895E-4,1.0817511001424103E-4,1.076482640591998E-4,1.0789890655494334E-4,1.0761605434781079E-4,1.1010606679055663E-4,1.0854311613882454E-4,1.0831190340933813E-4,1.0821717975459852E-4,1.086116485769012E-4,1.0761212834347461E-4,1.0821944847707826E-4,1.0997469609047953E-4,1.0780497525488003E-4,1.1047309222248317E-4,1.0809000065702922E-4,1.0893596720186927E-4,1.0827019849290059E-4,1.0757838877181234E-4,1.0771173957324135E-4]}}
{"value":"\"True\" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins polluting the waters. Amusing, though not really good, monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way. Give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy. An amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind. (My one complaint is that the print used on the Elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years

{"value":"I've never been to Paris, but after seeing \"Paris, Je t'aime\" I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I LOVE the city and its boroughs. I kinda expected to be touched by this film, to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away, but, lo and behold, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine.

{"value":"The film is based on a genuine 1950s novel.<br /><br />Journalist Colin McInnes wrote a set of three \"London novels\": \"Absolute Beginners\", \"City of Spades\" and \"Mr Love and Justice\". I have read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, perhaps an experiment that did not come off. But McInnes's work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. This musical is the novelist's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one's mind being turned into a glitzy, badly-acted, soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s London, and does nothing of the sort.<br /><br />Thank goodness Colin McInnes wasn't alive to witness it.","finished_norm":["the","film","be","base","on","a","genuin","novelbr","br","journalist","colin","mcinn","write","a","set","of","three","london","novel","absolut","beginn","citi","of","spade","and","mr","love","and","justic","i","have","read","all","three","the","two","be","excel","the","last","perhap","a","experi","that","do","not","come","off","but","mcinn","work","be","highli","acclaim","and","rightli","so","thi","music","be","the","novelist","ultim","nightmar","to","see","the","fruit","of","on","mind","be","turn","into","a","glitzi","badlyact","soporif","onedimension","apologi","of","a","film","that","sai","it","captur","the","spirit","of","london","and","doe","noth","of","the","sortbr","br","thank","good","colin","mcinn","be","not","aliv","to","wit","it"],"filtered":["film","base","genuin","novelbr","br","journalist","colin","mcinn","write","set","three","london","novel","absolut","beginn","citi","spade","mr","love","justic","read","three","two","excel","last","perhap","experi","come","mcinn","work","highli","acclaim","rightli","thi","music","novelist","ultim","nightmar","see","fruit","mind","turn","glitzi","badlyact","soporif","onedimension","apologi","film","sai","captur","spirit","london","doe","noth","sortbr","br","thank","good","colin","mcinn","aliv","wit"],"filtered2":["base","genuin","novelbr","journalist","colin","mcinn","write","set","three","london","novel","absolut","beginn","citi","spade","mr","love","justic","read","three","two","excel","last","perhap","experi","come","mcinn","work","highli","acclaim","rightli","music","novelist","ultim","nightmar","see","fruit","mind","turn","glitzi","badlyact","soporif","onedimension","apologi","captur","spirit","london","doe","noth","sortbr","thank","good","colin","mcinn","aliv","wit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,18,34,47,48,49,54,65,96,109,118,144,145,222,224,238,318,333,334,357,474,580,595,651,735,851,894,896,924,1048,1054,1092,1166,1426,2688,2836,3340,3952,4812,5882,5898,6695,6827],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,18,34,47,48,49,54,65,96,109,118,144,145,222,224,238,318,333,334,357,474,580,595,651,735,851,894,896,924,1048,1054,1092,1166,1426,2688,2836,3340,3952,4812,5882,5898,6695,6827],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.2153159934048174,1.3982850089458962,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,2.0390708128715254,2.125691139326857,2.354379525480895,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.5771019354959765,5.379009467558432,2.597304642813496,2.902686292364678,2.948928684455311,2.942840385588056,3.2829611516442836,3.6466665387238555,3.5039747767006686,3.6284289511740746,3.5474598886404074,3.7132521434831514,3.857614816944247,4.091229668125752,3.8844878351953436,3.969732115064953,4.160564361526816,4.3095999406873045,9.101523995008385,4.246178114249808,4.5432147918688095,5.259176650194926,5.501738287366237,5.583416318380505,12.350934764138163,6.0662680901040895,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.327095594767159E-5,7.277687276236528E-5,7.334264355176784E-5,7.291886897598037E-5,7.292006366955106E-5,7.281813599275409E-5,7.303470733196159E-5,7.278735215650473E-5,7.295100465828951E-5,8.093515742993585E-5,0.5501107155186792,7.266985732228558E-5,7.402620417243643E-5,7.508220424118035E-5,7.272284742416033E-5,7.252187285083419E-5,7.433084025167877E-5,7.30415501327495E-5,7.2814939008E-5,7.287528964616192E-5,7.358040081570529E-5,7.31139158259483E-5,7.319716711096715E-5,7.327602884879984E-5,7.383838472488203E-5,7.345223075986705E-5,7.654002300228292E-5,7.269146140456022E-5,7.26934060713873E-5,7.287757440458679E-5,7.442657018773147E-5,7.303731799864032E-5,7.839937375463333E-5,7.324276119630246E-5,0.04159197584216229,7.310646700172204E-5,7.269766484879779E-5,7.274062382001546E-5,7.252150849508135E-5,7.254032392022287E-5,7.270360337332393E-5,7.347047233442587E-5,7.309713798987806E-5,7.280813233976896E-5,7.369282749168623E-5,7.283607649881915E-5,0.1959324987871868,7.414939536768221E-5,7.255835415634748E-5,7.27187125562809E-5,7.269349096707647E-5,0.1106749043365229,7.271979447209168E-5,7.253388399708473E-5,7.333004717793795E-5,7.273852516069594E-5,7.822228963963728E-5,7.267857916450387E-5,7.255751506060707E-5,7.29039558993912E-5,7.362710187054097E-5,0.048776174278413284,7.254409175810951E-5,7.271299956511048E-5,7.252238565556408E-5,7.420040334311406E-5,7.314713196448508E-5,7.299131786371815E-5,7.29274836573689E-5,7.319331592778156E-5,7.251973992391856E-5,7.292901254790125E-5,7.411187271789674E-5,7.264969932603739E-5,7.444774153146233E-5,0.04748352061632714,7.341187402803676E-5,7.296321294896407E-5,7.2497002849578E-5,7.258686786374639E-5]}}
{"value":"Plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller related topics. Characters are interesting though sometimes. Not realistic but interesting nevertheless.<br /><br />Development is slow like tea drinking ceremony. Visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting. Movie sitcom style.<br /><br />I liked Woody - excellent performance.

{"value":"Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying, untalented self in this film. This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up. Hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age.<br /><br

{"value":"The movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. The Middle Eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there obviously are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible. <br /><br />The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this

{"value":"Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.","finished_norm":["have","see","three","other","version","of","the","same","film","i","be","afraid","for","me","thi","be","by","far","the","weak","primarili","due","to","scott","rather","dull","and","leaden","perform","hi","emot","throughout","be","so","bland","it","make","it","difficult","to","engag","in","the","film","alistair","sim","portrai","the","role","infinit","well","when","scroog","be","at","hi","mean","you","do","not","get","the","sens","scott","be","sai","the","dialogu","with","much","convict","and","when","he","undergo","hi","metamorphosi","he","be","similarli","unconvinc","i","cannot","think","of","ani","actor","in","thi","film","who","match","that","from","the","alistair","sim","version","even","the","music","version","and","frankli","the","muppet","take","on","thi","be","well","execut","veri","disappoint"],"filtered":["see","three","version","film","afraid","thi","far","weak","primarili","due","scott","rather","dull","leaden","perform","hi","emot","throughout","bland","make","difficult","engag","film","alistair","sim","portrai","role","infinit","well","scroog","hi","mean","get","sens","scott","sai","dialogu","much","convict","undergo","hi","metamorphosi","similarli","unconvinc","think","ani","actor","thi","film","match","alistair","sim","version","even","music","version","frankli","muppet","take","thi","well","execut","veri","disappoint"],"filtered2":["see","three","version","afraid","far","weak","primarili","due","scott","rather","dull","leaden","perform","emot","throughout","bland","make","difficult","engag","alistair","sim","portrai","role","infinit","well","scroog","mean","get","sens","scott","dialogu","convict","undergo","metamorphosi","similarli","unconvinc","think","ani","actor","match","alistair","sim","version","even","music","version","frankli","muppet","take","well","execut","veri","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,12,15,20,27,31,41,88,101,105,118,128,160,173,187,220,224,248,367,379,438,469,506,568,662,803,919,930,943,1028,1244,1332,1398,2358,3408,3552,4034,4836,4887,6055,6229,6683],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,12,15,20,27,31,41,88,101,105,118,128,160,173,187,220,224,248,367,379,438,469,506,568,662,803,919,930,943,1028,1244,1332,1398,2358,3408,3552,4034,4836,4887,6055,6229,6683],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.5687599167621034,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.354379525480895,2.3409902041158843,2.3722295531801256,2.4368824319140248,2.4732161909892554,8.501080262633181,2.689504733779216,2.689504733779216,3.0791938792932125,3.1272886331425473,3.1797351085150902,3.328770687675578,3.449627639403373,3.4471119148061256,3.616452760127359,3.7636829971100436,4.235066888824737,8.619199881374609,3.9911462095687695,4.086456389373095,4.339813719283801,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,5.185068678041204,5.604922523601468,5.649374286172302,6.660975197850782,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.07766873884623847,7.600795040653035E-5,7.659883974362498E-5,7.615625083155154E-5,7.615749856597905E-5,7.605104560215998E-5,7.627723206751842E-5,7.601889505473807E-5,7.61898132429952E-5,8.452843875507241E-5,0.45667661859804914,7.589618379780467E-5,7.731274843169522E-5,7.841563177646965E-5,7.595152650328866E-5,7.574162925403166E-5,7.76309094507692E-5,7.628437866839844E-5,0.04391607910098776,7.611073670853603E-5,7.684715272603572E-5,7.635995718408636E-5,7.644690457963679E-5,7.65292675451043E-5,7.711659035683935E-5,7.671329229925476E-5,7.993817337368011E-5,7.59187470373584E-5,7.592077804163407E-5,7.611312290346935E-5,7.773088951250767E-5,7.627995864006698E-5,8.188007379353543E-5,7.649452290734803E-5,7.600138117935286E-5,7.635217765412187E-5,7.592522589615052E-5,7.597009211848038E-5,7.574124872196232E-5,7.576089949626399E-5,7.593142807358049E-5,7.673234374570712E-5,7.634243446177704E-5,7.604059781660507E-5,7.696457081351296E-5,7.6069782613569E-5,7.85972037420138E-5,7.744140895121681E-5,7.577973022148149E-5,7.594720805951952E-5,7.592086670644045E-5,7.805756528530143E-5,7.594833800918854E-5,7.575417365960837E-5,7.658568412809735E-5,0.05782281439987249,0.35816982034084094,7.590529286399038E-5,7.577885387237492E-5,7.614067565852234E-5,7.689592716941519E-5,7.61356385197322E-5,7.57648346149955E-5,7.594124142845843E-5,7.574216482577305E-5,7.74946815297133E-5,7.639464802081474E-5,7.623191623536963E-5,7.616524797928397E-5,7.644288241532188E-5,7.573940163147699E-5,7.616684474802862E-5,7.740222040689274E-5,7.58751308462148E-5,7.775300080120772E-5,7.607573698365358E-5,7.667114384803533E-5,7.62025

{"value":"I came into this movie really wanting to line it. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Don't get me wrong here, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane, I was taking this for the B movie that it is. That said, it still fell short of the expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glazed over and the ending left me a bit cold. The acting in the movie was very wooden. All in all I give it 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have scored much higher with a bit more attention to movie making fundamentals. Is it worth seeing? I didn't wish for my two hours back, but I don't know that I'd recommend it to others.","finished_norm":["i","come","into","thi","movi","realli","want","to","line","it","i","think","the","premis","have","a","lot","of","potenti","and","be","ripe","for","a","interest","movi","do","not","get","me","wrong","here","i","be","not","expect","citizen","kane","i","be","take","thi","for","the","b","movi","that","it","be","that","sai","it","still","fall","short","of","the","expect","the","histor","aspect","of","the","stori","be","glaze","over","and","the","end","leav","me","a","bite","cold","the","act","in","the","movi","be","veri","wooden","all","in","all","i","give","it","for","a","great","idea","but","the","movi","can","have","score","much","high","with","a","bite","much","attent","to","movi","make","fundament","be","it","worth","see","i","do","not","wish","for","my","two","hour","back","but","i","do","not","know","that","i","have","recommend","it","to","other"],"filtered":["come","thi","movi","realli","want","line","think","premis","lot","potenti","ripe","interest","movi","get","wrong","expect","citizen","kane","take","thi","b","movi","sai","still","fall","short","expect","histor","aspect","stori","glaze","end","leav","bite","cold","act","movi","veri","wooden","give","great","idea","movi","score","much","high","bite","much","attent","movi","make","fundament","worth","see","wish","two","hour","back","know","recommend"],"filtered2":["come","realli","want","line","think","premis","lot","potenti","ripe","interest","get","wrong","expect","citizen","kane","take","b","still","fall","short","expect","histor","aspect","stori","glaze","end","leav","bite","cold","act","veri","wooden","give","great","idea","score","high","bite","attent","make","fundament","worth","see","wish","two","hour","back","know","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,12,13,15,17,21,24,25,26,30,31,34,37,47,51,60,63,64,72,74,107,123,130,154,170,174,211,219,272,298,399,484,518,547,636,642,645,890,953,1107,2369,2834,3394,6333],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,12,13,15,17,21,24,25,26,30,31,34,37,47,51,60,63,64,72,74,107,123,130,154,170,174,211,219,272,298,399,484,518,547,636,642,645,890,953,1107,2369,2834,3394,6333],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,2.1439533986393955,2.2619070973220485,4.528427806839927,4.696999252276032,2.4071371113909277,2.456282578459816,2.5687161421197025,2.5792094178355414,2.8028805344481915,2.7819920465008363,3.129115117668582,3.291526514503207,3.4101163271295305,3.432149042129413,3.530930586689197,3.622422927113863,3.558633189238533,3.8767358583910254,4.1302590120314875,4.213208095012239,5.089758498236879,5.373120909544144,5.649374286172302,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0353674825604888E-4,1.0283857575764254E-4,1.0363804762252219E-4,1.0303922587926615E-4,1.0304091406097298E-4,1.0289688345462482E-4,1.0320291320320645E-4,1.0285338384058426E-4,1.0308463574196336E-4,1.1436677618716457E-4,0.811497849699615,1.0268735580239924E-4,1.0460396437609173E-4,0.11874552040565986,1.0276223435102615E-4,1.0247824387300923E-4,1.0503443547665646E-4,1.0321258253716533E-4,1.0289236590191404E-4,1.0297764537929558E-4,1.0397401449594361E-4,1.0331484008877213E-4,1.0343247970773855E-4,1.0354391660372839E-4,1.0433856296829629E-4,1.0379290165752556E-4,1.0815615806567608E-4,1.0271788381174265E-4,1.0272063175568732E-4,1.0298087389535356E-4,1.051697082619158E-4,1.032066022493667E-4,1.1078354470579699E-4,1.034969071916477E-4,1.028296876089272E-4,1.0330431440327037E-4,1.0272664969224794E-4,1.0278735358413493E-4,1.024777290140263E-4,1.0250431646482468E-4,1.0273504122352965E-4,1.0381867821917216E-4,1.0329113188724784E-4,1.0288274762566821E-4,1.0413288088846915E-4,0.06177167362064714,1.0634182934983472E-4,1.0477804175238027E-4,1.025297943911665E-4,1.0275639150689823E-4,1.0272075171895906E-4,1.05611699803971E-4,1.0275792032610751E-4,1.0249521642385867E-4,1.0362024810606582E-4,1.0278438803852644E-4,1.105333130390014E-4,1.0269968034723974E-4,1.0252860869291385E-4,1.0301815270727644E-4,1.0404000620159664E-4,1.030113374704979E-4,1.0250964067109021E-4,1.0274831866929226E-4,1.0247896850029895E-4,1.0485011942412664E-4,1.033617767081903E-4,1.0314160099030599E-4,1.030513989987061E-4,1.034270377290061E-4,1.0247522990500165E-4,1.0305355942301218E-4,1.0472501974530408E-4,1.026588712090716E-4,1.0519962478283127E-4,1.0293029083494107E-4,1.03735874903474E-4,1.0310188687103436E-4,1.024431009022934E-4,1.025700861617

{"value":"This film on paper looked like it could possibly be good, after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible!! The plot has no meaning, and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous. I watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the SCARINESS of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera i mean be serious!!

{"value":"This is probably the worst excuse for television programming since, oh, I don't know, WHATS HAPPENING NOW? NOTHING ever happened on this ridiculous \"series\". Even though it's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin themselves, you don't get any good details into their personal lives. It's mostly just them making stupid, jokey small talk and acting like white trash. Look, I love Britney's music as much as the next babe, but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to Britney that they would watch her clip her toenails (yes, that could be an actual episode). Thank God these two broke up, because they were PAINFULLY dull together.

{"value":"<br /><br />\"step aside for hollywood veterans?\" (the wayan brothers were 'asked') thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got. However, like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous mistake.<br /><br />The director is SO out of touch with todays audience, attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a DISASTER. I knew it, the audience knew it and the CAST knew it.<br /><br />What a shame, why did they EVER consider changing directors? Not only that but the two Wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters, without them its just a farce and a sad one.<br /><br />SP<br /><br

{"value":"Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... okay, two of my friends and me, we orderd Pizza, sat down and wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or at least something brainless but funny like Versus. But Naked Blood sucked. It's a complete waste. Okay, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding. But that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. I won't summerize the plot, other people did already, I just wanted to stop the hype. But watch it and rate for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it sould be. One more thing that comes to my mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - okay, John's cool ... :)

{"value":"Truly shows that hype is not everything. Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke. The leading lady is such a waste of an actor. Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry. With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch.<br /><br />RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone?
