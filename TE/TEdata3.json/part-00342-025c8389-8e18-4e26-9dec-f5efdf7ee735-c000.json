But please allow me to try to describe it: Horrible acting, terrible dialog, corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Its a weak attempt at trying to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep, religious message attached to it. They failed miserably.

{"value":"Slash flicks come few and far between now a days, so when I heard about Cut I had high hopes and heard good things about it. Those good things I heard were all wrong..very wrong!

There is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. Just another slasher wannabe with those \"Hip,\" \"Self aware.\" \"Movie savvy\" characters. I'm so sick of that crap. Someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood, literally.","finished_norm":["slash","flick","come","few","and","far","between","now","a","dai","so","when","i","hear","about","cut","i","have","high","hope","and","hear","good","thing","about","it","that","good","thing","i","hear","be","all","wrongveri","wrong","thi","flick","be","bad","and","i","mean","bad","it","just","plain","stupid","everyth","about","it","especi","the","killer","origin","and","how","he","stai","aliv","and","how","he","be","take","care","of","in","the","end","there","be","noth","origin","or","outstand","about","thi","flick","just","anoth","slasher","wannab","with","that","hip","self","awar","movi","savvi","charact","i","be","so","sick","of","that","crap","someon","do","someth","differ","caus","the","slash","genr","ne","new","blood","liter"],"filtered":["slash","flick","come","far","dai","hear","cut","high","hope","hear","good","thing","good","thing","hear","wrongveri","wrong","thi","flick","bad","mean","bad","plain","stupid","everyth","especi","killer","origin","stai","aliv","take","care","end","noth","origin","outstand","thi","flick","anoth","slasher","wannab","hip","self","awar","movi","savvi","charact","sick","crap","someon","someth","differ","caus","slash","genr","ne","new","blood","liter"],"filtered2":["slash","flick","come","far","dai","hear","cut","high","hope","hear","good","thing","good","thing","hear","wrongveri","wrong","flick","bad","mean","bad","plain","stupid","everyth","especi","killer","origin","stai","aliv","take","care","end","noth","origin","outstand","flick","anoth","slasher","wannab","hip","self","awar","savvi","charact","sick","crap","someon","someth","differ","caus","slash","genr","ne","new","blood","liter"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,10,24,25,29,31,34,49,53,69,73,87,88,101,110,132,136,139,181,193,204,205,211,216,252,257,267,303,313,354,366,452,467,586,731,778,897,1048,1108,1625,1920,2227,2422,2804],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,10,24,25,29,31,34,49,53,69,73,87,88,101,110,132,136,139,181,193,204,205,211,216,252,257,267,303,313,354,366,452,467,586,731,778,897,1048,1108,1625,1920,2227,2422,2804],"values":[1.357228929984541,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,2.6390769554676132,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,4.254065042302116,1.8950689206770979,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.253494045787767,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.4442286541160034,2.517840471459249,2.624524614047584,2.571852579609833,2.5687161421197025,7.821056089601908,3.0433232530252132,8.280797856968729,2.7085302779237206,2.868298950055202,2.907069060519773,3.185521045582134,3.008694896185175,3.2872346624216657,3.342254038012865,3.4572130107926293,4.096025840389245,3.8059428063999263,3.8844878351953436,4.160564361526816,4.165705761027235,4.671389985292807,4.8184434032493035,5.129498826886393,5.116075806554253,10.712052952369687]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816467E-4,2.2324275812784223E-4,2.2329787848933373E-4,2.2325298847310012E-4,2.2327411672029327E-4,2.232415272346223E-4,2.233109584489241E-4,2.2320831253640859E-4,2.23242805307917E-4,2.2347350255652818E-4,2.252466997550513E-4,2.2324317404730234E-4,2.234545994406501E-4,2.2347787955470633E-4,2.2337635938917745E-4,2.2325386783430921E-4,2.2333067579914016E-4,2.2343577597443498E-4,2.2326539346890391E-4,2.2326457718847376E-4,2.2346543761534032E-4,2.232869460197477E-4,2.2328728394518986E-4,2.2343032416998455E-4,2.232654740063532E-4,2.2348055066696404E-4,2.233213453268012E-4,2.2324225779449936E-4,2.2334346629394183E-4,2.2341163393927886E-4,2.2328804127835615E-4,2.2340762949082032E-4,2.2351731705956904E-4,2.237247757880988E-4,2.2332095942123806E-4,2.2325373242729926E-4,2.233342280058664E-4,2.2327640592866805E-4,2.2320855076990684E-4,2.232653243272448E-4,2.2348907433600594E-4,2.2336647651074396E-4,2.2340813859831569E-4,2.2321965983456378E-4,2.2326538109796089E-4,2.2325364847537184E-4,2.2332921781121286E-4,2.233679433767197E-4,2.2332252276763837E-4,2.2328712575322477E-4,2.2325420056448954E-4,2.2371161216552593E-4,2.23310377752348E-4,2.2326532992581898E-4,2.2330918184256568E-4,2.2324248620167705E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760433E-4,2.232545139848125E-4,2.2324235876917283E-4,2.2342095801135598E-4,2.2333127123814594E-4,2.2324226544800517E-4,2.2321956888982677E-4,2.23197121696452E-4,2.2339892722621755E-4,2.2325320192525606E-4,2.2335468452716273E-4,2.234202334647874E-4,2.233188720525105E-4,2.2326562563335241E-4,2.23219861515807E-4,2.232769652806555E-4,2.2321974128682495E-4,2.232314554978465E-4,2.2321986783348544E-4,2.23364768720513E-4,2.2329828821719076E-4,2.2324256341896764E-4,2.2326418864637539E-4]}}
{"value":"<br /><br />Cheap-looking and ugly, this film didn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience, except for one fairly amusing toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role, although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help.   Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this movie, especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with Robin Williams's often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy.<br /><br

{"value":"Just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity; awful acting, plus, the lovemaking scenes are the most un-sexy I've ever seen (and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love, since I'm gay).<br /><br />Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it... And this time, there isn't even the issue of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to talk about!

{"value":"I wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on DVD and being sorely disapointed.<br /><br />I tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself (ie no budget, shot on digi cam), I stand by my original comments. This is a no budget student project (and not a particularly good one), released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover). So deceving the public into thinking it's something it's not. I want my money back under the trades description act!

{"value":"This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. Cool title, excellent director (I saw \"To Die For\" and \"Drugstore Cowboy\" before this), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey.<br /><br />Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. Its critical lambasting was well deserved. You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality.

{"value":"I got this movie because I worked at a movie store so I got free rentals. It came in, and the cover made it look alright. Hot chick, carrying a weapon, alright, I'll check it out.<br /><br />Oh man, bad move. This was so horrible, I spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity.<br /><br />Cheesy dialogue, crappy violence, poor excuses of characters. I feel bad putting this movie down, because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but so was \"Clerks\" and it became a cult classic and a franchise.<br /><br

{"value":"When I was a kid in the 50's and 60's anything connected with Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to get any actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources.<br /><br />Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still...they screw things up! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect Disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad.<br /><br />It is only due to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 of 10.","finished_norm":["when","i","be","a","kid","in","the","and","anyth","connect","with","disnei","be","by","definit","great","what","happen","thei","be","abl","to","get","ani","actor","and","actress","thei","want","the","well","of","their","time","but","somehow","disnei","manag","to","screw","thing","up","in","spite","of","their","abund","resourcesbr","br","disnei","can","afford","the","well","writer","the","well","produc","and","director","but","stillthei","screw","thing","up","thi","movi","be","crap","the","sad","thing","be","that","i","suspect","disnei","in","their","arrog","doe","not","even","know","when","a","movi","be","good","or","badbr","br","it","be","onli","due","to","the","talent","of","the","actor","that","i","can","even","give","it","a","of"],"filtered":["kid","anyth","connect","disnei","definit","great","happen","thei","abl","get","ani","actor","actress","thei","want","well","time","somehow","disnei","manag","screw","thing","spite","abund","resourcesbr","br","disnei","afford","well","writer","well","produc","director","stillthei","screw","thing","thi","movi","crap","sad","thing","suspect","disnei","arrog","doe","even","know","movi","good","badbr","br","onli","due","talent","actor","even","give"],"filtered2":["kid","anyth","connect","disnei","definit","great","happen","abl","get","ani","actor","actress","want","well","time","somehow","disnei","manag","screw","thing","spite","abund","resourcesbr","disnei","afford","well","writer","well","produc","director","stillthei","screw","thing","crap","sad","thing","suspect","disnei","arrog","doe","even","know","good","badbr","onli","due","talent","actor","even","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,8,11,18,20,26,27,29,30,37,41,51,58,94,104,114,261,276,287,313,345,355,392,454,455,549,568,767,841,977,1629,1705,2104,2363,2663,4091],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,8,11,18,20,26,27,29,30,37,41,51,58,94,104,114,261,276,287,313,345,355,392,454,455,549,568,767,841,977,1629,1705,2104,2363,2663,4091],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,3.4960351200691706,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,3.9586154332014196,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,3.1375198335242067,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,2.08112281984698,2.0728240170322856,2.4433074195966826,2.7085302779237206,2.7884729505849193,2.841890188081905,2.907069060519773,3.0022328381570844,3.0316467233633775,3.0670934723591254,3.2556198060399626,3.2787058260741455,3.4471119148061256,3.4471119148061256,3.79165684915245,17.21466082066996,4.035401218572811,4.613282354485526,9.502865385932687,5.00274712124725,5.129498826886393,5.274680836730892,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278294E-4,2.505862069158132E-4,2.5064807858603364E-4,2.5059769030472633E-4,2.506214064035925E-4,2.505848252590657E-4,2.5066276061866866E-4,2.5054754232407145E-4,2.505862598746464E-4,2.5084521362060523E-4,2.528355973920481E-4,2.5058667377834786E-4,2.508239951938733E-4,2.5085012672676976E-4,2.5073617206405776E-4,2.505986773727582E-4,2.5068489300962506E-4,2.5080286617253604E-4,2.5061161470196704E-4,2.5061069844103885E-4,2.508361608610075E-4,2.506358070744793E-4,2.506361863900526E-4,2.5079674661457357E-4,2.506117051038869E-4,2.508531250049424E-4,2.5067441971279E-4,2.50585645300128E-4,2.5069925012294786E-4,2.507757671478343E-4,2.506370364836776E-4,2.507712722224068E-4,2.5089439465660827E-4,2.5112726355820144E-4,2.506739865403453E-4,2.505985253806878E-4,2.506888803013839E-4,2.5062397600113863E-4,2.5054780973712967E-4,2.506115370916282E-4,2.508626926787704E-4,2.5072507870075754E-4,2.507718436869293E-4,2.505602794736538E-4,2.506116008157934E-4,2.505984311460741E-4,2.50683256442923E-4,2.507267252329183E-4,2.5067574137014513E-4,2.506360088222567E-4,2.505990508567382E-4,2.511124876152886E-4,2.506621087966181E-4,2.506115433759327E-4,2.5066076640818555E-4,2.505859016833082E-4,0.9801944567830261,2.506249972686771E-4,2.5059940266573106E-4,2.505857586424851E-4,2.507862332604841E-4,2.506855613798027E-4,2.505856538910584E-4,2.5056017738973006E-4,2.505349807961614E-4,2.507615040780931E-4,2.5059792990114846E-4,2.5071184239933207E-4,2.5078541996925854E-4,2.506716435043774E-4,2.5061187530261997E-4,2.505605058574262E-4,2.5062460386425067E-4,2.5056037090243446E-4,2.505735199054817E-4,2.50560512948913E-4,2.507231617352095E-4,2.5064853849859886E-4,2.505859883584063E-4,2.506102623091281E-4]}}
{"value":"I wonder how the actors acted in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half in and half out, was she faking or being natural? It didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film. Brian Cox acted really well. I almost thought that he had always acted this way, tricky, dishonest, in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she was doing in this film.<br /><br />This film is quite sickening and disgusting.

I liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end.

file.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","great","book","and","the","possibl","for","a","truli","great","film","be","definit","there","but","the","cast","decis","complet","wreck","the","movi","hank","be","a","great","actor","to","be","sure","but","lack","the","smarmi","moral","ambival","characterist","ne","for","the","lead","role","jeff","daniel","would","have","be","my","choicebr","br","putt","melani","griffith","in","for","ey","candi","reason","be","understand","but","again","she","do","not","portrai","the","depth","or","ambival","so","ne","to","pull","thi","offbr","br","thi","movi","be","a","great","exampl","of","how","everi","decis","even","that","earli","on","in","the","movi","product","can","make","or","break","a","file"],"filtered":["thi","great","book","possibl","truli","great","film","definit","cast","decis","complet","wreck","movi","hank","great","actor","sure","lack","smarmi","moral","ambival","characterist","ne","lead","role","jeff","daniel","choicebr","br","putt","melani","griffith","ey","candi","reason","understand","portrai","depth","ambival","ne","pull","thi","offbr","br","thi","movi","great","exampl","everi","decis","even","earli","movi","product","make","break","file"],"filtered2":["great","book","possibl","truli","great","definit","cast","decis","complet","wreck","hank","great","actor","sure","lack","smarmi","moral","ambival","characterist","ne","lead","role","jeff","daniel","choicebr","putt","melani","griffith","ey","candi","reason","understand","portrai","depth","ambival","ne","pull","offbr","great","exampl","everi","decis","even","earli","product","make","break","file"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,41,51,85,92,95,103,110,119,128,151,157,183,190,212,266,281,307,342,360,392,402,469,544,878,914,1213,1483,1787,1869,1873,1897,2166,3141,3379,3509,3919,5342],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,41,51,85,92,95,103,110,119,128,151,157,183,190,212,266,281,307,342,360,392,402,469,544,878,914,1213,1483,1787,1869,1873,1897,2166,3141,3379,3509,3919,5342],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,1.5687599167621034,6.855959723323929,2.011190219103739,2.0489535369135887,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,4.2580959472608155,2.1653408989309972,2.3409902041158843,2.8002454868101863,2.3360150694757706,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.5983793339432615,2.747702973022204,2.832333801361687,2.8767855639325206,2.9705344631698933,3.028335462059722,3.0670934723591254,3.084424928710765,3.328770687675578,3.4222967456864013,4.067587905068712,3.9612932464190886,4.251780369798478,9.086429583737619,4.828393734102471,4.979216623837056,5.00274712124725,4.848596441419991,5.390512652256013,5.521540914662417,5.604922523601468,5.626901430320244,6.032366538428407,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7310929654841826E-4,2.728672805936191E-4,2.729346536330478E-4,2.7287978503727256E-4,2.7290560987210105E-4,2.7286577608575313E-4,2.7295064113039654E-4,2.728251781086751E-4,2.7286733826132936E-4,2.731493170874148E-4,2.7531667741558343E-4,2.7286778896761063E-4,2.7312621200724265E-4,2.7315466704635663E-4,2.7303058001336346E-4,2.728808598712506E-4,2.729747414406556E-4,2.731032042820177E-4,2.7289494753346795E-4,2.72893949802464E-4,2.731394593944328E-4,2.7292129099019605E-4,2.729217040329178E-4,2.730965405986481E-4,2.7289504597354707E-4,2.7315793191883903E-4,2.729633369022279E-4,2.728666690414245E-4,2.7299037512823075E-4,2.730736957257882E-4,2.7292262971329967E-4,2.7306880113045923E-4,2.7320287109470077E-4,2.734564457215512E-4,2.7296286521390765E-4,2.7288069436468324E-4,2.7297908326566093E-4,2.7290840794747505E-4,2.7282546929898E-4,2.7289486302234356E-4,2.7316835031006325E-4,2.730185002747632E-4,2.730694234072083E-4,2.7283904779213384E-4,2.7289493241259405E-4,2.7288059175112334E-4,2.729729593573119E-4,2.730202932096524E-4,2.729647760758073E-4,2.7292151067653895E-4,2.728812665638584E-4,2.7344035596381686E-4,2.729499313510653E-4,2.72894869865422E-4,2.7294846960308804E-4,2.728669482211209E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.7290952002183625E-4,2.728816496542302E-4,2.7286679246170826E-4,2.7308509244124303E-4,2.72975469239504E-4,2.7286667839622437E-4,2.7283893663133615E-4,2.728114996624306E-4,2.730581644437551E-4,2.728800459376028E-4,2.7300408705697467E-4,2.730842068355755E-4,2.7296031384501637E-4,2.72895231305637E-4,2.7283929430500103E-4,2.7290909163753957E-4,2.728391473503779E-4,2.728534655075829E-4,2.728393020270331E-4,2.7301641286068515E-4,2.7293515443910785E-4,2.7286704260300493E-4,2.728934748915345E-4]}}
{"value":"This is a typical \"perfect crime\" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. The audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. The result is like every single episode of \"Columbo\" or \"murder she wrote\". The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. Skip this one, you are not missing anything.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","typic","perfect","crime","thriller","a","perfect","crime","be","execut","and","the","investig","polic","offic","ignor","all","the","clue","immedi","know","who","guilti","be","the","audienc","have","to","wait","around","the","whole","movi","for","the","guilti","to","be","catch","the","result","be","like","everi","singl","episod","of","columbo","or","murder","she","write","the","director","himself","refer","to","the","hacknei","stori","by","show","the","polic","offic","watch","a","episod","of","matlock","thi","stori","bare","fill","up","minut","but","the","director","insist","on","us","all","minut","fill","with","everi","clich","in","the","book","skip","thi","on","you","be","not","miss","anyth"],"filtered":["thi","typic","perfect","crime","thriller","perfect","crime","execut","investig","polic","offic","ignor","clue","immedi","know","guilti","audienc","wait","around","whole","movi","guilti","catch","result","like","everi","singl","episod","columbo","murder","write","director","refer","hacknei","stori","show","polic","offic","watch","episod","matlock","thi","stori","bare","fill","minut","director","insist","us","minut","fill","everi","clich","book","skip","thi","miss","anyth"],"filtered2":["typic","perfect","crime","thriller","perfect","crime","execut","investig","polic","offic","ignor","clue","immedi","know","guilti","audienc","wait","around","whole","guilti","catch","result","like","everi","singl","columbo","murder","write","director","refer","hacknei","stori","show","polic","offic","watch","matlock","stori","bare","fill","minut","director","insist","us","minut","fill","everi","clich","book","skip","miss","anyth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,17,26,28,56,58,59,65,85,98,104,111,151,168,255,273,331,443,447,471,512,553,587,594,613,662,677,714,715,753,762,931,988,1045,1113,1581,1912,2038,2815,2844],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,17,26,28,56,58,59,65,85,98,104,111,151,168,255,273,331,443,447,471,512,553,587,594,613,662,677,714,715,753,762,931,988,1045,1113,1581,1912,2038,2815,2844],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,2.5541073880211935,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.8610609350701788,3.731402629253362,3.7386508898401445,1.9073850067444174,4.022380438207478,2.0881990796736947,2.0728240170322856,2.1183455303375887,2.8002454868101863,2.4894767118610357,2.6754694156628323,2.9674191958529437,2.932274249550174,3.239158528985891,3.2070272508030975,6.992055430016274,3.369778711402955,6.909356310378882,7.221036049215089,3.496027715008137,3.5364100524538222,3.616452760127359,7.311823193735813,3.7297814454343623,3.68099128126493,7.738087025535739,3.7465885637507435,3.9241755834625858,4.035401218572811,4.165705761027235,4.268777946167049,4.671389985292807,4.838444069955973,9.958433247674112,6.342521466732247,5.339219357868463]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918343E-4,2.3612552253122058E-4,2.3618382374676028E-4,2.361363432433456E-4,2.361586907472489E-4,2.3612422060632424E-4,2.3619765851711906E-4,2.3608908917345178E-4,2.361255724339359E-4,2.3636958262639033E-4,2.3824510696873895E-4,2.3612596245232116E-4,2.3634958866039737E-4,2.3637421220985635E-4,2.3626683357713384E-4,2.3613727335022446E-4,2.3621851370481583E-4,2.3632967894044422E-4,2.3614946409949669E-4,2.3614860071362597E-4,2.3636105227822522E-4,2.3617226039252115E-4,2.361726178187699E-4,2.3632391252640514E-4,2.3614954928455467E-4,2.363770374651205E-4,2.3620864479495746E-4,2.3612499332492957E-4,2.3623204230611877E-4,2.3630414373063938E-4,2.3617341885568202E-4,2.3629990819577746E-4,2.364159255515169E-4,2.366353561887683E-4,2.3620823661977853E-4,2.361371301292248E-4,2.3622227090024024E-4,2.3616111205994103E-4,2.360893411547914E-4,2.3614939096785055E-4,2.363860530131422E-4,2.3625638038324843E-4,2.3630044668255468E-4,2.3610109129494804E-4,2.3614945101465838E-4,2.3613704133264795E-4,2.3621697158016165E-4,2.3625793189828038E-4,2.3620989018287175E-4,2.361724504979541E-4,2.3613762528140622E-4,2.3662143292745185E-4,2.361970443100397E-4,2.3614939688950401E-4,2.36195779387385E-4,2.3612523491289698E-4,0.9813373836540946,2.361620743927611E-4,2.3613795678840852E-4,2.3612510012659127E-4,2.363140058708933E-4,2.362191435050725E-4,2.3612500142009948E-4,2.3610099510202456E-4,2.3607725253895363E-4,2.362907037459052E-4,2.361365690132755E-4,2.362439079146759E-4,2.3631323951260898E-4,2.3620602879437962E-4,2.3614970966155733E-4,2.361013046146962E-4,2.3616170369069055E-4,2.3610117744760935E-4,2.3611356765556815E-4,2.3610131129695158E-4,2.3625457404084327E-4,2.361842571189563E-4,2.3612531658619848E-4,2.3614818974976415E-4]}}
{"value":"1st watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): Fairly lame account of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much-heralded event. The replication of the disaster is not bad, but the drama around it is at some times silly, badly acted and way-too soap opera-like. The story is very much the same as the most recent Oscar-winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late. Good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what James Cameron was competing against(barely) in his recreation.","finished_norm":["st","watch","out","of","direwald","andr","dupont","fairli","lame","account","of","the","titan","disast","be","the","film","version","of","thi","muchherald","event","the","replic","of","the","disast","be","not","bad","but","the","drama","around","it","be","at","some","time","silli","badli","act","and","waytoo","soap","operalik","the","stori","be","veri","much","the","same","a","the","much","recent","oscarwin","on","except","that","we","be","show","how","the","crow","try","to","hide","the","actual","disast","that","be","occur","until","almost","too","late","good","for","nostalgia","purpos","onli","and","to","get","a","feel","for","what","jame","cameron","be","compet","againstbar","in","hi","recreat"],"filtered":["st","watch","direwald","andr","dupont","fairli","lame","account","titan","disast","film","version","thi","muchherald","event","replic","disast","bad","drama","around","time","silli","badli","act","waytoo","soap","operalik","stori","veri","much","much","recent","oscarwin","except","show","crow","try","hide","actual","disast","occur","almost","late","good","nostalgia","purpos","onli","get","feel","jame","cameron","compet","againstbar","hi","recreat"],"filtered2":["st","watch","direwald","andr","dupont","fairli","lame","account","titan","disast","version","muchherald","event","replic","disast","bad","drama","around","time","silli","badli","act","waytoo","soap","operalik","stori","veri","recent","oscarwin","except","show","crow","try","hide","actual","disast","occur","almost","late","good","nostalgia","purpos","onli","get","feel","jame","cameron","compet","againstbar","recreat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,9,11,15,17,21,28,36,43,52,98,131,150,220,232,373,385,448,463,470,562,620,707,768,794,819,1034,1128,1259,1343,1361,1503,2720,2866,3446,4206,7054,7055,7146],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,9,11,15,17,21,28,36,43,52,98,131,150,220,232,373,385,448,463,470,562,620,707,768,794,819,1034,1128,1259,1343,1361,1503,2720,2866,3446,4206,7054,7055,7146],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.7122153074726136,2.0881990796736947,2.2512118082053005,2.332712011146513,2.8336934208777267,2.6102777977348763,3.070535816550098,3.09496984188738,3.2681460658591432,3.3467891931782563,3.3814747511661465,3.432149042129413,3.7568101178222815,3.6375061693251913,3.857614816944247,3.7465885637507435,3.835141961092188,12.375888668068075,4.315570107673808,4.315570107673808,4.520909034354511,4.396611317676934,4.597282013139085,5.626901430320244,5.426230734858092,5.770002273960917,5.9370563586240825,6.948657270302562,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.73109296548418E-4,2.7286728059361886E-4,2.7293465363304755E-4,2.728797850372723E-4,2.729056098721008E-4,2.7286577608575286E-4,2.729506411303963E-4,2.728251781086748E-4,2.728673382613291E-4,2.731493170874146E-4,2.753166774155832E-4,2.7286778896761036E-4,2.731262120072424E-4,2.7315466704635636E-4,2.7303058001336325E-4,2.7288085987125035E-4,2.7297474144065534E-4,2.731032042820174E-4,2.728949475334677E-4,2.7289394980246375E-4,2.7313945939443253E-4,2.729212909901958E-4,2.7292170403291755E-4,2.7309654059864784E-4,2.728950459735468E-4,2.731579319188388E-4,2.729633369022276E-4,2.7286666904142423E-4,2.729903751282305E-4,2.7307369572578794E-4,2.7292262971329945E-4,2.7306880113045896E-4,2.7320287109470055E-4,2.7345644572155097E-4,2.729628652139074E-4,2.72880694364683E-4,2.7297908326566066E-4,2.729084079474748E-4,2.7282546929897975E-4,2.728948630223433E-4,2.73168350310063E-4,2.73018500274763E-4,2.730694234072081E-4,2.7283904779213357E-4,2.728949324125938E-4,2.7288059175112307E-4,2.7297295935731165E-4,2.7302029320965215E-4,2.729647760758071E-4,2.729215106765387E-4,2.728812665638581E-4,2.7344035596381665E-4,2.7294993135106504E-4,2.7289486986542175E-4,2.7294846960308777E-4,2.728669482211207E-4,0.9784334310143923,2.72909520021836E-4,2.728816496542299E-4,2.72866792461708E-4,2.730850924412428E-4,2.729754692395037E-4,2.728666783962241E-4,2.728389366313359E-4,2.728114996624304E-4,2.730581644437549E-4,2.728800459376026E-4,2.730040870569744E-4,2.730842068355753E-4,2.729603138450161E-4,2.7289523130563675E-4,2.7283929430500076E-4,2.729090916375393E-4,2.7283914735037765E-4,2.7285346550758266E-4,2.728393020270328E-4,2.730164128606849E-4,2.729351544391076E-4,2.7286704260300466E-4,2.728934748915342E-4]}}
{"value":"I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and of the few reviews that there are to be positive. I saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed. I didn't find it very enjoyable at all. It was slow, and lacks the entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are lackluster, with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all. And the supposed great twist ending is really not much, I did see it coming, and then the ending just seemed cliche. This movie may not get much mention, but by the little that it does get, it is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.","finished_norm":["i","be","veri","surpris","to","see","such","a","high","rate","for","thi","film","and","of","the","few","review","that","there","be","to","be","posit","i","see","the","movi","and","be","pretti","dissapoint","i","do","not","find","it","veri","enjoy","at","all","it","be","slow","and","lack","the","entertain","valu","even","the","murder","scene","be","lacklust","with","real","closeup","shot","of","gener","stab","that","do","not","look","good","at","all","and","the","suppos","great","twist","end","be","realli","not","much","i","do","see","it","come","and","then","the","end","just","seem","clich","thi","movi","mai","not","get","much","mention","but","by","the","littl","that","it","doe","get","it","be","overr","i","would","not","recommend","thi","movi"],"filtered":["veri","surpris","see","high","rate","thi","film","review","posit","see","movi","pretti","dissapoint","find","veri","enjoy","slow","lack","entertain","valu","even","murder","scene","lacklust","real","closeup","shot","gener","stab","look","good","suppos","great","twist","end","realli","much","see","come","end","seem","clich","thi","movi","mai","get","much","mention","littl","doe","get","overr","recommend","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["veri","surpris","see","high","rate","review","posit","see","pretti","dissapoint","find","veri","enjoy","slow","lack","entertain","valu","even","murder","scene","lacklust","real","closeup","shot","gener","stab","look","good","suppos","great","twist","end","realli","see","come","end","seem","clich","mai","get","mention","littl","doe","get","overr","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,13,14,15,16,18,19,24,34,35,38,46,51,78,80,149,176,183,195,202,211,225,273,285,298,326,390,435,441,451,509,737,1581,1587,1948,2112,2741],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,13,14,15,16,18,19,24,34,35,38,46,51,78,80,149,176,183,195,202,211,225,273,285,298,326,390,435,441,451,509,737,1581,1587,1948,2112,2741],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,2.6420723132238515,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.3253197803590226,2.5040471493269134,2.4885128563647294,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,2.5687161421197025,2.641219492619754,2.9674191958529437,2.808171552082607,2.7819920465008363,2.942840385588056,3.132778125427319,3.2829611516442836,3.293679367864308,3.216957819005698,3.360519385990158,3.68099128126493,4.671389985292807,4.706176101378222,4.911775343041523,4.9909126636002465,5.259176650194926]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.671703793782347E-4,2.66933626198184E-4,2.6699953417250606E-4,2.6694585872558975E-4,2.669711219846794E-4,2.6693215440669825E-4,2.6701517401262116E-4,2.6689243925574947E-4,2.6693368261187703E-4,2.6720952964782193E-4,2.693297594914937E-4,2.6693412351729354E-4,2.6718692700077485E-4,2.672147632688601E-4,2.6709337457905835E-4,2.669469101866909E-4,2.6703875024791017E-4,2.671644195916362E-4,2.669606915046714E-4,2.669597154698963E-4,2.671998863159871E-4,2.6698646210793214E-4,2.669868661688048E-4,2.6715790081385603E-4,2.669607878041149E-4,2.672179571448313E-4,2.6702759370766466E-4,2.669330279445401E-4,2.6705404397204673E-4,2.6713555271576497E-4,2.6698777171973965E-4,2.671307645561986E-4,2.672619190927242E-4,2.675099795949206E-4,2.6702713227647556E-4,2.669467482791581E-4,2.6704299765745843E-4,2.6697385921431113E-4,2.668927241139554E-4,2.6696060883128953E-4,2.672281489822058E-4,2.6708155752125254E-4,2.671313733011854E-4,2.669060073350436E-4,2.669606767126095E-4,2.669466478969885E-4,2.670370069169836E-4,2.670833114677516E-4,2.670290015855951E-4,2.669866770170704E-4,2.6694730803553633E-4,2.6749423971813023E-4,2.670144796678457E-4,2.6696061552556135E-4,2.670130497064105E-4,2.66933301053315E-4,0.9789024083376444,2.6697494710598214E-4,2.6694768279538985E-4,2.669331486809795E-4,2.6714670160315264E-4,2.6703946222035813E-4,2.6693303709591446E-4,2.6690589859150075E-4,2.6687905825510753E-4,2.671203591703037E-4,2.669461139524938E-4,2.6706745772709213E-4,2.6714583525548467E-4,2.6702463638855365E-4,2.6696096910605306E-4,2.669062484873481E-4,2.6697452803714586E-4,2.66906104728337E-4,2.669201115290603E-4,2.669062560414602E-4,2.670795154991822E-4,2.6700002408825313E-4,2.669333933828112E-4,2.669592508861753E-4]}}
{"value":"My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us other cult classics such as \"Spider Baby\". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.","finished_norm":["my","exposur","to","the","templario","not","a","good","on","i","be","excit","to","find","thi","titl","among","the","offer","from","anchor","bai","video","which","have","bring","u","other","cult","classic","such","a","spider","babi","the","print","qualiti","be","excel","but","thi","alon","ca","not","hide","the","fact","that","the","film","be","deadli","dull","there","a","thrill","open","sequenc","in","which","the","villag","exact","a","terribl","reveng","on","the","templar","set","the","whole","thing","in","motion","but","everyth","els","in","the","movi","be","slow","ponder","ultim","unfulfil","add","insult","to","injuri","the","movi","be","dub","not","subtitl","a","promis","on","the","video","jacket"],"filtered":["exposur","templario","good","excit","find","thi","titl","among","offer","anchor","bai","video","bring","u","cult","classic","spider","babi","print","qualiti","excel","thi","alon","ca","hide","fact","film","deadli","dull","thrill","open","sequenc","villag","exact","terribl","reveng","templar","set","whole","thing","motion","everyth","els","movi","slow","ponder","ultim","unfulfil","add","insult","injuri","movi","dub","subtitl","promis","video","jacket"],"filtered2":["exposur","templario","good","excit","find","titl","among","offer","anchor","bai","video","bring","u","cult","classic","spider","babi","print","qualiti","excel","alon","ca","hide","fact","deadli","dull","thrill","open","sequenc","villag","exact","terribl","reveng","templar","set","whole","thing","motion","everyth","els","slow","ponder","ultim","unfulfil","add","insult","injuri","dub","subtitl","promis","video","jacket"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,29,38,81,97,109,111,112,166,193,196,240,242,250,264,299,319,332,349,367,390,457,507,524,580,683,698,707,709,735,826,871,933,949,1021,1218,1688,1721,1945,1999,2255,3391,3674,3726,3783,3990,3997,5995,8567],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,29,38,81,97,109,111,112,166,193,196,240,242,250,264,299,319,332,349,367,390,457,507,524,580,683,698,707,709,735,826,871,933,949,1021,1218,1688,1721,1945,1999,2255,3391,3674,3726,3783,3990,3997,5995,8567],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.3195384777338066,1.519311641348122,1.949757232424728,2.0545557924622586,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.4423870329693536,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,5.533214255322713,2.689504733779216,2.6812935439488212,2.757740698455715,2.7949961309240425,2.9056060024680126,2.9705344631698933,3.0568369721919364,3.0791938792932125,3.132778125427319,3.3243163373261977,3.365138331846453,3.4028786598293,3.5039747767006686,3.6105180246075443,3.90413483257914,3.6375061693251913,3.6497387377608255,3.7132521434831514,3.8204358137024927,3.9954846111673676,4.091229668125752,4.086456389373095,4.076977645418551,4.297765483040301,4.838444069955973,4.760735085628657,4.900964426937307,4.979216623837056,5.143104478942172,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776,5.7446844659766265,5.719991853386255,6.032366538428407,5.907203395474402,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006066E-4,2.4075667160687803E-4,2.4081611628889928E-4,2.407677045465099E-4,2.4079049035382463E-4,2.407553441472228E-4,2.408302224017342E-4,2.4071952367870044E-4,2.4075672248833935E-4,2.4100551847254184E-4,2.4291782711448486E-4,2.4075712015618692E-4,2.409851323632679E-4,2.4101023885640487E-4,2.409007541978265E-4,2.407686528956506E-4,2.4085148662392325E-4,2.409648321523582E-4,2.407810827430797E-4,2.407802024235517E-4,2.4099682081796445E-4,2.408043261416531E-4,2.4080469057813193E-4,2.4095895264117164E-4,2.4078116959887915E-4,2.4101311952363027E-4,2.4084142415433326E-4,2.4075613202122098E-4,2.4086528056278372E-4,2.409387961184069E-4,2.4080550732584615E-4,2.409344775116553E-4,2.4105277032522763E-4,2.4127650467341201E-4,2.4084100797358134E-4,2.4076850686564587E-4,2.4085531750952708E-4,2.407929591559195E-4,2.407197806021706E-4,2.4078100817709667E-4,2.410223118943285E-4,2.4089009598459934E-4,2.4093502655981748E-4,2.4073176119878166E-4,2.407810694016074E-4,2.4076841632749452E-4,2.4084991425345282E-4,2.408916779296218E-4,2.40842693968142E-4,2.4080451997563935E-4,2.4076901172928727E-4,2.4126230833403908E-4,2.4082959614816143E-4,2.4078101421489198E-4,2.4082830641647583E-4,2.4075637834747286E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305142E-4,2.4076934973816337E-4,2.4075624091759236E-4,2.4094885168561962E-4,2.408521287765036E-4,2.4075614027516213E-4,2.4073166311921858E-4,2.4070745489132732E-4,2.4092509253415917E-4,2.4076793474448382E-4,2.4087737889248641E-4,2.4094807029668796E-4,2.4083875684592336E-4,2.4078133312136903E-4,2.4073197870238739E-4,2.40793562390371E-4,2.4073184904116213E-4,2.4074448225927723E-4,2.4073198551570238E-4,2.4088825421425368E-4,2.4081655816085942E-4,

{"value":"Beyond dirt cheap, this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through. It's got the typical gore that you'd expect in a zombie movie, but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while.<br /><br />What's strange is that this is an amateur German video, and the version I saw is English-dubbed!

{"value":"This movie is very much like \"Flashdance\", you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals. That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. \"G.I. Jane\" is much better than that film, but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting, but the script is too clichéd and Ridley Scott can't do anything about that. Well, like I said... It's better than \"Flashdance\"...

{"value":"It's a bad movie, it seems like there is only 5 police in HK, they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a Jacky Chan's movie. All the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only. When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In The movie, it's like all the good guys died without a reason.<br /><br />They story line of the movie also sucks, the story jump here and there and bored people. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is only a OK type of movie, I think U.S. made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one","finished_norm":["it","a","bad","movi","it","seem","like","there","be","onli","polic","in","hk","thei","be","not","us","there","gun","and","thi","make","me","feel","like","a","jacki","chan","movi","all","the","time","thei","be","us","their","gun","to","point","at","the","suspect","onli","when","thei","final","us","their","gun","be","when","thei","kill","each","other","what","a","funni","movi","in","the","movi","it","like","all","the","good","gui","die","without","a","reasonbr","br","thei","stori","line","of","the","movi","conjur","suck","the","stori","jump","here","and","there","and","bore","peopl","but","if","you","want","to","see","a","bloodi","movi","i","think","thi","be","onli","a","okai","typ","of","movi","i","think","u","make","zombi","movi","be","much","bloodi","than","thi","on"],"filtered":["bad","movi","seem","like","onli","polic","hk","thei","us","gun","thi","make","feel","like","jacki","chan","movi","time","thei","us","gun","point","suspect","onli","thei","final","us","gun","thei","kill","funni","movi","movi","like","good","gui","die","without","reasonbr","br","thei","stori","line","movi","conjur","suck","stori","jump","bore","peopl","want","see","bloodi","movi","think","thi","onli","okai","typ","movi","think","u","make","zombi","movi","much","bloodi","thi"],"filtered2":["bad","seem","like","onli","polic","hk","us","gun","make","feel","like","jacki","chan","time","us","gun","point","suspect","onli","final","us","gun","kill","funni","like","good","gui","die","without","reasonbr","stori","line","conjur","suck","stori","jump","bore","peopl","want","see","bloodi","think","onli","okai","typ","think","u","make","zombi","bloodi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,11,12,17,23,35,37,39,43,55,56,62,66,76,107,108,112,125,156,191,268,293,384,421,471,501,674,977,1181,3441,3676,4946,5205],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,11,12,17,23,35,37,39,43,55,56,62,66,76,107,108,112,125,156,191,268,293,384,421,471,501,674,977,1181,3441,3676,4946,5205],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.9739294460164585,2.133457220525776,2.5541073880211935,1.364847727375781,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.9536997889255368,5.583182805210536,2.0226120445069267,1.929723173391612,2.1337665533324026,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.3451551414151686,2.5460113484259455,3.6746621462132825,2.9012296278682137,3.109204957709252,3.2597778161886266,3.496027715008137,10.535956501340243,3.6405503117064195,4.035401218572811,8.549017241752068,5.878215858601149,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006077E-4,2.407566716068781E-4,2.408161162888994E-4,2.4076770454651E-4,2.4079049035382474E-4,2.4075534414722292E-4,2.408302224017343E-4,2.4071952367870055E-4,2.4075672248833946E-4,2.4100551847254195E-4,2.4291782711609775E-4,2.4075712015618703E-4,2.40985132363268E-4,2.4101023885640495E-4,2.409007541978266E-4,2.4076865289565072E-4,2.4085148662392333E-4,2.409648321523583E-4,2.407810827430798E-4,2.407802024235518E-4,2.4099682081796456E-4,2.408043261416532E-4,2.4080469057813204E-4,2.4095895264117175E-4,2.4078116959887926E-4,2.4101311952363035E-4,2.4084142415433337E-4,2.407561320212211E-4,2.4086528056278383E-4,2.4093879611840701E-4,2.4080550732584626E-4,2.4093447751165537E-4,2.4105277032522771E-4,2.4127650467341212E-4,2.4084100797358142E-4,2.4076850686564595E-4,2.4085531750952718E-4,2.407929591559196E-4,2.407197806021707E-4,2.4078100817709675E-4,2.410223118943286E-4,2.4089009598459945E-4,2.4093502655981756E-4,2.4073176119878176E-4,2.407810694016075E-4,2.4076841632749462E-4,2.4084991425345293E-4,2.408916779296219E-4,2.408426939681421E-4,2.4080451997563946E-4,2.4076901172928738E-4,2.412623083340392E-4,2.4082959614816154E-4,2.407810142148921E-4,2.4082830641647594E-4,2.4075637834747296E-4,0.9809713522425271,2.407939403630515E-4,2.4076934973816348E-4,2.4075624091759247E-4,2.4094885168561973E-4,2.4085212877650368E-4,2.4075614027516224E-4,2.4073166311921866E-4,2.4070745489132743E-4,2.4092509253415925E-4,2.407679347444839E-4,2.408773788924865E-4,2.4094807029668806E-4,2.4083875684592344E-4,2.407813331213691E-4,2.407319787023875E-4,2.4079356239037109E-4,2.4073184904116222E-4,2.4074448225927734E-4,2.407319855157025E-4,2.408882542142538E-4,2.4081655816085952E-4,2.4075646162263957E-4,2.4077978339942234E-4]}}

{"value":"After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was: Is this supposed to be irony or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not meant to be ironic. So, the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.","finished_norm":["after","have","see","the","movi","the","question","aris","in","my","mind","be","be","thi","suppos","to","be","ironi","or","not","after","read","a","few","comment","about","the","charact","doc","savag","and","the","comic","seri","i","know","thi","film","be","not","mean","to","be","iron","so","the","stori","tell","u","about","a","usamerican","superdoc","save","a","south","american","republ","from","evil","sound","like","a","typic","stori","but","thi","on","come","in","such","a","unrealist","wai","that","it","becom","ridicul","the","mandatori","endfight","show","the","wrong","present","of","martial","art","i","have","ever","see","the","film","mai","be","interest","for","low","budget","movi","design","a","a","bad","exampl"],"filtered":["see","movi","question","aris","mind","thi","suppos","ironi","read","comment","charact","doc","savag","comic","seri","know","thi","film","mean","iron","stori","tell","u","usamerican","superdoc","save","south","american","republ","evil","sound","like","typic","stori","thi","come","unrealist","wai","becom","ridicul","mandatori","endfight","show","wrong","present","martial","art","ever","see","film","mai","interest","low","budget","movi","design","bad","exampl"],"filtered2":["see","question","aris","mind","suppos","ironi","read","comment","charact","doc","savag","comic","know","mean","iron","stori","tell","u","usamerican","superdoc","save","south","american","republ","evil","sound","like","typic","stori","come","unrealist","wai","becom","ridicul","mandatori","endfight","show","wrong","present","martial","art","ever","see","mai","interest","low","budget","design","bad","exampl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,10,17,25,26,28,33,34,44,46,60,88,90,112,115,145,149,178,189,217,223,238,256,274,280,307,321,378,382,411,480,613,681,1246,1264,1299,1386,2308,2660,2765,5371,5534,6580],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,10,17,25,26,28,33,34,44,46,60,88,90,112,115,145,149,178,189,217,223,238,256,274,280,307,321,378,382,411,480,613,681,1246,1264,1299,1386,2308,2660,2765,5371,5534,6580],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,2.5541073880211935,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.838176641236591,2.0317223413467334,2.0477128419653545,2.2466628996789315,2.201553588425805,2.34599021453259,2.3253197803590226,2.532833256045391,2.498193474075453,2.6113665294700725,2.825563294794476,2.597304642813496,2.748952192422636,2.748952192422636,2.8028805344481915,2.8767855639325206,3.09496984188738,3.130944944345658,3.235085203598255,3.229006157521873,3.43462735814388,3.5364100524538222,3.706716172503366,4.315570107673808,4.327618446189983,4.5432147918688095,4.715065048795469,5.339219357868463,5.290429193699031,5.822646007446338,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351994E-4,2.5580823473939323E-4,2.558713957686225E-4,2.558199574334826E-4,2.558441677579874E-4,2.558068242899597E-4,2.558863837637599E-4,2.557687644066797E-4,2.5580828880184854E-4,2.5607263894884266E-4,2.581045008063246E-4,2.5580871133099145E-4,2.560509783460782E-4,2.5607765444043935E-4,2.559613250483812E-4,2.5582096507126886E-4,2.5590897737707484E-4,2.5602940901184963E-4,2.5583417200467464E-4,2.5583323664955874E-4,2.56063397536553E-4,2.558588685280097E-4,2.558592557482337E-4,2.560231619269081E-4,2.5583426429050244E-4,2.5608071520047095E-4,2.558982858246217E-4,2.558076614200601E-4,2.559236336818262E-4,2.560017452638827E-4,2.5586012355716966E-4,2.559971566675946E-4,2.561228448805954E-4,2.5636056659471295E-4,2.558978436251895E-4,2.5582080991179814E-4,2.5591304776099094E-4,2.5584679090401107E-4,2.557690373924247E-4,2.558340927769948E-4,2.5609048225741564E-4,2.5595000050774474E-4,2.559977400410073E-4,2.5578176698886636E-4,2.558341578291236E-4,2.558207137134061E-4,2.559073067055553E-4,2.5595168135239565E-4,2.5589963502432064E-4,2.558590744800588E-4,2.5582134633837366E-4,2.5634548273227825E-4,2.558857183582287E-4,2.5583409919225947E-4,2.558843479954322E-4,2.5580792314607264E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539959E-4,2.55821705478801E-4,2.558077771243866E-4,2.5601242948243753E-4,2.559096596755836E-4,2.5580767019001897E-4,2.557816627775906E-4,2.5575594110598875E-4,2.5598718496251026E-4,2.5582020202291367E-4,2.5593648837176643E-4,2.5601159924283536E-4,2.558954517621166E-4,2.5583443803604887E-4,2.557819980903061E-4,2.5584743185131753E-4,2.55781860322954E-4,2.557952833413216E-4,2.5578200532957416E-4,2.559480435940784E-4,2.5587186526541923E-4,2.558080116274145E-4,2.558327914289875E-4]}}

{"value":"Strange, almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie.

(I have not read the book, but I don't think that's a problem, film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book). <br /><br />Or is it because I am subconsciously irritated about the fact that English-speaking actors try to behave as their French counterparts?","finished_norm":["strang","almost","all","review","be","highli","posit","about","thi","movi","be","it","becaus","it","from","and","have","chamberlain","and","curti","in","it","and","therefor","forgiv","the","by","time","veri","bad","act","and","childish","wai","of","storytel","br","br","mayb","it","becaus","some","peopl","get","sentiment","about","thi","film","becaus","thei","have","read","the","book","i","have","not","read","the","book","but","i","do","not","think","that","a","problem","film","maker","never","presum","that","the","viewer","have","read","the","book","br","br","or","be","it","becaus","i","be","subconsci","irrit","about","the","fact","that","englishspeak","actor","try","to","behav","a","their","french","counterpart"],"filtered":["strang","almost","review","highli","posit","thi","movi","becaus","chamberlain","curti","therefor","forgiv","time","veri","bad","act","childish","wai","storytel","br","br","mayb","becaus","peopl","get","sentiment","thi","film","becaus","thei","read","book","read","book","think","problem","film","maker","never","presum","viewer","read","book","br","br","becaus","subconsci","irrit","fact","englishspeak","actor","try","behav","french","counterpart"],"filtered2":["strang","almost","review","highli","posit","becaus","chamberlain","curti","therefor","forgiv","time","veri","bad","act","childish","wai","storytel","mayb","becaus","peopl","get","sentiment","becaus","read","book","read","book","think","problem","maker","never","presum","viewer","read","book","becaus","subconsci","irrit","fact","englishspeak","actor","try","behav","french","counterpart"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,9,12,15,21,22,23,33,36,41,42,97,131,145,151,163,167,176,279,417,509,763,896,899,958,1229,1311,1607,1649,2029,2572,2642,4408,5166,8008],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,9,12,15,21,22,23,33,36,41,42,97,131,145,151,163,167,176,279,417,509,763,896,899,958,1229,1311,1607,1649,2029,2572,2642,4408,5166,8008],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,5.191696066944709,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,2.0545557924622586,2.2512118082053005,7.03797064359777,8.400736460430558,2.4000574358028657,2.4609576687888097,2.5040471493269134,2.7910771187233068,3.1932880749197934,3.360519385990158,3.749984152751882,3.8844878351953436,4.197121957260614,3.969732115064953,4.3095999406873045,4.456830177669989,4.597282013139085,4.715065048795469,4.979216623837056,5.1994574154933035,5.3064295350454715,5.999576715605417,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7931824809238E-4,2.7907073007172223E-4,2.791396347907476E-4,2.7908351879528013E-4,2.791099307399218E-4,2.790691913599073E-4,2.7915598575282497E-4,2.790276704158133E-4,2.790707890504681E-4,2.793591784707359E-4,2.815758122415371E-4,2.790712500032459E-4,2.793355481124973E-4,2.7936465005730534E-4,2.7923774199117705E-4,2.7908461806486754E-4,2.791806339670202E-4,2.7931201732250355E-4,2.790990260003717E-4,2.790980055866414E-4,2.7934909666990095E-4,2.791259683574243E-4,2.791263907903876E-4,2.793052021448873E-4,2.790991266784182E-4,2.793679891544125E-4,2.7916897015427494E-4,2.7907010461631016E-4,2.791966230757027E-4,2.792818379095948E-4,2.7912733751547466E-4,2.792768320390159E-4,2.794139499914512E-4,2.7967328946259943E-4,2.79168487742446E-4,2.7908444879562255E-4,2.791850745004233E-4,2.791127924276101E-4,2.7902796822612904E-4,2.7909893956794523E-4,2.7937864440057754E-4,2.792253876280489E-4,2.792774684627978E-4,2.7904185541696215E-4,2.7909901053573525E-4,2.7908434384921405E-4,2.7917881136924045E-4,2.7922722132407647E-4,2.7917044204647334E-4,2.7912619303818476E-4,2.7908503400335134E-4,2.7965683391531715E-4,2.7915525983715E-4,2.7909894656659635E-4,2.7915376485734036E-4,2.7907039014296445E-4,0.9779431299389859,2.7911392978421516E-4,2.790854258030186E-4,2.7907023084246897E-4,2.792934937215173E-4,2.791813783118735E-4,2.7907011418378495E-4,2.790417417290004E-4,2.79013680999525E-4,2.7926595353457373E-4,2.7908378562699956E-4,2.79210646735692E-4,2.7929258798221554E-4,2.7916587836994216E-4,2.7909931622390545E-4,2.790421075341294E-4,2.7911349166089683E-4,2.7904195723859427E-4,2.790566009092307E-4,2.790421154317165E-4,2.7922325275805103E-4,2.791401469822881E-4,2.790704866705555E-4,2.7909751987893934E-4]}}

{"value":"I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago. I watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again.

HA! <br /><br />Final verdict: Don't bother with this \"horror\" flick. <br /><br />3 Stars (out of a possible 73)","finished_norm":["i","bui","bloodsuck","on","ebai","a","while","ago","i","watch","part","and","deem","it","just","too","dumb","to","review","again","the","excess","amount","of","wateri","blood","at","the","begin","be","just","plain","obsolet","not","to","mention","the","whiparound","wind","sound","my","friend","and","i","make","a","super","low","budget","movi","and","the","effect","still","exc","thi","crap","festbr","br","a","for","the","amount","of","mistak","in","thi","movi","there","be","wai","too","mani","to","count","i","know","on","of","the","actor","believ","it","or","not","he","be","my","theatr","teacher","ha","br","br","final","verdict","do","not","bother","with","thi","horror","flick","br","br","star","out","of","a","possibl"],"filtered":["bui","bloodsuck","ebai","ago","watch","part","deem","dumb","review","excess","amount","wateri","blood","begin","plain","obsolet","mention","whiparound","wind","sound","friend","make","super","low","budget","movi","effect","still","exc","thi","crap","festbr","br","amount","mistak","thi","movi","wai","mani","count","know","actor","believ","theatr","teacher","ha","br","br","final","verdict","bother","thi","horror","flick","br","br","star","possibl"],"filtered2":["bui","bloodsuck","ebai","ago","watch","part","deem","dumb","review","excess","amount","wateri","blood","begin","plain","obsolet","mention","whiparound","wind","sound","friend","make","super","low","budget","effect","still","exc","crap","festbr","amount","mistak","wai","mani","count","know","actor","believ","theatr","teacher","ha","final","verdict","bother","horror","flick","star","possibl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,26,33,41,50,61,64,83,91,100,106,147,156,161,176,178,217,256,257,285,313,347,354,402,420,496,586,592,610,771,885,1009,1114,1118,1342,1903,1919,4516,5129,5375,5511,8126],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,26,33,41,50,61,64,83,91,100,106,147,156,161,176,178,217,256,257,285,313,347,354,402,420,496,586,592,610,771,885,1009,1114,1118,1342,1903,1919,4516,5129,5375,5511,8126],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,2.292318797740072,2.0105926690411424,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.2844323215331563,2.3451551414151686,2.4323182980210873,2.5040471493269134,2.532833256045391,2.6113665294700725,2.748952192422636,2.7602659523229094,2.808171552082607,2.907069060519773,3.0151989841543516,3.185521045582134,3.084424928710765,3.3023374306074227,3.293679367864308,3.4572130107926293,3.5227672760500357,3.477726550625732,7.479663562575727,3.9323057095458362,4.096025840389245,4.364659717870332,4.34596758485818,4.484804029712395,5.626901430320244,4.8796870284900224,5.967828017290836,6.1754673820690815,6.600350576034347,6.255510089742618,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.731092965484181E-4,2.7286728059361897E-4,2.7293465363304766E-4,2.7287978503727245E-4,2.729056098721009E-4,2.72865776085753E-4,2.7295064113039643E-4,2.728251781086749E-4,2.7286733826132925E-4,2.731493170874147E-4,2.7531667741658653E-4,2.7286778896761047E-4,2.7312621200724255E-4,2.7315466704635647E-4,2.7303058001336335E-4,2.7288085987125046E-4,2.729747414406555E-4,2.7310320428201753E-4,2.728949475334678E-4,2.728939498024639E-4,2.731394593944327E-4,2.729212909901959E-4,2.729217040329177E-4,2.73096540598648E-4,2.728950459735469E-4,2.731579319188389E-4,2.729633369022277E-4,2.728666690414244E-4,2.7299037512823064E-4,2.7307369572578805E-4,2.7292262971329956E-4,2.7306880113045907E-4,2.7320287109470066E-4,2.734564457215511E-4,2.7296286521390754E-4,2.7288069436468313E-4,2.729790832656608E-4,2.729084079474749E-4,2.7282546929897986E-4,2.728948630223434E-4,2.7316835031006314E-4,2.730185002747631E-4,2.730694234072082E-4,2.7283904779213373E-4,2.7289493241259395E-4,2.7288059175112323E-4,2.729729593573118E-4,2.7302029320965226E-4,2.729647760758072E-4,2.729215106765388E-4,2.7288126656385827E-4,2.7344035596381676E-4,2.729499313510652E-4,2.728948698654219E-4,2.729484696030879E-4,2.728669482211208E-4,0.9784334310143911,2.7290952002183614E-4,2.7288164965423003E-4,2.7286679246170815E-4,2.730850924412429E-4,2.729754692395038E-4,2.728666783962242E-4,2.7283893663133604E-4,2.728114996624305E-4,2.73058164443755E-4,2.728800459376027E-4,2.7300408705697456E-4,2.730842068355754E-4,2.7296031384501626E-4,2.728952313056369E-4,2.7283929430500087E-4,2.729090916375394E-4,2.728391473503778E-4,2.7285346550758277E-4,2.72839302027033E-4,2.7301641286068504E-4,2.729351544391077E-4,2.7286704260300477E-4,2.7289347489153437E-4]}}
{"value":"I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it. I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap. I put it in my VCR and started up: Man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie (except for that awful sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face all the way. And that stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. I just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else.","finished_norm":["i","rememb","i","love","thi","movi","when","it","come","out","i","be","year","old","have","a","commodor","and","love","to","plai","rambo","on","it","i","be","therefor","realli","thrill","when","i","get","to","bui","thi","movi","realli","cheap","i","put","it","in","my","vcr","and","start","up","man","thi","movi","be","realli","bad","sylvest","stallon","sai","like","word","in","the","entir","movi","except","for","that","aw","sentiment","speech","at","the","end","and","have","the","same","express","on","hi","face","all","the","wai","and","that","stupid","love","thing","in","the","middl","it","just","so","amazingli","predict","i","just","end","up","fast","forward","the","entir","thing","and","go","to","exchang","the","movi","for","someth","els"],"filtered":["rememb","love","thi","movi","come","year","old","commodor","love","plai","rambo","therefor","realli","thrill","get","bui","thi","movi","realli","cheap","put","vcr","start","man","thi","movi","realli","bad","sylvest","stallon","sai","like","word","entir","movi","except","aw","sentiment","speech","end","express","hi","face","wai","stupid","love","thing","middl","amazingli","predict","end","fast","forward","entir","thing","go","exchang","movi","someth","els"],"filtered2":["rememb","love","come","year","old","commodor","love","plai","rambo","therefor","realli","thrill","get","bui","realli","cheap","put","vcr","start","man","realli","bad","sylvest","stallon","like","word","entir","except","aw","sentiment","speech","end","express","face","wai","stupid","love","thing","middl","amazingli","predict","end","fast","forward","entir","thing","go","exchang","someth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,9,13,24,29,33,34,40,45,53,54,57,67,71,136,138,159,196,198,232,251,258,290,337,347,351,542,554,699,846,1218,1229,1603,2116,2243,2642,2985,4475,4784],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,9,13,24,29,33,34,40,45,53,54,57,67,71,136,138,159,196,198,232,251,258,290,337,347,351,542,554,699,846,1218,1229,1603,2116,2243,2642,2985,4475,4784],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,3.3953824709201923,2.6420723132238515,2.6390769554676132,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,1.7003182735607676,5.4341679758188235,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,1.9214926742550966,2.346825985579986,2.2907365189289424,2.300267965194495,2.478925055209576,5.087945223472195,2.6102777977348763,2.6942272927333892,2.7061321952397077,2.8612813773965557,2.973659465713028,3.0151989841543516,3.0135689919434205,3.4471119148061256,3.439602492783994,3.5813614403160887,3.9201351739255808,4.297765483040301,4.3095999406873045,4.6973654716960676,5.850044981634453,5.039114765418124,5.3064295350454715,5.426230734858092,6.214688095222362,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727827E-4,2.50586206915813E-4,2.506480785860334E-4,2.5059769030472606E-4,2.5062140640359223E-4,2.505848252590655E-4,2.506627606186684E-4,2.505475423240712E-4,2.505862598746461E-4,2.5084521362060496E-4,2.5283559737960333E-4,2.505866737783476E-4,2.50823995193873E-4,2.508501267267695E-4,2.507361720640575E-4,2.5059867737275797E-4,2.506848930096248E-4,2.508028661725358E-4,2.5061161470196677E-4,2.506106984410386E-4,2.5083616086100724E-4,2.506358070744791E-4,2.506361863900523E-4,2.507967466145733E-4,2.5061170510388666E-4,2.5085312500494215E-4,2.5067441971278974E-4,2.5058564530012773E-4,2.506992501229476E-4,2.5077576714783404E-4,2.506370364836773E-4,2.507712722224065E-4,2.5089439465660805E-4,2.5112726355820117E-4,2.5067398654034505E-4,2.505985253806875E-4,2.506888803013837E-4,2.5062397600113836E-4,2.5054780973712945E-4,2.5061153709162793E-4,2.508626926787701E-4,2.5072507870075726E-4,2.50771843686929E-4,2.505602794736535E-4,2.506116008157932E-4,2.505984311460739E-4,2.5068325644292275E-4,2.5072672523291804E-4,2.5067574137014486E-4,2.506360088222565E-4,2.5059905085673793E-4,2.511124876152883E-4,2.506621087966179E-4,2.5061154337593244E-4,2.506607664081853E-4,2.5058590168330793E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867684E-4,2.5059940266573084E-4,2.505857586424849E-4,2.507862332604838E-4,2.5068556137980246E-4,2.505856538910581E-4,2.5056017738972984E-4,2.5053498079616115E-4,2.507615040780928E-4,2.505979299011482E-4,2.507118423993318E-4,2.5078541996925827E-4,2.506716435043771E-4,2.506118753026197E-4,2.505605058574259E-4,2.506246038642504E-4,2.505603709024342E-4,2.505735199054815E-4,2.5056051294891277E-4,2.507231617352092E-4,2.5064853849859865E-4,2.50585988358406E-4,2.5061026230912783E-4]}}
