{"value":"All the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place: dialog riddled with biological techno-babble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood acting, a horrific late-'80s Casio score, and an overall look that suggests anything on the Sci-Fi Channel's programming schedule, circa 1993. Though \"Metamorphosis\" starts off with a lot of promise, the film unravels into bland idiocy and MST3K-style cheese as Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects. But when he tests his vague experiment on himself, he transforms into a vaguely-defined creature (that bears more than a passing resemblance to 'Dr. Freudstein' from \"House by the Cemetery\"). The FX work is fairly good for such an obviously low-budget production (though I suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason), but overall, \"Metamorphosis\" leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts, in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise. I can't help but agree with one character's closing remark: \"(It was) A nightmare...from the past!\"","finished_norm":["all","the","elem","for","a","bad","night","at","the","movi","be","in","place","dialog","riddl","with","biolog","technobabbl","chintzi","set","balsawood","act","a","horrif","late","casio","score","and","a","overal","look","that","suggest","anyth","on","the","scifi","channel","programm","schedul","circa","though","metamorphosi","start","off","with","a","lot","of","promis","the","film","unravel","into","bland","idioci","and","mstkstyl","chees","a","clark","kent","wannab","doctor","peter","houseman","gene","lebrock","be","pressur","into","releas","inform","on","hi","secret","project","but","when","he","test","hi","vagu","experi","on","himself","he","transform","into","a","vaguelydefin","creatur","that","bear","much","than","a","pass","resembl","to","dr","freudstein","from","hous","by","the","cemeteri","the","fx","work","be","fairli","good","for","such","a","obvious","lowbudget","product","though","i","suspect","much","of","it","be","keep","in","shadow","for","a","reason","but","overal","metamorphosi","leav","a","bad","retro","aftertast","in","your","gut","in","spite","of","it","hope","to","swai","u","otherwis","i","ca","not","help","but","agre","with","on","charact","close","remark","it","be","a","nightmarefrom","the","past"],"filtered":["elem","bad","night","movi","place","dialog","riddl","biolog","technobabbl","chintzi","set","balsawood","act","horrif","late","casio","score","overal","look","suggest","anyth","scifi","channel","programm","schedul","circa","though","metamorphosi","start","lot","promis","film","unravel","bland","idioci","mstkstyl","chees","clark","kent","wannab","doctor","peter","houseman","gene","lebrock","pressur","releas","inform","hi","secret","project","test","hi","vagu","experi","transform","vaguelydefin","creatur","bear","much","pass","resembl","dr","freudstein","hous","cemeteri","fx","work","fairli","good","obvious","lowbudget","product","though","suspect","much","keep","shadow","reason","overal","metamorphosi","leav","bad","retro","aftertast","gut","spite","hope","swai","u","otherwis","ca","help","agre","charact","close","remark","nightmarefrom","past"],"filtered2":["elem","bad","night","place","dialog","riddl","biolog","technobabbl","chintzi","set","balsawood","act","horrif","late","casio","score","overal","look","suggest","anyth","scifi","channel","programm","schedul","circa","though","metamorphosi","start","lot","promis","unravel","bland","idioci","mstkstyl","chees","clark","kent","wannab","doctor","peter","houseman","gene","lebrock","pressur","releas","inform","secret","project","test","vagu","experi","transform","vaguelydefin","creatur","bear","pass","resembl","dr","freudstein","hous","cemeteri","fx","work","fairli","good","obvious","lowbudget","product","though","suspect","keep","shadow","reason","overal","metamorphosi","leav","bad","retro","aftertast","gut","spite","hope","swai","u","otherwis","ca","help","agre","charact","close","remark","nightmarefrom","past"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,10,16,21,48,71,72,74,81,86,95,104,109,112,134,150,164,181,185,190,210,213,295,327,333,341,412,432,440,479,487,518,525,622,627,646,660,683,693,728,739,760,761,781,798,819,977,1028,1044,1053,1222,1229,1306,1507,1529,1768,1773,1846,1862,1920,2093,2106,2149,2193,2371,3384,4396,4540,4605,4878,4926,4994,6139,6229,6496,7096,7799],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,10,16,21,48,71,72,74,81,86,95,104,109,112,134,150,164,181,185,190,210,213,295,327,333,341,412,432,440,479,487,518,525,622,627,646,660,683,693,728,739,760,761,781,798,819,977,1028,1044,1053,1222,1229,1306,1507,1529,1768,1773,1846,1862,1920,2093,2106,2149,2193,2371,3384,4396,4540,4605,4878,4926,4994,6139,6229,6496,7096,7799],"values":[0.6786144649922705,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.6955116224012472,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,1.949757232424728,4.062224798544638,2.0323326556775485,2.0728240170322856,2.125691139326857,2.2466628996789315,2.2443961816702407,2.332712011146513,2.3930275298746078,2.4442286541160034,2.518833027372001,2.558331832813986,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.7910771187233068,2.9674191958529437,2.948928684455311,2.933776879434709,6.214828893870928,3.235085203598255,3.212973749990824,3.360519385990158,3.3220965805878846,3.4101163271295305,3.4149707055943286,3.4933926673701317,3.477726550625732,3.5900195030592035,3.6405503117064195,3.6105180246075443,3.8463152616903136,3.7740817043309423,4.004218291136122,3.850067611308864,3.9405024767500145,3.9363956947973615,3.9282323841582003,3.835141961092188,4.035401218572811,4.086456389373095,4.125296222689358,4.067587905068712,

{"value":"I just saw this movie on Flix after timer-taping it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a major hard for Wrangler Jane so I was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never have guessed it was her in a million years. What the hell is she doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie lacks what it's pushing. No sex, no gore, no tease. It's also a remake of the Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or thereabouts). Most of the action is tedious; the main character spends enormous amounts of time running around the crazed doctor's house and basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being roughed up by the cop, all of it boring and time-filling. Now if the Italians would have made this, half the film would have been the Slingblade/Uncle Ernest/Jack Elam henchman fondling the unconscious nude girls.

{"value":"Let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a movie. It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up.<br /><br />The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it. This film takes us to where no movie I've seen has done before: to a realm where the Film Theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The large movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner.<br /><br />Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the Art of film making for sales. This is very scary. The industry is spoiling the art in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture.

{"value":"This is a truly awful film. What they have done is taken a TV show, which was never aimed at young children & given it the George Lucas treatment (i.e. ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience).<br /><br />OK so the Thunderbirds TV show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows, in fact it was pretty formulaic, but it was always enjoyable to watch (especially when the models got blown up) and the voice cast wasn't too bad.<br /><br />This suffers from bad casting & bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played) & after this travesty I wouldn't let Frakes direct traffic.<br /><br />The whole point of Thunderbirds was that it was about the whole Tracy family & how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters.<br /><br />Avoid this rubbish like the plague.<br /><br />I only give it 1 out of 10

{"value":"I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations. I think I paid about 50$ for this movie. As an eternal fan of horror, from cheesy 80s American slashers to European zombie films, I told myself this was going to be great! I can't tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it was gonna be pretty much gorier than it actually is. After all I've had heard about this film, I was almost scared to watch it. The murders are boring. The acting... forget it, there's no acting! The story, even if we don't care, is incredibly bad. It seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case it doesn't help the movie. Why? There's no atmosphere, and this is the worst thing about this flick. It's just bad film-making from point A to B. Though it's extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers, don't make any effort to get your hands on it.

{"value":"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic). The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity. The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was way off. The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called \"David Lynch-esquire\" and \"irreverently funny\"... it is neither. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative.

{"value":"I'm not sure this is a spoiler; perhaps it is a public service. If you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits, you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice-over, which states the U.S. has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 to end WWII. Here are just a few of the problems with this close: <br /><br />1)The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLY movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion.<br /><br />2)The average person will really kick themselves that they did not \"watch\" one of these UNHOLY fill-in-the-blanks flicks created in their own head for free, instead of shelling out time and money to see this UNHOLY from the video store (or on cable).<br /><br />3)This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII, leading them to the conclusion that George W.

{"value":"All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and gets eaten. Then they start rolling the title credits: You see \"Slugs!\" in big letters, followed shortly thereafter by \"The Movie.\" WHEW! I was worried I had accidentally tuned into \"Slugs: The Musical\" or \"Slugs: The Game Show.\" Anyway, from there the movie deteriorates into a kill-fest. You see a guy cut his hand off because he had slugs in his gardening glove, two people get attacked by slugs while having sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passageway get stung to death by killer slugs. It's a pretty silly movie, falling in the \"so-bad-it's-good\" category. It also is shot so poorly with such grainy film that you're shocked to learn it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I'm VERY surprised it has received as high a score as it has here, because most people here don't give those types of movie any love.

{"value":"I saw this last week after picking up the DVD cheap. I had wanted to see it for ages, finding the plot outline very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp's in The Ninth Gate (of which this is almost a complete rip-off), but I guess TV budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability.<br /><br />I also the thought the direction was confused and dull, serving only to remind me that Carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness. As for the story - well, I was disappointed there as well! There was no way it could meet my expectation I guess, but I thought the payoff and explanation was poor, and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the least.<br /><br />This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN, and you can tell he does love his cinema, but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise.<br /><br />I took the DVD back to

{"value":"From around the time Europe began fighting World War II, until the war's end, Hollywood (with significant prodding from the government) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army, by making the life of a serviceman appear \"cool.\" This is by far the sloppiest, implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work, you get the best food, and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am far too young to have participated in WWII, but I think that there was more to it than that. There is the barest cat's whisker of a plot, and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day's leading acts.<br /><br />I think that by 1943, even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie. While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment, I can't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war, were amused or repulsed by this

{"value":"Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematography effects. Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.<br /><br />One of the best scenes was in the \"deleted scenes\" section, the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom. I don't understand why they'd cut that. The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV, and completely not needed or helpful to a movie. Speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used. It's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away.<br /><br />Another movie with Jerry Springer in it?

{"value":"I wonder who, how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit Broadway in many many years? He's an Academy Award winning director. Yes, he won for Ghandi you moron! Jeremy Irons is an Academy winning actor do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? \"Oh what a lovely war\" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings. Every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical. I felt nothing. But when I saw it on stage I felt everything. The film should have been cast with stars, unknown, newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well Michael Douglas was in it. True I forgot I'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right.

{"value":"this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush. I realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by. However if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding, this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing. The plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add, many times before. There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others. i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space. In my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film. what i've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review, than for God's sake don't waste more time watching this movie.

{"value":"Every Christmas eve I make my kids endure yet another showing of It's A Wonderful Life. I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa. So sue me. I admit it. I like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. I like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. What would the Christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of Santa in all his guises, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will make no one forget Bedford Falls, but I do not believe a Christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed. \"Fred\" is a perfectly OK holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince. Paul Giamatti was a top-notch Santa, which helped a lot. Not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice.

{"value":"This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so. It did not happen here, I am afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit his father's skills, unfortunately (neither did his sister, who can however make movies which one might watch).<br /><br />I do wonder how this movie came to get such rave reviews. <br /><br />Let's see: the lead male actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same pitch whatever he says, the lead female actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps one single connecting element, the movie within the movie idea must be more stale than paleolithic rocks... Would that be enough?<br /><br />I regretted every single moment I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is far superior entertainment to this unbelievably lame movie. It's as if a François Truffaut plot were directed by Dick Cheney...<br /><br />Brazil, some other classic SF movies?

{"value":"This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen. To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously WTF??? How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? WRONG!

{"value":"Though I never like to be the sort of person who negates another's personal taste; if you like something, that's fine. But, this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. I don't like Ani Difranco too much, but she's a great guitarist and songwriter, that I can admit. But I can't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film. Many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face. Maybe, but everything is portrayed too far-fetched. There seems to be an attempt at a \"Naked Gun\" - esque kind of comedy, but the timing is off; there is too much space between each actors line, as if they're holding for laughter (there wasn't any). Whoever wrote the script was all over the place. They tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film, almost never fully developing any of them (especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher). I did not laugh once throughout this entire movie.

{"value":"\"A young woman unwittingly becomes part of a kidnapping plot involving the son of a movie producer she is babysitting. The kidnappers happen to be former business partners of the son's father and are looking to exact some revenge on him. Our babysitter must bide her time and wait to see what will become of the son and herself, while the kidnappers begin to argue amongst themselves, placing the kidnap victims in great peril,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />That acclaimed director René Clément could be responsible for this haphazard crime thriller is the real shocker. Despite beginning with the appearance of having been edited in a washing machine, the film develops a linear storyline. Once you've figured out what is going on, the engaging Maria Schneider (as Michelle) and endearing John Whittington (as Boots) can get you through the film.

{"value":"I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and despite the fact that I didn't pay a dime to see this film I still felt ripped off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a Benjamin on your seat. The acting is torpid at best; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter. And if you can't spot the \"mole\" within the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recycled story lines. If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent In the Line of Fire. If you see and buy into this one, you'll start to fear for the president's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210.

{"value":"This is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if Art Bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that Carl Kolchak exemplified. Of course there probably wouldn't be an X-Files if this show hadn't prepped this audience for it so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a plausible(enough) guy to deliver heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he is the main attraction, there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who's a distraction. In fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show. Something I'm noticing as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way. There's a lot of throwaway humor to this show. Sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax. There's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present MAD MEN show in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men but the people that worked under him on The Sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio-comic

{"value":"For anyone craving a remake of 1989's Slaves of New York. What are there, seven of you? Here it is... was.<br /><br />This undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (Well they're club-kids, ya big jerk!) that are in holding patterns. The big question seems to be, just how long can a young adult remain juvenile? It took three people to write this 'story'? Good god, it was easier to come up with Citizen Kane. Rather than take viewers back, this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s.<br /><br />The idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-somethings could imagine it. The odd sidebar about library work is not the sub-plot one expects from the equivalent of Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. Her \"I'm serious about graduate school!\" while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical. Posey's shtick is always amusing, but there are projects that are beneath her.

{"value":"Well it's not often that we in the UK have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community, the last example that I can remember was the underrated Babylon way back in 1980. So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a film that has been touted as the British version of La Haine! Well La Haine it is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late, but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.<br /><br />The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London, but I'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging.

{"value":"First of all, if you'r a fan of the comic, well, you'll be VERY disappointed I'm sure ! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic, now suddenly he becomes croatian, pfff! chicken producers, it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks croatian... Lol ). The striking N.Y. Winch building becomes a common average-small yacht in H.K. The good looking Largo becomes some unshaved Tzigan/Turkish looking guy. Freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes some fat, out of shape, sad, average guy. Simon, Largo's good buddy, does not exist at all !? He gave some pepper ! Largo doesn't throw knifes at all, but just some snake stares... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV-film. French directors and producers, if you don't have the money, the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic, please stick to some romance shooted in Paris.

{"value":"I rented this by mistake. I thought, after a cursory examination of the box, that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story. Instead, it's a \"Christian\" story, and I suppose is fairly typical example. If you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc., but I found it rather painful. <br /><br />I have to admit that I'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. It paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this \"highly moral\" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination were widespread, for instance). And at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a

{"value":"I remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid, and there were parts of it (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I have seen it once as an adult, and I then understood those parts. The only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a \"kids movie\"? Not hardly. It contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids. Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children? Maybe, but then why wouldn't it focus more on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a film has a 7-year-old as its main character, in order to do well with it's audience, it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd, otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds wouldn't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them). I'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office, and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market.","finished_norm":["i","rememb","watch","thi","movi","sever","time","a","a","veri","young","kid","and","there","be","part","of","it","mani","in","fact","that","i","do","not","understand","i","think","i","have","see","it","onc","a","a","adult","and","i","then","understand","that","part","the","onli","problem","with","view","it","a","a","adult","be","that","it","be","not","entertain","to","me","at","all","so","what","kind","of","movi","be","thi","be","it","a","kid","movi","not","hardli","it","contain","languag","and","subject","matt","not","suitabl","for","kid","be","it","a","hyperbol","of","what","everi","parent","feel","like","thei","be","go","through","with","their","own","child","mayb","but","then","why","would","not","it","focu","much","on","john","ritter","charact","instead","of","junior","when","a","film","have","a","yearold","a","it","main","charact","in","order","to","do","good","with","it","audienc","it","should","be","a","movi","for","the","seven","and","under","crowd","otherwis","peopl","old","than","that","will","have","no","wai","to","relat","even","yearold","would","not","want","to","see","a","movi","about","a","kid","who","be","whole","year","young","than","them","i","be","pretti","sure","thi","film","do","not","do","good","in","the","box","offic","and","the","reason","have","to","be","becaus","it","be","unabl","to","find","a","nich","in","the","market"],"filtered":["rememb","watch","thi","movi","sever","time","veri","young","kid","part","mani","fact","understand","think","see","onc","adult","understand","part","onli","problem","view","adult","entertain","kind","movi","thi","kid","movi","hardli","contain","languag","subject","matt","suitabl","kid","hyperbol","everi","parent","feel","like","thei","go","child","mayb","focu","much","john","ritter","charact","instead","junior","film","yearold","main","charact","order","good","audienc","movi","seven","crowd","otherwis","peopl","old","wai","relat","even","yearold","want","see","movi","kid","whole","year","young","pretti","sure","thi","film","good","box","offic","reason","becaus","unabl","find","nich","market"],"filtered2":["rememb","watch","sever","time","veri","young","kid","part","mani","fact","understand","think","see","onc","adult","understand","part","onli","problem","view","adult","entertain","kind","kid","hardli","contain","languag","subject","matt","suitabl","kid","hyperbol","everi","parent","feel","like","go","child","mayb","focu","john","ritter","charact","instead","junior","yearold","main","charact","order","good","audienc","seven","crowd","otherwis","peopl","old","wai","relat","even","yearold","want","see","kid","whole","year","young","pretti","sure","good","box","offic","reason","becaus","unabl","find","nich","market"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,15,22,23,33,37,38,43,50,57,61,67,78,85,95,97,111,114,119,122,135,152,163,167,168,179,180,195,212,236,290,291,312,316,408,439,550,587,619,627,654,665,670,711,734,903,1094,1241,1500,1508,1646,1720,2767,3456,5582,8524],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,15,22,23,33,37,38,43,50,57,61,67,78,85,95,97,111,114,119,122,135,152,163,167,168,179,180,195,212,236,290,291,312,316,408,439,550,587,619,627,654,665,670,711,734,903,1094,1241,1500,1508,1646,1720,2767,3456,5582,8524],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,3.7637034094785053,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.1183455303375887,9.77322967838673,2.1653408989309972,2.2489347673732487,4.732488142874176,2.3131195476980753,2.4000574358028657,2.4609576687888097,2.4894767118610357,2.507968722980095,2.7097314792693545,2.51289241584188,5.196758667886523,2.617923930016232,2.8612813773965557,3.016831637578237,2.8824835850471584,2.878207028279898,3.130944944345658,3.2872346624216657,3.4751392270607813,3.6105180246075443,3.5929222627171646,3.477726550625732,3.634471265630037,3.5929222627171646,3.7264536553416874,3.6375061693251913,7.5833136983049,3.948766986599908,4.218628162481577,4.3215761317340196,4.520909034354511,4.751432692966343,9.55920713986608,4.724033718778229,5.290429193699031,5.719991853386255,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.154044922864072E-5,6.112546759250943E-5,6.160065981690381E-5,6.124473054822794E-5,6.12457339741841E-5,6.11601246773244E-5,6.134202345744127E-5,6.11342692604369

{"value":"Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary.<br /><br />This film is ... well ... I guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits (apart from the acting, plot, story, sets, dialogue and sound). I wrongly assumed it was about zombies. <br /><br />Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness; you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home-made amateur torture videos or something along those lines. <br /><br />I'm so taken aback I'm writing this review on my mobile so I don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /><br />I worst film I've ever seen and I can say (with hand on

{"value":"This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers, eating pizza, and laugh at. Unfortunately for me I found myself watching this one alone. My friends and I rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one. It was due back and I figured that it was a waste not to watch it. So I did, and I was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is.<br /><br />Now, I love bad movies quite a bit, and I probably would have liked this one if the \"hero\" wasn't so utterly loathsome. The entire movie I was hoping that he'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him! He does very little heroic things in the movie. He's a beefy, disgusting, stupid thing. He has less redeeming qualities than the villains do. And what was it with all the naked chicks? I mean, I love naked chicks just as much as the next guy, but this movie went a tad overboard in that department.<br /><br />Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting \"hero\"

{"value":"An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus.(but done several times by now) Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit. The editing could have been tighter. I am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits. Maybe the movie was rushed to market. The lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is the audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialog, but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful in the recording, or the sound mixing could have been better. Also too much background noise got through. The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes. The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter.<br /><br />Also the acting was a bit flat. I am sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie, in my experience it is a red flag.<br /><br />But it was a good effort so I gave it a

{"value":"Where to begin, there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie I am not sure where to start. Okay, the two stooges who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, first they couldn't make up their so-called minds for a name. My guess they split the difference, that's why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE, but the end screen says HEAD THAT WOULDN'T DIE. Neither one knows anything about the Medical profession. After all Doctors take oaths to \"do no harm\". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered \"harm\". Plus, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would spell death for Jan in the pan. Plus who keeps a patch work monster. What medical school did Bill graduate from, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name, that bugs the hell out of me. Plus, the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated? All and all a disaster of a movie, it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable, except on MST3K.

{"value":"I am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first movie since \"Beverly Hills Cop\" so at the time he was hot. Considering that one made over two hundred million and it was R and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular. I have never been a big Eddie Murphy fan, so that is probably another reason I didn't care for it much at all. This one has Eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects. I had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better stuff. Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" type scenes.
