{"value":"This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. I found them pretty bad: it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.<br /><br />Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story. The archaeologists are looking for \"the set\". They do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt.<br /><br />If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.<br /><br />The action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. It made the movie look short, and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie.","finished_norm":["thi","must","have","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","i","have","to","disagre","with","anoth","comment","who","sai","the","special","effect","be","okai","i","find","them","pretti","bad","it","just","be","not","realist","and","thei","be","so","fake","that","it","just","distract","from","the","actual","storybr","br","mayb","that","distract","be","the","reason","that","i","do","not","fulli","understand","the","stori","the","archaeologist","be","look","for","the","set","thei","do","not","bother","to","tell","what","set","or","what","be","so","special","about","it","that","conjur","make","it","unclear","why","thei","search","for","it","in","california","while","the","intro","of","the","movi","take","place","in","ancient","egyptbr","br","if","you","re","shoot","a","movi","that","take","place","in","the","desert","take","the","effort","to","actual","go","to","the","desert","the","begin","the","ancient","ceremoni","look","like","it","be","shoot","insid","a","studio","instead","of","a","desertbr","br","the","actionlevel","be","constant","throughout","the","movi","no","up","and","down","no","climax","it","make","the","movi","look","short","and","that","certainli","a","pro","for","thi","particular","movi"],"filtered":["thi","must","wrong","movi","ever","seenbr","br","disagre","anoth","comment","sai","special","effect","okai","find","pretti","bad","realist","thei","fake","distract","actual","storybr","br","mayb","distract","reason","fulli","understand","stori","archaeologist","look","set","thei","bother","tell","set","special","conjur","make","unclear","thei","search","california","intro","movi","take","place","ancient","egyptbr","br","re","shoot","movi","take","place","desert","take","effort","actual","go","desert","begin","ancient","ceremoni","look","like","shoot","insid","studio","instead","desertbr","br","actionlevel","constant","throughout","movi","climax","make","movi","look","short","certainli","pro","thi","particular","movi"],"filtered2":["must","wrong","ever","seenbr","disagre","anoth","comment","special","effect","okai","find","pretti","bad","realist","fake","distract","actual","storybr","mayb","distract","reason","fulli","understand","stori","archaeologist","look","set","bother","tell","set","special","conjur","make","unclear","search","california","intro","take","place","ancient","egyptbr","re","shoot","take","place","desert","take","effort","actual","go","desert","begin","ancient","ceremoni","look","like","shoot","insid","studio","instead","desertbr","actionlevel","constant","throughout","climax","make","look","short","certainli","pro","particular"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,9,16,17,25,31,38,39,44,52,68,73,78,90,95,106,109,117,141,147,152,163,164,191,203,212,272,280,389,401,438,496,639,832,890,932,959,1089,1136,1187,1356,1367,1458,1723,1930,2546,2903,2933,3347,3552,4460,4801,6057],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,9,16,17,25,31,38,39,44,52,68,73,78,90,95,106,109,117,141,147,152,163,164,191,203,212,272,280,389,401,438,496,639,832,890,932,959,1089,1136,1187,1356,1367,1458,1723,1930,2546,2903,2933,3347,3552,4460,4801,6057],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,3.589841616087325,1.2770536940105968,1.2796387880827016,4.221200943435452,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,3.4244306149452273,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979,2.0064197866819473,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.159084361316692,4.251382278653714,4.5594602370234405,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.4000574358028657,4.7860550597492155,2.5460113484259455,5.139521057275218,2.5983793339432615,2.8028805344481915,2.8028805344481915,3.0914425013694116,3.0879275592619675,3.1797351085150902,3.293679367864308,3.616452760127359,3.7987743169213135,3.9161110236258554,4.058285512406398,4.067587905068712,4.2078172463773615,4.181290492043933,8.872703292652895,8.793222635353867,4.416284083275639,4.4919214974812585,9.71770588317436,4.848596441419991,5.214056214914456,5.373120909544144,5.373120909544144,5.541743621979936,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.101359409915359,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7809600260830543E-4,1.7793818273669398E-4,1.779821170485518E-4,1.7794633694988873E-4,1.779631774599303E-4,1.7793720163923518E-4,1.779925425793027E-4,1.779107274857627E-4,1.779382203421099E-4,1.7812210021138082E-4,1.7953544723228762E-4,1.7793851425003632E-4,1.7810703326759454E-4,1.781255889476256E-4,1.7804467114354168E-4,1.7794703785475494E-4,1.7800825851784088E-4,1.780920298094792E-4,1.7795622449306682E-4,1.7795557386745384E-4,1.7811567195816049E-4,1.7797340319916527E-4,1.7797367254648733E-4,1.780876843866548

{"value":"This movie blows - let's get that straight right now. There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in \"12 Monkeys\" and acts in a similar manner. I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he's OK in this movie. There were two plot lines in this movie-= one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache. Let's face it- this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go. THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene. But overall- Don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf -an American fetish that has catapulted

{"value":"I usually come on this website prior to going to the movies, as I like to see what other people think of the movie. I read many reviews which said 'thriller not a horror movie'. This prompted me to give this film a try. I really must take issue with these 'thriller/horror' statements, as it was neither! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish....well you must be easily pleased! At the end of the movie, the people behind me said out loud \"what a waste of time\" and I turned to them and replied \" I couldn't have summed it up better\". I kept waiting for something to happen...but it didn't. There was the potential for a lot of good scares (or thrills if you like) but none happened. Williams acted the part quite well but I felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere.

{"value":"Two films are useful for scaring people to God, this and 'Event Horizon'. One has a significant and poignant message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie can get. Too bad Paul Anderson went on to the accursed Resident Evil movies, he really had something going.<br /><br />Thief in the Night is hampered by many obvious independent film attributes (acting, storytelling, dialog, and persuasion) and it's obvious what the film's intentions are from the start. The Christian film industry hasn't learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck with The Omega Code, Left Behind, and the other Tribulation movies. Their underlying element is that they are so concerned with selling their message: \"Get saved, folks!\" that everything else becomes second to whacking the audience over the head with a Bible.<br /><br />Overall, I can't believe I'm even writing this much about a movie this ineffective.

{"value":"This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie, A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary.

They throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the EXTREMELY weak and far fetched story.

{"value":"Basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game'. Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand, only to have it replaced by an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma ( and looked like one of the bad guys ) while Mick Ford ( who played the irritating Chico Barnes ) made me think of a horse's arse whenever he was on screen. For six weeks, this less-than dynamic duo charged about the countryside, foiling nefarious plots to fix races, usually by the same methods - blackmail, kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire Television threw money at the show, but to no avail.

{"value":"OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with. Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list. I don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best. Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. How does that scare someone? I can make that noise easily. Now don't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.","finished_norm":["okai","when","i","see","the","preview","for","thi","movi","i","think","it","look","realli","scari","and","be","quit","excit","to","see","it","a","be","the","group","i","be","with","now","live","in","america","especi","dure","thi","elect","i","see","some","veri","deceiv","thing","but","i","have","to","sai","thi","preview","be","toward","the","top","of","list","i","do","not","see","how","so","mani","peopl","can","be","scare","by","thi","movi","i","onli","realli","notic","two","real","jump","scene","and","onli","jump","at","on","the","whole","movi","be","extrem","predict","and","perhap","that","mess","up","some","of","the","jump","scene","for","me","a","for","the","sound","effect","so","mani","to","be","so","frighten","of","i","think","thei","be","comic","at","well","oh","and","the","uhh","catboi","where","do","that","come","from","and","why","the","wrong","nois","in","the","whole","movi","have","to","be","the","weird","groan","how","doe","that","scare","someon","i","can","make","that","nois","easili","now","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","have","alwai","love","all","that","realli","bad","scari","movi","that","your","just","laugh","the","whole","wai","through","but","i","do","not","even","think","thi","on","have","that","go","for","it","it","be","just","plain","out","bad"],"filtered":["okai","see","preview","thi","movi","think","look","realli","scari","quit","excit","see","group","live","america","especi","dure","thi","elect","see","veri","deceiv","thing","sai","thi","preview","toward","top","list","see","mani","peopl","scare","thi","movi","onli","realli","notic","two","real","jump","scene","onli","jump","whole","movi","extrem","predict","perhap","mess","jump","scene","sound","effect","mani","frighten","think","thei","comic","well","oh","uhh","catboi","come","wrong","nois","whole","movi","weird","groan","doe","scare","someon","make","nois","easili","get","wrong","alwai","love","realli","bad","scari","movi","laugh","whole","wai","even","think","thi","go","plain","bad"],"filtered2":["okai","see","preview","think","look","realli","scari","quit","excit","see","group","live","america","especi","dure","elect","see","veri","deceiv","thing","preview","toward","top","list","see","mani","peopl","scare","onli","realli","notic","two","real","jump","scene","onli","jump","whole","extrem","predict","perhap","mess","jump","scene","sound","effect","mani","frighten","think","comic","well","oh","uhh","catboi","come","wrong","nois","whole","weird","groan","doe","scare","someon","make","nois","easili","get","wrong","alwai","love","realli","bad","scari","laugh","whole","wai","even","think","go","plain","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,9,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,20,23,25,29,33,34,47,50,54,80,106,111,116,120,133,139,178,191,197,234,239,267,318,329,337,364,396,407,410,480,524,563,583,586,601,623,625,674,688,808,1501,1710,1974,3328,4286,5874],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,9,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,20,23,25,29,33,34,47,50,54,80,106,111,116,120,133,139,178,191,197,234,239,267,318,329,337,364,396,407,410,480,524,563,583,586,601,623,625,674,688,808,1501,1710,1974,3328,4286,5874],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.6228008218775787,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.982619630677639,3.200185830788664,3.3953824709201923,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.7064694353107215,3.43598877114071,1.8113893252729412,1.9951803900462557,2.159084361316692,6.355036591012766,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.532833256045391,2.5460113484259455,2.558331832813986,2.673149229007135,2.6593400337329487,2.7085302779237206,2.902686292364678,2.951986790814132,2.973659465713028,2.9878441007049847,6.583053029006414,3.120015873813468,3.2070272508030975,3.43462735814388,3.4028786598293,3.459754308221302,3.4986697244709752,3.4572130107926293,3.555828138310924,7.215127625420226,3.6194333882654965,10.921650935119258,3.6016814428070463,3.90413483257914,9.308880853958067,4.688631791727313,9.981825327200493,5.583416318380505,5.999576715605417,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5360363215407877E-4,1.5346751621014645E-4,1.535054085254074E-4,1.5347454902809703E-4,1.5348907357368944E-4,1.534666700365605E-4,1.5351440030156755E-4,1.5344383669907945E-4,1.5346754864393713E-4,1.536261407256592E-4,1.548451194378479E-4,1.5346780213264184E-4,1.5361314583943412E-4,1.5362914967898198E-4,1.5355935996763984E-4,1.5347515354213252E-4,1.5352795493056998E-4,1.5360020570811373E-4,1.5348307680257254E-4,1.5348251565321566E-4,1.

{"value":"This is the sorriest collection of clichés, strung together on a straight line, with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting I've seen in a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence. Was this movie good? It wasn't a movie at all!<br /><br />Even if it doesn't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy, the movie does offer some laughs. The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be funny talking Korean, the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever his name was.<br /><br />Bottom line: any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not on the director/writer.

{"value":"Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to \"tone it down\" or make it \"realistic,\" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production

{"value":"\"The Rainmaker\" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, and Burt Lancaster being the principle players. Not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. She is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. Lancaster over acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems like the 1950's was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn't make too many of them.

{"value":"This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull, boring filmstrip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford's 8th grade Social Studies class -- way back in 67.<br /><br />What a waste, will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.<br /><br />Every time a scene had potential, all we were left with were a few clichés, combined with black and white footage that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shameful.<br /><br />Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this dull fest. The other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the Captain set a new low standard for line delivery.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to accept all the

{"value":"Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll find out.<br /><br />In truth, Martin, the lead, is mis-cast. He's not doing the great slapstick he's known for, from movies like \"The Jerk\", but instead plays a sort of in-between character that doesn't work. Hawn, with no one to play off of, is terrible. Cleese is the only even partially funny member.<br /><br />To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can't say how much of it may have been changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense. They blunder through New York, not doing anything right, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who don't live in New York aren't very bright, a theme repeated throughout the movie.<br /><br />In

{"value":"The word in the summary sums it up d'oh ;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it, they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them (ooooh).<br /><br />From there out everything is screaming, crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight ;), well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie (very annoying) The movie is shot, with a cheap camera trying to make it seem \"real\" or \"shocking\" I guess, it's just embarrassing and useless though. In lack of anything better to compare it with, \"Blair witch style\".<br /><br />The screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying, you literally

{"value":"\"Little Man\", now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. It's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist. He and his partner Tracy Morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home. He then goes through all sorts of \"Home Alone\" or \"Child's Play\" like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. I was surprised by how low the humor was in this film. The jokes have been done in other places so many times, that they aren't cute or funny. I almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use CGI and used the small actor who Marlon's face was pasted over. In watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI) this actor was funny in a Mini-me like way, but they chose a different route.

{"value":"Rebar is an astronaut who goes on the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course this being a horror movie things turn ugly and he returns to earth as the only survivor. Stricken with some bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what apparently is the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring town to stalk more victims.<br /><br />I liked the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good, but the space scenes are just pasted together out of stock NASA footage and the hospital looks curiously like a warehouse. A very weak script, little character development and overall poor acting keep this one from rising above being anything other than a mediocre slasher flick with the novelty of having a living candle

{"value":"I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it's VERY close. Ever seen a bad teen soap opera. Well this is like one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) girl: I wanna go somewhere else.<br /><br />guy: all we need is here.<br /><br />girl: but I wanna take myself somewhere different.<br /><br />guy: I'll take YOU somewhere else.<br /><br />... Proceeding this line they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've EVER read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the personalities of the characters and the events. Additionally, they just get rid of things. Also, the movie ends about before the book finishes. It is an AWFUL movie. So, if you haven't read the book, don't watch it. If you HAVE read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like stupid teen soap operas that are lower quality than your average low quality teen soap opera, go for it.

{"value":"As a child the first installment (\"The Little Mermaid\") was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family film. A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time. I believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn't surpass their original. I think that I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I have grown up. However, it is not a bad film.<br /><br />It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eurselas' sister), so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea. As Melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go. Trouble stirs up as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out. I did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing.

{"value":"Who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film, term used loosely, or bank rolling it, and should the latter be the case, I would want my seven dollars back! The actors, again term used loosely, are awful, in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief. The scenery and everything about this screams, we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in. Was this filmed in someones back yard? Everything about this project says, low budget. The actors at best were D list. Do not waste your time, unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back. The lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother dummee moore. My local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached. Even as a 99 cent rental this flick gathers dust. Someone really must have owed some favors.

{"value":"I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I couldn't get into this story because its two main characters: \"David\" (Bruce Willis) and \"Maddie\" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit was some clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I did appreciate of lot of that dialog. <br /><br />Basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female. You get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming. A lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering, but I hate it, so I never got on the Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /><br />Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless aide \"Agnes,\" was entertaining. It's too bad she had such little air time. Shepherd was nice on the eyes and I suppose women would say the same for Willis, but too much arguing between the two finally turned me

{"value":"Without question, the worst film I've seen for a long while. I endured to the end because surely there must be something here, but no. The plot, when not dealing in clichés, rambles to the point of non-existence; dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed; characters never develop beyond sketches; set-pieces are clichéd. Worse, considering its co-director, the photography is only so-so.<br /><br />Comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are way way off the mark; Lives of the Saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30-minute short, but as it stands it's a 6th form film project realised on a million-pound scale; rambling and bloated with its own pretensions. That it received funding (surely only because of Rankin's name) while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the British film

{"value":"By far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one over on us, as well as their dumb-witted marks, the cops, the mob and (ideally) each other. But this film NEVER pulls this off. Every scam can be seen coming a mile off (especially the biggen!) Neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are alright, but they're delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylised way that I thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time... but it wasn't. As for the psychological complexity, the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore, but she gets over it.

{"value":"The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" passed me by; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in either New York or California; or, I probably would have watched. Still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release), I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and, the \"General Lee\" is still good to go. <br /><br />Hunky cousins Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her skimpy short well - but, even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing, topless coeds. The too stupid plot involves a graying Burt Reynolds (as \"Boss\" Hogg) threatening to turn Hazzard County into a strip-mine.<br /><br />** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann

{"value":"I've seen (far too) many flicks from this company - this one is about middle of the pack. One the good side, its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to story (for what its worth). Many of their titles, like Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility. On the other side, I found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein).<br /><br />Misty Mundae is always a 10 on the peter meter, as is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot in a school-marm kinda way, and Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie.<br /><br />Watch this with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porn. Don't waste your time wanting to check the story - you've got better things to do w/ your life.

{"value":"All the other comments already said what I was going to say, here goes anyway. I thought this was Italian at first, sorry about that, Italy. I wasn't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when? Was it Alan Parsons? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected, terrible. Full of streaks and stuff. The movie was an incoherent mess. Goofy music and clueless characters. The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients. I thought the \"doctor\" directing the \"battle\" scene was never going to end. Had some good looking babes though. It seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked. I gave it a 2 for the nekkid women. That bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs.

{"value":"When I bought this DVD I though: \"It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standards let's give it a chance\" I was TOTALLY WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring, and leads nowhere It has no structure, it just flows, like the wind, in one or another direction The production is also bad! The sound mixing is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80's The acting should have been better too Well, to sum up, it's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years!

{"value":"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a \"good\" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the \"Time Machine\" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.","finished_norm":["i","attempt","to","watch","thi","film","without","be","abl","to","realli","sit","through","it","for","while","it","be","suppos","to","have","a","good","messag","the","problem","be","that","it","be","obvious","produc","accord","to","on","particular","interpret","of","scriptur","a","interpret","in","my","opinion","will","mislead","a","lot","of","peopl","in","addit","i","be","a","movi","maniac","and","the","act","in","thi","film","be","complet","unaccept","never","befor","have","i","wish","for","a","neg","score","to","rate","a","movi","so","if","you","wish","to","be","preach","to","incessantli","by","that","without","author","then","by","all","mean","get","thi","film","thi","comment","be","conjur","a","warn","to","peopl","who","like","or","love","scifi","becaus","the","titl","will","deceiv","a","lot","of","peopl","a","good","thi","be","a","unfortun","film","becaus","the","basic","idea","have","possibl","and","that","possibl","be","squander","the","film","onli","redeem","qualiti","be","that","it","do","make","me","realiz","that","the","charact","in","the","time","machin","probabl","should","have","show","a","littl","much","moral","outrag","at","the","odd","behavior","by","that","in","hi","futur"],"filtered":["attempt","watch","thi","film","without","abl","realli","sit","suppos","good","messag","problem","obvious","produc","accord","particular","interpret","scriptur","interpret","opinion","mislead","lot","peopl","addit","movi","maniac","act","thi","film","complet","unaccept","never","befor","wish","neg","score","rate","movi","wish","preach","incessantli","without","author","mean","get","thi","film","thi","comment","conjur","warn","peopl","like","love","scifi","becaus","titl","deceiv","lot","peopl","good","thi","unfortun","film","becaus","basic","idea","possibl","possibl","squander","film","onli","redeem","qualiti","make","realiz","charact","time","machin","probabl","show","littl","much","moral","outrag","odd","behavior","hi","futur"],"filtered2":["attempt","watch","without","abl","realli","sit","suppos","good","messag","problem","obvious","produc","accord","particular","interpret","scriptur","interpret","opinion","mislead","lot","peopl","addit","maniac","act","complet","unaccept","never","befor","wish","neg","score","rate","wish","preach","incessantli","without","author","mean","get","comment","conjur","warn","peopl","like","love","scifi","becaus","titl","deceiv","lot","peopl","good","unfortun","becaus","basic","idea","possibl","possibl","squander","onli","redeem","qualiti","make","realiz","charact","time","machin","probabl","show","littl","moral","outrag","odd","behavior","futur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,10,11,13,14,21,22,23,28,39,42,54,72,79,88,103,123,125,148,149,167,177,202,227,244,261,264,280,286,319,341,399,402,405,454,518,527,538,569,634,772,781,832,844,878,1071,1111,1147,1185,1379,1494,1739,2075,2452,2528,3216,4422,5824,5874],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,10,11,13,14,21,22,23,28,39,42,54,72,79,88,103,123,125,148,149,167,177,202,227,244,261,264,280,286,319,341,399,402,405,454,518,527,538,569,634,772,781,832,844,878,1071,1111,1147,1185,1379,1494,1739,2075,2452,2528,3216,4422,5824,5874],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,4.094543182127343,1.5452294193519092,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.8113893252729412,3.841892750832105,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.2619070973220485,4.448447326975307,2.3018654096236517,2.3253197803590226,2.4609576687888097,2.458149992634611,2.597304642813496,2.6005321873043625,2.634508058031767,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,2.8028805344481915,2.780700890737216,2.9056060024680126,2.933776879434709,6.258230235337164,6.16884985742153,3.109204957709252,3.2556198060399626,3.4101163271295305,3.439602492783994,3.43462735814388,3.6436037491933098,3.5119855004467477,3.8059428063999263,3.9363956947973615,3.7987743169213135,3.8690435127678695,4.067587905068712,4.30366520516749,4.2574141875167335,4.246178114249808,4.235066888824737,4.403125998698128,4.558366596889411,4.751432692966343,10.153710186801943,5.339219357868463,5.185068678041204,5.583416318380505,5.9370563586240825,6.543192162194399,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6606027355064852E-4,1.659131191470252E-4,1.659540843777913E-4,1.6592072229843724E-4,1.659364247266966E-4,1.659122043521393E-4,1.6596380535110371E-4,1.6588751932213706E-4,1.6591315421106683E-4,1.6608460747753203E-4,1.6740244049723188E-4,1.6591342825669363E-4,1.66

{"value":"I picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious \"The Gamers\" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommendable, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver. The reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing. True, it can be funny to use every singe cliché there is about role playing games, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene you know what the \"joke\" will be about. But maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there would be captions \"LAUGH NOW\" or a cheap 80s-style fake-laughter track it would not make much difference.

{"value":"What can I say about this film other than \"don't see it\". I waited and waited and WAITED for someting (or anything) to happen and it just didn't come. Watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie. What are they doing? Are they solving a mystery? Are they gathering clues? Possibly, it's just hard to tell. At the end of the movie, after a lot of radio signals are decoded (illegibly on some sort of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (I guess they don't like sharing the wealth). My guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art (garbage!) and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film.
