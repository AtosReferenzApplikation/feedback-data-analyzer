{"value":"Firstly, this is a very dated film, non-focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual ( which in itself is quite nonsensical, since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual) it reduces me to despair; as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree. But no doubt this non-educational message ties in with Godard's use of rock music; hence The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />The song 'Sympathy for the Devil', whose creation we witness, and from which the film takes its name, is in fact nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not especially original, was used to much better effect in Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou'(Led Zeppelin II). Apart form that, 'Sir' Mick Jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner (rather like Bob Dylan)- notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse.<br /><br />Besides the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film, don't seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today ( indeed, a message that would belie the behaviour of The Rolling Stones around the time the film was made).<br /><br />No wonder, the DVD came free with The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical exposition of left-wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.","finished_norm":["firstli","thi","be","a","veri","date","film","nonfocus","in","it","exposit","of","the","leav","wing","polit","revolut","honestli","when","someon","sai","that","the","onli","wai","to","be","truli","revolutionari","be","to","ceas","to","be","intellectu","which","in","itself","be","quit","nonsens","sinc","the","answer","be","arriv","at","by","precis","be","intellectu","it","reduc","me","to","despair","a","if","we","all","should","return","to","be","ap","in","the","name","of","equal","it","be","simpli","ridicul","our","intellectu","be","onli","on","of","mani","human","qualiti","but","thi","doe","not","mean","we","should","not","educ","ourselv","to","the","high","possibl","degre","but","no","doubt","thi","noneduc","messag","tie","in","with","godard","us","of","rock","music","henc","the","roll","stonesbr","br","the","song","sympathi","for","the","devil","whose","creation","we","wit","and","from","which","the","film","take","it","name","be","in","fact","noth","special","the","chord","sequenc","which","be","not","especi","origin","be","us","to","much","well","effect","in","lead","zeppelin","thankyoul","zeppelin","ii","apart","form","that","sir","mick","jagger","declaim","in","hi","usual","nebul","manner","rather","like","bob","dylan","notic","how","the","melod","phrase","be","unimagin","repeat","over","again","to","form","the","versebr","br","besid","the","fact","that","the","black","panther","depict","in","thi","film","do","not","seem","to","know","what","thei","be","fight","for","the","much","interest","scene","involv","the","equat","of","fascism","with","pornographi","a","messag","that","in","fact","undermin","the","sexual","liber","of","the","and","todai","ind","a","messag","that","would","beli","the","behaviour","of","the","roll","stone","around","the","time","the","film","be","madebr","br","no","wonder","the","dvd","come","free","with","the","sundai","time","for","a","truli","profound","histor","exposit","of","leftw","sympathi","listen","to","luigi","nono","masterpiec","al","gran","sole","caricodamor"],"filtered":["firstli","thi","veri","date","film","nonfocus","exposit","leav","wing","polit","revolut","honestli","someon","sai","onli","wai","truli","revolutionari","ceas","intellectu","quit","nonsens","sinc","answer","arriv","precis","intellectu","reduc","despair","return","ap","name","equal","simpli","ridicul","intellectu","onli","mani","human","qualiti","thi","doe","mean","educ","ourselv","high","possibl","degre","doubt","thi","noneduc","messag","tie","godard","us","rock","music","henc","roll","stonesbr","br","song","sympathi","devil","whose","creation","wit","film","take","name","fact","noth","special","chord","sequenc","especi","origin","us","much","well","effect","lead","zeppelin","thankyoul","zeppelin","ii","apart","form","sir","mick","jagger","declaim","hi","usual","nebul","manner","rather","like","bob","dylan","notic","melod","phrase","unimagin","repeat","form","versebr","br","besid","fact","black","panther","depict","thi","film","seem","know","thei","fight","much","interest","scene","involv","equat","fascism","pornographi","messag","fact","undermin","sexual","liber","todai","ind","messag","beli","behaviour","roll","stone","around","time","film","madebr","br","wonder","dvd","come","free","sundai","time","truli","profound","histor","exposit","leftw","sympathi","listen","luigi","nono","masterpiec","al","gran","sole","caricodamor"],"filtered2":["firstli","veri","date","nonfocus","exposit","leav","wing","polit","revolut","honestli","someon","onli","wai","truli","revolutionari","ceas","intellectu","quit","nonsens","sinc","answer","arriv","precis","intellectu","reduc","despair","return","ap","name","equal","simpli","ridicul","intellectu","onli","mani","human","qualiti","doe","mean","educ","ourselv","high","possibl","degre","doubt","noneduc","messag","tie","godard","us","rock","music","henc","roll","stonesbr","song","sympathi","devil","whose","creation","wit","take","name","fact","noth","special","chord","sequenc","especi","origin","us","well","effect","lead","zeppelin","thankyoul","zeppelin","ii","apart","form","sir","mick","jagger","declaim","usual","nebul","manner","rather","like","bob","dylan","notic","melod","phrase","unimagin","repeat","form","versebr","besid","fact","black","panther","depict","seem","know","fight","interest","scene","involv","equat","fascism","pornographi","messag","fact","undermin","sexual","liber","todai","ind","messag","beli","behaviour","roll","stone","around","time","madebr","wonder","dvd","come","free","sundai","time","truli","profound","histor","exposit","leftw","sympathi","listen","luigi","nono","masterpiec","al","gran","sole","caricodamor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,11,15,18,19,20,26,31,33,34,35,49,50,56,60,69,74,88,97,98,106,118,120,139,143,157,160,162,175,201,203,211,229,233,241,247,265,267,274,292,319,328,342,349,402,488,519,567,569,572,575,582,598,647,686,688,689,757,789,795,800,829,845,851,905,906,953,972,986,1011,

{"value":"I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children. Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies. Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.<br /><br />Technically, the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural. Personally I hate that, but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project. The \"acting\" reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices. Thankfully it was a very short movie.<br /><br />Now, before I come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick, the one thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message. Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is. Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given: <br /><br />If you are lost, don't worry, you will inevitably find your way home.<br /><br />Approach wild animals without any

{"value":"And I mean ultra light. This film features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.<br /><br />There really isn't too much to say about this stinker, other than that although it has a couple of really good bits, most of it isn't very funny. Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated, much less amusing.<br /><br />What's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all. This movie could have been so much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted, complete with phony quotes from critics. The film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes, it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance.<br /><br />The same with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character -- the whinny, self centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she's given, but she's given practically nothing. It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years.<br /><br />In the end, it is hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks like a rerun of \"The Love Boat.\" In fact, as the old joke goes, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal.

{"value":"For starters, \"Hobgoblins\" tries to ape the more successful \"Gremlins\". That's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here. Instead, it's more like a bargain basement, everything-must-go clearance of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound FX, acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube-aroo.<br /><br />The plot? Grrrr.... Meddling kids track down gremlin-like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies. Sound cool, does it? Well, see that wall on the other side of your room? Run right at it, top speed, face first. See, THAT is cooler than this movie.<br /><br />You dare to doubt? Quick, name something else one of the leads has been in other than this. What other scripts have the writers done since \"Hobgoblins\"? Name another Rick Sloane directoral effort. How many \"Hobgoblins\" action figures do you have? See? THANK you.<br /><br />I cannot believe I took so long to write about such a horrible film. I'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing. But no, \"Hobgoblins\" it is and it is bad - bad like your grandparents' wallpaper, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad like underwear that says \"Home of the Whopper\"...and I think we'll stop

{"value":"Comes this heartwarming tale of hope. Hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again. *cough* Razzie award *cough*<br /><br />I disliked this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and inane. While watching I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained. When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing 'I wasn't entitled to reimbursement'. I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.<br /><br />The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police. Underneath this clever outline however, lies a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits. Or not.<br /><br />Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people getting hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool?<br /><br />If you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed in some places as 'The Worst Movie of the Decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse...somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously. <br /><br />This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny.<br /><br

{"value":"Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, one can only expect the best. However, with \"Envy\", no one could save this disaster.<br /><br />Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers at a sandpaper factory. Both are making a decent living, but because Tim has a better performance at work, he's able to afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who's always coming up with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear (Yes, I'm serious). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50/50. Tim refuses thinking the idea will never work.<br /><br />Nick's invention, titled \"va-poo-rize\" (again, i'm serious), ends up making millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy deserts. Tim starts feeling envy for Nick. Hence the name of the movie.<br /><br />The concept isn't bad, but it still turns out awful. This movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character named \"J-man\", made this movie funny. The movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if: *you like crap (no pun intended) *you want to see Jack Black in a white tux<br /><br />I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid ESPECIALLY if: *you're offended by bathroom humor *you love

{"value":"I haven't been able to decide if this movie is so bad it's good, or, to quote Enid Coleslaw, \"so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again.\" No matter, it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird coloured vomit might, and it offers up a number of scenes that you won't forget even if you want to. There's a sneering young Ray Liotta telling a pigtailed Pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A bit later, there's Ray again, molesting Pia, not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose. There's a firm chinned Pia telling her domineering Mom that she wants to go to bed with Ray's geezer father, Walter. There's the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: \"WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!\" There's that garden hose again, as Walter waves it Pia's face and roars \"Is this more to your liking!?\" There's Pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other masticating salad that they start tearing each other's clothes off. There's Pia showering but forgetting to remove her dress. Perhaps best of all, there's Pia's typewriter, but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most (afterwards, I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally there's Pia at \"The Awards\" exposing Hollywood for the cesspool it is, spitting out the second best line ever, \"I guess I'm not the only one who has ever had to **** her way to the top.\" I see I have already spent more time commenting on \"The Lonely Lady\" than I have on far better pictures, so I'll quit. Be forewarned, though, that once you start watching you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever.","finished_norm":["i","have","not","be","abl","to","decid","if","thi","movi","be","so","bad","it","good","or","to","quot","enid","coleslaw","so","bad","it","go","past","good","and","back","to","bad","again","no","matt","it","forc","me","look","much","the","same","wai","a","pile","of","weird","colour","vomit","mai","and","it","offer","up","a","numb","of","scene","that","you","wo","not","forget","even","if","you","want","to","there","a","sneer","young","rai","liotta","tell","a","pigtail","pia","that","her","creativ","write","trophi","look","like","a","peni","a","bite","late","there","rai","again","molest","pia","not","with","the","appropri","shape","trophi","but","a","garden","hose","there","a","firm","chin","pia","tell","her","domin","mom","that","she","want","to","go","to","bed","with","rai","geezer","father","walter","there","the","actress","in","the","graveyard","scene","yowl","the","well","line","ever","write","by","pia","or","anyon","els","wwwwhhhyyyyyyi","there","that","garden","hose","again","a","walter","wave","it","pia","face","and","roar","be","thi","much","to","your","like","there","pia","and","her","date","so","turn","on","by","closeup","of","each","other","mastic","salad","that","thei","start","tear","each","other","cloth","off","there","pia","shower","but","forget","to","remov","her","dress","perhap","well","of","all","there","pia","typewrit","but","instead","of","kei","there","be","the","miniatur","talk","head","of","that","who","have","torment","her","the","much","afterward","i","be","afraid","to","open","my","laptop","and","final","there","pia","at","the","award","expos","hollywood","for","the","cesspool","it","be","spit","out","the","well","line","ever","i","guess","i","be","not","the","onli","on","who","have","ever","have","to","her","wai","to","the","top","i","see","i","have","alreadi","spend","much","time","comment","on","the","lone","ladi","than","i","have","on","far","well","pictur","so","i","will","quit","be","forewarn","though","that","onc","you","start","watch","you","probabl","wo","not","be","abl","to","take","your","ey","off","the","screen","until","two","hour","of","your","life","have","vanish","forev"],"filtered":["abl","decid","thi","movi","bad","good","quot","enid","coleslaw","bad","go","past","good","back","bad","matt","forc","look","much","wai","pile","weird","colour","vomit","mai","offer","numb","scene","wo","forget","even","want","sneer","young","rai","liotta","tell","pigtail","pia","creativ","write","trophi","look","like","peni","bite","late","rai","molest","pia","appropri","shape","trophi","garden","hose","firm","chin","pia","tell","domin","mom","want","go","bed","rai","geezer","father","walter","actress","graveyard","scene","yowl","well","line","ever","write","pia","anyon","els","wwwwhhhyyyyyyi","garden","hose","walter","wave","pia","face","roar","thi","much","like","pia","date","turn","closeup","mastic","salad","thei","start","tear","cloth","pia","shower","forget","remov","dress","perhap","well","pia","typewrit","instead","kei","miniatur","talk","head","torment","much","afterward","afraid","open","laptop","final","pia","award","expos","hollywood","cesspool","spit","well","line","ever","guess","onli","ever","wai","top","see","alreadi","spend","much","time","comment","lone","ladi","far","well","pictur","quit","forewarn","though","onc","start","watch","probabl","wo","abl","take","ey","screen","two","hour","life","vanish","forev"],"filtered2":["abl","decid","bad","good","quot","enid","coleslaw","bad","go","past","good","back","bad","matt","forc","look","wai","pile","weird","colour","vomit","mai","offer","numb","scene","wo","forget","even","want","sneer","young","rai","liotta","tell","pigtail","pia","creativ","write","trophi","look","like","peni","bite","late","rai","molest","pia","appropri","shape","trophi","garden","hose","firm","chin","pia","tell","domin","mom","want","go","bed","rai","geezer","father","walter","actress","graveyard","scene","yowl","well","line","ever","write","pia","anyon","els","wwwwhhhyyyyyyi","garden","hose","walter","wave","pia","face","roar","like","pia","date","turn","closeup","mastic","salad","start","tear","cloth","pia","shower","forget","remov","dress","perhap","well","pia","typewrit","instead","kei","miniatur","talk","head","torment","afterward","afraid","open","laptop","final","pia","award","expos","hollywood","cesspool","spit","well","line","ever","guess","onli","ever","wai","top","see","alreadi","spend","time","comment","lone","ladi","far","well","pictur","quit","forewarn","though","onc","start","watch","probabl","wo","abl","take","ey","screen","two","hour","life","vanish","forev"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,16,19,20,31,33,37,44,46,47,63,65,71,75,86,90,96,101,107,120,135,148,150,152,154,156,158,174,186,192,196,208,236,242,243,249,251,280,281,283,300,311,318,330,338,343,355,364,372,406,408,440,454,472,507,516,625,647,873,879,1004,1065,1120,1121,1125,1133,1236,1244,1324,1463,1527,1605,1691,1748,1790

{"value":"As a huge fan of horror films, especially J-horror and also gore i thought Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying, and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? The acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it. I did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light, they left both pretty unexplained, or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn't understand what i was actually seeing. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing?)certainly were, i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way, they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends, but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value, but don't be expecting a dark, deeply scary and horrifying film; you'll just be disappointed. If this was a horror comedy/spoof i'd probably rate it about a nine, the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife's stomach and closed up her wounds, but as a horror sadly i gave it a one.","finished_norm":["a","a","huge","fan","of","horror","film","especi","jhorror","and","conjur","gore","i","think","nekeddo","burâddo","sound","pretti","good","i","research","the","plot","read","review","and","even","look","at","some","photo","to","make","sure","it","seem","like","a","good","gori","and","scari","movi","to","watch","befor","download","it","so","excit","it","have","finish","and","readi","to","be","scare","and","recoil","in","horror","at","the","amaz","gore","i","be","expect","i","be","terribli","disappoint","the","plot","be","ridicul","and","do","not","even","make","sens","and","leav","too","much","unexplain","the","gore","be","hilari","rather","then","horrifi","and","what","be","with","the","cartoon","styl","sound","effect","the","act","be","probabl","the","onli","thing","mildli","scari","about","it","i","do","not","understand","the","cactu","idea","and","the","wai","the","mother","husband","disappear","in","the","middl","of","the","sea","after","follow","a","flash","light","thei","leav","both","pretti","unexplain","or","perhap","i","miss","it","a","my","mind","can","not","understand","what","i","be","actual","see","i","appreci","the","wai","it","be","suppos","to","be","shock","and","a","few","scene","the","strang","cannib","and","own","mother","kissingcertainli","be","i","just","think","thei","go","a","littl","bite","far","and","not","even","in","a","horrifi","wai","thei","make","it","to","unconvinc","which","make","it","much","believ","to","be","a","comedi","rather","than","a","horror","in","my","opinion","howev","it","be","a","veri","entertain","film","and","get","a","lot","of","laugh","out","of","me","and","a","coupl","of","friend","but","sadli","we","be","expect","horror","not","comedi","so","it","worth","a","watch","for","the","entertain","valu","but","do","not","be","expect","a","dark","deepli","scari","and","horrifi","film","you","will","just","be","disappoint","if","thi","be","a","horror","comedyspoof","i","have","probabl","rate","it","about","a","nine","the","climax","be","the","weird","scene","when","the","husband","climb","insid","hi","wife","stomach","and","close","up","her","wound","but","a","a","horror","sadli","i","give","it","a","on"],"filtered":["huge","fan","horror","film","especi","jhorror","conjur","gore","think","nekeddo","burâddo","sound","pretti","good","research","plot","read","review","even","look","photo","make","sure","seem","like","good","gori","scari","movi","watch","befor","download","excit","finish","readi","scare","recoil","horror","amaz","gore","expect","terribli","disappoint","plot","ridicul","even","make","sens","leav","much","unexplain","gore","hilari","rather","horrifi","cartoon","styl","sound","effect","act","probabl","onli","thing","mildli","scari","understand","cactu","idea","wai","mother","husband","disappear","middl","sea","follow","flash","light","thei","leav","pretti","unexplain","perhap","miss","mind","understand","actual","see","appreci","wai","suppos","shock","scene","strang","cannib","mother","kissingcertainli","think","thei","go","littl","bite","far","even","horrifi","wai","thei","make","unconvinc","make","much","believ","comedi","rather","horror","opinion","howev","veri","entertain","film","get","lot","laugh","coupl","friend","sadli","expect","horror","comedi","worth","watch","entertain","valu","expect","dark","deepli","scari","horrifi","film","disappoint","thi","horror","comedyspoof","probabl","rate","nine","climax","weird","scene","husband","climb","insid","hi","wife","stomach","close","wound","horror","sadli","give"],"filtered2":["huge","fan","horror","especi","jhorror","conjur","gore","think","nekeddo","burâddo","sound","pretti","good","research","plot","read","review","even","look","photo","make","sure","seem","like","good","gori","scari","watch","befor","download","excit","finish","readi","scare","recoil","horror","amaz","gore","expect","terribli","disappoint","plot","ridicul","even","make","sens","leav","unexplain","gore","hilari","rather","horrifi","cartoon","styl","sound","effect","act","probabl","onli","thing","mildli","scari","understand","cactu","idea","wai","mother","husband","disappear","middl","sea","follow","flash","light","leav","pretti","unexplain","perhap","miss","mind","understand","actual","see","appreci","wai","suppos","shock","scene","strang","cannib","mother","kissingcertainli","think","go","littl","bite","far","even","horrifi","wai","make","unconvinc","make","believ","comedi","rather","horror","opinion","howev","veri","entertain","get","lot","laugh","coupl","friend","sadli","expect","horror","comedi","worth","watch","entertain","valu","expect","dark","deepli","scari","horrifi","disappoint","horror","comedyspoof","probabl","rate","nine","climax","weird","scene","husband","climb","insid","wife","stomach","close","wound","horror","sadli","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,14,15,16,19,21,29,30,32,33,35,39,52,72,74,78,79,83,91,101,106,113,119,123,127,130,133,140,145,148,149,154,16

{"value":"Well then, thank you SO MUCH Disney for DESTROYING the fond memories I USED to have of my FORMER favorite movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So, now that I'm 16, and feeling masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. Thus, I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it, right down to the last detail.<br /><br />In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show her to everyone in the ocean...BROADWAY STYLE! After the musical number ends, within minutes, the sea witch Morgana shows up and threatens to kill Melody if Triton doesn't give up the trident. Thus, he gives it up without even a fight. Eric stands there gaping, though Ariel figures out how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never go near the sea until Morgana is caught.<br /><br />Well...uh, nothing of note really happens. Eric is a total wuss. He never really manages to do anything. Ariel sort of does something. Melody manages to screw things up. Plus, the animation is a new low-point for Disney. The computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds. Ever single opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite.<br /><br />Look, don't waste your time. I'm pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this, since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens. They won't want to sing the songs. If you manage to grab a copy of this, throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it.

{"value":"A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels. But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn't happy with where it went. Alice just became more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me. Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.<br /><br />Alice is back and she's carrying a child, she couldn't be happier with her life. But Freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyways, he wants her child and to be born into the world again. Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too? Well that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him.<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series. I don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Just the story was really silly, I mean it could have possibly worked, but once again, it was just executed the wrong way. I know that if you're looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should watch it, but I really wouldn't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion.<br /><br

{"value":"A man wakes from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket. He wants to go on a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. She relents. They go on the tour, but leave the group to make out. She falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again, and seems to know a bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. He fights it off her, and it attacks him, biting his forehead.<br /><br />They get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He becomes angry when this happens. He's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about rabies, and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection.<br /><br />And then some people are killed. We see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person. It seems it is not just in his mind. Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear, since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.<br /><br />While the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of the desert, cave, and ski-slope locations, and some of the weirder scenes.

{"value":"Writer/Director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA. He says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film.<br /><br />Unfortunately Sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his \"backstage\" footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast (also on that reel) that was seen by millions, not hidden away in NASA vaults as he implies. And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not faking footage.<br /><br />Finally, anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy Sibrel's hacked-up version of it. (He shows you more of the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination than of his \"smoking gun\".) Sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it. What's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth, destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway Earth.<br /><br />As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on

{"value":"It as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy. It is not only oppressively preachy, but absurd, stagebound, dramatically straight-jacketed, and painfully overwrought. Watching it, one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write \"I will not become a fascist\" on the blackboard 100 times.<br /><br />Now I understand that it was made during the height of WW2, and was intended to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about, (which anyone would whole-heartedly applaud) and I'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day. But it is presented in such an immature, over-obvious, sledgehammer way, it fails abysmally as a work of art.<br /><br />The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships, the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snips. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is so one dimensionally noble I cringed every time she was on screen. Her every word, her every gesture is meant to convey how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING she is of the SACRIFICES her husband has to make and the great CAUSE he is fighting for, that she must've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal.<br /><br />So yes, this is a very IMPORTANT film, just not a very good one.","finished_norm":["it","a","absolut","incred","to","me","that","anyon","can","make","the","comment","that","thi","film","be","not","preachi","it","be","not","onli","oppress","preachi","but","absurd","stagebound","dramat","straightjacket","and","painfulli","overwrought","watch","it","on","feel","like","a","year","old","child","be","punish","by","have","to","write","i","will","not","becom","a","fascist","on","the","blackboard","timesbr","br","now","i","understand","that","it","be","make","dure","the","height","of","ww","and","be","intend","to","be","a","brave","condemn","of","hitler","and","the","terribl","suffer","he","bring","about","which","anyon","would","wholeheartedli","applaud","and","i","be","sure","it","accur","captur","the","mood","of","the","dai","but","it","be","present","in","such","a","immatur","overobvi","sledgehamm","wai","it","fail","abysm","a","a","work","of","artbr","br","the","onli","good","perform","here","be","from","paul","luka","who","bring","sincer","and","intens","to","hi","role","a","a","quietli","heroic","antifascist","and","lucil","watson","a","the","amusingli","illmann","rich","grandmoth","who","slowli","come","to","realiz","how","danger","the","world","have","becom","though","their","rootless","upbring","have","subject","them","to","all","kind","of","hardship","the","child","be","ridicul","show","a","robot","wellbehav","littl","snip","thei","do","not","even","remot","resembl","real","human","be","and","bett","davi","a","great","actress","here","be","so","on","dimension","nobl","i","cring","everi","time","she","be","on","screen","her","everi","word","her","everi","gestur","be","mean","to","convei","how","support","and","understand","she","be","of","the","sacrific","her","husband","have","to","make","and","the","great","caus","he","be","fight","for","that","she","must","have","be","wire","to","receiv","a","pain","electr","shock","if","she","dare","allow","ani","hint","of","doubt","or","shade","to","surfac","in","her","portrayalbr","br","so","ye","thi","be","a","veri","import","film","just","not","a","veri","good","on"],"filtered":["absolut","incred","anyon","make","comment","thi","film","preachi","onli","oppress","preachi","absurd","stagebound","dramat","straightjacket","painfulli","overwrought","watch","feel","like","year","old","child","punish","write","becom","fascist","blackboard","timesbr","br","understand","make","dure","height","ww","intend","brave","condemn","hitler","terribl","suffer","bring","anyon","wholeheartedli","applaud","sure","accur","captur","mood","dai","present","immatur","overobvi","sledgehamm","wai","fail","abysm","work","artbr","br","onli","good","perform","paul","luka","bring","sincer","intens","hi","role","quietli","heroic","antifascist","lucil","watson","amusingli","illmann","rich","grandmoth","slowli","come","realiz","danger","world","becom","though","rootless","upbring","subject","kind","hardship","child","ridicul","show","robot","wellbehav","littl","snip","thei","even","remot","resembl","real","human","bett","davi","great","actress","dimension","nobl","cring","everi","time","screen","everi","word","everi","gestur","mean","convei","support","understand","sacrific","husband","make","great","caus","fight","must","wire","receiv","pain","electr","shock","dare","allow","ani","hint","doubt","shade","surfac","portrayalbr","br","ye","thi","veri","import","film","veri","good"],"filtered2":["absolut","incred","anyon","make","comment","preachi","onli","oppress","preachi","absurd","stagebound","dramat","straightjacket","painfulli","overwrought","watch","feel","like","year","old","child","punish","write","becom","fascist","blackboard","timesbr","understand","make","dure","height","ww","intend","brave","condemn","hitler","terribl","suffer","bring","anyon","wholeheartedli","applaud","sure","accur","captur","mood","dai","present","immatur","overobvi","sledgehamm","wai","fail","abysm","work","artbr","onli","good","perform","paul","luka","bring","sincer","intens","role","quietli","heroic","antifascist","lucil","watson","amusingli","illmann","rich","grandmoth","slowli","come","realiz","danger","world","becom","though","rootless","upbring","subject","kind","hardship","child","ridicul","show","robot","wellbehav","littl","snip","even","remot","resembl","real","human","bett","davi","great","actress","dimension","nobl","cring","everi","time","screen","everi","word","everi","gestur","mean","convei","support","understand","sacrific","husband","make","great","caus","fight","must","wire","receiv","pain","electr","shock","dare","allow","ani","hint","doubt","shade","surfac","portrayalbr","ye","veri","import","veri","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,8,11,14,15,27,28,33,34,43,48,51,57,65,67,80,85,86,88,105,115,119,122,128,132,141,158,165,166,180,192,209,212,215,222,233,239,250,258,274,280,292,355,405,411,452,458,459,508,521,536,550,567,600,633,756,840,883,925,926,928,937,978,1031,1053,1129,1154,1241,1303,1350,1375,1418,1468,1601,1613,1741,1771,1828,198

{"value":"When I first heard about \"Down To Earth,\" I was pretty excited. I'm a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole.<br /><br />First off, Chris Rock. He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine. Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't. Even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh. He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out.<br /><br />Also, the movie was poorly directed. The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier.<br /><br />Overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that \"Down To Earth\" is poorly acted, and poorly directed.

{"value":"Ye Lou's film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film \"has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography\", but I don't think that helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century, and I don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. The overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability.<br /><br />The actors are all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. However, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.<br /><br />All in all, a very

{"value":"Firstly, I won't tell you WHY I rented this movie, as I'm still confused myself...<br /><br />Air Rage is much like any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked. There is of course that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker looking for revenge. The sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?<br /><br />Although it's Ice-T (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while he's not busy putting the \"c\" back in front of rap) who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers, which naturally comes back to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania from \"Seinfeld\".<br /><br />I can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used about a POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow a lock off a door... BRILLIANT.<br /><br />The plot was unnaturally predictable.<br /><br />The script - atrocious. It got to the point where I could say something, which I felt would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie.<br /><br />As for special effects... the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes.<br /><br />And the title - the movie DID take place in the Air. But due to the less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the movie was that of the viewer.<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie, just because it's bad. Please SAVE YOURSELF, don't choose this.","finished_norm":["firstli","i","wo","not","tell","you","why","i","rent","thi","movi","a","i","be","still","confus","myselfbr","br","air","rage","be","much","like","ani","movi","i","have","see","where","a","plane","be","hijack","there","be","of","cours","that","on","import","person","on","the","plane","and","the","hijack","look","for","reveng","the","sad","thing","be","some","of","the","method","to","stop","the","hijack","have","alreadi","be","us","in","other","movi","be","we","realli","becom","so","unorigin","so","quicklybr","br","although","it","icet","who","for","some","incomprehens","reason","make","pain","attempt","at","act","while","he","not","busi","putt","the","c","back","in","front","of","rap","who","be","glorifi","on","the","cover","the","movi","actual","star","the","littl","than","amaz","kim","oja","a","a","stewardess","who","be","surprisingli","overlook","by","the","five","hijack","which","natur","come","back","to","haunt","them","a","for","the","rest","of","the","cast","the","onli","person","i","manag","to","recogn","be","steve","hytner","much","commonli","know","a","kenni","bania","from","seinfeldbr","br","i","ca","not","forget","to","leav","out","my","favorit","part","of","the","movi","when","a","hijack","us","about","a","pound","of","plastiqu","to","blow","a","lock","off","a","door","brilliantbr","br","the","plot","be","unnatur","predictablebr","br","the","script","atroci","it","get","to","the","point","where","i","can","sai","someth","which","i","feel","would","make","a","stupid","comment","and","it","would","be","the","next","line","in","the","moviebr","br","a","for","special","effect","the","onli","thing","special","about","thi","movi","be","that","i","wast","the","cost","of","electr","to","run","my","tv","and","vcr","for","minutesbr","br","and","the","titl","the","movi","do","take","place","in","the","air","but","due","to","the","littl","than","stellar","perform","the","onli","rage","in","the","movi","be","that","of","the","viewerbr","br","so","if","you","re","in","the","mood","to","even","pick","apart","a","movi","just","becaus","it","bad","pleas","save","yourself","do","not","choos","thi"],"filtered":["firstli","wo","tell","rent","thi","movi","still","confus","myselfbr","br","air","rage","much","like","ani","movi","see","plane","hijack","cours","import","person","plane","hijack","look","reveng","sad","thing","method","stop","hijack","alreadi","us","movi","realli","becom","unorigin","quicklybr","br","although","icet","incomprehens","reason","make","pain","attempt","act","busi","putt","c","back","front","rap","glorifi","cover","movi","actual","star","littl","amaz","kim","oja","stewardess","surprisingli","overlook","five","hijack","natur","come","back","haunt","rest","cast","onli","person","manag","recogn","steve","hytner","much","commonli","know","kenni","bania","seinfeldbr","br","ca","forget","leav","favorit","part","movi","hijack","us","pound","plastiqu","blow","lock","door","brilliantbr","br","plot","unnatur","predictablebr","br","script","atroci","get","point","sai","someth","feel","make","stupid","comment","next","line","moviebr","br","special","effect","onli","thing","special","thi","movi","wast","cost","electr","run","tv","vcr","minutesbr","br","titl","movi","take","place","air","due","littl","stellar","perform","onli","rage","movi","viewerbr","br","re","mood","even","pick","apart","movi","becaus","bad","pleas","save","choos","thi"],"filtered2":["firstli","wo","tell","rent","still","confus","myselfbr","air","rage","like","ani","see","plane","hijack","cours","import","person","plane","hijack","look","reveng","sad","thing","method","stop","hijack","alreadi","us","realli","becom","unorigin","quicklybr","although","icet","incomprehens","reason","make","pain","attempt","act","busi","putt","c","back","front","rap","glorifi","cover","actual","star","littl","amaz","kim","oja","stewardess","surprisingli","overlook","five","hijack","natur","come","back","haunt","rest","cast","onli","person","manag","recogn","steve","hytner","commonli","know","kenni","bania","seinfeldbr","ca","forget","leav","favorit","part","hijack","us","pound","plastiqu","blow","lock","door","brilliantbr","plot","unnatur","predictablebr","script","atroci","get","point","someth","feel","make","stupid","comment","next","line","moviebr","special","effect","onli","thing","special","wast","cost","electr","run","tv","vcr","minutesbr","titl","take","place","air","due","littl","stellar","perform","onli","rage","viewerbr","re","mood","even","pick","apart","becaus","bad","pleas","save","choos"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,9,11,13,14,16,21,22,26,27,29,31,32,34,43,52,53,56,61,63,64,66,68,74,77,81,89,90,92,95,100,105,106,107,115,136,137,153,164,172,177,189,199,203,226,237,264,280,297,315,330,345,346,372,406,427,446,455,456,458,465,491,504,568,572,584,600,661,679,685,754,773,790,822,836,838,871,1088,1104,1115,1129,1213,1219,1262,1318,1398,1568,2071,2342,2382,2384,2434,2437,2492,2502,2763,2821,2981,3450,3

{"value":"Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful. To this end, he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies. I'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies. I don't remember it ever being fully explained. All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife. (I'll just guess that it's spinal fluid. Spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s.) You can pretty much guess the rest from here.<br /><br />There are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I'll only write about two) of problems that I have with this movie. One is the way Bela is used. Sure, he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). But, to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly. Also, why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has? Is it to make him look evil? Well, someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil.<br /><br />The second problem I have is the idea of drugging brides. Why brides? Wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do? Watching Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, I was reminded of the idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. In each case, there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control.

{"value":"I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. Like many others on here, I don't know how to categorize this film, it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can't be a drama, there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words, like \"ambiguity\" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there. Like the Blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. This movie actually started off well with the family \"meeting\" the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the film), nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself.

didn't.","finished_norm":["i","have","never","hear","of","larri","fessenden","befor","but","judg","by","thi","effort","into","write","and","direct","he","should","keep","hi","dai","job","a","a","journeyman","actor","like","mani","other","on","here","i","do","not","know","how","to","categor","thi","film","it","be","not","scari","or","spooki","so","ca","not","be","call","a","horror","the","plot","be","so","wafer","thin","it","ca","not","be","a","drama","there","be","no","suspens","so","it","ca","not","be","a","thriller","it","just","a","bad","film","that","you","should","onli","see","if","you","be","a","fan","of","the","blair","witch","project","peopl","who","like","thi","film","us","word","like","ambigu","and","complex","and","subtl","but","thei","be","read","into","someth","that","be","not","there","like","the","blair","witch","peopl","get","scare","becaus","peopl","assum","thei","should","be","scare","and","bui","into","some","guff","that","it","be","terrifi","thi","movi","actual","start","off","good","with","the","famili","meet","the","local","after","hit","a","deer","it","look","like","be","a","modern","dai","deliver","but","then","for","the","next","minut","good","over","half","the","film","noth","happen","the","famili","pot","about","their","holidai","home","which","be","all","veri","nice","and","dandi","but","not","the","slight","bite","entertain","it","be","obviou","the","local","would","be","involv","in","some","wai","at","some","stage","but","essendon","clearli","have","no","idea","how","to","build","suspens","in","a","movi","final","when","someth","doe","happen","it","not","even","clear","how","the","father","be","shoot","how","he","die","the","nurs","sai","hi","live","be","onli","graze","and","all","the","time","thi","wendigo","spirit","appar","track","down","the","appar","shooter","in","a","veri","clumsi","wai","with","rd","grade","special","effect","the","film","be","call","wendigo","but","no","attempt","be","make","to","explain","it","in","ani","clear","wai","the","film","end","all","muddl","and","leav","you","veri","unsatisfi","i","would","have","bail","out","with","minut","to","go","but","i","want","to","see","if","thi","movi","can","redeem","itself","it","do","not"],"filtered":["never","hear","larri","fessenden","befor","judg","thi","effort","write","direct","keep","hi","dai","job","journeyman","actor","like","mani","know","categor","thi","film","scari","spooki","ca","call","horror","plot","wafer","thin","ca","drama","suspens","ca","thriller","bad","film","onli","see","fan","blair","witch","project","peopl","like","thi","film","us","word","like","ambigu","complex","subtl","thei","read","someth","like","blair","witch","peopl","get","scare","becaus","peopl","assum","thei","scare","bui","guff","terrifi","thi","movi","actual","start","good","famili","meet","local","hit","deer","look","like","modern","dai","deliver","next","minut","good","half","film","noth","happen","famili","pot","holidai","home","veri","nice","dandi","slight","bite","entertain","obviou","local","involv","wai","stage","essendon","clearli","idea","build","suspens","movi","final","someth","doe","happen","even","clear","father","shoot","die","nurs","sai","hi","live","onli","graze","time","thi","wendigo","spirit","appar","track","appar","shooter","veri","clumsi","wai","rd","grade","special","effect","film","call","wendigo","attempt","make","explain","ani","clear","wai","film","end","muddl","leav","veri","unsatisfi","bail","minut","go","want","see","thi","movi","redeem"],"filtered2":["never","hear","larri","fessenden","befor","judg","effort","write","direct","keep","dai","job","journeyman","actor","like","mani","know","categor","scari","spooki","ca","call","horror","plot","wafer","thin","ca","drama","suspens","ca","thriller","bad","onli","see","fan","blair","witch","project","peopl","like","us","word","like","ambigu","complex","subtl","read","someth","like","blair","witch","peopl","get","scare","becaus","peopl","assum","scare","bui","guff","terrifi","actual","start","good","famili","meet","local","hit","deer","look","like","modern","dai","deliver","next","minut","good","half","noth","happen","famili","pot","holidai","home","veri","nice","dandi","slight","bite","entertain","obviou","local","involv","wai","stage","essendon","clearli","idea","build","suspens","final","someth","doe","happen","even","clear","father","shoot","die","nurs","live","onli","graze","time","wendigo","spirit","appar","track","appar","shooter","veri","clumsi","wai","rd","grade","special","effect","call","wendigo","attempt","make","explain","ani","clear","wai","end","muddl","leav","veri","unsatisfi","bail","minut","go","want","see","redeem"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11,15,16,18,22,23,24,26,27,32,33,37,41,42,49,50,52,53,56,59,65,71,74,79,81,83,94,102,106,116,117,123,132,134,140,142,145,154,156,177,182,195,203,206,216,241,258,262,289,293,297,302,308,343,347,350,383,388,395,396,401,463,475,477,494,529,590,623,634,659,669,714,729,8

{"value":"My original review of this film was simply the word sh*t written 2000 times over. Although this was a very accurate critique, I felt my review should be a little more descriptive.<br /><br />I will start with the lead actress; her facial expression doesn't change once in this film, she doesn't show fear, happiness or depression. Her skills in body language pretty much come down to darting her eyes left and right and looking like she don't know jack. She is an emotionless husk who I'm guessing has had too much botox. Her lack of facial expression through out the film is outmatched however by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another. The lead actor, whose hair demands more attention than he did, was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril.<br /><br />The only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing, storyline and inaccuracies in plot. I have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie. The is no development in character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe a real person would.<br /><br />This film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that I couldn't even laugh. I believe I now have a brain tumour from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways I could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior.

{"value":"I saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing \"Last Days\" and some Charlie Chaplin films. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give \"Immortel\" a chance. I nearly walked out of this movie, and I LIKE science-fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner-style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning/synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour-and-forty-five-minute movie. Three groups exist in this world: humans, artificial humans, and Egyptian gods. The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth \"cap\" on the pyramid. Wouldn't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it's there. I won't bore you with the so-called plot, but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross-out scenes. The film, as I said, looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credits were listed thank-yous to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who don't speak French. Hence, it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting.

{"value":"Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well.<br /><br />Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. The family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event [ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. The \"3 for 1\" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian \"History Channel\" material.

{"value":"This is possibly the worst version of the play I have seen - several times on stage apart from the movie.<br /><br />A very nice idea for the set up - the American South can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round Hero's supposed misdemeanour.<br /><br />But the execution! Widdoes is a very mannered Beatrice giving a particularly poor performance. Waterston, a fine actor, is not much better as Benedict.<br /><br />The poorest performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of Dogberry and his men - but the acting makes you want to cringe.<br /><br />Successful set-ups include the scene where they fool Benedict into believing Beatrice loves him - were the acting competent it would be superb. But the use of the river and the visual humour of Benedict moving closer is well produced.<br /><br />Overall I had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn't keep my attention.<br /><br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />With respect to latter comments above I am nearly 40. I've been watching stage and screen productions of Shakespeare for over 2 decades. Might I suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact. I can assume though, from your distaste regarding youth, that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste.<br /><br />My personal favourite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage.

{"value":"Having loved 'Paris, Je T'aime', I highly anticipated this film and I admit I went in with high expectations, but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Although, I was not expecting a re-make of 'Paris' in New York I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about 'Paris' was the breakup of the neighborhoods. You got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell. In 'NY', there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who I was watching and what exactly was going on. Also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about the 'Paris' film was the different takes on love. It wasn't all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman yearning for love etc., it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. 'NY' seemed to only go for an edgy, over-the-top sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts (the older couple having spent a lifetime together, Julie Christie's short), but overall the'NY' film didn't evoke any emotion for me. I didn't connect with any of the characters like I did with 'Paris'. I remember watching 'Paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder... it just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the 'NY' film.<br /><br />Maybe if I had gone into it without having 'Paris' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a self-titled re-take of 'Paris, Je T'aime' I was sorely disappointed.","finished_norm":["have","love","pari","je","t","aim","i","highli","anticip","thi","film","and","i","admit","i","go","in","with","high","expect","but","be","sore","disappoint","for","a","numb","of","reasonsbr","br","although","i","be","not","expect","a","remak","of","pari","in","new","york","i","be","expect","the","same","structur","what","i","like","about","pari","be","the","breakup","of","the","neighborhood","you","get","a","sens","of","each","director","styl","and","the","stori","thei","want","to","tell","in","ny","there","be","no","clear","separ","of","the","stori","at","differ","point","in","the","film","charact","from","differ","stori","run","into","each","other","which","make","me","confus","a","to","who","i","be","watch","and","what","exactli","be","go","on","conjur","the","switch","in","direct","be","evid","but","confus","sinc","there","be","no","flowbr","br","anoth","thing","i","love","about","the","pari","film","be","the","differ","take","on","love","it","be","not","all","romant","there","be","love","between","parent","and","their","child","unrequit","love","a","lone","middleag","woman","yearn","for","love","etc","it","explor","so","mani","layer","of","the","complex","of","love","between","human","ny","seem","to","onli","go","for","a","edgi","overthetop","sexual","there","be","some","redeem","short","the","old","coupl","have","spend","a","lifetim","togeth","juli","christi","short","but","overal","the","ny","film","do","not","evok","ani","emot","for","me","i","do","not","connect","with","ani","of","the","charact","like","i","do","with","pari","i","rememb","watch","pari","and","feel","a","deep","sad","loneli","yearn","hope","wonder","it","just","have","so","much","soul","for","me","there","be","no","soul","in","the","ny","filmbr","br","mayb","if","i","have","go","into","it","without","have","pari","loom","in","the","back","of","my","brain","a","a","comparison","thi","film","mai","have","elicit","a","much","favor","respons","but","a","a","selftitl","retak","of","pari","je","t","aim","i","be","sore","disappoint"],"filtered":["love","pari","je","aim","highli","anticip","thi","film","admit","go","high","expect","sore","disappoint","numb","reasonsbr","br","although","expect","remak","pari","new","york","expect","structur","like","pari","breakup","neighborhood","get","sens","director","styl","stori","thei","want","tell","ny","clear","separ","stori","differ","point","film","charact","differ","stori","run","make","confus","watch","exactli","go","conjur","switch","direct","evid","confus","sinc","flowbr","br","anoth","thing","love","pari","film","differ","take","love","romant","love","parent","child","unrequit","love","lone","middleag","woman","yearn","love","etc","explor","mani","layer","complex","love","human","ny","seem","onli","go","edgi","overthetop","sexual","redeem","short","old","coupl","spend","lifetim","togeth","juli","christi","short","overal","ny","film","evok","ani","emot","connect","ani","charact","like","pari","rememb","watch","pari","feel","deep","sad","loneli","yearn","hope","wonder","much","soul","soul","ny","filmbr","br","mayb","go","without","pari","loom","back","brain","comparison","thi","film","mai","elicit","much","favor","respons","selftitl","retak","pari","je","aim","sore","disappoint"],"filtered2":["love","pari","je","aim","highli","anticip","admit","go","high","expect","sore","disappoint","numb","reasonsbr","although","expect","remak","pari","new","york","expect","structur","like","pari","breakup","neighborhood","get","sens","director","styl","stori","want","tell","ny","clear","separ","stori","differ","point","charact","differ","stori","run","make","confus","watch","exactli","go","conjur","switch","direct","evid","confus","sinc","flowbr","anoth","thing","love","pari","differ","take","love","romant","love","parent","child","unrequit","love","lone","middleag","woman","yearn","love","etc","explor","mani","layer","complex","love","human","ny","seem","onli","go","edgi","overthetop","sexual","redeem","short","old","coupl","spend","lifetim","togeth","juli","christi","short","overal","ny","evok","ani","emot","connect","ani","charact","like","pari","rememb","watch","pari","feel","deep","sad","loneli","yearn","hope","wonder","soul","soul","ny","filmbr","mayb","go","without","pari","loom","back","brain","comparison","mai","elicit","favor","respons","selftitl","retak","pari","je","aim","sore","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,7,10,11,17,27,29,31,35,37,39,43,46,50,54,58,63,66,67,70,73,87,90,102,125,130,137,162,163,173,175,180,181,187,204,211,237,253,270,272,283,290,292,380,412,427,429,455,462,483,506,516,519,566,590,634,670,673,691,767,827,834,864,896,915,1006,1015,1110,1208,1291,1472,1526,1579,1614,1691,1789,1886,1921,2041,2270,2388,2548,2573,3195,3232,3707,4578,4582,4720,5159,5294,6793,7137,8168],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"This is a good example of how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />There is very little meaningful dialog, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary.<br /><br />This movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. It includes some stock footage of real, horrible acts of violence, including war time executions. Although it works in the context of the movie, I feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak stomached or the easily offended, and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors.<br /><br />The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie. If you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it.<br /><br />The director's commentary was a one-shot, \"sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts\" type of commentary. While this isn't necessarily bad, the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college, filming conditions, co producers, bad film, and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie.<br /><br />The movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor.

{"value":"With a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler, 'The Art of Seduction' fails to deliver the romantic, sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead are \"swinging singles (or in the female lead's case, engaged)\", but 'The Art of Seduction' doesn't even try. Shirking from a frank examination of these two characters' personalities, 'The Art of Seduction' eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin, lean stereotype. <br /><br />'The Art of Seduction' is insulting - insulting to its characters, insulting to men and women, and insulting to its audiences' expectations. It takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she's pretty. Min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. Neither are nice people. The \"humour\" in this film primarily revolve around Ji-wan and Min-jun's outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation. No character development occurs, and we never learn why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like this. We are simply expected to take them as they are, and not ask questions - they're cute!, and that's all that matters. The copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester's reviews may tip you off to 'Art of Seduction's shallowness. <br /><br />If you're still in high school, you liked Grease, or you are a yellow fever victim, you may like this movie.<br /><br />Despite its \"Romance\" tag, this is not a very good date movie.","finished_norm":["with","a","stori","and","screenplai","that","seem","to","have","be","write","by","a","high","schooler","the","art","of","seduct","fail","to","deliv","the","romant","sophist","experi","it","try","to","bill","itself","a","the","two","main","charact","have","the","potenti","to","be","interest","both","male","and","femal","lead","be","swing","singl","or","in","the","femal","lead","case","engag","but","the","art","of","seduct","doe","not","even","try","shirk","from","a","frank","examin","of","thi","two","charact","person","the","art","of","seduct","eschew","anyth","of","substanc","for","a","basi","of","thin","lean","stereotyp","br","br","the","art","of","seduct","be","insult","insult","to","it","charact","insult","to","man","and","woman","and","insult","to","it","audienc","expect","it","take","the","aw","beauti","peopl","we","all","know","and","plai","out","their","pain","interact","while","expect","u","to","idol","them","jiwan","be","a","immatur","spoil","manipul","bitch","the","viewer","be","expect","to","like","and","forgiv","her","flaw","becaus","she","pretti","minjun","good","he","exactli","the","same","neither","be","nice","peopl","the","humour","in","thi","film","primarili","revolv","around","jiwan","and","minjun","outlandish","attempt","at","outdo","each","other","in","the","honour","art","of","lie","and","manipul","no","charact","develop","occur","and","we","never","learn","why","jiwan","and","minjun","be","like","thi","we","be","simpli","expect","to","take","them","a","thei","be","and","not","ask","question","thei","re","cute","and","that","all","that","matter","the","copiou","refer","to","the","celebr","of","the","main","actor","in","azn","cinema","scenest","review","mai","tip","you","off","to","art","of","seduct","shallow","br","br","if","you","re","still","in","high","school","you","like","greas","or","you","be","a","yellow","fever","victim","you","mai","like","thi","moviebr","br","despit","it","romanc","tag","thi","be","not","a","veri","good","date","movi"],"filtered":["stori","screenplai","seem","write","high","schooler","art","seduct","fail","deliv","romant","sophist","experi","try","bill","two","main","charact","potenti","interest","male","femal","lead","swing","singl","femal","lead","case","engag","art","seduct","doe","even","try","shirk","frank","examin","thi","two","charact","person","art","seduct","eschew","anyth","substanc","basi","thin","lean","stereotyp","br","br","art","seduct","insult","insult","charact","insult","man","woman","insult","audienc","expect","take","aw","beauti","peopl","know","plai","pain","interact","expect","u","idol","jiwan","immatur","spoil","manipul","bitch","viewer","expect","like","forgiv","flaw","becaus","pretti","minjun","good","exactli","neither","nice","peopl","humour","thi","film","primarili","revolv","around","jiwan","minjun","outlandish","attempt","outdo","honour","art","lie","manipul","charact","develop","occur","never","learn","jiwan","minjun","like","thi","simpli","expect","take","thei","ask","question","thei","re","cute","matter","copiou","refer","celebr","main","actor","azn","cinema","scenest","review","mai","tip","art","seduct","shallow","br","br","re","still","high","school","like","greas","yellow","fever","victim","mai","like","thi","moviebr","br","despit","romanc","tag","thi","veri","good","date","movi"],"filtered2":["stori","screenplai","seem","write","high","schooler","art","seduct","fail","deliv","romant","sophist","experi","try","bill","two","main","charact","potenti","interest","male","femal","lead","swing","singl","femal","lead","case","engag","art","seduct","doe","even","try","shirk","frank","examin","two","charact","person","art","seduct","eschew","anyth","substanc","basi","thin","lean","stereotyp","art","seduct","insult","insult","charact","insult","man","woman","insult","audienc","expect","take","aw","beauti","peopl","know","plai","pain","interact","expect","u","idol","jiwan","immatur","spoil","manipul","bitch","viewer","expect","like","forgiv","flaw","becaus","pretti","minjun","good","exactli","neither","nice","peopl","humour","primarili","revolv","around","jiwan","minjun","outlandish","attempt","outdo","honour","art","lie","manipul","charact","develop","occur","never","learn","jiwan","minjun","like","simpli","expect","take","ask","question","re","cute","matter","copiou","refer","celebr","main","actor","azn","cinema","scenest","review","mai","tip","art","seduct","shallow","re","still","high","school","like","greas","yellow","fever","victim","mai","like","moviebr","despit","romanc","tag","veri","good","date"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,10,15,17,18,22,23,26,31,35,36,40,41,42,45,46,47,60,64,65,68,70,78,98,104,112,130,138,153,157,168,176,177,179,201,211,215,262,279,288,296,306,320,325,333,378,382,391,409,422,431,443,458,462,465,517,535,547,604,647,649,650,703,709,715,718,722,855,864,892,923,943,980,1150,1193,1235,1259,1311,1434,1435,1500,1539,1686,1797,1913,2032,2498,2525,2829,2835,2908,3020,303

{"value":"I have always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure \"The Incredible Melting Man\" would be a lot of fun.<br /><br />It really wasn't. I mean, the acting was entertainingly bad, the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor, so I should have loved it. Unfortunately it's really draggy between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. That's how boring this film is.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the Fat Nurse, and the stellar acting of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor man, he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face - like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the I M Man:<br /><br />\"I'll find him with a geiger counter.\" \"Is he radioactive?\" \"Just a little bit.\" <br /><br />Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He's a brave man. Unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree. \"Oh god - it's his ear!\" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I'm so glad he cleared that up. <br /><br />I realise I'm making this movie sound rather fun. It would be if it were only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it, just don't have pop-tarts during the movie, because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end.","finished_norm":["i","have","alwai","want","to","see","thi","becaus","i","love","cheesi","horror","movi","and","with","a","titl","like","thi","i","be","sure","the","incred","melt","man","would","be","a","lot","of","funbr","br","it","realli","be","not","i","mean","the","act","be","entertainingli","bad","the","script","contain","some","classic","bad","line","and","the","special","effect","look","like","someon","have","sneez","all","over","the","lead","actor","so","i","should","have","love","it","unfortun","it","realli","draggi","between","thi","highlight","i","decid","to","watch","the","last","half","of","the","movi","while","do","my","tax","return","that","how","bore","thi","film","isbr","br","nevertheless","if","you","love","bad","movi","you","will","enjoi","the","dramat","exit","of","the","fat","nurs","and","the","stellar","act","of","the","gui","who","plai","dr","ted","to","be","fair","to","the","poor","man","he","doe","have","to","deliv","some","amazingli","inept","line","with","straight","face","like","the","convers","he","have","with","hi","wife","on","track","down","the","i","be","manbr","br","i","will","find","him","with","a","geiger","counter","be","he","radioact","just","a","littl","bite","br","br","ye","the","plot","have","dr","ted","wander","about","try","to","find","a","superstrong","zombi","kill","machin","arm","onli","with","what","look","like","a","minidyson","he","a","brave","man","unfortun","hi","plan","fail","when","he","find","a","big","lot","of","goop","on","a","tree","oh","god","it","hi","ear","sai","dr","ted","to","the","audienc","i","be","so","glad","he","clear","that","up","br","br","i","realis","i","be","make","thi","movi","sound","rather","fun","it","would","be","if","it","be","onli","minut","long","but","unfortun","it","go","on","and","on","and","the","incred","melt","dude","just","dangl","about","make","a","sticki","mess","when","he","should","be","eat","much","peopl","in","my","opinion","i","think","if","you","be","truli","stone","you","would","probabl","love","it","just","do","not","have","poptart","dure","the","movi","becaus","the","lead","actor","realli","doe","resembl","on","near","the","end"],"filtered":["alwai","want","see","thi","becaus","love","cheesi","horror","movi","titl","like","thi","sure","incred","melt","man","lot","funbr","br","realli","mean","act","entertainingli","bad","script","contain","classic","bad","line","special","effect","look","like","someon","sneez","lead","actor","love","unfortun","realli","draggi","thi","highlight","decid","watch","last","half","movi","tax","return","bore","thi","film","isbr","br","nevertheless","love","bad","movi","enjoi","dramat","exit","fat","nurs","stellar","act","gui","plai","dr","ted","fair","poor","man","doe","deliv","amazingli","inept","line","straight","face","like","convers","hi","wife","track","manbr","br","find","geiger","counter","radioact","littl","bite","br","br","ye","plot","dr","ted","wander","try","find","superstrong","zombi","kill","machin","arm","onli","look","like","minidyson","brave","man","unfortun","hi","plan","fail","find","big","lot","goop","tree","oh","god","hi","ear","sai","dr","ted","audienc","glad","clear","br","br","realis","make","thi","movi","sound","rather","fun","onli","minut","long","unfortun","go","incred","melt","dude","dangl","make","sticki","mess","eat","much","peopl","opinion","think","truli","stone","probabl","love","poptart","dure","movi","becaus","lead","actor","realli","doe","resembl","near","end"],"filtered2":["alwai","want","see","becaus","love","cheesi","horror","titl","like","sure","incred","melt","man","lot","funbr","realli","mean","act","entertainingli","bad","script","contain","classic","bad","line","special","effect","look","like","someon","sneez","lead","actor","love","unfortun","realli","draggi","highlight","decid","watch","last","half","tax","return","bore","isbr","nevertheless","love","bad","enjoi","dramat","exit","fat","nurs","stellar","act","gui","plai","dr","ted","fair","poor","man","doe","deliv","amazingli","inept","line","straight","face","like","convers","wife","track","manbr","find","geiger","counter","radioact","littl","bite","ye","plot","dr","ted","wander","try","find","superstrong","zombi","kill","machin","arm","onli","look","like","minidyson","brave","man","unfortun","plan","fail","find","big","lot","goop","tree","oh","god","ear","dr","ted","audienc","glad","clear","realis","make","sound","rather","fun","onli","minut","long","unfortun","go","incred","melt","dude","dangl","make","sticki","mess","eat","peopl","opinion","think","truli","stone","probabl","love","poptart","dure","becaus","lead","actor","realli","doe","resembl","near","end"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,9,11,12,13,14,16,18,21,22,23,24,32,36,37,38,40,41,45,54,55,59,72,76,77,82,83,88,99,106,107,108,119,139,144,146,148,154,157,160,168,178,197,200,203,206,209,215,227,234,239,249,251,259,263,264,268,332,342,352,407,488,517,538,543,548,555,581,590,599,711,739,756,867,877,992,1053,

{"value":"This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to Florida for a vacation. On their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on. The girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved. She becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened. The other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell. The deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually WANTS to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene I admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller \"Blood Song\" with Frankie Avalon staring in it, the same motive just a different character part. It's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80's low-budget movie and the ending was the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money

{"value":"Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. Thus, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. It's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director, and given Medak's talents in the film The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain. He's probably quite thankful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned, so that he can keep this off his resume. Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher but he and Seller both look pretty desperate, with even Sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible. They had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it. With lines like these, I can understand any possible unease:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />And that's one of the GOOD jokes. It's amazing to me that much of Sellers prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well-received British TV program \"A Show Called Fred\" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester?","finished_norm":["peter","seller","plai","dick","scratcher","haha","a","cook","for","a","pirat","ship","who","take","over","a","captain","after","he","murder","the","previou","on","although","he","wit","a","treasur","be","buri","he","begin","lose","hi","memori","and","the","treasur","map","he","obtain","becom","blank","thu","dick","be","forc","to","find","someon","who","can","see","and","commun","with","ghost","do","you","place","a","ad","for","that","and","help","lead","a","path","to","the","treasur","it","mind","boggl","how","anyon","can","have","bankrol","thi","pointless","film","former","goon","spike","milligan","replac","medak","a","director","and","give","medak","talent","in","the","film","the","rule","class","you","can","probabl","guess","which","of","the","graini","poorli","light","scene","have","milligan","in","the","director","chair","peter","boyl","make","a","brief","appear","in","the","film","minut","a","the","doom","pirat","captain","he","probabl","quit","thank","that","young","frankenstein","be","releas","the","same","year","thi","be","film","and","can","so","that","he","can","keep","thi","off","hi","resum","franciosa","look","dash","a","the","handsom","powerbehindscratch","but","he","and","seller","both","look","pretti","desper","with","even","seller","makeup","and","hair","look","quit","terribl","thei","have","to","know","thi","movi","be","bomb","even","a","thei","be","film","it","with","line","like","thi","i","can","understand","ani","possibl","uneasebr","br","pierr","about","to","be","hang","you","will","pai","for","thisbr","br","scratcher","no","i","wo","not","i","will","do","it","for","freebr","br","and","that","on","of","the","good","joke","it","amaz","to","me","that","much","of","seller","prolif","materi","be","still","in","the","vault","but","thi","be","make","avail","on","vh","much","than","year","ago","how","about","someon","step","up","to","the","plate","and","releas","in","the","u","the","wellreceiv","british","tv","program","a","show","call","fred","star","seller","milligan","and","direct","by","the","great","richard","lester"],"filtered":["peter","seller","plai","dick","scratcher","haha","cook","pirat","ship","take","captain","murder","previou","although","wit","treasur","buri","begin","lose","hi","memori","treasur","map","obtain","becom","blank","thu","dick","forc","find","someon","see","commun","ghost","place","ad","help","lead","path","treasur","mind","boggl","anyon","bankrol","thi","pointless","film","former","goon","spike","milligan","replac","medak","director","give","medak","talent","film","rule","class","probabl","guess","graini","poorli","light","scene","milligan","director","chair","peter","boyl","make","brief","appear","film","minut","doom","pirat","captain","probabl","quit","thank","young","frankenstein","releas","year","thi","film","keep","thi","hi","resum","franciosa","look","dash","handsom","powerbehindscratch","seller","look","pretti","desper","even","seller","makeup","hair","look","quit","terribl","thei","know","thi","movi","bomb","even","thei","film","line","like","thi","understand","ani","possibl","uneasebr","br","pierr","hang","pai","thisbr","br","scratcher","wo","freebr","br","good","joke","amaz","much","seller","prolif","materi","still","vault","thi","make","avail","vh","much","year","ago","someon","step","plate","releas","u","wellreceiv","british","tv","program","show","call","fred","star","seller","milligan","direct","great","richard","lester"],"filtered2":["peter","seller","plai","dick","scratcher","haha","cook","pirat","ship","take","captain","murder","previou","although","wit","treasur","buri","begin","lose","memori","treasur","map","obtain","becom","blank","thu","dick","forc","find","someon","see","commun","ghost","place","ad","help","lead","path","treasur","mind","boggl","anyon","bankrol","pointless","former","goon","spike","milligan","replac","medak","director","give","medak","talent","rule","class","probabl","guess","graini","poorli","light","scene","milligan","director","chair","peter","boyl","make","brief","appear","minut","doom","pirat","captain","probabl","quit","thank","young","frankenstein","releas","year","keep","resum","franciosa","look","dash","handsom","powerbehindscratch","seller","look","pretti","desper","even","seller","makeup","hair","look","quit","terribl","know","bomb","even","line","like","understand","ani","possibl","uneasebr","pierr","hang","pai","thisbr","scratcher","wo","freebr","good","joke","amaz","seller","prolif","materi","still","vault","make","avail","vh","year","ago","someon","step","plate","releas","u","wellreceiv","british","tv","program","show","call","fred","star","seller","milligan","direct","great","richard","lester"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,16,19,26,27,28,30,31,38,40,51,57,58,59,64,78,100,102,107,112,115,120,134,135,139,142,147,148,157,158,164,166,170,172,185,212,214,221,237,238,243,273,276,322,327,338,353,398,402,406,531,537,610,628,641,651,685,696,727,760,784,788,813,848,85

{"value":"Given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings, the girls in this film would be collecting Gold, Silver and Bronze at a Darwin Awards Olympic ceremony. A mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did, and would have screamed a lot less while doing so.<br /><br />If you like films with a grainy picture, deliberately amateur camera-work (my 92 year-old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results), extremely poor sound and no discernible plot/narrative, then this is your ideal film. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women whining for no reason. In fact reason and logic don't appear much in this film. For example: \"we have to find Stephanie\" \"yeah I can't believe I was speaking to her, like, last night\" \"she called you last night?\" \"yeah, she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one\" \"WHAT? How come she didn't tell me\"? As in, our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but I have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me she was going on a date.<br /><br />Okay, so the budget is low. That doesn't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget. The 'score' is interesting since all - with the exception of one - tracks have been written and performed by the writers/directors of the film itself. In fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden.<br /><br />The most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel.","finished_norm":["give","that","a","lot","of","horror","film","be","base","on","the","premis","that","on","or","much","of","the","central","charact","doe","someth","stupid","at","some","stage","dure","the","proceed","the","girl","in","thi","film","would","be","collect","gold","silver","and","bronz","at","a","darwin","award","olymp","ceremoni","a","mental","disabl","baboon","would","have","make","well","choic","than","thei","do","and","would","have","scream","a","lot","littl","while","do","sobr","br","if","you","like","film","with","a","graini","pictur","deliber","amateur","camerawork","my","yearold","grandmoth","wield","a","camcord","with","well","result","extrem","poor","sound","and","no","discern","plotnarr","then","thi","be","your","ideal","film","conjur","note","that","you","should","enjoi","the","follow","woman","scream","for","no","reason","woman","whine","for","no","reason","in","fact","reason","and","logic","do","not","appear","much","in","thi","film","for","exampl","we","have","to","find","stephani","ye","i","ca","not","believ","i","be","speak","to","her","like","last","night","she","call","you","last","night","ye","she","want","to","talk","about","some","date","she","get","ask","on","what","how","come","she","do","not","tell","me","a","in","our","friend","be","be","chase","by","a","serial","killer","with","a","shotgun","and","a","arrai","of","grisli","weapon","but","i","have","a","problem","with","the","fact","that","she","do","not","tell","me","she","be","go","on","a","datebr","br","okai","so","the","budget","be","low","that","doe","not","mean","you","have","to","make","it","look","like","it","cost","half","the","budget","the","score","be","interest","sinc","all","with","the","except","of","on","track","have","be","write","and","perform","by","the","writersdirector","of","the","film","itself","in","fact","it","would","appear","that","the","entir","budget","have","be","blow","on","sampl","a","track","by","the","duskfal","a","death","metal","band","from","swedenbr","br","the","much","worri","thing","of","all","in","the","entir","film","be","the","end","which","leav","u","with","the","possibl","for","a","sequel"],"filtered":["give","lot","horror","film","base","premis","much","central","charact","doe","someth","stupid","stage","dure","proceed","girl","thi","film","collect","gold","silver","bronz","darwin","award","olymp","ceremoni","mental","disabl","baboon","make","well","choic","thei","scream","lot","littl","sobr","br","like","film","graini","pictur","deliber","amateur","camerawork","yearold","grandmoth","wield","camcord","well","result","extrem","poor","sound","discern","plotnarr","thi","ideal","film","conjur","note","enjoi","follow","woman","scream","reason","woman","whine","reason","fact","reason","logic","appear","much","thi","film","exampl","find","stephani","ye","ca","believ","speak","like","last","night","call","last","night","ye","want","talk","date","get","ask","come","tell","friend","chase","serial","killer","shotgun","arrai","grisli","weapon","problem","fact","tell","go","datebr","br","okai","budget","low","doe","mean","make","look","like","cost","half","budget","score","interest","sinc","except","track","write","perform","writersdirector","film","fact","appear","entir","budget","blow","sampl","track","duskfal","death","metal","band","swedenbr","br","much","worri","thing","entir","film","end","leav","u","possibl","sequel"],"filtered2":["give","lot","horror","base","premis","central","charact","doe","someth","stupid","stage","dure","proceed","girl","collect","gold","silver","bronz","darwin","award","olymp","ceremoni","mental","disabl","baboon","make","well","choic","scream","lot","littl","sobr","like","graini","pictur","deliber","amateur","camerawork","yearold","grandmoth","wield","camcord","well","result","extrem","poor","sound","discern","plotnarr","ideal","conjur","note","enjoi","follow","woman","scream","reason","woman","whine","reason","fact","reason","logic","appear","exampl","find","stephani","ye","ca","believ","speak","like","last","night","call","last","night","ye","want","talk","date","get","ask","come","tell","friend","chase","serial","killer","shotgun","arrai","grisli","weapon","problem","fact","tell","go","datebr","okai","budget","low","doe","mean","make","look","like","cost","half","budget","score","interest","sinc","except","track","write","perform","writersdirector","fact","appear","entir","budget","blow","sampl","track","duskfal","death","metal","band","swedenbr","worri","thing","entir","end","leav","u","possibl","sequel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,10,14,16,18,20,24,29,30,34,37,38,39,53,60,65,70,72,74,81,83,84,88,90,91,95,97,105,112,136,142,144,146,161,162,167,170,178,186,191,198,200,206,209,210,217,232,239,245,252,256,260,306,307,311,329,334,344,387,402,447,484,518,526,530,560,647,669,754,809,836,867,911,927,973,1004,1026,1134,1158,1263,1279,1404,1645,1800,2105,2139,2386,2666,2697,2750,2888,2896,3215,3552,3580,3704,3737,3741,3828,4564,

{"value":"Good grief I can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Let's face it, a PG-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. <br /><br />We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. And here's a turnup for the books... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. <br /><br />On top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. I'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.<br /><br />Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? <br /><br />Closets, that's what. <br /><br />Lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to Narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. In fact this movie should have just been called \"CLOSET\", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case. On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: \"what the f*@! did we just waste our time

{"value":"I am not so much like Love Sick as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.Ending up was sad.<br /><br />The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday 12:00PM on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.<br /><br />On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting for. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The \"ear piercing \" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love.

{"value":"I am not so much like Love Sick as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, Alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.Ending up was sad.<br /><br />The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theatre on Sunday 12:00PM on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.<br /><br />On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after Alex moved into the building which Kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting for. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The \"ear piercing \" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love.
