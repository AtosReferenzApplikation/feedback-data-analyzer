{"value":"I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him, he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a $50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a children's birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the $50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out.","finished_norm":["i","get","to","see","a","earli","preview","of","thi","movi","and","i","hope","thei","have","time","to","edit","it","in","what","ever","wai","thei","can","to","improv","on","it","befor","it","come","out","aug","rd","it","star","andi","samberg","from","saturdai","night","live","a","hot","rod","kimbl","he","plai","a","teenag","in","a","small","town","who","want","to","be","a","stunt","man","like","hi","late","father","when","we","meet","him","he","jump","a","mail","truck","on","hi","mope","ye","a","mope","and","almost","make","it","thi","would","be","worthi","of","a","jackass","movi","if","he","be","not","honestli","try","to","do","thi","isla","fisher","plai","the","slightli","old","and","much","much","matur","girlnextdoor","denis","she","seem","to","like","rod","enough","to","join","hi","crow","jorma","taccon","conjur","snl","plai","hi","half","brother","kevin","who","docum","the","stunt","with","a","camcord","sissi","spacek","plai","rod","mom","mari","she","remarri","frank","powel","plai","by","ian","mcshane","frank","a","real","tough","gui","who","enjoi","beat","rod","in","some","real","drag","out","brawl","it","clear","that","rod","not","go","to","earn","frank","respect","till","he","can","beat","him","we","find","out","frank","ne","a","heart","transplant","and","rod","be","determin","to","rais","the","monei","just","so","he","can","beat","hi","ass","onc","he","heal","and","prove","himself","a","man","a","long","fall","down","a","mountain","side","convinc","rod","to","go","big","on","on","stunt","rod","set","out","to","get","se","monei","by","charg","for","do","stunt","that","would","make","you","cring","if","you","see","them","in","real","life","like","the","human","torch","at","a","child","birthdai","parti","there","be","that","at","the","show","who","manag","to","laugh","at","much","of","the","stunt","just","when","all","hope","and","monei","be","lose","along","come","a","sponsor","who","save","the","dai","by","get","the","school","bu","rod","want","to","jump","he","get","exclus","broadcast","right","and","set","up","phone","line","to","get","donat","rod","get","a","new","outfit","and","a","real","motorcycl","the","whole","town","turn","out","and","the","world","tune","in","doe","he","make","the","jump","doe","he","get","the","girl","do","thei","rais","the","k","doe","frank","get","hi","ass","beat","by","rod","wait","till","thi","minut","movi","come","out","on","video","to","find","out"],"filtered":["get","see","earli","preview","thi","movi","hope","thei","time","edit","ever","wai","thei","improv","befor","come","aug","rd","star","andi","samberg","saturdai","night","live","hot","rod","kimbl","plai","teenag","small","town","want","stunt","man","like","hi","late","father","meet","jump","mail","truck","hi","mope","ye","mope","almost","make","thi","worthi","jackass","movi","honestli","try","thi","isla","fisher","plai","slightli","old","much","much","matur","girlnextdoor","denis","seem","like","rod","enough","join","hi","crow","jorma","taccon","conjur","snl","plai","hi","half","brother","kevin","docum","stunt","camcord","sissi","spacek","plai","rod","mom","mari","remarri","frank","powel","plai","ian","mcshane","frank","real","tough","gui","enjoi","beat","rod","real","drag","brawl","clear","rod","go","earn","frank","respect","till","beat","find","frank","ne","heart","transplant","rod","determin","rais","monei","beat","hi","ass","onc","heal","prove","man","long","fall","mountain","side","convinc","rod","go","big","stunt","rod","set","get","se","monei","charg","stunt","make","cring","see","real","life","like","human","torch","child","birthdai","parti","show","manag","laugh","much","stunt","hope","monei","lose","along","come","sponsor","save","dai","get","school","bu","rod","want","jump","get","exclus","broadcast","right","set","phone","line","get","donat","rod","get","new","outfit","real","motorcycl","whole","town","turn","world","tune","doe","make","jump","doe","get","girl","thei","rais","k","doe","frank","get","hi","ass","beat","rod","wait","till","thi","minut","movi","come","video","find"],"filtered2":["get","see","earli","preview","hope","time","edit","ever","wai","improv","befor","come","aug","rd","star","andi","samberg","saturdai","night","live","hot","rod","kimbl","plai","teenag","small","town","want","stunt","man","like","late","father","meet","jump","mail","truck","mope","ye","mope","almost","make","worthi","jackass","honestli","try","isla","fisher","plai","slightli","old","matur","girlnextdoor","denis","seem","like","rod","enough","join","crow","jorma","taccon","conjur","snl","plai","half","brother","kevin","docum","stunt","camcord","sissi","spacek","plai","rod","mom","mari","remarri","frank","powel","plai","ian","mcshane","frank","real","tough","gui","enjoi","beat","rod","real","drag","brawl","clear","rod","go","earn","frank","respect","till","beat","find","frank","ne","heart","transplant","rod","determin","rais","monei","beat","ass","onc","heal","prove","man","long","fall","m

{"value":"Vulpine Massacre should have been this movies actual title. And the tag-line should have read \"Guaranteed to make your kids CRY!\" This is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. Starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them. The only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den, giving insight into the animals loves and lives... Lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals. Sounds good huh? Well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core...<br /><br />*** Spoilers Below - Or they it may be a Warning!***<br /><br />Almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind. But seems to get along well enough and there's a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him... And then he dies... Next we have one of the siblings adventures. And then he dies... One of the sisters gets her screen-time... and then she dies...And so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature, in traps, just up and vanish, and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! By the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred. Though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen. (Least not in the version we saw.) Unlike say \"Tarka the Otter\" the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It is a nature film after all. But not nearly the whole family.<br /><br />Do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids. Watch it with some foreknowledge that things are *not* going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are. You may enjoy it. Or you may not...","finished_norm":["vulpin","massacr","should","have","be","thi","movi","actual","titl","and","the","taglin","should","have","read","guarante","to","make","your","kid","cry","thi","be","a","natur","drama","tell","the","stori","of","a","famili","of","wild","fox","in","a","remot","region","start","with","the","meet","and","pair","of","two","young","fox","and","the","eventu","birth","of","a","larg","famili","and","the","trial","of","rais","them","the","onli","speak","be","do","in","narr","by","a","tree","that","stand","over","the","den","give","insight","into","the","anim","love","and","live","love","sceneri","and","gorgeou","film","of","the","anim","sound","good","huh","good","from","there","thing","go","straight","to","hell","and","then","start","drill","toward","the","corebr","br","spoiler","below","or","thei","it","mai","be","a","warningbr","br","almost","off","we","learn","on","of","the","fox","be","bear","blind","but","seem","to","get","along","good","enough","and","there","a","beautifulli","cheer","music","score","to","accompani","him","and","then","he","die","next","we","have","on","of","the","sibl","adventur","and","then","he","die","on","of","the","sister","get","her","screentim","and","then","she","diesand","so","it","go","like","some","horrif","slasher","movi","a","on","fox","after","anoth","be","kill","off","by","natur","in","trap","just","up","and","vanish","and","even","by","a","bunch","of","snowmobil","by","the","end","of","the","movi","almost","all","the","fox","have","be","massacr","though","mercifulli","no","death","be","show","on","screen","littl","not","in","the","version","we","see","unlik","sai","tarka","the","otter","the","death","in","thi","movi","be","almost","all","pointless","and","border","on","the","sadist","in","the","wai","hope","be","build","up","and","then","snuff","out","on","or","two","loss","would","have","be","accept","it","be","a","natur","film","after","all","but","not","nearli","the","whole","familybr","br","do","not","go","to","see","thi","film","deceiv","by","the","cheeri","box","into","think","it","safe","for","the","kid","watch","it","with","some","foreknowledg","that","thing","be","not","go","to","go","good","at","all","and","that","you","or","your","kid","mai","be","leav","feel","veri","badli","depend","on","how","sensit","you","or","thei","be","you","mai","enjoi","it","or","you","mai","not"],"filtered":["vulpin","massacr","thi","movi","actual","titl","taglin","read","guarante","make","kid","cry","thi","natur","drama","tell","stori","famili","wild","fox","remot","region","start","meet","pair","two","young","fox","eventu","birth","larg","famili","trial","rais","onli","speak","narr","tree","stand","den","give","insight","anim","love","live","love","sceneri","gorgeou","film","anim","sound","good","huh","good","thing","go","straight","hell","start","drill","toward","corebr","br","spoiler","thei","mai","warningbr","br","almost","learn","fox","bear","blind","seem","get","along","good","enough","beautifulli","cheer","music","score","accompani","die","next","sibl","adventur","die","sister","get","screentim","diesand","go","like","horrif","slasher","movi","fox","anoth","kill","natur","trap","vanish","even","bunch","snowmobil","end","movi","almost","fox","massacr","though","mercifulli","death","show","screen","littl","version","see","unlik","sai","tarka","otter","death","thi","movi","almost","pointless","border","sadist","wai","hope","build","snuff","two","loss","accept","natur","film","nearli","whole","familybr","br","go","see","thi","film","deceiv","cheeri","box","think","safe","kid","watch","foreknowledg","thing","go","go","good","kid","mai","leav","feel","veri","badli","depend","sensit","thei","mai","enjoi","mai"],"filtered2":["vulpin","massacr","actual","titl","taglin","read","guarante","make","kid","cry","natur","drama","tell","stori","famili","wild","fox","remot","region","start","meet","pair","two","young","fox","eventu","birth","larg","famili","trial","rais","onli","speak","narr","tree","stand","den","give","insight","anim","love","live","love","sceneri","gorgeou","anim","sound","good","huh","good","thing","go","straight","hell","start","drill","toward","corebr","spoiler","mai","warningbr","almost","learn","fox","bear","blind","seem","get","along","good","enough","beautifulli","cheer","music","score","accompani","die","next","sibl","adventur","die","sister","get","screentim","diesand","go","like","horrif","slasher","fox","anoth","kill","natur","trap","vanish","even","bunch","snowmobil","end","almost","fox","massacr","though","mercifulli","death","show","screen","littl","version","see","unlik","tarka","otter","death","almost","pointless","border","sadist","wai","hope","build","snuff","two","loss","accept","natur","nearli","whole","familybr","go","see","deceiv","cheeri","box","think","safe","kid","watch","foreknowledg","thing","go","go","good","kid","mai","leav","feel","veri","badli","depend","sensit","mai","enjoi","mai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indic

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike-team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above. However the night before they're due to strike, they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength. With the French police dallying around with their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible himself, only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person's DNA and gives them terrifying new strength.<br /><br />Bad cover. Bad title. Bad post-production tampering. And bad trailer. Pretty bad film. But, I've got to say, I don't think Attack Force is quite his worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (perhaps not Steveday!) but I think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself.<br /><br />I must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as I'd been lead to believe. The dubbing there was (which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as I'd thought. The plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called Harvester that went on. Also as another reviewer noted, the film has a nice Gothic look to it, a new touch for a Seagal film.<br /><br />The absolute killer low point, though, was the complete and total lack of any exciting action, with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun.<br /><br />I have to be honest, though, I would rather watch this again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill.

{"value":"I'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I had expected), this movie had all of those qualities. <br /><br />The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, though, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done.<br /><br />The acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been, having been based directly on H.G. Wells' book. For having such good source material, it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny. And then there's the mustache... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half the movie contains acting. The rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots.<br /><br />To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes, the bad green screening, it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie. I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /><br />My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies over, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you'll make it all the way through. It does make for an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","realli","sure","how","to","even","begin","to","describ","how","bad","thi","movi","be","i","like","bad","film","a","thei","be","often","the","much","entertain","i","love","bad","special","effect","bad","act","bad","music","and","inept","direct","with","the","except","of","the","music","which","be","well","than","i","have","expect","thi","movi","have","all","of","that","qualiti","br","br","the","special","effect","be","amazingli","bad","the","wrong","i","have","see","sinc","my","nintendo","some","scene","to","watch","for","includ","the","thunderchild","the","woman","be","crush","by","the","mechan","foot","the","big","ben","scene","the","train","wreck","wow","there","be","so","mani","bad","effect","on","the","plu","side","though","some","scene","of","the","alien","walker","be","good","donebr","br","the","act","be","about","a","bad","a","it","can","possibli","have","be","have","be","base","directli","on","hg","well","book","for","have","such","good","sourc","materi","it","almost","a","though","the","actor","be","try","to","be","so","overthetop","a","to","make","it","funni","and","then","there","the","mustach","the","singl","much","distract","piec","of","facial","hair","i","have","see","in","a","long","time","of","cours","onli","half","the","movi","contain","act","the","rest","be","charact","walk","around","aimlessli","and","poorli","render","effect","shotsbr","br","to","sai","that","timothi","hine","be","a","inept","director","would","be","a","injustic","to","inept","director","with","the","us","of","differ","color","filter","between","shot","for","no","particular","reason","the","us","of","poorli","render","background","for","even","insid","scene","the","bad","green","screen","it","amaz","to","me","how","thi","man","ever","get","approv","to","direct","a","movi","i","would","not","imagin","it","would","be","possibl","to","turn","a","brilliant","book","into","thi","bad","a","movi","bravo","mr","hine","bravo","br","br","my","advic","to","anyon","who","plan","to","see","thi","movi","be","to","do","what","i","do","have","some","friend","who","enjoi","bad","movi","over","drink","plai","poker","while","watch","it","keep","drink","and","mayb","you","will","make","it","all","the","wai","through","it","doe","make","for","a","excel","bad","movi","so","have","fun","and","laugh","yourself","silli","with","thi","disast"],"filtered":["realli","sure","even","begin","describ","bad","thi","movi","like","bad","film","thei","often","much","entertain","love","bad","special","effect","bad","act","bad","music","inept","direct","except","music","well","expect","thi","movi","qualiti","br","br","special","effect","amazingli","bad","wrong","see","sinc","nintendo","scene","watch","includ","thunderchild","woman","crush","mechan","foot","big","ben","scene","train","wreck","wow","mani","bad","effect","plu","side","though","scene","alien","walker","good","donebr","br","act","bad","possibli","base","directli","hg","well","book","good","sourc","materi","almost","though","actor","try","overthetop","make","funni","mustach","singl","much","distract","piec","facial","hair","see","long","time","cours","onli","half","movi","contain","act","rest","charact","walk","around","aimlessli","poorli","render","effect","shotsbr","br","sai","timothi","hine","inept","director","injustic","inept","director","us","differ","color","filter","shot","particular","reason","us","poorli","render","background","even","insid","scene","bad","green","screen","amaz","thi","man","ever","get","approv","direct","movi","imagin","possibl","turn","brilliant","book","thi","bad","movi","bravo","mr","hine","bravo","br","br","advic","anyon","plan","see","thi","movi","friend","enjoi","bad","movi","drink","plai","poker","watch","keep","drink","mayb","make","wai","doe","make","excel","bad","movi","fun","laugh","silli","thi","disast"],"filtered2":["realli","sure","even","begin","describ","bad","like","bad","often","entertain","love","bad","special","effect","bad","act","bad","music","inept","direct","except","music","well","expect","qualiti","special","effect","amazingli","bad","wrong","see","sinc","nintendo","scene","watch","includ","thunderchild","woman","crush","mechan","foot","big","ben","scene","train","wreck","wow","mani","bad","effect","plu","side","though","scene","alien","walker","good","donebr","act","bad","possibli","base","directli","hg","well","book","good","sourc","materi","almost","though","actor","try","overthetop","make","funni","mustach","singl","distract","piec","facial","hair","see","long","time","cours","onli","half","contain","act","rest","charact","walk","around","aimlessli","poorli","render","effect","shotsbr","timothi","hine","inept","director","injustic","inept","director","us","differ","color","filter","shot","particular","reason","us","poorli","render","background","even","insid","scene","bad","green","screen","amaz","man","ever","get","approv","direct","imagin","possibl","turn","brilliant","book","bad","bravo","mr","

{"value":"Well, I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler's 2001 opus, \"The Double-D Avenger,\" is that it manages to unite three of Russ Meyer's mammarian marvels--Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix--in one picture. (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing...or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there's plenty of it), is that this film--if it can even be called that, having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire, a total abortion, an out-and-out atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst pictures that I have ever seen. Look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, such as it is, deals with Kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oy), and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in L.A. Too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat, that there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all (other than some old photos of Kitten in her heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX. The Meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), does manage to, uh, stand out nicely. So why have I given this juvenile, unfunny, failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice-over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word \"breast\" from the 1,000+ on his Web site's \"Canonical Hooters List.\" The man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status!","finished_norm":["good","i","suppos","the","good","new","concern","william","winckler","opu","the","doubl","aveng","be","that","it","manag","to","unit","three","of","russ","meyer","mammarian","marvelskitten","natividad","haji","and","raven","de","la","croixin","on","pictur","i","can","onli","assum","that","lorna","maitland","tura","satana","and","babett","bardot","be","busi","the","week","thei","shoot","thi","thingor","els","manag","to","see","a","copi","of","the","script","in","advanc","the","bad","new","though","and","there","plenti","of","it","be","that","thi","filmif","it","can","even","be","call","that","have","be","shoot","straight","to","videoi","a","complet","misfir","a","total","abort","a","outandout","atroc","a","absolut","abomin","and","truli","on","of","the","wrong","pictur","that","i","have","ever","see","look","no","far","for","the","lame","superhero","movi","ever","make","the","plot","here","such","a","it","be","deal","with","kitten","gain","superpow","after","fellat","the","rare","cockazilla","plant","in","south","america","to","cure","her","breast","cancer","oi","and","late","battl","a","trio","of","megalung","bikini","dancer","back","in","la","too","bad","that","everi","lame","boob","joke","trot","out","fall","complet","you","should","pardon","the","express","flat","that","there","be","zero","actual","nuditi","in","the","film","at","all","other","than","some","old","photo","of","kitten","in","her","heydai","and","that","some","shave","cream","and","a","papiermach","boulder","be","the","sum","total","of","the","special","fx","the","meyer","gal","here","be","a","bite","long","in","the","toothsaggi","in","the","chest","to","put","it","kindli","although","sheri","dawn","thoma","a","bikini","girl","ooga","boobi","doe","manag","to","uh","stand","out","nice","so","why","have","i","give","thi","juvenil","unfunni","fail","embarrass","of","a","movi","star","instead","of","to","be","succinct","joe","bob","brigg","hi","voiceov","commentari","in","the","special","featur","of","the","dvd","i","just","watch","be","absolut","hilari","especi","when","he","pull","out","around","synonym","for","the","word","breast","from","the","+","on","hi","web","site","canon","hooter","list","the","man","be","a","nation","treasur","and","he","manag","to","upgrad","thi","skeet","of","a","disc","to","coaster","statu"],"filtered":["good","suppos","good","new","concern","william","winckler","opu","doubl","aveng","manag","unit","three","russ","meyer","mammarian","marvelskitten","natividad","haji","raven","de","la","croixin","pictur","onli","assum","lorna","maitland","tura","satana","babett","bardot","busi","week","thei","shoot","thi","thingor","els","manag","see","copi","script","advanc","bad","new","though","plenti","thi","filmif","even","call","shoot","straight","videoi","complet","misfir","total","abort","outandout","atroc","absolut","abomin","truli","wrong","pictur","ever","see","look","far","lame","superhero","movi","ever","make","plot","deal","kitten","gain","superpow","fellat","rare","cockazilla","plant","south","america","cure","breast","cancer","oi","late","battl","trio","megalung","bikini","dancer","back","la","bad","everi","lame","boob","joke","trot","fall","complet","pardon","express","flat","zero","actual","nuditi","film","old","photo","kitten","heydai","shave","cream","papiermach","boulder","sum","total","special","fx","meyer","gal","bite","long","toothsaggi","chest","put","kindli","although","sheri","dawn","thoma","bikini","girl","ooga","boobi","doe","manag","uh","stand","nice","give","thi","juvenil","unfunni","fail","embarrass","movi","star","instead","succinct","joe","bob","brigg","hi","voiceov","commentari","special","featur","dvd","watch","absolut","hilari","especi","pull","around","synonym","word","breast","+","hi","web","site","canon","hooter","list","man","nation","treasur","manag","upgrad","thi","skeet","disc","coaster","statu"],"filtered2":["good","suppos","good","new","concern","william","winckler","opu","doubl","aveng","manag","unit","three","russ","meyer","mammarian","marvelskitten","natividad","haji","raven","de","la","croixin","pictur","onli","assum","lorna","maitland","tura","satana","babett","bardot","busi","week","shoot","thingor","els","manag","see","copi","script","advanc","bad","new","though","plenti","filmif","even","call","shoot","straight","videoi","complet","misfir","total","abort","outandout","atroc","absolut","abomin","truli","wrong","pictur","ever","see","look","far","lame","superhero","ever","make","plot","deal","kitten","gain","superpow","fellat","rare","cockazilla","plant","south","america","cure","breast","cancer","oi","late","battl","trio","megalung","bikini","dancer","back","la","bad","everi","lame","boob","joke","trot","fall","complet","pardon","express","flat","zero","actual","nuditi","old","photo","kitten","heydai","shave","cream","papiermach","boulder","sum","total","special","fx","meyer","gal","bite","long","toothsaggi","chest","put","kindli","although","sheri","daw

{"value":"This film is so bad, you can't imagine. The acting is terrible, even worse than in third class soap operas. An it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers didn't make any sense at all. The story could have been taken out from a bravo photo-story, the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays it doesn't need much to satisfy the audience. The actors were handsome for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung (woah!!) and there certainly was much abuse of drugs. That's real cool man! Particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens. But the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you don't go along with the other `sheep' and say.yes that is exactly what it was like when I was in the army/ that's exactly what I'm going to do when I must go to the army.. to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness. And don't think I like the army. I was there and I hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush (which I was forced to do because I offended an lieutenant) It is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated. Sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and I think its not a bad thing. But this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots.

{"value":"If asked how I would define the word \" Shallow \" I would reply \" Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production \" . If asked how I would define the phrase \" Wasted potential \" I would reply \" Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production \" . Bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical pannings from the critics . Off the top of my head I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting a lot of critical acclaim . <br /><br />CRIMSON TIDE too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much . The problem I had is the scenario that sets up the story : The Russians are fighting the Chechens and the conflict spreads through the whole of Russia leading to an ultra nationalist Russian to take over a nuclear missile base and threaten the West if they interfere . Maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but I found this set up very unconvincing . It`s not helped by some errors in geography like the French carrier Foch being in the Med ( Wouldn`t the Foch be better positioned in the black sea ? ) or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans , the first gulf war and even Vietnam . Once again the adjective \" Very unconvincing \" crept into my mind . The story does improve somewhat when the story proper - A battle of wills concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two - gets underway . Director Tony Scott does his best as do the cast , but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario . The worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nay probability - this film would have terrified me , but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means CRIMSON TIDE has little impact

{"value":"What Hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film. However, perhaps therein lies the problem. His movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within, but it's so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who anyone is, thus there is no investment on our part.<br /><br />It could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters. Is it? Maybe. By that I don't mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean that there is no telling. Hopkins's film is an experiment. On the face of it, one could make the case that it is about a would-be screenwriter, who at the very moment of his meeting with fate, realizes that life is hit and miss, and/or success is blind chance, as he is hurled into a \"slipstream\" of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts, and reality. Nevertheless, it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even to the tiny, quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its characters.<br /><br />I didn't think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky, machine-gun-speed camera-work and editing disengaged me, but reflecting upon the film I am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it. There are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmosphere-deteriorating technical doodads. I suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams. However, I knew barely anything about Slipstream when watching it, and I came out the same way. And I just do not care, because Hopkins made no effort to make us care.

{"value":"Hello there,<br /><br />This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while. I would therefore like to salute you all. The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance.<br /><br />I spent 2 years of my life, (all we Greeks did actually), analysing Omirus epos (and not Homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. If I recall well it was Iliada (Iliad) on 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) on 9th grade. Warner's Troy, was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus (I study in the UK).<br /><br />Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC, and the actual reason of the war not being Helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy. That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events (as it's not accurate historically) but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /><br />Reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. None of these though were revealed in 'Troy'<br /><br />Warner's Troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well. It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers graphics did the whole work), and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /><br />I conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10.

{"value":"Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that's right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.<br /><br />The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the \"once\" bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties' actual 1939 release date. *1/2 of 4

{"value":"This would've been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I'm Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.<br /><br />Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away. This dialogue might've worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />This script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled \"weighted score\". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That's a plot contrivance.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.<br /><br />Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male \"look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man\" glory.<br /><br />Don't say you weren't warned.","finished_norm":["thi","would","have","be","a","great","silent","film","the","act","realli","be","good","at","littl","in","a","look","ma","i","be","do","realli","big","act","sort","of","waybr","br","everyth","be","huge","everi","line","be","profound","everi","scene","be","shatter","by","human","tragedybr","br","mostli","i","feel","like","gag","yet","like","ani","train","wreck","i","can","not","tear","my","ey","awai","thi","dialogu","mai","have","work","on","the","stage","although","i","doubt","it","on","the","screen","it","be","clutter","haphazard","hacknei","and","pretti","much","everi","other","stereotyp","neg","adject","you","can","come","up","with","to","describ","a","realli","bad","dramat","workbr","br","if","you","enjoi","your","melodrama","in","huge","heap","dose","you","mai","enjoi","the","movi","be","prepar","to","wait","howev","for","all","that","melodrama","thi","thing","sure","plod","along","at","it","own","pacebr","br","thi","script","must","have","sound","a","lot","differ","when","the","actor","involv","be","read","it","to","themselv","it","simpli","doe","not","work","onc","thei","get","around","to","deliv","it","in","front","of","the","camerabr","br","imdb","doe","u","a","great","disservic","at","time","when","it","us","it","goofi","computercontrol","weight","score","curs","of","the","starv","class","deserv","littl","than","a","br","br","characterdriven","fiction","be","great","but","when","you","develop","your","charact","by","simpli","push","them","through","hoop","with","no","plausibl","explan","for","their","matur","or","evolut","it","be","not","charact","develop","your","charact","must","have","a","motiv","be","drink","for","a","while","and","wake","up","in","a","field","be","not","charact","develop","that","a","plot","contrivancebr","br","stai","awai","from","thi","movi","or","at","the","veri","littl","watch","it","mute","perhap","you","will","get","some","amus","from","all","the","armwav","the","charact","dobr","br","oh","and","word","to","the","wise","to","prove","that","thi","be","truli","a","artsi","film","you","see","jame","wood","in","all","hi","dangli","male","lookatm","imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof","man","glorybr","br","do","not","sai","you","be","not","warn"],"filtered":["thi","great","silent","film","act","realli","good","littl","look","ma","realli","big","act","sort","waybr","br","everyth","huge","everi","line","profound","everi","scene","shatter","human","tragedybr","br","mostli","feel","like","gag","yet","like","ani","train","wreck","tear","ey","awai","thi","dialogu","mai","work","stage","although","doubt","screen","clutter","haphazard","hacknei","pretti","much","everi","stereotyp","neg","adject","come","describ","realli","bad","dramat","workbr","br","enjoi","melodrama","huge","heap","dose","mai","enjoi","movi","prepar","wait","howev","melodrama","thi","thing","sure","plod","along","pacebr","br","thi","script","must","sound","lot","differ","actor","involv","read","themselv","simpli","doe","work","onc","thei","get","around","deliv","front","camerabr","br","imdb","doe","u","great","disservic","time","us","goofi","computercontrol","weight","score","curs","starv","class","deserv","littl","br","br","characterdriven","fiction","great","develop","charact","simpli","push","hoop","plausibl","explan","matur","evolut","charact","develop","charact","must","motiv","drink","wake","field","charact","develop","plot","contrivancebr","br","stai","awai","thi","movi","veri","littl","watch","mute","perhap","get","amus","armwav","charact","dobr","br","oh","word","wise","prove","thi","truli","artsi","film","see","jame","wood","hi","dangli","male","lookatm","imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof","man","glorybr","br","sai","warn"],"filtered2":["great","silent","act","realli","good","littl","look","ma","realli","big","act","sort","waybr","everyth","huge","everi","line","profound","everi","scene","shatter","human","tragedybr","mostli","feel","like","gag","yet","like","ani","train","wreck","tear","ey","awai","dialogu","mai","work","stage","although","doubt","screen","clutter","haphazard","hacknei","pretti","everi","stereotyp","neg","adject","come","describ","realli","bad","dramat","workbr","enjoi","melodrama","huge","heap","dose","mai","enjoi","prepar","wait","howev","melodrama","thing","sure","plod","along","pacebr","script","must","sound","lot","differ","actor","involv","read","themselv","simpli","doe","work","onc","get","around","deliv","front","camerabr","imdb","doe","u","great","disservic","time","us","goofi","computercontrol","weight","score","curs","starv","class","deserv","littl","characterdriven","fiction","great","develop","charact","simpli","push","hoop","plausibl","explan","matur","evolut","charact","develop","charact","must","motiv","drink","wake","field","charact","develop","plot","contrivancebr","stai","awai","veri","littl","watch","mute","perhap","get","amus","armwav","charact","dobr","oh","word","wise","prove","t

{"value":"I wasn't expecting a lot from a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren but I was surely expecting more than a got. A one-liner user comment - 2nd rate action movie - didn't seem too depreciative to me for a Lundgren film. On the other hand, I wouldn't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5.0 but hey, the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 score, which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production.<br /><br />Now I understand that the 37.5% of people who rated this film a 10 (excellent) was clearly a publicity stunt because DETENTION is the regular Nu Image garbage you have seen before, over and over.<br /><br />Lundgren does not convince as an ex-military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school. His acting is just plain terrible, emotionless and contrived. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids. Either they are great actors or, compared to Lundgren, they seem great actors - just because they seem natural and believable.<br /><br />DETENTION has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie - a closed-for-weekend high-security high school, four teens in detention with a war-veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story (something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of unbelievable situations, lots of clichés and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget Dolph Lundgren is the main actor.<br /><br />Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó play a Bonnie and Clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie, even if he seems a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, a Milla Jovovich wanna-be. In a movie where everything fails, their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","expect","a","lot","from","a","film","direct","by","sidnei","j","furi","and","star","dolph","lundgren","but","i","be","sure","expect","much","than","a","get","a","onelin","user","comment","nd","rate","action","movi","do","not","seem","too","depreci","to","me","for","a","lundgren","film","on","the","other","hand","i","would","not","have","bother","to","watch","thi","film","if","it","rate","be","below","but","hei","the","movi","have","a","out","of","score","which","seem","pretti","accept","to","me","for","thi","kind","of","productionbr","br","now","i","understand","that","the","of","peopl","who","rate","thi","film","a","excel","be","clearli","a","public","stunt","becaus","detent","be","the","regular","nu","imag","garbag","you","have","see","befor","over","and","overbr","br","lundgren","doe","not","convinc","a","a","exmilitari","turn","a","histori","teacher","assign","to","a","rough","school","hi","act","be","just","plain","terribl","emotionless","and","contriv","lundgren","inabl","to","act","becom","much","visibl","in","the","scene","with","the","juvenil","delinqu","kid","either","thei","be","great","actor","or","compar","to","lundgren","thei","seem","great","actor","just","becaus","thei","seem","natur","and","believablebr","br","detent","have","some","elem","that","can","have","be","potenti","interest","for","thi","low","budget","movi","a","closedforweekend","highsecur","high","school","four","teen","in","detent","with","a","warveteran","teacher","and","a","group","of","ruthless","crimin","try","to","get","in","but","the","stori","someth","like","the","breakfast","club","meet","die","hard","or","be","it","panic","room","be","full","of","unbeliev","situat","lot","of","cliché","and","stereotyp","charact","and","let","not","forget","dolph","lundgren","be","the","main","actorbr","br","alex","karzi","and","kata","dobó","plai","a","bonni","and","clyd","coupl","in","love","and","thei","deliv","the","much","accept","perform","of","the","movi","even","if","he","seem","a","lowbudget","version","of","sam","rockwel","and","she","a","milla","jovovich","wannab","in","a","movi","where","everyth","fail","their","crazi","and","styl","suppli","enough","fresh","air","to","prevent","my","interest","from","drop","to","grind","zero"],"filtered":["expect","lot","film","direct","sidnei","j","furi","star","dolph","lundgren","sure","expect","much","get","onelin","user","comment","nd","rate","action","movi","seem","depreci","lundgren","film","hand","bother","watch","thi","film","rate","hei","movi","score","seem","pretti","accept","thi","kind","productionbr","br","understand","peopl","rate","thi","film","excel","clearli","public","stunt","becaus","detent","regular","nu","imag","garbag","see","befor","overbr","br","lundgren","doe","convinc","exmilitari","turn","histori","teacher","assign","rough","school","hi","act","plain","terribl","emotionless","contriv","lundgren","inabl","act","becom","much","visibl","scene","juvenil","delinqu","kid","either","thei","great","actor","compar","lundgren","thei","seem","great","actor","becaus","thei","seem","natur","believablebr","br","detent","elem","potenti","interest","thi","low","budget","movi","closedforweekend","highsecur","high","school","four","teen","detent","warveteran","teacher","group","ruthless","crimin","try","get","stori","someth","like","breakfast","club","meet","die","hard","panic","room","full","unbeliev","situat","lot","cliché","stereotyp","charact","let","forget","dolph","lundgren","main","actorbr","br","alex","karzi","kata","dobó","plai","bonni","clyd","coupl","love","thei","deliv","much","accept","perform","movi","even","seem","lowbudget","version","sam","rockwel","milla","jovovich","wannab","movi","everyth","fail","crazi","styl","suppli","enough","fresh","air","prevent","interest","drop","grind","zero"],"filtered2":["expect","lot","direct","sidnei","j","furi","star","dolph","lundgren","sure","expect","get","onelin","user","comment","nd","rate","action","seem","depreci","lundgren","hand","bother","watch","rate","hei","score","seem","pretti","accept","kind","productionbr","understand","peopl","rate","excel","clearli","public","stunt","becaus","detent","regular","nu","imag","garbag","see","befor","overbr","lundgren","doe","convinc","exmilitari","turn","histori","teacher","assign","rough","school","act","plain","terribl","emotionless","contriv","lundgren","inabl","act","becom","visibl","scene","juvenil","delinqu","kid","either","great","actor","compar","lundgren","seem","great","actor","becaus","seem","natur","believablebr","detent","elem","potenti","interest","low","budget","closedforweekend","highsecur","high","school","four","teen","detent","warveteran","teacher","group","ruthless","crimin","try","get","stori","someth","like","breakfast","club","meet","die","hard","panic","room","full","unbeliev","situat","lot","cliché","stereotyp","charact","let","forget","dolph","lundgren","main","actorbr","alex","karzi","kata","dobó","plai","bonni","clyd",

{"value":"This reworking of Anthony Shaffer's classic play did not last long in cinemas. Having recently suffered through it on cable, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original.<br /><br />Michael Caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film. He now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead, played in that version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Looking puffy and washed-out, Caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as Batman's butler. He had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER. What's next -- ALFIE II, or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING? <br /><br />But then, no one benefits from this inane adaptation by Pinter, who thinks that frequent cursing and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shaffer's witty character interplay. Branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a second-rate nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight, overacted close-ups can help Law overcome his dull screen persona. The result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller, almost making you forget the purpose behind the title.<br /><br />Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and the Olivier/Caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream. The late Mr Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must be turning in his grave, wishing he could plan a real murder or two!","finished_norm":["thi","rework","of","anthoni","shaffer","classic","plai","do","not","last","long","in","cinema","have","recent","suffer","through","it","on","cabl","i","still","congratul","myself","for","not","wast","monei","on","a","ticket","director","kenneth","branagh","writer","harold","pinter","and","starproduc","jude","law","delud","themselv","that","their","prestig","alon","can","sustain","thi","travesti","through","a","intermin","minut","without","the","fun","or","class","of","the","long","originalbr","br","michael","cain","enhanc","hi","reput","plai","the","lead","in","the","marvel","film","he","now","seem","intent","on","destroi","it","by","attempt","the","lead","plai","in","that","version","by","laurenc","olivi","both","be","nomin","for","well","actor","oscar","but","lose","to","marlon","brando","in","the","godfath","look","puffi","and","washedout","cain","glide","through","the","part","with","littl","depth","than","he","displai","a","batman","butler","he","have","alreadi","lower","himself","to","a","guest","appear","in","the","atroci","remak","of","get","carter","what","next","alfi","ii","or","son","of","the","man","who","would","be","king","br","br","but","then","no","on","benefit","from","thi","inan","adapt","by","pinter","who","think","that","frequent","curs","and","a","add","sexual","angl","can","compens","for","the","absenc","of","shaffer","witti","charact","interplai","branagh","direct","reli","on","bluish","light","and","a","soulless","set","design","that","would","not","hold","up","in","a","secondr","nightclub","neither","the","shadow","nor","the","tight","overact","closeup","can","help","law","overcom","hi","dull","screen","persona","the","result","be","a","failur","both","a","straight","drama","and","a","detect","thriller","almost","make","you","forget","the","purpos","behind","the","titlebr","br","fan","of","the","origin","stage","product","with","anthoni","quayl","and","keith","baxter","and","the","oliviercain","film","would","do","good","to","regard","thi","enterpris","a","a","bad","dream","the","late","mr","shaffer","who","write","the","screenplai","a","good","a","hitchcock","frenzi","and","sever","agatha","christi","adapt","must","be","turn","in","hi","grave","wish","he","can","plan","a","real","murder","or","two"],"filtered":["thi","rework","anthoni","shaffer","classic","plai","last","long","cinema","recent","suffer","cabl","still","congratul","wast","monei","ticket","director","kenneth","branagh","writer","harold","pinter","starproduc","jude","law","delud","themselv","prestig","alon","sustain","thi","travesti","intermin","minut","without","fun","class","long","originalbr","br","michael","cain","enhanc","hi","reput","plai","lead","marvel","film","seem","intent","destroi","attempt","lead","plai","version","laurenc","olivi","nomin","well","actor","oscar","lose","marlon","brando","godfath","look","puffi","washedout","cain","glide","part","littl","depth","displai","batman","butler","alreadi","lower","guest","appear","atroci","remak","get","carter","next","alfi","ii","son","man","king","br","br","benefit","thi","inan","adapt","pinter","think","frequent","curs","add","sexual","angl","compens","absenc","shaffer","witti","charact","interplai","branagh","direct","reli","bluish","light","soulless","set","design","hold","secondr","nightclub","neither","shadow","tight","overact","closeup","help","law","overcom","hi","dull","screen","persona","result","failur","straight","drama","detect","thriller","almost","make","forget","purpos","behind","titlebr","br","fan","origin","stage","product","anthoni","quayl","keith","baxter","oliviercain","film","good","regard","thi","enterpris","bad","dream","late","mr","shaffer","write","screenplai","good","hitchcock","frenzi","sever","agatha","christi","adapt","must","turn","hi","grave","wish","plan","real","murder","two"],"filtered2":["rework","anthoni","shaffer","classic","plai","last","long","cinema","recent","suffer","cabl","still","congratul","wast","monei","ticket","director","kenneth","branagh","writer","harold","pinter","starproduc","jude","law","delud","themselv","prestig","alon","sustain","travesti","intermin","minut","without","fun","class","long","originalbr","michael","cain","enhanc","reput","plai","lead","marvel","seem","intent","destroi","attempt","lead","plai","version","laurenc","olivi","nomin","well","actor","oscar","lose","marlon","brando","godfath","look","puffi","washedout","cain","glide","part","littl","depth","displai","batman","butler","alreadi","lower","guest","appear","atroci","remak","get","carter","next","alfi","ii","son","man","king","benefit","inan","adapt","pinter","think","frequent","curs","add","sexual","angl","compens","absenc","shaffer","witti","charact","interplai","branagh","direct","reli","bluish","light","soulless","set","design","hold","secondr","nightclub","neither","shadow","tight","overact","closeup","help","law","overcom","dull","screen","persona","result","failur","straight","drama","detect","thriller","almo

{"value":"Hollywood, the home of hype, glamor and the search for profits, is scarcely ruled by spiritual values, and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly (better to go farther afield--to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, for probing depictions of the spirituality). \"Strange Cargo\" is no exception. This odd hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne (Clark Gable at his most cockily mannered and self-regarding) and Julie (Joan Crawford, snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of Tough Dames) seems ludicrous at best. Is this the Patron Saint of the Star System at work, matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the M-G-M lot? BUT. . .there are good supporting performances here, and visually arresting moments: the shadowy prison barracks; the escaping boat by moonlight, or against a painterly cloudscape; Julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) bargaining for Verne's freedom as the storm builds; an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts. . .Above all, there is Paul Lukas's dignified and detached performance as Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate Cambreau's virtues, yet turns his back on him. In the film's most arresting moment, Hessler, having left Cambreau, stands outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, see the shadows on his face, which conveys a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he exits into the night. In this moment, Hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve. is the film's secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler?","finished_norm":["hollywood","the","home","of","hyp","glamor","and","the","search","for","profit","be","scarc","rule","by","spiritu","valu","and","so","it","come","a","no","surpris","that","it","attempt","at","investig","of","the","spiritu","life","be","thin","and","often","silli","well","to","go","far","afieldto","the","film","of","bresson","dreyer","rossellini","and","bergman","for","probe","depict","of","the","spiritu","strang","cargo","be","no","except","thi","odd","hybrid","of","adventur","film","love","stori","and","religi","parabl","trivial","the","veri","insight","it","try","to","commun","that","a","figur","of","provid","and","salvat","would","work","to","match","vern","clark","gabl","at","hi","much","cockili","manner","and","selfregard","and","juli","joan","crawford","snarl","and","spit","out","everi","other","word","in","a","attempt","to","be","the","queen","of","tough","dame","seem","ludicr","at","well","be","thi","the","patron","saint","of","the","star","system","at","work","match","war","ego","befor","send","them","off","to","far","penal","servitud","on","the","mgm","lot","but","there","be","good","support","perform","here","and","visual","arrest","moment","the","shadowi","prison","barrack","the","escap","boat","by","moonlight","or","against","a","painterli","cloudscap","juli","walk","along","the","seafront","a","the","wind","whip","up","juli","and","monsieur","pig","peter","lorr","bargain","for","vern","freedom","a","the","storm","build","a","unusu","ennobl","gai","prison","romanc","between","two","convict","abov","all","there","be","paul","luka","dignifi","and","detach","perform","a","hessler","a","murder","who","can","appreci","cambreau","virtu","yet","turn","hi","back","on","him","in","the","film","much","arrest","moment","hessler","have","leav","cambreau","stand","outsid","the","cabin","we","hear","the","wind","through","the","jungl","see","the","shadow","on","hi","face","which","convei","a","moment","of","fear","and","selfdoubt","then","he","exit","into","the","night","in","thi","moment","hessler","achiev","a","ambigu","depth","and","existenti","strength","that","none","of","the","other","charact","manag","to","achiev","be","the","film","secret","that","it","deep","sympathi","be","alli","with","hessler"],"filtered":["hollywood","home","hyp","glamor","search","profit","scarc","rule","spiritu","valu","come","surpris","attempt","investig","spiritu","life","thin","often","silli","well","go","far","afieldto","film","bresson","dreyer","rossellini","bergman","probe","depict","spiritu","strang","cargo","except","thi","odd","hybrid","adventur","film","love","stori","religi","parabl","trivial","veri","insight","try","commun","figur","provid","salvat","work","match","vern","clark","gabl","hi","much","cockili","manner","selfregard","juli","joan","crawford","snarl","spit","everi","word","attempt","queen","tough","dame","seem","ludicr","well","thi","patron","saint","star","system","work","match","war","ego","befor","send","far","penal","servitud","mgm","lot","good","support","perform","visual","arrest","moment","shadowi","prison","barrack","escap","boat","moonlight","painterli","cloudscap","juli","walk","along","seafront","wind","whip","juli","monsieur","pig","peter","lorr","bargain","vern","freedom","storm","build","unusu","ennobl","gai","prison","romanc","two","convict","abov","paul","luka","dignifi","detach","perform","hessler","murder","appreci","cambreau","virtu","yet","turn","hi","back","film","much","arrest","moment","hessler","leav","cambreau","stand","outsid","cabin","hear","wind","jungl","see","shadow","hi","face","convei","moment","fear","selfdoubt","exit","night","thi","moment","hessler","achiev","ambigu","depth","existenti","strength","none","charact","manag","achiev","film","secret","deep","sympathi","alli","hessler"],"filtered2":["hollywood","home","hyp","glamor","search","profit","scarc","rule","spiritu","valu","come","surpris","attempt","investig","spiritu","life","thin","often","silli","well","go","far","afieldto","bresson","dreyer","rossellini","bergman","probe","depict","spiritu","strang","cargo","except","odd","hybrid","adventur","love","stori","religi","parabl","trivial","veri","insight","try","commun","figur","provid","salvat","work","match","vern","clark","gabl","cockili","manner","selfregard","juli","joan","crawford","snarl","spit","everi","word","attempt","queen","tough","dame","seem","ludicr","well","patron","saint","star","system","work","match","war","ego","befor","send","far","penal","servitud","mgm","lot","good","support","perform","visual","arrest","moment","shadowi","prison","barrack","escap","boat","moonlight","painterli","cloudscap","juli","walk","along","seafront","wind","whip","juli","monsieur","pig","peter","lorr","bargain","vern","freedom","storm","build","unusu","ennobl","gai","prison","romanc","two","convict","abov","paul","luka","dignifi","detach","perform","hessler","murder","appreci","cambreau","virtu","yet","turn","back","arrest","moment","hessler"

{"value":"My title ought to be enough.<br /><br />It baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would churn out such tosh as the \"nouvelle vague\" cinematic movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy. But the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEIRD I CAN BE! PLOT? THEME? PSHAW! LET'S FILM AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GOING ROUND & ROUND! At least this is not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples' heads. Oh-la-la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But so does the security camera at a quickie-mart. The two are indistinguishable.<br /><br />Haha, just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds: I bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now. But don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like French literature, you will HATE this. People who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or maybe \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Or maybe they have read the lyrics to The Doors songs, and they think that's profoundly moving. Whatever floats yer boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived. Nice try, Truffles. But you're nowhere near the ballpark.<br /><br />Avoid this film like an aids-infected syringe.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA).<br /><br />If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard, and Andy Worhol.

{"value":"The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical innacuracies are not. I do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it.<br /><br />Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation, which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph, in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for \"klinghoffer samir kuntar\" on google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC, did he?<br /><br />*** possible spoilers ***<br /><br />The movie almost excuses the terrorists' actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived, always accentuating and exaggerating how much the Israeli's have done to hurt them. However, they never portray the hurt that the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis. The movie uses (quite horrid!!!) images from the Sabra and Chatila horror, and nothing is said, understating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible, without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian-les Lebanese army who conducted the massacre.<br /><br />The acting was generally very bad, but I guess that's what can be expected from opera singers?<br /><br />On another note I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism.

{"value":"Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clichéd, patchy, overwrought screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story... \"sort of\".<br /><br />The problem with this rubbish is that there isn't much of a story at all and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life.<br /><br />You just don't care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as an obnoxious, cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect. She punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she isn't the least bit real and Knightly isn't the least bit convincing, either.<br /><br />The film is boring. It's loud, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time. The final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of Scott's \"True Romance\" climax with Domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise! surprise! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters.<br /><br />Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the \"narrative\" progresses. Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by this film's multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.","finished_norm":["toni","scott","destroi","anyth","that","mai","have","be","interest","in","richard","kelli","clichéd","patchi","overwrought","screenplai","domino","harvei","kiera","knightlei","be","a","model","who","drop","out","and","becom","a","bounti","hunter","thi","be","her","stori","sort","ofbr","br","the","problem","with","thi","rubbish","be","that","there","be","not","much","of","a","stori","at","all","and","scott","extrem","graphic","styliz","of","everi","shoot","act","a","a","distanc","mechan","that","make","u","indiffer","to","everyth","in","harvei","chaotic","lifebr","br","you","just","do","not","care","about","harvei","knightlei","plai","her","a","a","obnoxi","cynic","brat","who","have","do","noth","to","warrant","our","respect","she","punch","peopl","she","doe","not","like","and","shed","her","cloth","and","inhibit","when","the","situat","call","for","it","but","she","be","not","the","littl","bite","real","and","knightli","be","not","the","littl","bite","convinc","eitherbr","br","the","film","be","bore","it","loud","too","and","shackl","with","on","of","the","much","annoi","sourc","music","score","i","have","hear","in","a","long","time","the","final","twenti","minut","be","a","poor","rerun","of","scott","true","romanc","climax","with","domino","gang","go","to","meet","two","set","of","feud","bad","gui","who","be","surpris","surpris","destin","to","shoot","it","out","with","each","other","at","the","top","of","a","la","vega","casinobr","br","unfortun","thi","potenti","excit","conflagr","be","total","botch","by","scott","and","becom","a","confus","pretenti","pointless","exercis","in","celluloid","masturb","thi","be","not","a","artist","brave","or","experiment","piec","it","be","a","failur","on","everi","level","becaus","it","give","u","no","entri","point","to","the","live","and","dilemma","of","it","charactersbr","br","mickei","roark","look","good","a","a","grizzl","bounti","hunter","but","he","disappear","into","the","background","a","the","narr","progress","chri","walken","turn","in","anoth","embarrass","cameo","and","dabnei","coleman","alwai","solid","be","underutilizedbr","br","do","not","be","fool","by","thi","film","multilay","gimmickridden","surfac","it","be","still","a","turd","no","matt","how","hard","you","polish","it"],"filtered":["toni","scott","destroi","anyth","mai","interest","richard","kelli","clichéd","patchi","overwrought","screenplai","domino","harvei","kiera","knightlei","model","drop","becom","bounti","hunter","thi","stori","sort","ofbr","br","problem","thi","rubbish","much","stori","scott","extrem","graphic","styliz","everi","shoot","act","distanc","mechan","make","u","indiffer","everyth","harvei","chaotic","lifebr","br","care","harvei","knightlei","plai","obnoxi","cynic","brat","noth","warrant","respect","punch","peopl","doe","like","shed","cloth","inhibit","situat","call","littl","bite","real","knightli","littl","bite","convinc","eitherbr","br","film","bore","loud","shackl","much","annoi","sourc","music","score","hear","long","time","final","twenti","minut","poor","rerun","scott","true","romanc","climax","domino","gang","go","meet","two","set","feud","bad","gui","surpris","surpris","destin","shoot","top","la","vega","casinobr","br","unfortun","thi","potenti","excit","conflagr","total","botch","scott","becom","confus","pretenti","pointless","exercis","celluloid","masturb","thi","artist","brave","experiment","piec","failur","everi","level","becaus","give","u","entri","point","live","dilemma","charactersbr","br","mickei","roark","look","good","grizzl","bounti","hunter","disappear","background","narr","progress","chri","walken","turn","anoth","embarrass","cameo","dabnei","coleman","alwai","solid","underutilizedbr","br","fool","thi","film","multilay","gimmickridden","surfac","still","turd","matt","hard","polish"],"filtered2":["toni","scott","destroi","anyth","mai","interest","richard","kelli","clichéd","patchi","overwrought","screenplai","domino","harvei","kiera","knightlei","model","drop","becom","bounti","hunter","stori","sort","ofbr","problem","rubbish","stori","scott","extrem","graphic","styliz","everi","shoot","act","distanc","mechan","make","u","indiffer","everyth","harvei","chaotic","lifebr","care","harvei","knightlei","plai","obnoxi","cynic","brat","noth","warrant","respect","punch","peopl","doe","like","shed","cloth","inhibit","situat","call","littl","bite","real","knightli","littl","bite","convinc","eitherbr","bore","loud","shackl","annoi","sourc","music","score","hear","long","time","final","twenti","minut","poor","rerun","scott","true","romanc","climax","domino","gang","go","meet","two","set","feud","bad","gui","surpris","surpris","destin","shoot","top","la","vega","casinobr","unfortun","potenti","excit","conflagr","total","botch","scott","becom","confus","pretenti","pointless","exercis","celluloid","masturb","artist","brave","experiment","piec","failur","everi","level","becaus","give","u","entri","point","live","dilemma","charactersbr","mickei","roark","look

{"value":"What happened? 'Doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar-nomination. Though it was not one of her best performances, she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.<br /><br />However, not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill. From the boring start, which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending, the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much talk and not enough action.<br /><br />Furthermore, the other Oscar-nominations were less than convincing. Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means Oscar-worthy. (Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith, in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, as I am sure she would have walked away victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.<br /><br />Overall, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008. It was a mess of a film with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep, who though gives a stunning, solid performance - doesn't even do enough to save this film. *** /

{"value":"Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.<br /><br />This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film. This movie has a very dreary, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.<br /><br />The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers.<br /><br />Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.<br /><br />Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED.<br /><br />My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.","finished_norm":["let","me","start","by","sai","how","much","i","love","the","tv","seri","despit","the","tragic","natur","of","a","middleag","man","seemingli","unabl","to","pursu","hi","dream","becaus","of","hi","overbear","manipul","father","it","be","incredibli","lightheart","and","fun","to","watch","in","practic","in","my","opinion","it","be","without","doubt","on","of","the","great","british","sitcom","of","all","time","the","tv","seri","have","my","out","of","rate","without","reservationbr","br","thi","movi","spinoff","on","the","other","hand","be","a","true","tragedi","in","everi","sens","of","the","word","hardli","ani","of","the","essenc","of","the","tv","show","be","transfer","successfulli","onto","film","thi","movi","have","a","veri","dreari","depress","tone","that","almost","move","me","to","tear","on","sever","occas","see","harold","be","beat","up","in","a","pub","and","not","in","a","comic","wai","be","not","my","idea","of","comedi","but","be","much","definit","on","reason","why","fan","of","the","tv","seri","will","not","like","thi","movi","the","movi","be","painfulli","unfunni","except","for","the","scene","where","albert","bath","in","the","sink","and","be","see","by","a","neighbourbr","br","the","romanc","between","harold","and","zita","be","complet","out","of","tone","and","it","make","me","wonder","whether","the","produc","of","thi","movi","ever","bother","to","watch","the","tv","seri","in","the","tv","seri","harold","alwai","go","after","respect","girl","not","strippersbr","br","albert","reaction","to","the","remark","make","against","him","by","harold","girlfriend","be","absolut","priceless","in","the","tv","seri","in","the","movi","albert","sai","virtual","noth","when","such","a","opportun","risesbr","br","much","movi","spinoff","of","british","sitcom","tend","to","be","quit","dull","with","the","notabl","except","of","the","on","the","bu","film","which","in","some","respect","be","actual","well","than","the","tv","seri","itself","but","stepto","and","son","have","to","rank","right","at","the","veri","bottom","of","the","pile","even","below","georg","and","mildredbr","br","my","advic","skip","thi","on","and","see","the","spinoff","stepto","and","son","ride","again","instead","it","have","a","much","light","tone","be","much","faith","to","the","tv","seri","and","be","actual","veri","funni"],"filtered":["let","start","sai","much","love","tv","seri","despit","tragic","natur","middleag","man","seemingli","unabl","pursu","hi","dream","becaus","hi","overbear","manipul","father","incredibli","lightheart","fun","watch","practic","opinion","without","doubt","great","british","sitcom","time","tv","seri","rate","without","reservationbr","br","thi","movi","spinoff","hand","true","tragedi","everi","sens","word","hardli","ani","essenc","tv","show","transfer","successfulli","onto","film","thi","movi","veri","dreari","depress","tone","almost","move","tear","sever","occas","see","harold","beat","pub","comic","wai","idea","comedi","much","definit","reason","fan","tv","seri","like","thi","movi","movi","painfulli","unfunni","except","scene","albert","bath","sink","see","neighbourbr","br","romanc","harold","zita","complet","tone","make","wonder","whether","produc","thi","movi","ever","bother","watch","tv","seri","tv","seri","harold","alwai","go","respect","girl","strippersbr","br","albert","reaction","remark","make","harold","girlfriend","absolut","priceless","tv","seri","movi","albert","sai","virtual","noth","opportun","risesbr","br","much","movi","spinoff","british","sitcom","tend","quit","dull","notabl","except","bu","film","respect","actual","well","tv","seri","stepto","son","rank","right","veri","bottom","pile","even","georg","mildredbr","br","advic","skip","thi","see","spinoff","stepto","son","ride","instead","much","light","tone","much","faith","tv","seri","actual","veri","funni"],"filtered2":["let","start","love","tv","despit","tragic","natur","middleag","man","seemingli","unabl","pursu","dream","becaus","overbear","manipul","father","incredibli","lightheart","fun","watch","practic","opinion","without","doubt","great","british","sitcom","time","tv","rate","without","reservationbr","spinoff","hand","true","tragedi","everi","sens","word","hardli","ani","essenc","tv","show","transfer","successfulli","onto","veri","dreari","depress","tone","almost","move","tear","sever","occas","see","harold","beat","pub","comic","wai","idea","comedi","definit","reason","fan","tv","like","painfulli","unfunni","except","scene","albert","bath","sink","see","neighbourbr","romanc","harold","zita","complet","tone","make","wonder","whether","produc","ever","bother","watch","tv","tv","harold","alwai","go","respect","girl","strippersbr","albert","reaction","remark","make","harold","girlfriend","absolut","priceless","tv","albert","virtual","noth","opportun","risesbr","spinoff","british","sitcom","tend","quit","dull","notabl","except","bu","respect","actual","well","tv","stepto","son","rank","right","veri","bottom","pile"

{"value":"I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting, my mom wanted to see it, so I rented it. I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes, but actually this wasn't too bad. I was just expecting this horrific movie, but it seems like the writers meant no harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria(Parker, sorry), she seems a little off set for the movie. I think I may have found it to be a little better without her, just she does annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable. But you have to admit, there was no point to this movie, it was one of those quick paychecks for the actor type of thing. The movie could've been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast.<br /><br />Henry just lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister takes him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls for her, but Kate is haunting her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and doesn't want Henry to move on so quickly and she will make sure that Ashley doesn't get him by torturing her day and night with her rambles, believe me, with Kate's voice, that's scary.<br /><br />Over Her Dead Body is an alright movie, not sure if it's worth the money, but I'd give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious. Eva Longoria just doesn't have enough star power to make the film work, no offense to those who love her, she just belongs on the small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she seems still not too likable with everything she pulls, or her \"gay\" friend, Dan, just again, not really likable. Just with some re-writing and proper attention, this film could have been better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with with an empty feeling.<br /><br

{"value":"This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more...and they're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television.<br /><br />The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos.

{"value":"i love horror films, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's.. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film? let's compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films. the haunting, the changeling, the shining. or for a similar technology based horror film that was FAAAR better, (though still FAR from great) Demon Seed. OK, i'll be fair.. let's compare it to made-for-TV horror films! don't go to sleep.. waaay creepier and better done. salem's lot, the night stalker, night gallery, even don't go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better. *SPOILERS* first of all, for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene.. oh boy! the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers! TERRIBLE. also, just what we understand about the house.. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on, and it's a very emotional house. not a spirit, or demon, or entity, it's a house thats \"possessed\", but by what? we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie/margaret, our protagonist? now that I'm on the topic of suzie.. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old crazy lady comes, tells you she was your nurse, pours her heart out, falls in the boiling pool, struggling in agony for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her's life? no, she stands there and watches! the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film, but that's where the positives end. for at least a more interesting, and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed: the bed that eats. i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired, or remembered it scaring them as children. this film was pretty much merit less.","finished_norm":["i","love","horror","film","low","budget","but","how","can","anyon","think","thi","be","a","veri","good","horror","film","let","compar","it","to","titl","in","a","similar","vein","haunt","hous","film","the","haunt","the","changel","the","shine","or","for","a","similar","technologi","base","horror","film","that","be","faaar","well","though","still","far","from","great","demon","se","okai","i","will","be","fair","let","compar","it","to","madefortv","horror","film","do","not","go","to","sleep","waaai","creepi","and","well","do","salem","lot","the","night","stalker","night","galleri","even","do","not","go","in","the","basem","or","crowhaven","farm","be","far","well","spoiler","of","all","for","a","good","a","scene","a","the","bloodi","shower","scene","be","you","have","a","scene","like","the","open","scene","oh","boi","the","garden","hose","come","aliv","to","hose","down","some","friski","teenag","terribl","conjur","just","what","we","understand","about","the","hous","it","appar","ne","to","us","it","video","camera","to","see","what","be","go","on","and","it","a","veri","emot","hous","not","a","spirit","or","demon","or","entiti","it","a","hous","that","possess","but","by","what","we","be","lead","to","believ","a","inanim","object","learn","to","love","suziemargaret","our","protagonist","now","that","i","be","on","the","topic","of","suzi","anoth","scene","that","total","bother","me","thi","poor","old","crazi","ladi","come","tell","you","she","be","your","nurs","pour","her","heart","out","fall","in","the","boil","pool","struggl","in","agoni","for","second","and","what","doe","margaret","do","doe","she","risk","her","hand","be","burn","to","save","thi","poor","elderli","woman","that","come","there","to","warn","her","life","no","she","stand","there","and","watch","the","act","for","the","much","part","be","well","than","averag","for","a","horror","film","but","that","where","the","posit","end","for","at","littl","a","much","interest","and","fun","horror","film","about","a","inanim","object","that","kill","peopl","watch","death","bed","the","bed","that","eat","i","have","a","feel","the","peopl","who","rate","thi","so","highli","either","have","not","watch","it","sinc","it","origin","air","or","rememb","it","scare","them","a","child","thi","film","be","pretti","much","merit","littl"],"filtered":["love","horror","film","low","budget","anyon","think","thi","veri","good","horror","film","let","compar","titl","similar","vein","haunt","hous","film","haunt","changel","shine","similar","technologi","base","horror","film","faaar","well","though","still","far","great","demon","se","okai","fair","let","compar","madefortv","horror","film","go","sleep","waaai","creepi","well","salem","lot","night","stalker","night","galleri","even","go","basem","crowhaven","farm","far","well","spoiler","good","scene","bloodi","shower","scene","scene","like","open","scene","oh","boi","garden","hose","come","aliv","hose","friski","teenag","terribl","conjur","understand","hous","appar","ne","us","video","camera","see","go","veri","emot","hous","spirit","demon","entiti","hous","possess","lead","believ","inanim","object","learn","love","suziemargaret","protagonist","topic","suzi","anoth","scene","total","bother","thi","poor","old","crazi","ladi","come","tell","nurs","pour","heart","fall","boil","pool","struggl","agoni","second","doe","margaret","doe","risk","hand","burn","save","thi","poor","elderli","woman","come","warn","life","stand","watch","act","much","part","well","averag","horror","film","posit","end","littl","much","interest","fun","horror","film","inanim","object","kill","peopl","watch","death","bed","bed","eat","feel","peopl","rate","thi","highli","either","watch","sinc","origin","air","rememb","scare","child","thi","film","pretti","much","merit","littl"],"filtered2":["love","horror","low","budget","anyon","think","veri","good","horror","let","compar","titl","similar","vein","haunt","hous","haunt","changel","shine","similar","technologi","base","horror","faaar","well","though","still","far","great","demon","se","okai","fair","let","compar","madefortv","horror","go","sleep","waaai","creepi","well","salem","lot","night","stalker","night","galleri","even","go","basem","crowhaven","farm","far","well","spoiler","good","scene","bloodi","shower","scene","scene","like","open","scene","oh","boi","garden","hose","come","aliv","hose","friski","teenag","terribl","conjur","understand","hous","appar","ne","us","video","camera","see","go","veri","emot","hous","spirit","demon","entiti","hous","possess","lead","believ","inanim","object","learn","love","suziemargaret","protagonist","topic","suzi","anoth","scene","total","bother","poor","old","crazi","ladi","come","tell","nurs","pour","heart","fall","boil","pool","struggl","agoni","second","doe","margaret","doe","risk","hand","burn","save","poor","elderli","woman","come","warn","life","stand","watch","act","part","well","averag","horror","posit","end","littl","interest","fun","horror

{"value":"I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film. Thought visually stunning like all of Ang Lee's work (each still frame seems worthy of a print), I was really disappointed by the film's disjointed pace. It really was too long.<br /><br />The story is set in Civil War era Missouri, and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers, sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned, presumably by Jayhawkers. The story follows Roedel's and Chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war, including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright), and a war widow played by Jewel.<br /><br />It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, the agitation among Roedel's group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol, and then dropped until later in the movie. A young villian/bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him, but, we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to surface; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.<br /><br />The historical detail was excellent. I loved looking at the housing, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, though they stumbled a bit with the dialog. Unless you really enjoy history or are a huge Ang Lee fan, though, take a pass on this one.","finished_norm":["i","be","probabl","on","of","the","few","viewer","who","would","not","recommend","thi","film","think","visual","stun","like","all","of","ang","lee","work","each","still","frame","seem","worthi","of","a","print","i","be","realli","disappoint","by","the","film","disjoint","pace","it","realli","be","too","longbr","br","the","stori","be","set","in","civil","war","era","missouri","and","be","about","a","young","man","roedel","who","join","the","feral","forc","of","the","bushwack","sort","of","renegad","confeder","sympath","who","conduct","geurilla","typ","fight","with","the","jayhawk","their","union","counterpart","he","and","hi","close","friend","jack","bull","chile","plai","by","skeet","ulrich","join","the","group","after","chile","father","be","shoot","pointblank","and","hi","home","be","burn","presum","by","jayhawk","the","stori","follow","roedel","and","chile","raid","adventur","and","their","interact","with","other","victim","of","the","war","includ","former","slave","who","fight","for","the","bushwhack","daniel","holt","plai","by","jefferi","wright","and","a","war","widow","plai","by","jewelbr","br","it","seem","that","everi","time","the","film","develop","the","stori","to","a","interest","point","it","would","turn","to","some","other","subplot","and","leav","thing","undevelop","for","exampl","the","agit","among","roedel","group","caus","by","former","slave","holt","particip","in","the","confeder","caus","be","show","briefli","through","some","conflict","regard","proprieti","and","protocol","and","then","drop","until","late","in","the","movi","a","young","villianbulli","bushwhack","hate","roedel","and","direct","much","angst","and","violenc","against","him","but","we","never","know","why","some","of","the","charact","never","seem","to","surfac","i","think","that","be","becaus","the","movi","embrac","too","mani","of","them","a","good","a","take","on","larg","amount","of","historybr","br","the","histor","detail","be","excel","i","love","look","at","the","hous","furnitur","cloth","etc","and","i","think","the","lead","actor","do","a","wonder","job","of","human","the","charact","though","thei","stumbl","a","bite","with","the","dialog","unless","you","realli","enjoi","histori","or","be","a","huge","ang","lee","fan","though","take","a","pass","on","thi","on"],"filtered":["probabl","viewer","recommend","thi","film","think","visual","stun","like","ang","lee","work","still","frame","seem","worthi","print","realli","disappoint","film","disjoint","pace","realli","longbr","br","stori","set","civil","war","era","missouri","young","man","roedel","join","feral","forc","bushwack","sort","renegad","confeder","sympath","conduct","geurilla","typ","fight","jayhawk","union","counterpart","hi","close","friend","jack","bull","chile","plai","skeet","ulrich","join","group","chile","father","shoot","pointblank","hi","home","burn","presum","jayhawk","stori","follow","roedel","chile","raid","adventur","interact","victim","war","includ","former","slave","fight","bushwhack","daniel","holt","plai","jefferi","wright","war","widow","plai","jewelbr","br","seem","everi","time","film","develop","stori","interest","point","turn","subplot","leav","thing","undevelop","exampl","agit","among","roedel","group","caus","former","slave","holt","particip","confeder","caus","show","briefli","conflict","regard","proprieti","protocol","drop","late","movi","young","villianbulli","bushwhack","hate","roedel","direct","much","angst","violenc","never","know","charact","never","seem","surfac","think","becaus","movi","embrac","mani","good","take","larg","amount","historybr","br","histor","detail","excel","love","look","hous","furnitur","cloth","etc","think","lead","actor","wonder","job","human","charact","though","thei","stumbl","bite","dialog","unless","realli","enjoi","histori","huge","ang","lee","fan","though","take","pass","thi"],"filtered2":["probabl","viewer","recommend","think","visual","stun","like","ang","lee","work","still","frame","seem","worthi","print","realli","disappoint","disjoint","pace","realli","longbr","stori","set","civil","war","era","missouri","young","man","roedel","join","feral","forc","bushwack","sort","renegad","confeder","sympath","conduct","geurilla","typ","fight","jayhawk","union","counterpart","close","friend","jack","bull","chile","plai","skeet","ulrich","join","group","chile","father","shoot","pointblank","home","burn","presum","jayhawk","stori","follow","roedel","chile","raid","adventur","interact","victim","war","includ","former","slave","fight","bushwhack","daniel","holt","plai","jefferi","wright","war","widow","plai","jewelbr","seem","everi","time","develop","stori","interest","point","turn","subplot","leav","thing","undevelop","exampl","agit","among","roedel","group","caus","former","slave","holt","particip","confeder","caus","show","briefli","conflict","regard","proprieti","protocol","drop","late","young","villianbulli","bushwhack","hate","roedel","direct","angst","violenc","never","know","charact",

{"value":"The husband-and-wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films. As is the case for some other performers of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them, in which they're portrayed by other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me', starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker.<br /><br />In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- Jesse Block and Eve Sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the \"second-team\" Fields and Seeley. Offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples' living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room-service rates for every meal they ate, and eventually running out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending in comfortable retirement.<br /><br />The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists. Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930, although I've never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start performing. They both have plenty of pep, and she's fairly attractive.<br /><br />I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they're about to break into a dance, but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive.<br /><br />I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and

{"value":"Incredible. Does it get any dumber than this? Not a chance. The stupidity in this movie would shame even Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part in the series had mediocre dialog and the second one had bad dialog, then this one has cretinous dialog. Amazing. But this time the story has been lowered to the level of the dialog, too. In spite of the acting and the dialog, I liked the first two films, but \"Cube Zero\" will surely kill the franchise. The utterly moronic plot so obviously stems from the pen of a frustrated left-winger.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if such leftists even themselves realize just how anti-democracy and pro-dictatorship they are. In this movie they obviously target the US  a democracy. Why don't they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe etc. in anti-military movies? Sure, most of these places are hardly likely to produce a cube like this any time soon, but that's beside the point. It's obvious: writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go as far as to say that ANYONE who adamantly attacks US foreign policies all the time, has anti-democratic beliefs in his core.<br /><br />Back to the movie: apart from being so far-fetched that it isn't even funny any more, the film has many obvious illogicalities. For example, for some reason the two men who supervise the cube have done it for a while and are oblivious to the pain and sadism that the project entails, yet the first one than the other suddenly turn against the system! Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about that cretinous character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat who talks as if he's in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears the movie loses ALL seriousness and hence any chance of being exciting: it really does become a

{"value":"I grew up on the 'Superman II' theatrical version (\"S2T\") and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman-type villains, it started off with a bang  the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes. Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen, as in part I. Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T (See: my review.) I've always heard of the back-story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director, Richard Donner from part II. (It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.) Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or, \"S2RD\") I still can't fully recommend it. Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening. In fact, they all but wrote the words: \"Previously on Superman\" in S2RD. The special effects weren't great in either Part I or S2T , but S2RD, they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the \"honeymoon suite.\" Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as 'I.' This is not only a lazy, unoriginal copout, it doesn't make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner, if those events never actually happened.

{"value":"I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that \"Stripes\" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and \"Stripes\" is a bad movie.<br /><br />Now, \"Stripes\" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.<br /><br />Why is it bad? Mostly because \"Stripes\" is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as \"Anchorman\" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.<br /><br />\"Stripes\" further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.<br /><br />Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in \"Stripes\" revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny (like I didn't) you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in \"Stripes\" funny either.<br /><br />\"Stripes\" is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's \"buddy\" comedy I would recommend \"Stir Crazy.\" Like \"Stripes\" the humor in \"Stir Crazy\" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike \"Stripes\" it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","like","thi","bill","murrai","vehicl","when","it","be","origin","releas","in","the","so","i","try","watch","it","again","to","see","if","my","distast","for","thi","film","be","down","to","my","moviego","tast","in","the","or","be","it","that","stripe","be","simpli","a","bad","movi","good","the","verdict","be","in","and","stripe","be","a","bad","moviebr","br","now","stripe","mai","have","be","innov","comedi","in","the","earli","and","it","mai","appeal","to","peopl","who","have","go","through","basic","train","or","who","be","bill","murrai","fan","but","it","still","a","bad","moviebr","br","why","be","it","bad","mostli","becaus","stripe","be","suppos","to","be","a","comedi","but","it","just","not","that","funni","there","be","some","laugh","but","thei","be","few","and","far","between","much","of","the","movi","be","consum","by","the","dramat","plot","which","be","incredibli","convolut","and","not","veri","interest","thi","lack","of","comedi","be","especi","notic","if","you","re","us","to","much","contemporari","comedi","such","a","anchorman","which","strive","for","laugh","in","everi","part","of","the","moviebr","br","stripe","far","suffer","from","bill","murrai","and","harold","rami","lack","of","act","abil","bill","murrai","be","a","great","comedian","but","he","be","not","a","veri","compel","dramat","actor","at","thi","point","in","hi","career","and","harold","rami","be","plai","harold","rami","thi","two","be","just","not","good","enough","a","actor","to","carri","the","dramat","arch","of","the","moviebr","br","lastli","much","of","the","comedi","that","there","be","in","stripe","revolv","around","bill","murrai","selfcent","smartalec","manchild","charact","so","if","you","do","not","find","that","charact","funni","like","i","do","not","you","re","not","go","to","find","much","of","what","littl","comedi","there","be","in","stripe","funni","eitherbr","br","stripe","be","veri","much","a","movi","of","it","era","it","have","not","ag","good","and","be","not","worth","watch","if","you","want","to","watch","a","earli","buddi","comedi","i","would","recommend","stir","crazi","like","stripe","the","humor","in","stir","crazi","be","not","a","fastpac","a","in","contemporari","comedi","but","unlik","stripe","it","have","ag","much","well","and","a","a","result","be","still","watchabl"],"filtered":["like","thi","bill","murrai","vehicl","origin","releas","try","watch","see","distast","thi","film","moviego","tast","stripe","simpli","bad","movi","good","verdict","stripe","bad","moviebr","br","stripe","mai","innov","comedi","earli","mai","appeal","peopl","go","basic","train","bill","murrai","fan","still","bad","moviebr","br","bad","mostli","becaus","stripe","suppos","comedi","funni","laugh","thei","far","much","movi","consum","dramat","plot","incredibli","convolut","veri","interest","thi","lack","comedi","especi","notic","re","us","much","contemporari","comedi","anchorman","strive","laugh","everi","part","moviebr","br","stripe","far","suffer","bill","murrai","harold","rami","lack","act","abil","bill","murrai","great","comedian","veri","compel","dramat","actor","thi","point","hi","career","harold","rami","plai","harold","rami","thi","two","good","enough","actor","carri","dramat","arch","moviebr","br","lastli","much","comedi","stripe","revolv","around","bill","murrai","selfcent","smartalec","manchild","charact","find","charact","funni","like","re","go","find","much","littl","comedi","stripe","funni","eitherbr","br","stripe","veri","much","movi","era","ag","good","worth","watch","want","watch","earli","buddi","comedi","recommend","stir","crazi","like","stripe","humor","stir","crazi","fastpac","contemporari","comedi","unlik","stripe","ag","much","well","result","still","watchabl"],"filtered2":["like","bill","murrai","vehicl","origin","releas","try","watch","see","distast","moviego","tast","stripe","simpli","bad","good","verdict","stripe","bad","moviebr","stripe","mai","innov","comedi","earli","mai","appeal","peopl","go","basic","train","bill","murrai","fan","still","bad","moviebr","bad","mostli","becaus","stripe","suppos","comedi","funni","laugh","far","consum","dramat","plot","incredibli","convolut","veri","interest","lack","comedi","especi","notic","re","us","contemporari","comedi","anchorman","strive","laugh","everi","part","moviebr","stripe","far","suffer","bill","murrai","harold","rami","lack","act","abil","bill","murrai","great","comedian","veri","compel","dramat","actor","point","career","harold","rami","plai","harold","rami","two","good","enough","actor","carri","dramat","arch","moviebr","lastli","comedi","stripe","revolv","around","bill","murrai","selfcent","smartalec","manchild","charact","find","charact","funni","like","re","go","find","littl","comedi","stripe","funni","eitherbr","stripe","veri","era","ag","good","worth","watch","want","watch","earli","buddi","comedi","recommend","stir","crazi","like","stripe","humor","stir","crazi","fastpac","contemporari","comedi","unlik","

{"value":"Tell the truth I’m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie. And after having seen it, I was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie.<br /><br />I’m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid’s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. I’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.<br /><br />Synopsis: The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven’t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin’) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. And the acting is so-so as expected when you’re watching this type of movie. And the direction, what do one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. Can’t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Pros: Elizabeth Bank?

{"value":"No one is a greater fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman papers than I am.<br /><br />I was surprised to see just now that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash, since I also see he had made the Three/Four Musketeers with Fraser which I though turned out rather well.<br /><br />Not so Royal Flash.<br /><br />I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published up to that time, and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I still am, but he was never really given a chance after that).<br /><br />What a disappointment (I saw it once again when I was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse).<br /><br />None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. The dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.<br /><br />Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda.<br /><br />If you have read the book and not seen the film, I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi has just invented: Russian roulette.<br /><br />A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.<br /><br />My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently, but I am glad I

of work, it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as that he did all those awful Roger Moore James Bond films.","finished_norm":["no","on","be","a","great","fan","of","gerog","macdonald","fraser","flashman","paper","than","i","ambr","br","i","be","surpris","to","see","just","now","that","richard","lester","direct","royal","flash","sinc","i","conjur","see","he","have","make","the","threefour","musket","with","fraser","which","i","though","turn","out","rather","wellbr","br","not","so","royal","flashbr","br","i","be","year","old","when","the","film","be","releas","and","can","not","have","be","much","enthusiast","sinc","i","have","read","all","the","flashman","paper","publish","up","to","that","time","and","be","intox","with","a","clockwork","orang","and","malcolm","macdowel","i","still","be","but","he","be","never","realli","give","a","chanc","after","thatbr","br","what","a","disappoint","i","see","it","onc","again","when","i","be","about","on","televis","and","it","seem","even","worsebr","br","none","of","the","sharp","dialogu","in","the","book","be","transfer","to","the","screen","the","comedi","of","flashman","charact","seem","to","me","to","have","be","mishandl","in","about","the","same","wai","on","can","imagin","a","group","of","high","school","student","try","to","parodi","it","would","do","the","duel","and","fenc","be","aw","and","undramaticbr","br","look","back","with","much","matur","ey","the","film","fail","complet","to","exploit","the","possibl","of","direct","satir","of","earli","film","version","of","the","prison","of","zendabr","br","if","you","have","read","the","book","and","not","see","the","film","i","can","onli","sai","that","the","film","end","with","flashman","and","rudi","von","starnberg","becom","fast","friend","and","plai","a","game","rudi","have","just","invent","russian","roulettebr","br","a","pathet","betray","of","everyth","the","book","be","aboutbr","br","my","comment","would","be","much","direct","if","i","have","see","the","film","much","recent","but","i","be","glad","i","have","notbr","br","if","by","ani","chanc","fraser","ever","read","thi","i","can","onli","sai","i","think","he","be","a","geniusperhap","the","great","comic","novelist","of","hi","gener","but","base","on","my","appreci","of","that","corpu","of","work","it","a","hard","to","believ","that","he","write","the","screenplai","of","thi","film","a","that","he","do","all","that","aw","roger","moor","jame","bond","film"],"filtered":["great","fan","gerog","macdonald","fraser","flashman","paper","ambr","br","surpris","see","richard","lester","direct","royal","flash","sinc","conjur","see","make","threefour","musket","fraser","though","turn","rather","wellbr","br","royal","flashbr","br","year","old","film","releas","much","enthusiast","sinc","read","flashman","paper","publish","time","intox","clockwork","orang","malcolm","macdowel","still","never","realli","give","chanc","thatbr","br","disappoint","see","onc","televis","seem","even","worsebr","br","none","sharp","dialogu","book","transfer","screen","comedi","flashman","charact","seem","mishandl","wai","imagin","group","high","school","student","try","parodi","duel","fenc","aw","undramaticbr","br","look","back","much","matur","ey","film","fail","complet","exploit","possibl","direct","satir","earli","film","version","prison","zendabr","br","read","book","see","film","onli","sai","film","end","flashman","rudi","von","starnberg","becom","fast","friend","plai","game","rudi","invent","russian","roulettebr","br","pathet","betray","everyth","book","aboutbr","br","comment","much","direct","see","film","much","recent","glad","notbr","br","ani","chanc","fraser","ever","read","thi","onli","sai","think","geniusperhap","great","comic","novelist","hi","gener","base","appreci","corpu","work","hard","believ","write","screenplai","thi","film","aw","roger","moor","jame","bond","film"],"filtered2":["great","fan","gerog","macdonald","fraser","flashman","paper","ambr","surpris","see","richard","lester","direct","royal","flash","sinc","conjur","see","make","threefour","musket","fraser","though","turn","rather","wellbr","royal","flashbr","year","old","releas","enthusiast","sinc","read","flashman","paper","publish","time","intox","clockwork","orang","malcolm","macdowel","still","never","realli","give","chanc","thatbr","disappoint","see","onc","televis","seem","even","worsebr","none","sharp","dialogu","book","transfer","screen","comedi","flashman","charact","seem","mishandl","wai","imagin","group","high","school","student","try","parodi","duel","fenc","aw","undramaticbr","look","back","matur","ey","fail","complet","exploit","possibl","direct","satir","earli","version","prison","zendabr","read","book","see","onli","end","flashman","rudi","von","starnberg","becom","fast","friend","plai","game","rudi","invent","russian","roulettebr","pathet","betray","everyth","book","aboutbr","comment","direct","see","recent","glad","notbr","ani","chanc","fraser","ever","read","onli","think","geniusperhap","great","comic","novelist","gener","base","appreci","corpu","work","hard","believ","write","screenplai","aw","roger

{"value":"I disliked this movie for numerous reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film, I grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself, for me at least, that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug. Unfortunately, that did not occur. The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film. Afterward, I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were \"moments\" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them to find their \"moments\" was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog. Although the plot is an interesting one, the movie on the whole is so poorly written, directed and edited that anybody's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it. The disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small-town America, I think, were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it's mark. As one reviewer has noted and I would agree, the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form. I suspect that, or at least hope that (for the actor's sakes anyway) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor. Sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop. Oh yeah and another thing...I wished for just once I could go see an American movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and/or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans, smashed CDs and, other such trash!","finished_norm":["i","dislik","thi","movi","for","numer","reason","within","the","ten","minut","of","the","film","i","grow","extrem","disappoint","and","come","to","the","conclus","that","if","thi","movi","be","go","to","salvag","itself","for","me","at","littl","that","it","be","go","to","have","to","pull","itself","out","of","the","enorm","hole","it","have","dig","unfortun","that","do","not","occur","the","two","draw","of","the","movi","for","me","be","to","see","jane","fonda","and","felic","huffman","i","do","not","know","enough","about","lindsei","lohan","work","to","have","be","interest","in","what","she","would","bring","to","the","film","afterward","i","just","feel","disappoint","in","and","for","all","three","of","them","even","though","there","be","moment","in","each","of","their","perform","i","imagin","that","for","each","of","them","to","find","their","moment","be","a","veri","difficult","task","give","the","fact","that","there","be","a","amaz","lack","of","charact","develop","and","uninspir","dialog","although","the","plot","be","a","interest","on","the","movi","on","the","whole","be","so","poorli","write","direct","and","edit","that","anybodi","perform","a","a","actor","would","suffer","and","be","taint","by","it","the","disrespect","wai","in","which","it","deal","with","sexual","abus","and","the","trite","and","insult","viewpoint","of","smalltown","america","i","think","be","the","two","main","reason","why","thi","film","fail","in","hit","it","mark","a","on","review","have","note","and","i","would","agre","the","movi","be","almost","imposs","to","market","give","it","finish","form","i","suspect","that","or","at","littl","hope","that","for","the","actor","sake","anywai","there","be","some","real","gem","on","the","cut","room","floor","sad","for","u","but","if","that","true","then","the","actor","can","take","solac","in","that","and","feel","somewhat","good","about","lend","their","talent","and","time","to","such","a","flop","oh","ye","and","anoth","thingi","wish","for","just","onc","i","can","go","see","a","american","movi","which","includ","the","sadli","disappear","but","wonderfulli","bucol","set","such","a","the","on","in","thi","film","where","the","main","charact","be","not","absentmindedli","andor","disrespectfulli","litter","the","countri","side","with","pop","can","smash","cd","and","other","such","trash"],"filtered":["dislik","thi","movi","numer","reason","within","ten","minut","film","grow","extrem","disappoint","come","conclus","thi","movi","go","salvag","littl","go","pull","enorm","hole","dig","unfortun","occur","two","draw","movi","see","jane","fonda","felic","huffman","know","enough","lindsei","lohan","work","interest","bring","film","afterward","feel","disappoint","three","even","though","moment","perform","imagin","find","moment","veri","difficult","task","give","fact","amaz","lack","charact","develop","uninspir","dialog","although","plot","interest","movi","whole","poorli","write","direct","edit","anybodi","perform","actor","suffer","taint","disrespect","wai","deal","sexual","abus","trite","insult","viewpoint","smalltown","america","think","two","main","reason","thi","film","fail","hit","mark","review","note","agre","movi","almost","imposs","market","give","finish","form","suspect","littl","hope","actor","sake","anywai","real","gem","cut","room","floor","sad","u","true","actor","take","solac","feel","somewhat","good","lend","talent","time","flop","oh","ye","anoth","thingi","wish","onc","go","see","american","movi","includ","sadli","disappear","wonderfulli","bucol","set","thi","film","main","charact","absentmindedli","andor","disrespectfulli","litter","countri","side","pop","smash","cd","trash"],"filtered2":["dislik","numer","reason","within","ten","minut","grow","extrem","disappoint","come","conclus","go","salvag","littl","go","pull","enorm","hole","dig","unfortun","occur","two","draw","see","jane","fonda","felic","huffman","know","enough","lindsei","lohan","work","interest","bring","afterward","feel","disappoint","three","even","though","moment","perform","imagin","find","moment","veri","difficult","task","give","fact","amaz","lack","charact","develop","uninspir","dialog","although","plot","interest","whole","poorli","write","direct","edit","anybodi","perform","actor","suffer","taint","disrespect","wai","deal","sexual","abus","trite","insult","viewpoint","smalltown","america","think","two","main","reason","fail","hit","mark","review","note","agre","almost","imposs","market","give","finish","form","suspect","littl","hope","actor","sake","anywai","real","gem","cut","room","floor","sad","u","true","actor","take","solac","feel","somewhat","good","lend","talent","time","flop","oh","ye","anoth","thingi","wish","onc","go","see","american","includ","sadli","disappear","wonderfulli","bucol","set","main","charact","absentmindedli","andor","disrespectfulli","litter","countri","side","pop","smash","cd","trash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,6,8,10,12,14,15,26,3

{"value":"Nightmare Weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies' they are prepared to do almost anything.<br /><br />I'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No...I'm talking about those who are more than willing to co-star with a badly made hand-puppet called George. Now that is embarrassing!!!<br /><br />A bio-electronic being created by brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair) is the artificially intelligent interface for an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device (a silver sphere about the size of a golf ball) that, when ingested, can reverse character disorders.<br /><br />Edward's personality altering experiments have been successful on lab animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human subjects, fearing that there may still be side effects. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such qualms, and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into hideous killer mutants.<br /><br />With bargain basement special effects, a cast totally devoid of talent, and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes as I watched the film, and even then I am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft-core sex scenes and a touch of gore can rescue.<br /><br />This film also features one of the most irritating characters I have ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman wearing idiot who bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.","finished_norm":["nightmar","weekend","be","proof","posit","that","some","peopl","be","so","desper","to","be","in","the","movi","thei","be","prepar","to","do","almost","anythingbr","br","i","be","not","refer","to","the","countless","woman","who","seem","quit","happi","to","appear","complet","starker","in","thi","dread","piec","of","trash","after","all","the","nake","femal","form","be","a","beauti","thing","and","noth","to","be","asham","of","noim","talk","about","that","who","be","much","than","will","to","costar","with","a","badli","make","handpuppet","call","georg","now","that","be","embarrassingbr","br","a","bioelectron","be","creat","by","brilliant","scientist","edward","brake","wellington","meffert","georg","who","look","like","a","dement","feel","clown","with","green","wool","for","hair","be","the","artifici","intellig","interfac","for","a","advanc","comput","system","that","oper","a","revolutionari","devic","a","silver","sphere","about","the","size","of","a","golf","ball","that","when","ingest","can","revers","charact","disordersbr","br","edward","person","alter","experi","have","be","success","on","lab","anim","but","the","cautiou","scientist","be","reluct","to","carri","out","test","on","human","subject","fear","that","there","mai","still","be","side","effect","hi","evil","assist","juli","debbi","laster","howev","have","no","such","qualm","and","proce","to","us","three","beauti","young","woman","a","guinea","pig","inevit","thei","all","turn","into","hideou","killer","mutantsbr","br","with","bargain","basem","special","effect","a","cast","total","devoid","of","talent","and","a","plot","that","be","almost","imposs","to","follow","i","take","note","a","i","watch","the","film","and","even","then","i","be","not","entir","convinc","that","my","synopsi","be","accur","nightmar","weekend","be","a","complet","and","utter","disast","that","not","even","sever","softcor","sex","scene","and","a","touch","of","gore","can","rescuebr","br","thi","film","conjur","featur","on","of","the","much","irrit","charact","i","have","ever","see","in","a","horror","movi","toni","bruce","morton","a","walkman","wear","idiot","who","bop","awai","to","crap","music","in","a","manner","that","make","me","look","like","justin","timberlak","in","comparison"],"filtered":["nightmar","weekend","proof","posit","peopl","desper","movi","thei","prepar","almost","anythingbr","br","refer","countless","woman","seem","quit","happi","appear","complet","starker","thi","dread","piec","trash","nake","femal","form","beauti","thing","noth","asham","noim","talk","much","costar","badli","make","handpuppet","call","georg","embarrassingbr","br","bioelectron","creat","brilliant","scientist","edward","brake","wellington","meffert","georg","look","like","dement","feel","clown","green","wool","hair","artifici","intellig","interfac","advanc","comput","system","oper","revolutionari","devic","silver","sphere","size","golf","ball","ingest","revers","charact","disordersbr","br","edward","person","alter","experi","success","lab","anim","cautiou","scientist","reluct","carri","test","human","subject","fear","mai","still","side","effect","hi","evil","assist","juli","debbi","laster","howev","qualm","proce","us","three","beauti","young","woman","guinea","pig","inevit","thei","turn","hideou","killer","mutantsbr","br","bargain","basem","special","effect","cast","total","devoid","talent","plot","almost","imposs","follow","take","note","watch","film","even","entir","convinc","synopsi","accur","nightmar","weekend","complet","utter","disast","even","sever","softcor","sex","scene","touch","gore","rescuebr","br","thi","film","conjur","featur","much","irrit","charact","ever","see","horror","movi","toni","bruce","morton","walkman","wear","idiot","bop","awai","crap","music","manner","make","look","like","justin","timberlak","comparison"],"filtered2":["nightmar","weekend","proof","posit","peopl","desper","prepar","almost","anythingbr","refer","countless","woman","seem","quit","happi","appear","complet","starker","dread","piec","trash","nake","femal","form","beauti","thing","noth","asham","noim","talk","costar","badli","make","handpuppet","call","georg","embarrassingbr","bioelectron","creat","brilliant","scientist","edward","brake","wellington","meffert","georg","look","like","dement","feel","clown","green","wool","hair","artifici","intellig","interfac","advanc","comput","system","oper","revolutionari","devic","silver","sphere","size","golf","ball","ingest","revers","charact","disordersbr","edward","person","alter","experi","success","lab","anim","cautiou","scientist","reluct","carri","test","human","subject","fear","mai","still","side","effect","evil","assist","juli","debbi","laster","howev","qualm","proce","us","three","beauti","young","woman","guinea","pig","inevit","turn","hideou","killer","mutantsbr","bargain","basem","special","effect","cast","total","devoid","talent","plot","almost","imposs","follow","take","note","watch","even","entir","convinc","synopsi","accur"

{"value":"Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie, after all I thought Steve Carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin, and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I'll start with what is right with this movie: at certain points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing. He's an undoubtedly talented individual, and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.<br /><br />The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.<br /><br />The family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie. No family behaves like this. It's almost as if they've been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7. It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling, and talent shows ARE NOT HOW ACTUAL PEOPLE BEHAVE. It's almost sickening.<br /><br />Another big flaw is the woman Carell is supposed to be falling for. Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded.<br /><br />It makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw.
