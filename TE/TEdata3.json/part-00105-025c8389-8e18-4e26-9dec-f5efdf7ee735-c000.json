{"value":"Oh, come on people give this film a break. The one thing I liked about it was......... Sorry, still thinking. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne came and shot up the the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking of a better quality film. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yeah, the chick that was from Clueless was in it. Don't put down Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a dooooosie.<br /><br />Hey, one thing that has never been done in a western, even an all female cast, they actually hung a woman from the gallows. That might be a western first. Even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal, still, you've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first. Also, I've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western, although that didn't happen in this movie, I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses#2, which should be made right after Ed Wood's Bride Of The Monster #2. Maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for. Orginality, especially with an all African woman cast and an oriental cowgirl.<br /><br />Heeey, if the makers of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you could have such slang like, \"Hey, don't you be takin about my homegirls\" and \"talk to the hand, baby, talk to the hand.\" You could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like, \"That gunfight was TOTALLY RAD man, totally.\" You know things like that.","finished_norm":["oh","come","on","peopl","give","thi","film","a","break","the","on","thing","i","like","about","it","be","sorri","still","think","oh","ye","when","john","wayn","come","and","shoot","up","the","the","bad","gui","oh","sorri","wrong","movi","i","be","think","of","a","well","qualiti","film","let","me","see","now","i","be","still","try","to","defend","it","oh","ye","the","chick","that","be","from","clueless","be","in","it","do","not","put","down","staci","dash","i","mean","we","all","make","mistak","but","boi","staci","you","make","a","dooooosiebr","br","hei","on","thing","that","have","never","be","do","in","a","western","even","a","all","femal","cast","thei","actual","hang","a","woman","from","the","gallow","that","mai","be","a","western","even","though","her","neck","should","have","be","break","and","she","surviv","the","ordeal","still","you","have","get","to","give","the","director","some","effort","for","try","a","western","conjur","i","have","never","see","a","woman","lynch","from","a","hors","in","ani","western","although","that","do","not","happen","in","thi","movi","i","just","think","i","would","give","the","director","anoth","idea","for","gang","of","rose","which","should","be","make","right","after","ed","wood","bride","of","the","monster","mayb","that","be","what","the","maker","of","thi","film","be","go","for","orgin","especi","with","a","all","african","woman","cast","and","a","orient","cowgirlbr","br","heeei","if","the","maker","of","gang","of","rose","want","to","make","a","sequel","to","thi","mess","you","can","have","such","slang","like","hei","do","not","you","be","takin","about","my","homegirl","and","talk","to","the","hand","babi","talk","to","the","hand","you","can","conjur","have","a","surfer","dude","typ","deputi","marshal","that","sai","thing","like","that","gunfight","be","total","rad","man","total","you","know","thing","like","that"],"filtered":["oh","come","peopl","give","thi","film","break","thing","like","sorri","still","think","oh","ye","john","wayn","come","shoot","bad","gui","oh","sorri","wrong","movi","think","well","qualiti","film","let","see","still","try","defend","oh","ye","chick","clueless","put","staci","dash","mean","make","mistak","boi","staci","make","dooooosiebr","br","hei","thing","never","western","even","femal","cast","thei","actual","hang","woman","gallow","mai","western","even","though","neck","break","surviv","ordeal","still","get","give","director","effort","try","western","conjur","never","see","woman","lynch","hors","ani","western","although","happen","thi","movi","think","give","director","anoth","idea","gang","rose","make","right","ed","wood","bride","monster","mayb","maker","thi","film","go","orgin","especi","african","woman","cast","orient","cowgirlbr","br","heeei","maker","gang","rose","want","make","sequel","thi","mess","slang","like","hei","takin","homegirl","talk","hand","babi","talk","hand","conjur","surfer","dude","typ","deputi","marshal","sai","thing","like","gunfight","total","rad","man","total","know","thing","like"],"filtered2":["oh","come","peopl","give","break","thing","like","sorri","still","think","oh","ye","john","wayn","come","shoot","bad","gui","oh","sorri","wrong","think","well","qualiti","let","see","still","try","defend","oh","ye","chick","clueless","put","staci","dash","mean","make","mistak","boi","staci","make","dooooosiebr","hei","thing","never","western","even","femal","cast","actual","hang","woman","gallow","mai","western","even","though","neck","break","surviv","ordeal","still","get","give","director","effort","try","western","conjur","never","see","woman","lynch","hors","ani","western","although","happen","think","give","director","anoth","idea","gang","rose","make","right","ed","wood","bride","monster","mayb","maker","go","orgin","especi","african","woman","cast","orient","cowgirlbr","heeei","maker","gang","rose","want","make","sequel","mess","slang","like","hei","takin","homegirl","talk","hand","babi","talk","hand","conjur","surfer","dude","typ","deputi","marshal","thing","like","gunfight","total","rad","man","total","know","thing","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,9,12,20,23,25,26,27,29,30,34,36,37,39,42,45,46,52,55,58,64,70,73,86,88,92,94,117,121,123,124,159,163,184,186,209,234,235,237,267,282,291,319,360,384,387,401,407,413,422,437,592,655,698,763,769,848,886,974,997,1041,1127,1376,1427,1806,2008,2160,2173,2269,2315,3145,3166,3225,3511,4403,4765,5508,6049,7605],"values":[4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,9,12,20,23,25,26,27,29,30,34,36,37,39,42,45,46,52,55,58,64,70,73,86,88,92,94,117,121,123,124,159,163,184,186,20

{"value":"When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We've all been guilty of it at some time or another, but my excuse for watching things like \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" and \"Silver Spoons\" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.<br /><br />Thankfully, I now appreciate the good stuff. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stilted dialogue, every bit of needless technobabble. The writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me long for the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble.<br /><br />The film Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas. With the exception of a little of the original music, none of what made the film fun appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep most episodes.<br /><br />The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. The cinematography isn't much better, as vanilla and dull as the scripts. It amazes me that shows with a lot more style (like Farscape) and substance (like the reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have smaller, less rabid fanbases than this pap.

{"value":"It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with. I neither understood or cared what the characters were doing.<br /><br />Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role.<br /><br />The film appears to have some fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watching it. I am a big Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, \"Cat's Meow\" and all his early ones from \"Targets\" to \"Nickleodeon\". So, it really surprised me that I was barely able to keep awake watching this one.<br /><br />It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called \"Moonlighting\" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no \"Paper Moon\" and only a very pale version of \"What's Up,

{"value":"The subject is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to \"escape\" from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence -- something almost everyone can relate to. The characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough to get most people to watch. However, very quickly the film turns into an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who \"don't get it\". The filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming, and this particular one, waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords. It's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care. However, the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. Moreover, the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them: a big no-no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.","finished_norm":["the","subject","be","certainli","compel","a","group","of","peopl","take","their","love","of","game","on","step","far","by","creat","a","fake","mediev","world","full","of","warrior","king","princ","and","castl","wargam","be","a","interest","phenomenon","that","delv","into","our","collect","ne","to","escap","from","realiti","and","the","sometim","mundan","of","our","exist","someth","almost","everyon","can","relat","to","the","charact","be","the","predict","mix","of","lord","of","the","ring","nerd","and","star","trek","enthusiast","that","enough","to","get","much","peopl","to","watch","howev","veri","quickli","the","film","turn","into","a","insid","view","of","wargam","with","a","almost","stereotyp","thumb","of","the","nose","to","viewer","who","do","not","get","it","the","filmmak","seem","to","take","the","subject","of","wargam","and","thi","particular","on","waaaaai","too","serious","rather","than","onc","in","awhil","recogn","the","humor","and","fun","in","make","a","film","about","adult","drssing","up","in","mediev","gear","and","pound","each","other","with","foam","sword","it","pretti","hard","for","anyon","who","doe","not","sit","on","their","comput","for","hour","a","dai","plai","game","or","desig","the","late","star","destroy","to","understand","what","the","charact","be","talk","about","and","why","we","should","even","care","howev","the","filmmak","themselv","seem","not","to","care","choos","to","focu","sole","on","the","subject","of","the","game","itself","rather","than","build","a","strong","narr","with","a","clear","stori","that","anyon","can","understand","moreov","the","charact","themselv","be","not","that","compel","and","you","quickli","becom","bore","of","them","a","big","nono","when","you","re","try","to","keep","peopl","attent","for","minut"],"filtered":["subject","certainli","compel","group","peopl","take","love","game","step","far","creat","fake","mediev","world","full","warrior","king","princ","castl","wargam","interest","phenomenon","delv","collect","ne","escap","realiti","sometim","mundan","exist","someth","almost","everyon","relat","charact","predict","mix","lord","ring","nerd","star","trek","enthusiast","enough","get","much","peopl","watch","howev","veri","quickli","film","turn","insid","view","wargam","almost","stereotyp","thumb","nose","viewer","get","filmmak","seem","take","subject","wargam","thi","particular","waaaaai","serious","rather","onc","awhil","recogn","humor","fun","make","film","adult","drssing","mediev","gear","pound","foam","sword","pretti","hard","anyon","doe","sit","comput","hour","dai","plai","game","desig","late","star","destroy","understand","charact","talk","even","care","howev","filmmak","themselv","seem","care","choos","focu","sole","subject","game","rather","build","strong","narr","clear","stori","anyon","understand","moreov","charact","themselv","compel","quickli","becom","bore","big","nono","re","try","keep","peopl","attent","minut"],"filtered2":["subject","certainli","compel","group","peopl","take","love","game","step","far","creat","fake","mediev","world","full","warrior","king","princ","castl","wargam","interest","phenomenon","delv","collect","ne","escap","realiti","sometim","mundan","exist","someth","almost","everyon","relat","charact","predict","mix","lord","ring","nerd","star","trek","enthusiast","enough","get","peopl","watch","howev","veri","quickli","turn","insid","view","wargam","almost","stereotyp","thumb","nose","viewer","get","filmmak","seem","take","subject","wargam","particular","waaaaai","serious","rather","onc","awhil","recogn","humor","fun","make","adult","drssing","mediev","gear","pound","foam","sword","pretti","hard","anyon","doe","sit","comput","hour","dai","plai","game","desig","late","star","destroy","understand","charact","talk","even","care","howev","filmmak","themselv","seem","care","choos","focu","sole","subject","game","rather","build","strong","narr","clear","stori","anyon","understand","moreov","charact","themselv","compel","quickli","becom","bore","big","nono","re","try","keep","peopl","attent","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,10,15,17,18,23,31,35,36,40,53,54,59,60,68,78,82,93,96,100,101,108,110,113,115,131,132,134,150,158,160,165,171,174,186,205,212,236,244,246,259,279,312,323,336,337,362,369,371,374,389,410,436,477,500,528,541,550,584,590,604,619,631,636,638,639,656,734,765,770,782,832,890,903,1026,1060,1084,1198,1253,1446,1467,1568,1775,1942,1952,1958,2304,2349,2398,2434,2586,3057,3196,3356,3693,4027,5207,5283,5405,6089],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":86

{"value":"This British film is truly awful, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, although he pretty much sleepwalks through it. The idea of a bomb on a train sounds good...but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is evacuated, so it's not like there's any danger to anyone either. In fact, this film could be used in a film class to show how NOT to make a suspense film. True suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters don't, a fact apparently unknown to the director. SPOILER: the train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. After the first bomb is defused, it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals there are two. Nor are we certain WHEN the bombs will go off, so we don't even have a classic \"ticking bomb\" tension sequence. A good 10 minutes or more are spent watching Glenn Ford's French wife thinking about leaving him, and then wondering where he is . She's such an annoying character that we don't care whether she reconciles with him, so when she does, there's nothing emotional about it.

{"value":"I can't believe I actually sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst acting since Killjoy.<br /><br />Here is a brief outline of the plot: The movie starts out with Jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach, drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach \"hunk\" who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life. Somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. UH OH! Here comes the competition! The stereotypical \"hot chick\" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. We soon find out Jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in Australia, which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'm gonna cry). A huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yup, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the \"story\" really takes off. Basically, they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the \"hunk\".<br /><br />This is a preteen flick with acting so bad, it makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all the clichés possible... the best friends, the \"hunk\" who everyone wants, the \"hot\" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man... you name it, it's in there. I took one for a lot of people by watching this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you. Please, don't see this movie.

{"value":"I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books I was very excited about this movie's premier, which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. Normally I'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well. Usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. It probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either. Most performances were ridiculously over the top, which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. Really, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful. It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.<br /><br />What a joke. Don't see this movie. After its conclusion I was genuinely

{"value":"We don't have this on television in England but I walked it over the Internet on YouTube. It's dumb, immature and boring! This is from the creator of \"Earthworm Jim\" Douglas TenNapel, I never got into that cartoon but I must admit it better than this. The cartoonist hasn't done anything for years since now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a comeback travesty and an all time low! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master. They are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on. \"BORING\"! The animation is dreadful. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they don't look nothing like cats! Just weird animal monster-looking creatures with big mouths, pointed teeth and bulgy eyes! The human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows. It surprised me how this show got 7.5/10 votes of other IMDb viewers. Television really isn't what is used to be! But now most of them is dumb, cheaply made and boring. Some of you on the website might not agree with me well I'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that Britain don't have too tolerate this crap (oh yeah, if you have digital you have to) but I don't, so it not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get that because I've given other shows

{"value":"I'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I've seen in some time.<br /><br />To have a good movie, you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Another thing, there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won't say who), the book makes it clear that it's a long, soul-searching process. In the film it's quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again, I won't say who), it seems artificial.<br /><br />I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film, but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way.

{"value":"First of all, I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply. In my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meant.<br /><br />However, the acting is near perfect. In fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked; talent! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast. Other than that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women. And just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and o something real artistic, I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work.

{"value":"I have never seen a worse movie.<br /><br />It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it into a decent movie.<br /><br />Mistake 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because... you don't get a chance.<br /><br />The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the begining.<br /><br />Mistake 2: the worst gunfight scene ever. I love gunfights. I love when the heros open up on the badguys and clean house. heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this gunfight was weird I guess that the best way to describe it is \"Apathetic\" I've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME. In this movie it looked and felt like the \"Actors\" were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion.<br /><br />Why? Where's the trash talking? where's the snarls of rage amongst the gunfire? These are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity.<br /><br />If you want a GOOD horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recomend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series.

{"value":"Unlike endemol USA's two other current game shows (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen.<br /><br />DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace--or end--at any moment. There is risk involved in every action the player takes, the rewards are wildly variable, and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money. Suspense is usually put to good use.<br /><br />Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is just too slow-paced. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and THEN have the player select a dancer, instead of Shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they're right. The random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler. Too much time is wasted while not enough is happening... and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early guarantees that there WILL be a lot of time wasted.<br /><br />Oh, and I have NO interest in watching Shat shake his groove thang, especially right after I've eaten dinner.<br /><br />I am a lifelong game show fan, but even I had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this. It either needs major changes or early retirement.","finished_norm":["unlik","endemol","usa","two","other","current","game","show","deal","or","no","deal","and","v","the","pace","in","thi","show","be","wai","too","slow","for","what","be","happen","on","the","screenbr","br","dond","and","v","can","get","awai","with","slow","pace","becaus","the","game","can","chang","paceor","endat","ani","moment","there","be","risk","involv","in","everi","action","the","player","take","the","reward","be","wildli","variabl","and","it","be","difficult","for","the","player","to","leav","with","a","signific","amount","of","monei","suspens","be","usual","put","to","good","usebr","br","show","me","the","monei","on","the","other","hand","be","just","too","slowpac","when","a","question","be","reveal","and","it","be","obviou","that","the","player","know","the","correct","answer","you","can","rest","assur","that","absolut","noth","excit","will","happen","in","the","next","few","minut","it","would","greatli","help","the","pace","of","thi","show","to","reveal","the","correct","answer","and","then","have","the","player","select","a","dancer","instead","of","shit","wast","time","talk","about","what","will","happen","if","the","player","get","a","answer","wrong","when","we","all","know","thei","re","right","the","random","danc","be","filler","that","actual","feel","like","filler","too","much","time","be","wast","while","not","enough","be","happen","and","the","fact","that","player","cannot","choos","to","quit","the","game","earli","guarante","that","there","will","be","a","lot","of","time","wastedbr","br","oh","and","i","have","no","interest","in","watch","shit","shake","hi","groov","thang","especi","right","after","i","have","eat","dinnerbr","br","i","be","a","lifelong","game","show","fan","but","even","i","have","a","lot","of","troubl","sit","through","a","hour","of","thi","it","either","ne","major","chang","or","earli","retir"],"filtered":["unlik","endemol","usa","two","current","game","show","deal","deal","v","pace","thi","show","wai","slow","happen","screenbr","br","dond","v","get","awai","slow","pace","becaus","game","chang","paceor","endat","ani","moment","risk","involv","everi","action","player","take","reward","wildli","variabl","difficult","player","leav","signific","amount","monei","suspens","usual","put","good","usebr","br","show","monei","hand","slowpac","question","reveal","obviou","player","know","correct","answer","rest","assur","absolut","noth","excit","happen","next","minut","greatli","help","pace","thi","show","reveal","correct","answer","player","select","dancer","instead","shit","wast","time","talk","happen","player","get","answer","wrong","know","thei","re","right","random","danc","filler","actual","feel","like","filler","much","time","wast","enough","happen","fact","player","choos","quit","game","earli","guarante","lot","time","wastedbr","br","oh","interest","watch","shit","shake","hi","groov","thang","especi","right","eat","dinnerbr","br","lifelong","game","show","fan","even","lot","troubl","sit","hour","thi","either","ne","major","chang","earli","retir"],"filtered2":["unlik","endemol","usa","two","current","game","show","deal","deal","v","pace","show","wai","slow","happen","screenbr","dond","v","get","awai","slow","pace","becaus","game","chang","paceor","endat","ani","moment","risk","involv","everi","action","player","take","reward","wildli","variabl","difficult","player","leav","signific","amount","monei","suspens","usual","put","good","usebr","show","monei","hand","slowpac","question","reveal","obviou","player","know","correct","answer","rest","assur","absolut","noth","excit","happen","next","minut","greatli","help","pace","show","reveal","correct","answer","player","select","dancer","instead","shit","wast","time","talk","happen","player","get","answer","wrong","know","re","right","random","danc","filler","actual","feel","like","filler","time","wast","enough","happen","fact","player","choos","quit","game","earli","guarante","lot","time","wastedbr","oh","interest","watch","shit","shake","groov","thang","especi","right","eat","dinnerbr","lifelong","game","show","fan","even","lot","troubl","sit","hour","either","ne","major","chang","earli","retir"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,7,8,22,25,26,27,28,31,33,43,47,49,52,59,60,68,72,74,85,89,93,94,97,110,120,121,126,129,140,152,155,159,174,185,186,188,207,222,226,234,235,241,244,265,266,267,278,297,374,378,383,390,404,468,492,524,529,546,584,599,615,752,771,800,803,833,859,999,1360,1417,1466,1642,1746,1927,2063,2087,2467,2515,2772,2889,3125,3224,3266,3993,4153,6950,7007,7296,7663,8145],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0

{"value":"Not as bad as you've heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have fairly good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is appealing and likable as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are consummate professionals. They're pretty good in just about everything. In the end, \"Surviving\" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /><br />Unfortunately, it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. The attempts at dark humor come off as dour. Affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed. His character's cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to Gandolfini and O'Hara's more muted, believable performances. Even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies, you never fully buy into the set-up of Affleck \"renting\" this family for X-mas.<br /><br />There are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness. The X-mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor (a son being discovered looking at naked, provocative pictures of his mother) that not only isn't funny or believable but disturbing.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the colors in this film are muddy, almost noirish. The house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap.<br /><br />\"Surviving\" is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be.","finished_norm":["not","a","bad","a","you","have","hear","there","be","actual","some","funni","part","and","affleck","and","appleg","have","fairli","good","chemistri","appleg","in","particular","be","appeal","and","likabl","a","affleck","love","interest","jame","gandolfini","and","catherin","o","hara","be","consumm","profession","thei","re","pretti","good","in","just","about","everyth","in","the","end","surviv","be","not","the","wrong","holidai","movi","you","will","ever","see","br","br","unfortun","it","be","unfocus","and","much","of","the","comedi","be","forc","the","attempt","at","dark","humor","come","off","a","dour","affleck","try","hard","to","be","endearingli","spastic","and","overenthusiast","but","come","across","a","disturb","hi","charact","cartoonish","natur","be","bring","into","high","relief","when","view","next","to","gandolfini","and","ohara","much","mute","believ","perform","even","by","the","relax","standard","of","holidai","movi","you","never","fulli","bui","into","the","setup","of","affleck","rent","thi","famili","for","xmasbr","br","there","be","conjur","scene","that","border","on","the","surreal","in","their","strang","the","xma","ev","scene","replet","with","incestu","humor","a","son","be","discov","look","at","nake","provoc","pictur","of","hi","mother","that","not","onli","be","not","funni","or","believ","but","disturbingbr","br","to","make","matter","wrong","the","color","in","thi","film","be","muddi","almost","noirish","the","hous","set","on","which","much","of","the","movi","take","place","look","stagei","and","cheapbr","br","surviv","be","mostli","of","interest","a","the","in","a","string","of","box","offic","dud","paycheck","gigli","jersei","girl","and","thi","for","affleck","it","remain","to","be","see","how","last","the","damag","will","be"],"filtered":["bad","hear","actual","funni","part","affleck","appleg","fairli","good","chemistri","appleg","particular","appeal","likabl","affleck","love","interest","jame","gandolfini","catherin","o","hara","consumm","profession","thei","re","pretti","good","everyth","end","surviv","wrong","holidai","movi","ever","see","br","br","unfortun","unfocus","much","comedi","forc","attempt","dark","humor","come","dour","affleck","try","hard","endearingli","spastic","overenthusiast","come","across","disturb","hi","charact","cartoonish","natur","bring","high","relief","view","next","gandolfini","ohara","much","mute","believ","perform","even","relax","standard","holidai","movi","never","fulli","bui","setup","affleck","rent","thi","famili","xmasbr","br","conjur","scene","border","surreal","strang","xma","ev","scene","replet","incestu","humor","son","discov","look","nake","provoc","pictur","hi","mother","onli","funni","believ","disturbingbr","br","make","matter","wrong","color","thi","film","muddi","almost","noirish","hous","set","much","movi","take","place","look","stagei","cheapbr","br","surviv","mostli","interest","string","box","offic","dud","paycheck","gigli","jersei","girl","thi","affleck","remain","see","last","damag"],"filtered2":["bad","hear","actual","funni","part","affleck","appleg","fairli","good","chemistri","appleg","particular","appeal","likabl","affleck","love","interest","jame","gandolfini","catherin","o","hara","consumm","profession","re","pretti","good","everyth","end","surviv","wrong","holidai","ever","see","unfortun","unfocus","comedi","forc","attempt","dark","humor","come","dour","affleck","try","hard","endearingli","spastic","overenthusiast","come","across","disturb","charact","cartoonish","natur","bring","high","relief","view","next","gandolfini","ohara","mute","believ","perform","even","relax","standard","holidai","never","fulli","bui","setup","affleck","rent","famili","xmasbr","conjur","scene","border","surreal","strang","xma","ev","scene","replet","incestu","humor","son","discov","look","nake","provoc","pictur","mother","onli","funni","believ","disturbingbr","make","matter","wrong","color","muddi","almost","noirish","hous","set","take","place","look","stagei","cheapbr","surviv","mostli","interest","string","box","offic","dud","paycheck","gigli","jersei","girl","affleck","remain","see","last","damag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,9,10,11,16,19,24,25,31,34,36,39,42,44,52,54,60,61,62,68,78,84,91,105,109,127,131,144,164,171,177,182,193,211,213,216,227,250,297,311,312,338,347,368,369,397,417,434,456,503,510,587,616,620,654,661,682,690,783,819,832,839,875,886,893,994,1132,1160,1367,1439,1686,1730,1754,1779,1985,2031,2185,2484,2497,2762,2790,3079,3291,3638,3672,3684,4909,5030,5157,5645,6872,6953,6984,7531,7582,7810],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1

{"value":"What \"Noise\" fails to do is get us to understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer, particularly car alarms. It's an odd idea for a film, which has about as much creative credibility as \"Death Wish.\" It is clever at points; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel, \"I'm too stupid to be understanding this.\" He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and don't get it either.Just then a car alarm goes off. Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises. Though, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona. <br /><br />The film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing, and visible boom mikes. No, \"Noise\" isn't all-bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the ending doesn't fall flat. Overall it drives home a logistical point, one you haven't probably thought of. At least I hadn't. Though all in all, ninety minutes long, it couldn't have ended sooner. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started.<br /><br />This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival, but probably won't get picked up for distribution.

{"value":"To this day when you speak of the Japanese cinema, most folks won't talk about Rashomon, or the Seven Ronin, or Ran. To the masses the Japanese cinema means all those monsters we've grown to love destroying those Japanese cities over and over again, lots of times in battles with each other. The first and greatest of these is Godzilla who's come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space, Ghidrah.<br /><br />Oddly enough in keeping with the times, the special effects got slightly better. But part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed, they looked so phony, maybe three steps above Ed Wood.<br /><br />Some visitors from the future have time traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla be destroyed from when he was first discovered. And in fact he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when he protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from those American troops. But later on with atomic testing on Bikini, Godzilla the friendly dinosaur just like Barney became the mean machine we've grown to know in the cinema.<br /><br />Of course you eliminate Godzilla than you give Ghidrah a clear field to wreck Japan so it does not become the economic colossus it was by 1991 when the film came out. More I won't say, but we all know Japan is doing reasonably well as 2010.<br /><br />Like all the other Japanese monster films, just sit back and enjoy the mayhem.","finished_norm":["to","thi","dai","when","you","speak","of","the","japanes","cinema","much","folk","wo","not","talk","about","rashomon","or","the","seven","ronin","or","run","to","the","mass","the","japanes","cinema","mean","all","that","monster","we","have","grow","to","love","destroi","that","japanes","citi","over","and","over","again","lot","of","time","in","battl","with","each","other","the","and","great","of","thi","be","godzilla","who","come","back","a","dozen","time","or","much","and","in","a","few","film","face","the","three","head","hydra","like","monster","from","outer","space","ghidrahbr","br","oddli","enough","in","keep","with","the","time","the","special","effect","get","slightli","well","but","part","of","the","charm","of","that","old","film","be","see","that","paper","mach","citi","set","destroi","thei","look","so","phoni","mayb","three","step","abov","ed","woodbr","br","some","visitor","from","the","futur","have","time","travel","to","japan","to","urg","that","godzilla","be","destroi","from","when","he","be","discov","and","in","fact","he","be","discov","a","a","surviv","dinosaur","dure","world","war","ii","when","he","protect","the","japanes","garrison","on","a","pacif","island","from","that","american","troop","but","late","on","with","atom","test","on","bikini","godzilla","the","friendli","dinosaur","just","like","barnei","becom","the","mean","machin","we","have","grow","to","know","in","the","cinemabr","br","of","cours","you","elimin","godzilla","than","you","give","ghidrah","a","clear","field","to","wreck","japan","so","it","doe","not","becom","the","econom","colossu","it","be","by","when","the","film","come","out","much","i","wo","not","sai","but","we","all","know","japan","be","do","reason","good","a","br","br","like","all","the","other","japanes","monster","film","just","sit","back","and","enjoi","the","mayhem"],"filtered":["thi","dai","speak","japanes","cinema","much","folk","wo","talk","rashomon","seven","ronin","run","mass","japanes","cinema","mean","monster","grow","love","destroi","japanes","citi","lot","time","battl","great","thi","godzilla","come","back","dozen","time","much","film","face","three","head","hydra","like","monster","outer","space","ghidrahbr","br","oddli","enough","keep","time","special","effect","get","slightli","well","part","charm","old","film","see","paper","mach","citi","set","destroi","thei","look","phoni","mayb","three","step","abov","ed","woodbr","br","visitor","futur","time","travel","japan","urg","godzilla","destroi","discov","fact","discov","surviv","dinosaur","dure","world","war","ii","protect","japanes","garrison","pacif","island","american","troop","late","atom","test","bikini","godzilla","friendli","dinosaur","like","barnei","becom","mean","machin","grow","know","cinemabr","br","cours","elimin","godzilla","give","ghidrah","clear","field","wreck","japan","doe","becom","econom","colossu","film","come","much","wo","sai","know","japan","reason","good","br","br","like","japanes","monster","film","sit","back","enjoi","mayhem"],"filtered2":["dai","speak","japanes","cinema","folk","wo","talk","rashomon","seven","ronin","run","mass","japanes","cinema","mean","monster","grow","love","destroi","japanes","citi","lot","time","battl","great","godzilla","come","back","dozen","time","face","three","head","hydra","like","monster","outer","space","ghidrahbr","oddli","enough","keep","time","special","effect","get","slightli","well","part","charm","old","see","paper","mach","citi","set","destroi","look","phoni","mayb","three","step","abov","ed","woodbr","visitor","futur","time","travel","japan","urg","godzilla","destroi","discov","fact","discov","surviv","dinosaur","dure","world","war","ii","protect","japanes","garrison","pacif","island","american","troop","late","atom","test","bikini","godzilla","friendli","dinosaur","like","barnei","becom","mean","machin","grow","know","cinemabr","cours","elimin","godzilla","give","ghidrah","clear","field","wreck","japan","doe","becom","econom","colossu","come","wo","know","japan","reason","good","like","japanes","monster","sit","back","enjoi","mayhem"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,8,16,18,20,26,30,34,51,54,61,63,67,72,88,93,95,97,106,109,115,132,134,137,150,163,165,186,199,200,203,208,223,224,239,244,251,314,344,406,409,413,561,590,595,637,704,719,738,783,786,797,843,844,886,965,1008,1032,1060,1071,1169,1282,1306,1323,1362,1376,1400,1509,1570,1830,1841,1897,2170,2216,2481,2605,2679,3103,3107,3149,3545,3748,4145,4303,4430,4783,5555,8016],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,8,16,18,20,26,30,34,51,54,61,63,67,72,88,

{"value":"This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot I rented the film) is discouraging also.<br /><br />Obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. HMM--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. Now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.<br /><br />There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage.

{"value":"There seems to be little in the way of middle ground where Watch On the Rhine is concerned. One either likes it very much, applauding its sincerity, its liberal point of view and fine acting, or else loathes its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness. I fall very much in the latter category, and found the film and play,--concerning the activities of European refugees in Washington during wartime--a crushing bore, worthwhile mostly for the acting, and even then only intermittently. That author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she seldom explored ideas that weren't already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the \"other side\" is. Even when I find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say,--as in Rhine--I still can't stand the way she says it. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I thoroughly agree with the late Mary McCarthy's long overdue dismantling of Hellman reputation some years ago. For those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days, I urge a peek at Watch On the Rhine, as bad in its way as Angels In America, which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago.","finished_norm":["there","seem","to","be","littl","in","the","wai","of","middl","grind","where","watch","on","the","rhine","be","concern","on","either","like","it","veri","much","applaud","it","sincer","it","liber","point","of","view","and","fine","act","or","els","loath","it","obviou","propaganda","mediocr","dialogu","cardboard","charact","and","overal","tendenti","i","fall","veri","much","in","the","latter","categori","and","find","the","film","and","playconcern","the","activ","of","european","refuge","in","washington","dure","wartimea","crush","bear","worthwhil","mostli","for","the","act","and","even","then","onli","intermitt","that","author","lillian","hellman","be","on","the","side","of","the","angel","be","irrelev","her","plai","be","write","for","peopl","who","share","her","point","of","view","and","she","seldom","explor","idea","that","be","not","alreadi","hold","by","the","author","and","audienc","except","to","point","out","how","dread","the","other","side","be","even","when","i","find","myself","in","on","hundr","percent","agreem","with","what","she","have","to","saya","in","rhinei","still","ca","not","stand","the","wai","she","sai","it","her","charact","be","unreal","and","while","her","ear","for","dialogu","show","a","certain","facil","for","the","wai","peopl","talk","she","possess","no","real","brillianc","or","origin","she","realli","have","noth","new","to","sai","i","thoroughli","agre","with","the","late","mari","mccarthi","long","overdu","dismantl","of","hellman","reput","some","year","ago","for","that","who","think","the","theatr","be","dead","or","in","extremi","and","yearn","for","the","good","old","dai","i","urg","a","peek","at","watch","on","the","rhine","a","bad","in","it","wai","a","angel","in","america","which","onli","go","to","show","that","the","theatr","have","on","foot","in","the","grave","sixti","year","ago"],"filtered":["seem","littl","wai","middl","grind","watch","rhine","concern","either","like","veri","much","applaud","sincer","liber","point","view","fine","act","els","loath","obviou","propaganda","mediocr","dialogu","cardboard","charact","overal","tendenti","fall","veri","much","latter","categori","find","film","playconcern","activ","european","refuge","washington","dure","wartimea","crush","bear","worthwhil","mostli","act","even","onli","intermitt","author","lillian","hellman","side","angel","irrelev","plai","write","peopl","share","point","view","seldom","explor","idea","alreadi","hold","author","audienc","except","point","dread","side","even","find","hundr","percent","agreem","saya","rhinei","still","ca","stand","wai","sai","charact","unreal","ear","dialogu","show","certain","facil","wai","peopl","talk","possess","real","brillianc","origin","realli","noth","new","sai","thoroughli","agre","late","mari","mccarthi","long","overdu","dismantl","hellman","reput","year","ago","think","theatr","dead","extremi","yearn","good","old","dai","urg","peek","watch","rhine","bad","wai","angel","america","onli","go","show","theatr","foot","grave","sixti","year","ago"],"filtered2":["seem","littl","wai","middl","grind","watch","rhine","concern","either","like","veri","applaud","sincer","liber","point","view","fine","act","els","loath","obviou","propaganda","mediocr","dialogu","cardboard","charact","overal","tendenti","fall","veri","latter","categori","find","playconcern","activ","european","refuge","washington","dure","wartimea","crush","bear","worthwhil","mostli","act","even","onli","intermitt","author","lillian","hellman","side","angel","irrelev","plai","write","peopl","share","point","view","seldom","explor","idea","alreadi","hold","author","audienc","except","point","dread","side","even","find","hundr","percent","agreem","saya","rhinei","still","ca","stand","wai","charact","unreal","ear","dialogu","show","certain","facil","wai","peopl","talk","possess","real","brillianc","origin","realli","noth","new","thoroughli","agre","late","mari","mccarthi","long","overdu","dismantl","hellman","reput","year","ago","think","theatr","dead","extremi","yearn","good","old","dai","urg","peek","watch","rhine","bad","wai","angel","america","onli","go","show","theatr","foot","grave","sixti","year","ago"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,21,23,28,33,35,38,40,49,57,64,65,66,67,69,80,81,87,99,123,132,150,168,169,186,196,207,228,232,239,248,312,330,377,383,412,414,425,464,510,525,554,610,622,774,787,808,874,921,981,995,1036,1064,1111,1118,1124,1291,1305,1328,1406,1445,1460,1473,1590,1657,1700,1788,1816,1831,1887,2014,2022,2176,2221,2605,2856,3035,3367,3453,3585,4190,4635,4817,5159,5437,5563,6457,6617,7604],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"*****probably minor spoilers******<br /><br />I cant say i liked it, but i cant say i didn't...its very strange. It has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine,if i was the director i would cut that part for sure, gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie... For some people it will be boring cause it lacks action, feels home made sometimes... Take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what? nop,not crying...their telling horror stories to each other..*sighs*(just after crying for hes lost)<br /><br />Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like \"hundreds\" of candles in the table in front of them...the boat is surrounded by some kind of rag curtains(old rags covering the windows) and sofas/Couches ...i thought it was dumb, using candles but not thinking about the surroundings, besides being in high sea alone...<br /><br />The good, some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some. Sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of, so this movie does it good, maybe because its a low budget i don't know, but it works fine for me!

{"value":"I enjoyed \"American Movie\", so I rented Chris Smith's first film, which I thought was a documentary too. In the first minute I saw that it wasn't, but I gave it a go.<br /><br />What a dead end film. Being true-to-life hardly serves you if you're merely going to examine tediousness, esp. tediousness that we're already familar with.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but will it come as a relevation to ANYONE that 1) a lot of jobs suck and 2) most of them are crappy, minimum wage jobs in the service sector??? I knew that before I saw the film. It didn't really provide an examination of that anyway, as while the film struggles to feel \"real\" (handheld camera, no music, etc.), what's going on hardly plays out as it would in the \"real world.\"<br /><br />Would an employer be so cheerful to Randy when he picks up his check, after Randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months?? Or the day after abandoning his job (and screwing up the machine he was working on), that everyone would be so easy on him??<br /><br />A big problem is our \"hero\"(?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he's stuck in these jobs, or has a crummy apartment, or looks like one. He's a dope. He doesn't pay attention or even really try at these jobs. He has zero personalty.

{"value":"Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman, where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film, of which I'd heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem. An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. It's not.<br /><br />City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and \"realistic\" citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind. In truth, however, these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as Corruption of Power, Two-Faced Politicians, Mafia with Police ties, etc. And theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen! But again, it really doesn't.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we're left with several \"confession\" monologues, that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the \"real world\" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal. I don't think we're left with that in City Hall, and while it's a very full film, I don't find it altogether rich.","finished_norm":["admittedli","i","find","al","pacino","to","be","a","guilti","pleasur","he","be","a","fine","actor","until","scent","of","a","woman","where","he","appar","overdos","on","himself","irrepar","i","hope","thi","film","of","which","i","have","hear","almost","noth","grow","up","would","be","a","nice","littl","gem","a","overlook","aheadofitstim","intellig","and","engag","citypolit","thriller","it","notbr","br","citi","hall","be","a","movi","that","cloud","it","plot","with","so","mani","charact","name","and","realist","citywid","issu","that","for","a","while","you","think","it","a","plot","in","scope","so","broad","and","implic","that","onc","you","find","out","the","truth","it","will","blow","your","mind","in","truth","howev","thi","subplot","and","digress","result","ultim","in","fairli","tame","and","veri","familiar","urban","stori","trademark","such","a","corrupt","of","power","twofac","politician","mafia","with","polic","tie","etc","and","theoret","thi","setup","allow","for","some","thrill","tension","the","fear","that","none","of","the","charact","be","safe","and","anyth","can","happen","but","again","it","realli","doesntbr","br","unfortun","the","onli","thing","that","happen","be","quit","predict","and","we","re","leav","with","sever","confess","monologu","that","be","mean","a","a","whole","to","form","modern","a","fabl","of","sort","a","lesson","in","the","moral","ambigu","of","the","real","world","of","polit","and","societi","but","after","minut","of","name","and","miss","report","and","a","spiderweb","of","lie","and","coverup","the","audienc","be","usual","treat","to","a","somewhat","satisfi","reveal","i","do","not","think","we","re","leav","with","that","in","citi","hall","and","while","it","a","veri","full","film","i","do","not","find","it","altogeth","rich"],"filtered":["admittedli","find","al","pacino","guilti","pleasur","fine","actor","scent","woman","appar","overdos","irrepar","hope","thi","film","hear","almost","noth","grow","nice","littl","gem","overlook","aheadofitstim","intellig","engag","citypolit","thriller","notbr","br","citi","hall","movi","cloud","plot","mani","charact","name","realist","citywid","issu","think","plot","scope","broad","implic","onc","find","truth","blow","mind","truth","howev","thi","subplot","digress","result","ultim","fairli","tame","veri","familiar","urban","stori","trademark","corrupt","power","twofac","politician","mafia","polic","tie","etc","theoret","thi","setup","allow","thrill","tension","fear","none","charact","safe","anyth","happen","realli","doesntbr","br","unfortun","onli","thing","happen","quit","predict","re","leav","sever","confess","monologu","mean","whole","form","modern","fabl","sort","lesson","moral","ambigu","real","world","polit","societi","minut","name","miss","report","spiderweb","lie","coverup","audienc","usual","treat","somewhat","satisfi","reveal","think","re","leav","citi","hall","veri","full","film","find","altogeth","rich"],"filtered2":["admittedli","find","al","pacino","guilti","pleasur","fine","actor","scent","woman","appar","overdos","irrepar","hope","hear","almost","noth","grow","nice","littl","gem","overlook","aheadofitstim","intellig","engag","citypolit","thriller","notbr","citi","hall","cloud","plot","mani","charact","name","realist","citywid","issu","think","plot","scope","broad","implic","onc","find","truth","blow","mind","truth","howev","subplot","digress","result","ultim","fairli","tame","veri","familiar","urban","stori","trademark","corrupt","power","twofac","politician","mafia","polic","tie","etc","theoret","setup","allow","thrill","tension","fear","none","charact","safe","anyth","happen","realli","doesntbr","unfortun","onli","thing","happen","quit","predict","re","leav","sever","confess","monologu","mean","whole","form","modern","fabl","sort","lesson","moral","ambigu","real","world","polit","societi","minut","name","miss","report","spiderweb","lie","coverup","audienc","usual","treat","somewhat","satisfi","reveal","think","re","leav","citi","hall","veri","full","find","altogeth","rich"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,12,13,14,15,17,29,32,38,41,49,50,59,68,70,74,80,88,94,104,111,113,120,131,143,165,168,181,216,227,236,238,255,262,265,269,308,316,336,337,365,370,429,447,464,471,521,561,575,595,596,603,650,689,714,729,735,754,758,806,812,819,833,849,878,887,937,943,959,990,1049,1095,1175,1218,1272,1317,1408,1606,1638,1685,1783,1985,2015,2038,2209,2296,2298,2419,2437,2474,2517,2576,2774,3091,3137,3240,3385,3424,3491,3922,4309,4355,5657,6159,6665,6866],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures

{"value":"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.<br /><br />Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing, but his character has been emptied, so there's not a lot he can do to save the film.<br /><br />Now the duke's slave/helper, he has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but he does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling that joke till the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer.<br /><br />If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel.

{"value":"Les Visiteurs, the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdness, that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.<br /><br />Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. The plot changes a little, since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history, without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing, but his character has been emptied, so there's not a lot he can do to save the film.<br /><br />Now the duke's slave/helper, he has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. Fact is; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience, but he does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling that joke till the end, adding details, to make your suffering a little longer.<br /><br />If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel.

{"value":"Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (a woefully miscast Bette Davis) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical Allen Brice (Jack Carson looking lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. Seriously). They crash land in the desert and hate each other but (sigh) start falling in love.<br /><br />This seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are in it. They were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why! The script is just horrible--there's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie. The running joke in this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first in a cactus (this is done THREE TIMES!). Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated. As it is they both do their best with the lousy material. Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full force but it doesn't work. Carson has this \"what the hell\" look on his face throughout the entire movie (probably because his characters emotions change in seconds). Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles. But, all in all, this was dull and laughless--a real chore to sit through. This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really--it's not worth seeing.

{"value":"Not that \"a film by Ulli Lommel\" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the \"mockumentary\" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And what's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He ought to know better. He ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. And lucky us, he wrote the script too! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. Please, please miss this film.

{"value":"Although the casting for this film was admirable, particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching.<br /><br />My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck, and it was almost impossible to turn away. It may have been that we \"hoped\" that the message would eventually make itself apparent, and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen.<br /><br />Of course the audience may have been able to \"make sense\" of this convoluted tale, a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. The writers, however, did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning.<br /><br />It was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts, and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non-existent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, made-for-TV movies have seemed to devolve over the years. Whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past, present-day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience, concentrating primarily on manipulating us to \"stay-tuned\" through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as Surrender, Dorothy are made.","finished_norm":["although","the","cast","for","thi","film","be","admir","particularli","diann","keaton","and","tom","everett","scott","the","qualiti","of","the","write","be","so","poor","that","it","would","be","imposs","for","ani","actor","or","director","to","make","thi","film","worth","watchingbr","br","my","wife","and","i","decid","that","the","reason","we","watch","the","entir","film","be","that","it","be","like","a","train","wreck","and","it","be","almost","imposs","to","turn","awai","it","mai","have","be","that","we","hope","that","the","messag","would","eventu","make","itself","appar","and","that","we","would","be","abl","to","glean","some","mean","from","thi","effort","unfortun","thi","do","not","happenbr","br","of","cours","the","audienc","mai","have","be","abl","to","make","sens","of","thi","convolut","tale","a","credit","to","the","ingenu","of","the","human","brain","to","make","sens","of","the","absurd","the","writer","howev","do","noth","to","facilit","thi","innat","ne","we","seem","to","have","for","find","meaningbr","br","it","be","appar","that","that","involv","be","simpli","go","through","the","motion","of","their","respect","craft","and","that","ani","intrins","passion","for","the","charact","or","the","stori","be","either","secondari","or","nonexistentbr","br","unfortun","madefortv","movi","have","seem","to","devolv","over","the","year","wherea","commun","a","messag","to","the","audienc","mai","to","have","be","the","primari","interest","of","the","writer","in","the","past","presentdai","writer","and","produc","seem","condescend","to","their","audienc","concentr","primarili","on","manipul","u","to","staytun","through","the","incess","advertis","which","seem","to","be","the","onli","reason","movi","such","a","surrend","dorothi","be","make"],"filtered":["although","cast","thi","film","admir","particularli","diann","keaton","tom","everett","scott","qualiti","write","poor","imposs","ani","actor","director","make","thi","film","worth","watchingbr","br","wife","decid","reason","watch","entir","film","like","train","wreck","almost","imposs","turn","awai","mai","hope","messag","eventu","make","appar","abl","glean","mean","thi","effort","unfortun","thi","happenbr","br","cours","audienc","mai","abl","make","sens","thi","convolut","tale","credit","ingenu","human","brain","make","sens","absurd","writer","howev","noth","facilit","thi","innat","ne","seem","find","meaningbr","br","appar","involv","simpli","go","motion","respect","craft","ani","intrins","passion","charact","stori","either","secondari","nonexistentbr","br","unfortun","madefortv","movi","seem","devolv","year","wherea","commun","messag","audienc","mai","primari","interest","writer","past","presentdai","writer","produc","seem","condescend","audienc","concentr","primarili","manipul","u","staytun","incess","advertis","seem","onli","reason","movi","surrend","dorothi","make"],"filtered2":["although","cast","admir","particularli","diann","keaton","tom","everett","scott","qualiti","write","poor","imposs","ani","actor","director","make","worth","watchingbr","wife","decid","reason","watch","entir","like","train","wreck","almost","imposs","turn","awai","mai","hope","messag","eventu","make","appar","abl","glean","mean","effort","unfortun","happenbr","cours","audienc","mai","abl","make","sens","convolut","tale","credit","ingenu","human","brain","make","sens","absurd","writer","howev","noth","facilit","innat","ne","seem","find","meaningbr","appar","involv","simpli","go","motion","respect","craft","ani","intrins","passion","charact","stori","either","secondari","nonexistentbr","unfortun","madefortv","seem","devolv","year","wherea","commun","messag","audienc","mai","primari","interest","writer","past","presentdai","writer","produc","seem","condescend","audienc","concentr","primarili","manipul","u","staytun","incess","advertis","seem","onli","reason","surrend","dorothi","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,10,11,17,27,35,38,41,46,49,57,58,60,65,88,92,95,96,110,112,113,131,146,155,168,173,181,198,199,201,207,219,227,237,241,249,261,263,287,292,308,319,356,401,440,454,497,569,673,694,713,716,759,820,901,928,930,1021,1061,1273,1274,1464,1535,1797,1897,2223,2318,2457,2507,2645,2966,3409,3800,4281,4402,4921,5396,5453,5476,6001,7788,8524],"values":[5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,10,11,17,27,35,38,41,46,49,57,58,60,65,88,92,95,96,110,112,113,131,146,155,168,173,181,198,199,201,207,219,227,237,241,249,261,263,287,292,308,319,356,401,440,454,497,569,673,694,713,716,759,820,901,928,930,1021,1061,1273,1274,1464,1535,1797,1897,2223,2318,2457,2507,2645,2966,3409,3800,4281,4402,4

{"value":"this movie has no plot, no character development, and no budget. it really sucks to put it in short terms. Since there is no development for the movie, it really can't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it. To be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak. Well it falls short here too. The girl's reactions just seem dumb. it's extremely easy to tell that it's fake (honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie. They throw innards on her, but she's asleep for most of it, so it's just kinda dumb. The only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye. But honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake, with the exception of the eye. if you want a good movie about torture, go watch Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people. Plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like American fears of foreigners, issues of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts vs. civilization, and many other things. Plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence.

{"value":"This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus. Suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves.<br /><br />\"Cabin Fever\" is a horrible film. For one, it tries to be many genres at once. Is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? Nobody can tell. There's a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. When the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. I liked the ending a lot.<br /><br />But apart from the ending, I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. The violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What are we supposed to get from that? This same girl would bite one of the characters. Was that supposed to be funny? I don't know.<br /><br />Some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. I didn't care for most of the characters. I liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. As a horror film, I didn't know what it was trying to be. I didn't find it funny, tense, nor scary. By the end, you're left indifferent, thinking, \"What have I just been through?\" Unfortunately, you'll never know the answer to that question.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","about","a","group","of","five","friend","who","rend","a","cabin","in","the","wood","on","of","the","friend","catch","a","horrifi","flesheat","viru","suddenli","the","friend","turn","on","on","anoth","in","a","desper","attempt","to","keep","from","contract","the","diseas","themselvesbr","br","cabin","fever","be","a","horribl","film","for","on","it","try","to","be","mani","genr","at","onc","be","it","suppos","to","be","a","homag","a","slasher","a","black","comedi","or","a","scari","movi","with","unintent","comedi","nobodi","can","tell","there","a","seriou","scene","at","and","a","alter","it","turn","funni","when","the","film","try","to","be","funni","the","humor","be","quit","bland","exclud","the","end","i","like","the","end","a","lotbr","br","but","apart","from","the","end","i","be","pretti","disappoint","and","disgust","the","violenc","be","cringeworthi","much","look","awai","from","the","screen","than","be","scare","the","tone","chang","within","each","scene","sometim","funni","sometim","scari","and","sometim","quit","random","in","fact","you","see","a","girl","do","karat","in","slomot","what","be","we","suppos","to","get","from","that","thi","same","girl","would","bite","on","of","the","charact","be","that","suppos","to","be","funni","i","do","not","knowbr","br","some","of","the","perform","be","decent","and","mani","be","quit","amateurish","i","do","not","care","for","much","of","the","charact","i","like","the","plot","but","the","execut","be","do","horribli","a","a","horror","film","i","do","not","know","what","it","be","try","to","be","i","do","not","find","it","funni","tens","nor","scari","by","the","end","you","re","leav","indiffer","think","what","have","i","just","be","through","unfortun","you","will","never","know","the","answer","to","that","question"],"filtered":["thi","film","group","five","friend","rend","cabin","wood","friend","catch","horrifi","flesheat","viru","suddenli","friend","turn","anoth","desper","attempt","keep","contract","diseas","themselvesbr","br","cabin","fever","horribl","film","try","mani","genr","onc","suppos","homag","slasher","black","comedi","scari","movi","unintent","comedi","nobodi","tell","seriou","scene","alter","turn","funni","film","try","funni","humor","quit","bland","exclud","end","like","end","lotbr","br","apart","end","pretti","disappoint","disgust","violenc","cringeworthi","much","look","awai","screen","scare","tone","chang","within","scene","sometim","funni","sometim","scari","sometim","quit","random","fact","see","girl","karat","slomot","suppos","get","thi","girl","bite","charact","suppos","funni","knowbr","br","perform","decent","mani","quit","amateurish","care","much","charact","like","plot","execut","horribli","horror","film","know","try","find","funni","tens","scari","end","re","leav","indiffer","think","unfortun","never","know","answer","question"],"filtered2":["group","five","friend","rend","cabin","wood","friend","catch","horrifi","flesheat","viru","suddenli","friend","turn","anoth","desper","attempt","keep","contract","diseas","themselvesbr","cabin","fever","horribl","try","mani","genr","onc","suppos","homag","slasher","black","comedi","scari","unintent","comedi","nobodi","tell","seriou","scene","alter","turn","funni","try","funni","humor","quit","bland","exclud","end","like","end","lotbr","apart","end","pretti","disappoint","disgust","violenc","cringeworthi","look","awai","screen","scare","tone","chang","within","scene","sometim","funni","sometim","scari","sometim","quit","random","fact","see","girl","karat","slomot","suppos","get","girl","bite","charact","suppos","funni","knowbr","perform","decent","mani","quit","amateurish","care","charact","like","plot","execut","horribli","horror","know","try","find","funni","tens","scari","end","re","leav","indiffer","think","unfortun","never","know","answer","question"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,10,12,16,19,24,26,32,36,38,42,50,62,68,73,74,78,83,84,90,96,97,105,120,127,134,149,154,155,161,177,187,192,205,227,229,230,236,278,309,369,378,396,410,453,467,493,500,504,512,533,572,623,655,662,672,731,785,788,800,859,866,963,967,1028,1188,1276,1610,2125,2159,2385,2513,2562,2611,2977,3020,3281,3575,3601,4444,6340,6414,6778,6967,7486],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,10,12,16,19,24,26,32,36,38,42,50,62,68,73,74,78,83,84,90,96,97,105,120,127,134,149,154,155,161,177,187,192,205,227,229,230,236,278,309,369,378,396,410,453,467,493,500,504,512,533,572,623,655,662,672,731,785,788,800,859,866,963,967,1028,1188,1276,1610,2125,2159,2385,2513,2562,2611,2977,3020,3281,3575,3601,4444,6340,

{"value":"I couldn't believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was it true? <br /><br />Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a Cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship!<br /><br />Sad as it is, \"Alien Intruder\" tries to be unique, with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain (Williams).<br /><br />Interesting? Maybe, but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of \"Red Shoe Diaries\". Williams out-classes everything right and left, and looks like he'd rather be doing anything else, ANYWHERE else. Ah, the things people do for money....<br /><br />The FX are pretty static, maybe even less than what you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this. Unfortunately, even the female nudity is less than you'd expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and, of course, it gets ALL the best scenes.<br /><br />If you like a movie that's all tease and no brains, check out \"Alien Intruder\". Of course, you'll probably have to look no further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning.<br /><br />No stars, not even for what star power this flick can muster.<br /><br />Leave this one lost in

{"value":"This is one of the worst movies i've ever encountered, but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted..<br /><br />As far as pure film-making technique goes, this director is competent. He's held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional. i've seen many movies where the \"directing\" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there. Also, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go. As far as artistic merit, there is none. The scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film. This is pure trash... Total garbage.<br /><br />The gore is decent for a film in this budget range. , it's obviously fake but there's lot's of it, and it's very outlandish..<br /><br />I saw the American version with the intentionally campy dubbing. This was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film)... Unfortunately, it's overdone, especially towards the end.<br /><br />It's really a terrible film, but i have to recommend it for it's camp value. It's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","encount","but","i","want","to","sai","that","some","of","the","critic","i","have","hear","turn","out","to","be","unwarrantedbr","br","a","far","a","pure","filmmak","techniqu","go","thi","director","be","compet","he","hold","back","by","the","limit","budget","and","the","vh","camera","but","the","actual","edit","camera","angl","camera","movem","and","scene","stage","be","pretti","profession","i","have","see","mani","movi","where","the","direct","be","much","wrong","at","littl","the","scene","flow","in","a","wai","that","be","not","confus","and","he","have","a","few","clever","shot","here","and","there","conjur","the","forest","scene","contain","a","decent","atmospher","there","be","onli","so","much","you","can","do","with","a","vh","camera","and","he","doe","a","nice","job","a","far","a","the","technic","go","a","far","a","artist","merit","there","be","none","the","scene","where","the","camera","pan","down","so","that","we","can","watch","a","gui","urin","in","the","wood","for","second","sort","of","epitom","the","artist","styl","of","the","whole","film","thi","be","pure","trash","total","garbagebr","br","the","gore","be","decent","for","a","film","in","thi","budget","rang","it","obvious","fake","but","there","lot","of","it","and","it","veri","outlandishbr","br","i","see","the","american","version","with","the","intention","campi","dub","thi","be","a","good","idea","and","it","the","onli","thing","that","allow","me","to","make","it","through","the","film","unfortun","it","overdo","especi","toward","the","endbr","br","it","realli","a","terribl","film","but","i","have","to","recommend","it","for","it","camp","valu","it","realli","hard","to","find","a","movi","that","wrong","than","thi","and","that","sort","of","put","it","in","a","uniqu","categori"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","encount","want","sai","critic","hear","turn","unwarrantedbr","br","far","pure","filmmak","techniqu","go","thi","director","compet","hold","back","limit","budget","vh","camera","actual","edit","camera","angl","camera","movem","scene","stage","pretti","profession","see","mani","movi","direct","much","wrong","littl","scene","flow","wai","confus","clever","shot","conjur","forest","scene","contain","decent","atmospher","onli","much","vh","camera","doe","nice","job","far","technic","go","far","artist","merit","none","scene","camera","pan","watch","gui","urin","wood","second","sort","epitom","artist","styl","whole","film","thi","pure","trash","total","garbagebr","br","gore","decent","film","thi","budget","rang","obvious","fake","lot","veri","outlandishbr","br","see","american","version","intention","campi","dub","thi","good","idea","onli","thing","allow","make","film","unfortun","overdo","especi","toward","endbr","br","realli","terribl","film","recommend","camp","valu","realli","hard","find","movi","wrong","thi","sort","put","uniqu","categori"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","encount","want","critic","hear","turn","unwarrantedbr","far","pure","filmmak","techniqu","go","director","compet","hold","back","limit","budget","vh","camera","actual","edit","camera","angl","camera","movem","scene","stage","pretti","profession","see","mani","direct","wrong","littl","scene","flow","wai","confus","clever","shot","conjur","forest","scene","contain","decent","atmospher","onli","vh","camera","doe","nice","job","far","technic","go","far","artist","merit","none","scene","camera","pan","watch","gui","urin","wood","second","sort","epitom","artist","styl","whole","pure","trash","total","garbagebr","gore","decent","budget","rang","obvious","fake","lot","veri","outlandishbr","see","american","version","intention","campi","dub","good","idea","onli","thing","allow","make","unfortun","overdo","especi","toward","endbr","realli","terribl","recommend","camp","valu","realli","hard","find","wrong","sort","put","uniqu","categori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,11,13,14,15,18,19,25,29,33,37,38,39,44,50,52,55,58,63,72,78,96,101,102,111,123,159,166,171,184,216,220,223,227,231,256,262,267,269,289,298,309,323,341,348,358,370,380,414,427,441,451,521,563,579,639,655,669,671,711,724,726,835,908,944,947,949,955,1027,1160,1288,1293,1300,1361,1473,1554,1637,1659,1695,1734,1794,1899,1977,2181,2242,2364,3210,5118,6025,6078],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,11,13,14,15,18,19,25,29,33,37,38,39,44,50,52,55,58,63,72,78,96,101,102,111,123,159,166,171,184,216,220,223,227,231,256,262,267,269,289,298,309,323,341,348,358,370,380,414,427,441,451,521,563,579,639,655,669,671,

{"value":"I went into this film expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written, poorly acted plot in the movie (with CG animated cells and peptides to boot). However, the real focus of the film are the \"expert\" talking heads spewing out new age feel-good hogwash in between plot segments.<br /><br />Sure, it stars off innocently enough. There is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. It states, for example, that electrons exist as both particle and wave, and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the movie takes a giant (and unscientific) leap, saying that sub-atomic quantum effects happen on large scales as well. The talking heads take it even further. According to them, the following are true:<br /><br />-When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of perceiving something so different. -Meditation can reduce the murder rate. -With positive thought, you can walk on water. -Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in bottles of water.<br /><br />And hey, that's only in the first 40 minutes!<br /><br />Watching the movie was torture. This film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that it basically is just that.<br /><br />On the other hand, this could be seen as a campy comedy (albeit one that's not funny).<br /><br />Save your time and money: don't see this

{"value":"HAH! So this is the movie that the \"Next Action Stars\" were getting into. Well I'm glad that I didn't participate and didn't win...<br /><br />Isn't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds(!) and make up ones mind about a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at those titles!? I watched this movie(or part of this \"teleplay\" since it was produced for TV and we couldn't bear to watch the whole thing) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge-podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar wasn't really high, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and it wasn't because of the great script ;D . But this movie's total lack of originality, acting, scripting, and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? don't remember...) without any complaints by the rest of the group. And that is rare(!) For heavens sake! Don't by this movie! If it's on TV, then yes, watch it. And contemplate on it. My conclusion? well, since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action-films out there (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to name some) I can only say that producers don't give the film it's quality, they provide money for the directors. And to sell this movie just because it's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it.","finished_norm":["hah","so","thi","be","the","movi","that","the","next","action","star","be","get","into","good","i","be","glad","that","i","do","not","particip","and","do","not","winbr","br","be","not","it","funni","how","on","can","just","look","at","the","second","and","make","up","on","mind","about","a","movi","i","mean","come","on","just","look","at","that","titl","i","watch","thi","movieor","part","of","thi","teleplai","sinc","it","be","produc","for","tv","and","we","can","not","bear","to","watch","the","whole","thing","on","even","while","do","my","militari","servic","and","the","audienc","with","me","be","the","typic","hodgepodg","of","averag","gui","that","onc","in","a","while","watch","seri","like","la","vega","just","for","the","girl","in","the","show","so","the","bar","be","not","realli","high","the","much","watch","movi","in","my","group","be","girl","next","door","and","it","be","not","becaus","of","the","great","script","have","but","thi","movi","total","lack","of","origin","act","script","and","just","about","everyth","els","that","make","a","movi","good","make","it","pretti","easi","to","switch","channel","to","la","vega","or","be","it","csi","do","not","rememb","without","ani","complaint","by","the","rest","of","the","group","and","that","be","rare","for","heaven","sake","do","not","by","thi","movi","if","it","on","tv","then","ye","watch","it","and","contempl","on","it","my","conclus","good","sinc","joel","silver","have","ind","produc","some","of","the","well","actionfilm","out","there","die","hard","matrix","to","name","some","i","can","onli","sai","that","produc","do","not","give","the","film","it","qualiti","thei","provid","monei","for","the","director","and","to","sell","thi","movi","just","becaus","it","a","joel","silver","movi","be","just","a","desper","attempt","to","conceal","the","obviou","flaw","of","the","crow","who","realli","make","it"],"filtered":["hah","thi","movi","next","action","star","get","good","glad","particip","winbr","br","funni","look","second","make","mind","movi","mean","come","look","titl","watch","thi","movieor","part","thi","teleplai","sinc","produc","tv","bear","watch","whole","thing","even","militari","servic","audienc","typic","hodgepodg","averag","gui","onc","watch","seri","like","la","vega","girl","show","bar","realli","high","much","watch","movi","group","girl","next","door","becaus","great","script","thi","movi","total","lack","origin","act","script","everyth","els","make","movi","good","make","pretti","easi","switch","channel","la","vega","csi","rememb","without","ani","complaint","rest","group","rare","heaven","sake","thi","movi","tv","ye","watch","contempl","conclus","good","sinc","joel","silver","ind","produc","well","actionfilm","die","hard","matrix","name","onli","sai","produc","give","film","qualiti","thei","provid","monei","director","sell","thi","movi","becaus","joel","silver","movi","desper","attempt","conceal","obviou","flaw","crow","realli","make"],"filtered2":["hah","next","action","star","get","good","glad","particip","winbr","funni","look","second","make","mind","mean","come","look","titl","watch","movieor","part","teleplai","sinc","produc","tv","bear","watch","whole","thing","even","militari","servic","audienc","typic","hodgepodg","averag","gui","onc","watch","like","la","vega","girl","show","bar","realli","high","watch","group","girl","next","door","becaus","great","script","total","lack","origin","act","script","everyth","els","make","good","make","pretti","easi","switch","channel","la","vega","csi","rememb","without","ani","complaint","rest","group","rare","heaven","sake","tv","ye","watch","contempl","conclus","good","sinc","joel","silver","ind","produc","well","actionfilm","die","hard","matrix","name","onli","produc","give","qualiti","provid","monei","director","sell","becaus","joel","silver","desper","attempt","conceal","obviou","flaw","crow","realli","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,7,11,13,16,20,21,22,27,28,29,30,34,51,55,58,61,62,69,77,78,84,88,100,111,125,126,129,143,162,168,171,172,177,183,184,193,196,209,211,226,236,238,261,264,290,293,297,319,383,410,525,613,643,695,728,744,766,768,788,829,838,861,923,947,956,984,1013,1070,1227,1270,1543,1579,1632,1858,2080,2105,2560,2787,3705,4273,4933,5321],"values":[4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,7,11,13,16,20,21,22,27,28,29,30,34,51,55,58,61,62,69,77,78,84,88,100,111,125,126,129,143,162,168,171,172,177,183,184,193,196,209,211,226,236,238,261,264,290,293,297,319,383,410,525,613,643,695,728,744,766,768,788,829,838,861,923,947,956,984,1013,1070,1227,1270,1543,1579,1632,1858,2080,2105,2560,

{"value":"This is one of the worst-written movies I've ever had to sit through.<br /><br />The story's nothing new -- but it's a cartoon, so who cares, as long as it's pretty and fun? <br /><br />I'm not going to go as deep as the characterisations, or I'll be here all day (except to say that there aren't any; the characters change personality whenever it's convenient to the plot), but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper. Thumbs down? I'd vote to cut their thumbs off.<br /><br />\"Narrow in on an object/prop. Cut back to character close-up. Character gives a knowing look, which the audience will not even remotely understand. Repeat that several times, with different objects/props.\"<br /><br />\"Make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around, crashing into each other, generally raining destruction all over, and which could kill them all at any moment -- but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless-looking, almost pastoral green rock in the distance.\" <br /><br />The whole thing is a long succession of events, actions, and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer, to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the
