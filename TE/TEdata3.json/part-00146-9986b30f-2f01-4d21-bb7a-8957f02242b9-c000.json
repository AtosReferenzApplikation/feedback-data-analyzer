{"value":"So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, the people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel stuff. Oh no, a girl see's s ghost. Some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc. This girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does but, oh no, she dies as she does. And goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who dies saving the kids) says \"oh no\". The acting is wooden, the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it, but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss. I was extremely disappointed when I watched this. A very big let down. My sister (who gets sacred very easily) got bored in this film it is appalling.","finished_norm":["so","it","start","with","a","beauti","old","hous","in","the","countri","you","have","a","group","of","peopl","who","get","ask","to","come","to","thi","hous","and","not","surprisingli","the","caretak","alwai","lock","the","gate","at","night","for","no","appar","reason","anywhoo","the","peopl","laugh","joke","etc","thi","dr","tell","them","a","spooki","stori","of","thi","woman","and","some","kid","thei","get","scare","thei","start","to","feel","stuff","oh","no","a","girl","see","ghost","some","much","talk","then","thi","huge","ghost","come","and","etc","etc","thi","girl","find","out","that","thi","ghost","kill","littl","kid","and","that","she","must","free","their","soul","ye","ye","blah","blah","she","doe","but","oh","no","she","die","a","she","doe","and","go","to","heaven","whilst","thi","evil","ghost","go","to","hell","two","peopl","surviv","and","escap","the","hous","the","script","be","terribl","becaus","a","gui","get","hi","head","chop","off","and","elanor","the","on","who","die","save","the","kid","sai","oh","no","the","act","be","wooden","the","effect","be","crap","and","the","set","be","a","coupl","off","room","us","over","and","over","again","basic","if","you","like","laugh","at","badli","make","film","watch","it","but","if","your","look","for","a","scare","then","definit","give","thi","film","a","miss","i","be","extrem","disappoint","when","i","watch","thi","a","veri","big","let","down","my","sister","who","get","sacr","veri","easili","get","bore","in","thi","film","it","be","appal"],"filtered":["start","beauti","old","hous","countri","group","peopl","get","ask","come","thi","hous","surprisingli","caretak","alwai","lock","gate","night","appar","reason","anywhoo","peopl","laugh","joke","etc","thi","dr","tell","spooki","stori","thi","woman","kid","thei","get","scare","thei","start","feel","stuff","oh","girl","see","ghost","much","talk","thi","huge","ghost","come","etc","etc","thi","girl","find","thi","ghost","kill","littl","kid","must","free","soul","ye","ye","blah","blah","doe","oh","die","doe","go","heaven","whilst","thi","evil","ghost","go","hell","two","peopl","surviv","escap","hous","script","terribl","becaus","gui","get","hi","head","chop","elanor","die","save","kid","sai","oh","act","wooden","effect","crap","set","coupl","room","us","basic","like","laugh","badli","make","film","watch","look","scare","definit","give","thi","film","miss","extrem","disappoint","watch","thi","veri","big","let","sister","get","sacr","veri","easili","get","bore","thi","film","appal"],"filtered2":["start","beauti","old","hous","countri","group","peopl","get","ask","come","hous","surprisingli","caretak","alwai","lock","gate","night","appar","reason","anywhoo","peopl","laugh","joke","etc","dr","tell","spooki","stori","woman","kid","get","scare","start","feel","stuff","oh","girl","see","ghost","talk","huge","ghost","come","etc","etc","girl","find","ghost","kill","littl","kid","must","free","soul","ye","ye","blah","blah","doe","oh","die","doe","go","heaven","whilst","evil","ghost","go","hell","two","peopl","surviv","escap","hous","script","terribl","becaus","gui","get","head","chop","elanor","die","save","kid","oh","act","wooden","effect","crap","set","coupl","room","us","basic","like","laugh","badli","make","watch","look","scare","definit","give","miss","extrem","disappoint","watch","veri","big","let","sister","get","sacr","veri","easili","get","bore","appal"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,14,15,16,17,18,21,22,23,30,34,38,43,47,55,56,67,70,71,76,77,82,84,90,95,106,108,109,114,124,133,141,166,186,187,189,197,208,209,210,213,214,234,253,255,286,293,306,308,313,321,325,329,361,392,394,410,429,444,448,513,583,585,608,623,638,686,727,739,885,890,1007,1318,1354,1406,1533,1543,1561,1863,2704,3123,4679,7881],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,14,15,16,17,18,21,22,23,30,34,38,43,47,55,56,67,70,71,76,77,82,84,90,95,106,108,109,114,124,133,141,166,186,187,189,197,208,209,210,213,214,234,253,255,286,293,306,308,313,321,325,329,361,392,394,410,429,444,448,513,583,585,608,623,638,686,727,739,885,890,1007,1318,1354,1406,1533,1543,1561,1863,2704,3123,4679,7881],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,3.983170235359962,1.9416538289407692,1.9218995441445863,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,4.094543182127343,1.3364419891718522,2.7965700178917925,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,3.8429

{"value":"When I rented \"Unhinged\", I was expecting a gore movie. The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater). After finishing the movie, I wondered how it could even receive a video release.<br /><br />The plot is as follows: A group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree. These women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion, which contains an extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards. The others acting is bad, but not nearly as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. This gets very annoying as the movie progresses.

{"value":"I wouldn't recommend this unless you're keen on David Copperfield and want to \"complete the set\". There are some good performances (e.g. Uriah Heep) and well directed moments (e.g. the beating), but on the whole it really pales in comparison with the 1999 BBC version, as well as earlier versions. <br /><br />There are inexplicable changes to the story that really serve no great purpose except, possibly, to dumb it down (the stolen jewels being a case in point). The American cast were poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is wrong as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only slightly better than Dick Van Dyke's cockney. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr Micawber; he hams it up rather too much, however, and becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply preposterous. Anthony Andrews is menacing as Mr Murdstone, but one almost expects him to don a black cape and tie David's mother to a railway line (though this is perhaps partly the fault of Dickens). <br /><br />I got this for free with a newspaper.

{"value":"Honestly I am not even joking when I say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! This film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line. I can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from \"The Omen\" and other movies like it. For example the nanny \"Lucy\" in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan.....does this sound a lot like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted, just like in \"The Omen\". However luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body....yet another coincidence?????? And to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls, much like the priest in \"The Omen\" having pages of the Bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper. Please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and \"The Omen\" for you because as I've stated above there are far too many to mention here.","finished_norm":["honestli","i","be","not","even","joke","when","i","sai","that","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","thi","film","dose","not","have","a","singl","ounc","of","origin","in","it","flimsi","dialog","or","it","blatantli","plagiar","stori","line","i","can","not","even","begin","to","count","the","numb","of","thing","in","thi","film","that","be","obvious","rip","off","from","the","omen","and","other","movi","like","it","for","exampl","the","nanni","luci","in","thi","film","be","actual","on","of","the","devil","minion","send","to","guid","and","protect","the","spawn","of","satando","thi","sound","a","lot","like","mr","baylock","to","anyon","els","anoth","thing","be","that","the","orphanag","be","thei","get","the","child","burn","to","the","grind","just","a","few","month","after","he","be","adopt","just","like","in","the","omen","howev","luckili","on","priest","surviv","the","blaze","and","escap","with","sever","burn","all","over","hi","bodyyet","anoth","coincid","and","to","top","it","all","off","the","burn","priest","be","stai","in","a","hospit","room","with","pictur","of","jesu","all","over","the","wall","much","like","the","priest","in","the","omen","have","page","of","the","bibl","plaster","on","the","wall","like","wallpap","pleas","do","not","even","get","me","start","draw","comparison","between","the","end","of","thi","movi","and","the","omen","for","you","becaus","a","i","have","state","abov","there","be","far","too","mani","to","mention","here"],"filtered":["honestli","even","joke","sai","thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","thi","film","dose","singl","ounc","origin","flimsi","dialog","blatantli","plagiar","stori","line","even","begin","count","numb","thing","thi","film","obvious","rip","omen","movi","like","exampl","nanni","luci","thi","film","actual","devil","minion","send","guid","protect","spawn","satando","thi","sound","lot","like","mr","baylock","anyon","els","anoth","thing","orphanag","thei","get","child","burn","grind","month","adopt","like","omen","howev","luckili","priest","surviv","blaze","escap","sever","burn","hi","bodyyet","anoth","coincid","top","burn","priest","stai","hospit","room","pictur","jesu","wall","much","like","priest","omen","page","bibl","plaster","wall","like","wallpap","pleas","even","get","start","draw","comparison","end","thi","movi","omen","becaus","state","abov","far","mani","mention"],"filtered2":["honestli","even","joke","wrong","ever","see","dose","singl","ounc","origin","flimsi","dialog","blatantli","plagiar","stori","line","even","begin","count","numb","thing","obvious","rip","omen","like","exampl","nanni","luci","actual","devil","minion","send","guid","protect","spawn","satando","sound","lot","like","mr","baylock","anyon","els","anoth","thing","orphanag","get","child","burn","grind","month","adopt","like","omen","howev","luckili","priest","surviv","blaze","escap","sever","burn","bodyyet","anoth","coincid","top","burn","priest","stai","hospit","room","pictur","jesu","wall","like","priest","omen","page","bibl","plaster","wall","like","wallpap","pleas","even","get","start","draw","comparison","end","omen","becaus","state","abov","far","mani","mention"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,17,22,24,25,29,44,50,52,69,71,72,73,101,107,113,147,158,178,180,196,214,285,307,311,316,341,346,357,364,365,432,443,498,513,516,576,638,704,721,757,824,862,884,885,1064,1085,1141,1143,1231,1252,1338,1411,1527,1570,2159,2439,2447,2659,2804,2883,2938,3008,3240,3326,3745,4274,4595,5228,5728,5873,6160,6734],"values":[5.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,17,22,24,25,29,44,50,52,69,71,72,73,101,107,113,147,158,178,180,196,214,285,307,311,316,341,346,357,364,365,432,443,498,513,516,576,638,704,721,757,824,862,884,885,1064,1085,1141,1143,1231,1252,1338,1411,1527,1570,2159,2439,2447,2659,2804,2883,2938,3008,3240,3326,3745,4274,4595,5228,5728,5873,6160,6734],"values":[3.230191472788289,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,2.7780513171783934,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,2.6390769554676132,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,2.127032521151058,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,3.7901378413541957,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.2844323215331563,2.3106972614914807,2.532833256045391,2.7097314792693545,2.478925055209576,2.7303758068497004,2.808171552082607,2.8767855639325206,2.9203338091782562,2.878207028279898,2.933776879434709,3.023389038124396,3.2829611516442836,2.9878441007049847,3.008694896185175,3.235085203598255,3.239158528985891,3.386191741044285,3.454678155189441,3.442099372982581,3.587125145032839,3.613480989738201,3

{"value":"Yikes. This is pretty bad. The play isn't great to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as Peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origins (we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc.) and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film, whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is breath-takingly poor: stage-y and plummy, it's as if she's playing the part via Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Only Fiona Shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone, even if that performance is as light, truthful and entire as Shaw's. Ben Kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role as just that.

{"value":"There is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also uncalled for. Rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to.

{"value":"That is the best way I can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances. That sounds well and good, but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom. In fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin. Well trust me, no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, weird gardeners, and doors being knocked on. And the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader. And you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking. Someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate. Yes in the end this is a slow paced (which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour), boring little tale, that is easily figured out by the average person.

{"value":"This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I've seen in a very long time. I've never liked Spike Lee, but thought I'd give this one a try: bad mistake. The movie is supposed to show how the Son of Sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems, marriage problems, and so on, etc. The scenes that depict the murders are just that, and nothing more; a shooting and then it's back to Saturday Night Fever! What's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie: Spike, trust me, you're no Hitchcock, stay out of the movies, it makes them even worse off. The most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice, which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot??? Spike, what were you thinking when you made this film? Not thinking at all is my guess. People who think they'll see a crime drama, take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser. You're better off watching Jerry Springer in this case!

{"value":"Um... Okay, I guess I get the whole shaky-cam, gorilla-style filming technique but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie... This thing was just a complete mess from the get go. Bad acting, bad directing, bad story and horrific cinematography. How this piece of garbage was released I will never know, but it has and unfortunately I watched it. Filmed on location in Tennessee by the directing team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), \"Five Across The Eyes\" I'm assuming is supposed to resemble a \"Blair Witch\" type film but falls short... Okay it nose dives off a cliff. I was actually embarrassed for these young women, whom I'm sure were promised Hollywood stardom, but ended up in this dung heap. The dialog is ridiculous, and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. How this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scary about it, except for the fact that I watched it... Try this one on for size: There is 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass... \"The End\".

{"value":"I have heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends have recommend me to read it. I searched it in every place and finally found it. This is a book that every man should read, because it is genius and because of it's vision. I enjoyed every page.<br /><br />I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it.

{"value":"Had the original casting idea been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked. Sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. The predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped Rutger's and Ice-T's roles. This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway' even uses more creative camera work. Eric's rewrite of 'The Most Dangerous Game' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this. We are never given the reasons, other than \"no one will miss these people\", why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things. Aside from a heart-felt performance by John McGinley, and a fair job by Charles Dutton, do not bother with this one. One small bit of trivia, there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured F.Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident.","finished_norm":["have","the","origin","cast","idea","be","keep","hunt","rutger","not","icet","thi","movi","mai","have","work","sadli","racism","have","to","come","into","the","pictur","liter","and","mess","it","up","the","predominantli","black","product","staff","can","not","allow","the","antagonist","be","black","so","thei","swap","rutger","and","icet","role","thi","be","onli","the","start","of","the","downward","spiral","of","thi","film","ernest","dickerson","newsroom","approach","to","direct","onli","verifi","that","thi","be","anoth","affirmativeact","job","assign","master","shoot","close","up","close","up","gad","who","line","be","it","anywai","even","us","much","creativ","camera","work","eric","rewrit","of","the","much","danger","game","be","at","littl","a","attempt","at","modern","the","classic","tale","but","fail","to","give","u","ani","motiv","for","why","the","charact","be","do","thi","we","be","never","give","the","reason","other","than","no","on","will","miss","thi","peopl","why","the","leader","rewrit","a","rutger","doe","thi","thing","asid","from","a","heartfelt","perform","by","john","mcginlei","and","a","fair","job","by","charl","dutton","do","not","bother","with","thi","on","on","small","bite","of","trivium","there","be","a","real","drunkdriv","accid","dure","film","that","injur","fmurrai","abraham","and","result","in","the","death","of","the","intox","young","driver","that","caus","the","accid"],"filtered":["origin","cast","idea","keep","hunt","rutger","icet","thi","movi","mai","work","sadli","racism","come","pictur","liter","mess","predominantli","black","product","staff","allow","antagonist","black","thei","swap","rutger","icet","role","thi","onli","start","downward","spiral","thi","film","ernest","dickerson","newsroom","approach","direct","onli","verifi","thi","anoth","affirmativeact","job","assign","master","shoot","close","close","gad","line","anywai","even","us","much","creativ","camera","work","eric","rewrit","much","danger","game","littl","attempt","modern","classic","tale","fail","give","u","ani","motiv","charact","thi","never","give","reason","miss","thi","peopl","leader","rewrit","rutger","doe","thi","thing","asid","heartfelt","perform","john","mcginlei","fair","job","charl","dutton","bother","thi","small","bite","trivium","real","drunkdriv","accid","dure","film","injur","fmurrai","abraham","result","death","intox","young","driver","caus","accid"],"filtered2":["origin","cast","idea","keep","hunt","rutger","icet","mai","work","sadli","racism","come","pictur","liter","mess","predominantli","black","product","staff","allow","antagonist","black","swap","rutger","icet","role","onli","start","downward","spiral","ernest","dickerson","newsroom","approach","direct","onli","verifi","anoth","affirmativeact","job","assign","master","shoot","close","close","gad","line","anywai","even","us","creativ","camera","work","eric","rewrit","danger","game","littl","attempt","modern","classic","tale","fail","give","u","ani","motiv","charact","never","give","reason","miss","peopl","leader","rewrit","rutger","doe","thing","asid","heartfelt","perform","john","mcginlei","fair","job","charl","dutton","bother","small","bite","trivium","real","drunkdriv","accid","dure","injur","fmurrai","abraham","result","death","intox","young","driver","caus","accid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,11,14,18,23,27,29,30,34,42,46,48,56,69,71,73,80,92,95,102,105,107,112,117,123,128,134,135,154,177,190,215,229,231,239,245,255,289,291,295,311,332,363,374,386,407,447,453,496,521,705,729,820,877,897,902,936,978,1059,1079,1128,1223,1247,1325,1624,1734,1990,2402,2442,2712,2741,4017,4043,4307,4559,5023,5957,6218,7083,7424,7440,8268],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,11,14,18,23,27,29,30,34,42,46,48,56,69,71,73,80,92,95,102,105,107,112,117,123,128,134,135,154,177,190,215,229,231,239,245,255,289,291,295,311,332,363,374,386,407,447,453,496,521,705,729,820,877,897,902,936,978,1059,1079,1128,1223,1247,1325,1624,1734,1990,2402,2442,2712,2741,4017,4043,4307,4559,5023,5957,6218,7083,7424,7440,8268],"values":[0.926017105726131,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,3.3910232448024944,1.8610609350701788,2.127032521151058,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,1.9951803900462557,2.0489535369135887,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1439533986393955,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.2619070973220485,2.3409902041158843,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.34849962613801

{"value":"Saw this movie in an early preview, and I cannot stress enough how bad I thought this film was. From the very beginning, the audience was groaning over Pacino's awful southern accent. Poor Al looked really, really haggard, and I can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist, or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set. Much worse than Pacino's close ups, however, is the wretched excuse for a plot. Early in the film we are given indications that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended. Later, however, we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles) lust after this elderly, half dead looking, effeminate man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part overall was the main plot thread, which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never, ever care about in the slightest. Because this was a preview I will reserve my final judgment, because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing, but you can bet I will not pay a cent to see this in theaters.","finished_norm":["see","thi","movi","in","a","earli","preview","and","i","cannot","stress","enough","how","bad","i","think","thi","film","be","from","the","veri","begin","the","audienc","be","groan","over","pacino","aw","southern","accent","poor","al","look","realli","realli","haggard","and","i","ca","not","decid","whether","thi","be","purpos","part","of","hi","role","a","a","drug","addict","publicist","or","perhap","he","just","do","not","get","ani","sleep","befor","come","to","the","set","much","wrong","than","pacino","close","up","howev","be","the","wretch","excus","for","a","plot","earli","in","the","film","we","be","give","indic","that","pacino","charact","be","gai","and","i","suspect","that","be","what","the","screenwrit","have","origin","intend","late","howev","we","be","suppos","to","suspend","our","incredul","and","believ","that","both","tea","leoni","and","kim","basing","both","of","whom","be","sleepwalk","through","lame","role","lust","after","thi","elderli","half","dead","look","effemin","man","with","the","ridicul","accent","the","wrong","part","overal","be","the","main","plot","thread","which","have","to","do","with","some","corpor","espionag","that","be","never","fulli","explain","and","we","never","ever","care","about","in","the","slight","becaus","thi","be","a","preview","i","will","reserv","my","final","judgment","becaus","of","the","possibl","of","reshoot","and","edit","but","you","can","bet","i","will","not","pai","a","cent","to","see","thi","in","theater"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","earli","preview","stress","enough","bad","think","thi","film","veri","begin","audienc","groan","pacino","aw","southern","accent","poor","al","look","realli","realli","haggard","ca","decid","whether","thi","purpos","part","hi","role","drug","addict","publicist","perhap","get","ani","sleep","befor","come","set","much","wrong","pacino","close","howev","wretch","excus","plot","earli","film","give","indic","pacino","charact","gai","suspect","screenwrit","origin","intend","late","howev","suppos","suspend","incredul","believ","tea","leoni","kim","basing","sleepwalk","lame","role","lust","thi","elderli","half","dead","look","effemin","man","ridicul","accent","wrong","part","overal","main","plot","thread","corpor","espionag","never","fulli","explain","never","ever","care","slight","becaus","thi","preview","reserv","final","judgment","becaus","possibl","reshoot","edit","bet","pai","cent","see","thi","theater"],"filtered2":["see","earli","preview","stress","enough","bad","think","veri","begin","audienc","groan","pacino","aw","southern","accent","poor","al","look","realli","realli","haggard","ca","decid","whether","purpos","part","role","drug","addict","publicist","perhap","get","ani","sleep","befor","come","set","wrong","pacino","close","howev","wretch","excus","plot","earli","give","indic","pacino","charact","gai","suspect","screenwrit","origin","intend","late","howev","suppos","suspend","incredul","believ","tea","leoni","kim","basing","sleepwalk","lame","role","lust","elderli","half","dead","look","effemin","man","ridicul","accent","wrong","part","overal","main","plot","thread","corpor","espionag","never","fulli","explain","never","ever","care","slight","becaus","preview","reserv","final","judgment","becaus","possibl","reshoot","edit","bet","pai","cent","see","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,9,10,12,13,15,16,22,25,27,30,32,34,42,44,45,61,69,79,81,91,93,109,113,128,138,146,147,149,150,156,168,179,205,206,228,249,266,274,295,318,322,348,372,395,402,412,424,559,597,617,640,697,732,794,926,977,1312,1366,1419,1440,1451,1503,1974,2008,2070,2210,2295,2611,2696,2709,2721,2823,2839,2922,2939,3093,3161,3334,3934,4214,4252,7134,7584,8213,8267],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,9,10,12,13,15,16,22,25,27,30,32,34,42,44,45,61,69,79,81,91,93,109,113,128,138,146,147,149,150,156,168,179,205,206,228,249,266,274,295,318,322,348,372,395,402,412,424,559,597,617,640,697,732,794,926,977,1312,1366,1419,1440,1451,1503,1974,2008,2070,2210,2295,2611,2696,2709,2721,2823,2839,2922,2939,3093,3161,3334,3934,4214,4252,7134,7584,8213,8267],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,2.5958480334723544,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,3.2439908614907673,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,3.7637034094785053,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.125691139326857,4.3043565130405606,4.681980408231769,2.290736518928

{"value":"Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It went downhill fast.<br /><br />There is much overacting, even from Angelina. She's about 20 and playing a 16 year old. There are three characters that are supposed to be Italian. Everyone else is Italian- American. The native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young male lead is cute, my wife says. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even the men.<br /><br />I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a randy doctor, that that was a bad sign. The two couples chasing their kids around are like the four Italian Stooges.<br /><br />My wife would not let go of the remote. Hopefully she was not taking makeup, clothing or decorating tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish. It was hidegarishous.<br /><br />Cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie shows up on your TV, do yourself a favor and ram your head through the TV screen instead. You'll be glad you did.

{"value":"Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: Too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing (that the screen is cut off), because there seems to be important actions going on, but you cannot see them. There is anyway already too much confusion in the movie, so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals. <br /><br />I like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow movies. But this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.<br /><br />Nothing to get attached to, to any of the characters, because they are not worked out well enough. To work out characters more is needed, than just minute long face shots, at least with this set of script+director+actors.<br /><br />I wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the

{"value":"Such a pretentious and lame attempt to hipness. Diabolical script and dialogue and truly embarrassing acting. Really the worse movie I have ever seen(at the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster. I saw it when it came out in a cinema in Brighton. People were walking out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium! At the end there were boos and scorn from the meagre crowd left, which was quite sad as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really sheepish. However the movie was that bad that I really could not feel like that sympathetic with them. Everybody has to start from somewhere and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at 'Tarantinism made in the UK'. 5 years have gone bye, but sometimes I still cringe at the memory of that sad night at the movies! This is a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever! I gave it a 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a 'shameometer' for everybody involved in this sorry mess of a movie.

{"value":"I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one strays further and further from the books. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than \"Love's Abiding Joy.\" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is no where in the book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines.

{"value":"My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show. I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he goes on watching it none the less. That is his right as an American I guess. But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode. It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really can't stand. I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college. My opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed, but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors. And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along (get the pun, HA,HA. Like Spielberg did. It's like Jesus before he became a man. Or thats at least what I think that would feel like. Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this, even though it contains little of Peter Falk. I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbo's investigation, as many later episodes would

{"value":"NOTHING in this movie is funny. I thought the premise, giving a human the libido of a randy ram, was interesting and should provide for some laughs. WRONG! There is simply nothing funny about the movie. For example, the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it borders on obscenity. They are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level, and it just aint funny.<br /><br />We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character doing this with everything, everywhere, everytime is also not funny. It becomes a cliche.<br /><br />Rob Schneider is, I guess, acceptable in the role. By this, I mean that he's not a bad actor, but with rotten material it's difficult to comment on quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the HUMAN-romantic leads (does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too?), seems embarrassed by the whole thing, as well she should be.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a poorly made film with too few laughs.<br /><br />The politics are spot on, it's gonna offend the hell out of republicans but that's what it's designed to do. That alone gives me reason to chuckle.<br /><br />The problem is, it looks like it was made in a REAL hurry (like about a week). And it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer, which seems to be completely off topic.<br /><br />Turiqistan is obviously Iraq, or Afghanistan, or any other number of countries the US has f**ked with since the 50s. The humour is a little dark (amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane corporation) but it IS on the mark, especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction (\"democracy lite\"!) <br /><br />However like a lot of satire criticising the US, it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured. I guess it's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer more of a nudge, wink approach - a bit of subtlety.

{"value":"I went on a visit to one of my relatives a while back, and we popped by a theatre, so we'd thought we'd go in and give this film a go. What a mistake! This film is awful in every department. I'd never heard of the film before, and literally everyone still hasn't. No wonder, this is as rank as it gets. It's a comedy, so it says, well the only thing funny is the ability, or lack of it, of the director to make such a film. Getting so close to Christmas, this should be titled how to under-cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hours - or however long it was, as I walked out. At the end of the film, you'll come out feeling as though you've been food poisoned on a sick turkey, and regret you wasted your time on such dribble. Who knows why such things get made. Some people had walked out from the theatre before the film was well over, and I blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and all that you come out and see is a poor TV movie that should be showed at 2 o'clock in the morning, in fact, it's that bad, day time TV shouldn't be showing it. What else can a say...probably not enough bad words could do it justice.","finished_norm":["i","go","on","a","visit","to","on","of","my","rel","a","while","back","and","we","pop","by","a","theatr","so","we","have","think","we","have","go","in","and","give","thi","film","a","go","what","a","mistak","thi","film","be","aw","in","everi","depart","i","have","never","hear","of","the","film","befor","and","liter","everyon","still","have","not","no","wonder","thi","be","a","rank","a","it","get","it","a","comedi","so","it","sai","good","the","onli","thing","funni","be","the","abil","or","lack","of","it","of","the","director","to","make","such","a","film","get","so","close","to","christma","thi","should","be","titl","how","to","undercook","a","turkei","in","nearli","on","and","a","half","hour","or","howev","long","it","be","a","i","walk","out","at","the","end","of","the","film","you","will","come","out","feel","a","though","you","have","be","food","poison","on","a","sick","turkei","and","regret","you","wast","your","time","on","such","dribbl","who","know","why","such","thing","get","make","some","peopl","have","walk","out","from","the","theatr","befor","the","film","be","good","over","and","i","blame","myself","for","not","walk","out","a","lot","earli","it","realli","annoi","me","that","you","pai","good","monei","to","see","someth","decent","and","all","that","you","come","out","and","see","be","a","poor","tv","movi","that","should","be","show","at","o","clock","in","the","morn","in","fact","it","that","bad","dai","time","tv","should","not","be","show","it","what","els","can","a","sayprob","not","enough","bad","word","can","do","it","justic"],"filtered":["go","visit","rel","back","pop","theatr","think","go","give","thi","film","go","mistak","thi","film","aw","everi","depart","never","hear","film","befor","liter","everyon","still","wonder","thi","rank","get","comedi","sai","good","onli","thing","funni","abil","lack","director","make","film","get","close","christma","thi","titl","undercook","turkei","nearli","half","hour","howev","long","walk","end","film","come","feel","though","food","poison","sick","turkei","regret","wast","time","dribbl","know","thing","get","make","peopl","walk","theatr","befor","film","good","blame","walk","lot","earli","realli","annoi","pai","good","monei","see","someth","decent","come","see","poor","tv","movi","show","o","clock","morn","fact","bad","dai","time","tv","show","els","sayprob","enough","bad","word","justic"],"filtered2":["go","visit","rel","back","pop","theatr","think","go","give","go","mistak","aw","everi","depart","never","hear","befor","liter","everyon","still","wonder","rank","get","comedi","good","onli","thing","funni","abil","lack","director","make","get","close","christma","titl","undercook","turkei","nearli","half","hour","howev","long","walk","end","come","feel","though","food","poison","sick","turkei","regret","wast","time","dribbl","know","thing","get","make","peopl","walk","theatr","befor","good","blame","walk","lot","earli","realli","annoi","pai","good","monei","see","someth","decent","come","see","poor","tv","show","o","clock","morn","fact","bad","dai","time","tv","show","els","sayprob","enough","bad","word","justic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,23,24,26,28,29,30,34,42,43,53,58,62,63,64,72,79,85,86,89,93,97,99,113,126,127,132,138,146,172,174,175,183,196,206,216,246,258,264,266,271,294,295,309,322,593,611,748,778,847,897,898,952,994,1118,1165,1167,1390,1426,1521,1654,1677,1695,1739,2777,2965,6489],"values":[2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,23,24,26,28,29,30,34,42,43,53,58,62,63,64,72,79,85,86,89,93,97,99,113,126,127,132,138,146,172,174,175,183,196,206,216,246,258,264,266,271,294,295,309,322,593,611,748,778,847,897,898,952,994,1118,1165,1167,1390,1426,1521,1654,1677,1695,1739,2777,2965,6489],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,2.389902141215977,2.912480743411154,1.8837873718108231,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,3.0904588387038183,2.6390769554676132,1.3364419891718522,2.7965700178917925,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,3.893901213901217,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,2.056430207256609,2.1521782565202803,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.326138445979858,5.000281788719697,2.456282578459816,2.3791142619576227,2.4885128563647294,2.478925055209576,2.597304642813496,2.6070186965339692,2.673149229007135,2.7061321952397077

{"value":"This movie was not made by Who fans. Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over: In Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams after the line \"Tommy doesn't know what day it is...\", they showed almost *no* Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of We're Not Gonna Take It (Listening to You), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's blazing guitar chords. Huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band. It's a very frustrating film to watch, and doesn't deliver the goods. I don't know if director Murry Lerner is just not a Who fan, or worse, for him at least, if he *is* a Who fan and this is all the *eight* cameras could deliver for him. To its credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, that are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. This might be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you're not anticipating Tommy.

{"value":"Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSF2000. The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON, people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character.

{"value":"Although this is \"better\" than the first Mulva (which doesn't say much anyways, I would rather watch paint dry) it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these Low Budget Pictures guys. I was suckered into buying a few dvds to support some indy filmmakers and boy did I regret it. Some haven't even been officially \"released\" yet (not bootlegs-bought from the filmmakers themselves) and I can't even list how bad they all are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they do pop up in other small indy films that they are friends with. If you are friends of these guys, chances are you were in their movies and had fun making them. But for those that had to watch them? No way. Bad video, bad audio, bad acting, bad plot...etc etc. These aren't even funny. I gave this one a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is in it and that is about it. Maybe it doesn't even deserve the 2. About a 1 1/16th star to show it was slightly better than the first (which I wish I could have rated in the negatives). If you want a decent no budget film, go pick up something from LBP's \"friends\" over at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes.

{"value":"I find it rather useless to comment on this \"movie\" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.It's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... <br /><br />Filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other Romanian \"movie\" directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists to depict the so called \"Romanian reality\" following the Communist era (1990 to present days).<br /><br />Under no circumstances recommended for people outside Romania as for the others (who lately find amateurish camera, lack of plot, lack of directorial / actors's quality etc, noise etc. as being trendy and even art-like) : watch & enjoy this \"movie\" (as I know you will) but do the other well intentioned IMDb members a favor, don't write an online review for it will misguide, irritate and in the end waste their time.<br /><br />On

{"value":"I find it rather useless to comment on this \"movie\" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.It's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... <br /><br />Filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other Romanian \"movie\" directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists to depict the so called \"Romanian reality\" following the Communist era (1990 to present days).<br /><br />Under no circumstances recommended for people outside Romania as for the others (who lately find amateurish camera, lack of plot, lack of directorial / actors's quality etc, noise etc. as being trendy and even art-like) : watch & enjoy this \"movie\" (as I know you will) but do the other well intentioned IMDb members a favor, don't write an online review for it will misguide, irritate and in the end waste their time.<br /><br />On

{"value":"I thoroughly enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when it came out, and was amazed when I saw the trailer for this film, and even more so when I found that Bilal had directed it himself. The film, however, was a major letdown. The visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks, and the story is poorly told. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he doesn't do a very good job at it, either.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both out of their right time and place, forced together by circumstance. Most of all, they were funny and likable. Not so here. Nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever, and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid. Even though the film is French, Horus doesn't have to be!<br /><br />We have all seen films we enjoyed, but wouldn't recommend to everyone, for some reason or other. I wouldn't recommend Immortel to anyone, except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources.

{"value":"The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel hinted at the idea the Wenders has lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture. The Land of Plenty seals the coffin, I'm afraid, by being a vastly unimaginative, obviously sentimental and cliché'd film. The characters are entirely flat and stereotyped, the writing, plot and direction are amateurish, at best. For the first time in quite a while, I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life. The war-torn delirium of the uncle, the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion...it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen. What happened? The days of experimentation, perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him, I'm afraid. Let's hope he finds his inspiration again... At the Toronto film festival, which is where I saw the film, Wenders was there to introduce it.

{"value":"I really don't have anything new to add but I just felt like I had to comment on this sack. So here goes:<br /><br />Atrocious. I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really, really painful but it was next on the list... You can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is \"Hobgoblins\" but it just couldn't get out. Everything about this movie is 4th rate. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the \"action scenes\", the... ahhhh forget it. I can watch a piece of crap like \"The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z\" (aka \"Zaat\") over and over and over with hardly any ill effects (I like it in fact- btw, it will be on TCM later this month- October, 2009) but \"Hobgoblins\" is a whole 'nother ballgame.<br /><br />The worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz \"New Wave\" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This torment will last for days. <br /><br />Good luck, won't you?","finished_norm":["i","realli","do","not","have","anyth","new","to","add","but","i","just","feel","like","i","have","to","comment","on","thi","sack","so","here","goesbr","br","atroci","i","be","run","through","my","mstk","dvd","collect","again","and","i","just","watch","hobgoblin","for","about","the","th","time","it","realli","realli","pain","but","it","be","next","on","the","list","you","can","see","that","there","be","a","tini","kernel","of","a","actual","movi","buri","under","all","the","crap","that","be","hobgoblin","but","it","just","can","not","get","out","everyth","about","thi","movi","be","th","rate","the","stori","the","act","the","effect","the","woman","the","action","scene","the","ahhhh","forget","it","i","can","watch","a","piec","of","crap","like","the","bloodwat","of","dr","z","aka","zaat","over","and","over","and","over","with","hardli","ani","ill","effect","i","like","it","in","fact","btw","it","will","be","on","tcm","late","thi","month","octob","but","hobgoblin","be","a","whole","nother","ballgamebr","br","the","wrong","part","of","it","all","mai","be","that","it","now","about","hour","after","the","movi","end","i","have","a","good","night","sleep","some","coffe","and","some","spindri","toast","my","medic","and","yet","the","ersatz","new","wave","danc","music","that","ami","red","short","and","larain","newman","be","frolic","to","in","the","live","room","be","still","run","through","my","head","thi","torment","will","last","for","dai","br","br","good","luck","wo","not","you"],"filtered":["realli","anyth","new","add","feel","like","comment","thi","sack","goesbr","br","atroci","run","mstk","dvd","collect","watch","hobgoblin","th","time","realli","realli","pain","next","list","see","tini","kernel","actual","movi","buri","crap","hobgoblin","get","everyth","thi","movi","th","rate","stori","act","effect","woman","action","scene","ahhhh","forget","watch","piec","crap","like","bloodwat","dr","z","aka","zaat","hardli","ani","ill","effect","like","fact","btw","tcm","late","thi","month","octob","hobgoblin","whole","nother","ballgamebr","br","wrong","part","mai","hour","movi","end","good","night","sleep","coffe","spindri","toast","medic","yet","ersatz","new","wave","danc","music","ami","red","short","larain","newman","frolic","live","room","still","run","head","thi","torment","last","dai","br","br","good","luck","wo"],"filtered2":["realli","anyth","new","add","feel","like","comment","sack","goesbr","atroci","run","mstk","dvd","collect","watch","hobgoblin","th","time","realli","realli","pain","next","list","see","tini","kernel","actual","buri","crap","hobgoblin","get","everyth","th","rate","stori","act","effect","woman","action","scene","ahhhh","forget","watch","piec","crap","like","bloodwat","dr","z","aka","zaat","hardli","ani","ill","effect","like","fact","btw","tcm","late","month","octob","hobgoblin","whole","nother","ballgamebr","wrong","part","mai","hour","end","good","night","sleep","coffe","spindri","toast","medic","yet","ersatz","new","wave","danc","music","ami","red","short","larain","newman","frolic","live","room","still","run","head","torment","last","dai","good","luck","wo"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,13,17,19,21,24,25,27,43,46,52,61,64,70,87,97,104,106,111,116,118,129,132,137,144,150,174,193,194,202,208,210,218,247,272,280,297,299,313,373,406,459,492,513,602,665,732,739,779,853,1026,1219,1231,1447,1489,1547,1715,1767,1794,1805,1819,1889,2443,2944,3214,3603,3669,4102,4397,6541,6655,7361,7863,8192],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,13,17,19,21,24,25,27,43,46,52,61,64,70,87,97,104,106,111,116,118,129,132,137,144,150,174,193,194,202,208,210,218,247,272,280,297,299,313,373,406,459,492,513,602,665,732,739,779,853,1026,1219,1231,1447,1489,1547,1715,1767,1794,1805,1819,1889,2443,2944,3214,3603,3669,4102,4397,6541,6655,7361,7863,8192],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,3.3953824709201923,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,2.094675786251684,4.230048743045324,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,4.318168722633384,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.354379525480895,2.4106958340079214,2.253494045787767,4.587807168251287,2.2931108769894046,2.332712011146513,2.456282578459816,2.517840471459249,2.5378812223426954,2.597304642813496,2.6289494000279396,2.687151791517189,2.5940874818617203,2.7303758068497004,2.8028805344481915,2.8028805344481915,2.813490713560207,2.79499613

{"value":"This movie was bad to say the least!!! The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this LAME movie. It starts off with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min...in a Ferrari F430. I did that in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously...this movie does not do justice to these cars. Obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 o'clock. I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo going 30-40MPH>>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /><br />And...the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT!!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into Hollywood. He partook in a movie that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women>>cheap money grubbing whores. Asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time . What the heck is all the fear about asians??

{"value":"Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair; even his smaller touches (like fingering a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) don't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself, an unsure filmmaker. In the Southwest circa 1950, a poor gambler (not above a little cheating) wins an orphaned, would-be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon, the bickering twosome become prospectors. Some lovely vistas, and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man, are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy-drama, with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty, but--although the camera loves her pouty, glossy beauty--she has no screen presence (and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever); every time she opens her mouth, one is

{"value":"Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or \"delights\" as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me. The plot isn't really worth commenting as, but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory. Before the movie is over, we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them, a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm, a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe, yet then jumps off, and a whole collection of further, bizarre occurrences. Basically, if you aren't staying up on a Saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of SciFi channel original movies, avoid this film like the plague. Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says: \"It's the best movie I have ever seen.\" To which the friend on my right says: \"Only battle techno music could have made it

{"value":"This ABC straight-to-TV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike into a magical, fantastical and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in her 'time quartet', is a beautiful take on life, the universe, and time itself. Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand. Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms. L'Engle's work of art. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mushy and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost. This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that someday an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón) makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, fake and cheap motel-room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its
