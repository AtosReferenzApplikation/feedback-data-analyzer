{"value":"Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nick-name that Donna Reeds' romantic lead played by Tom Drake tags her with! So lets get this clear right away. From her first ingénue role in THE GET-AWAY (1941) too her last, DALLAS (1984-1985) Ms. Reed could NEVER be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slim actress. Whose roles at M.G.M. seldom lived up to her talents.<br /><br />Ms. Reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball' comedy. Clearly M.G.M. was out of their depth making this type of film. A type better produced over at COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the 'touch' of Ernst Lubitsch nor the wit of Preston Sturges could save this film. A rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre-war (WWII) effort.<br /><br />If Irving Thalberg had still been alive the screen-play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day. It did fit into Louis B. Mayer's 'safe-zone' of none challenging family entertainment. A form that could not stand up to the post-war challenges of the 'DeHavilland Decision', loss of their theater chains, television and would contribute to M.G.M.s decline. Fortunetly for Donna Reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Oscar win as Best Supporting Actress.","finished_norm":["ye","chunki","thi","be","the","nicknam","that","donna","re","romant","lead","plai","by","tom","drake","tag","her","with","so","let","get","thi","clear","right","awai","from","her","ingénu","role","in","the","getawai","too","her","last","dalla","m","re","can","never","be","describ","a","chunki","not","thi","attract","and","slim","actress","whose","role","at","mgm","seldom","live","up","to","her","talentsbr","br","m","re","be","support","by","a","cast","of","compet","charact","actor","who","unfortun","must","flounder","through","thi","alleg","screwbal","comedi","clearli","mgm","be","out","of","their","depth","make","thi","typ","of","film","a","typ","well","produc","over","at","columbia","paramount","rko","and","even","univers","neither","the","touch","of","ernst","lubitsch","nor","the","wit","of","preston","sturg","can","save","thi","film","a","rather","convent","romant","comedi","that","have","all","the","mark","of","a","prewar","wwii","effortbr","br","if","irv","thalberg","have","still","be","aliv","the","screenplai","would","have","either","go","through","a","signific","rewrit","or","never","see","the","light","of","dai","it","do","fit","into","loui","b","mayer","safezon","of","none","challeng","famili","entertain","a","form","that","can","not","stand","up","to","the","postwar","challeng","of","the","dehavilland","decis","loss","of","their","theater","chain","televis","and","would","contribut","to","mgm","declin","fortunetli","for","donna","re","her","well","dai","be","ahead","of","her","culmin","in","from","here","to","etern","and","her","oscar","win","a","well","support","actress"],"filtered":["ye","chunki","thi","nicknam","donna","re","romant","lead","plai","tom","drake","tag","let","get","thi","clear","right","awai","ingénu","role","getawai","last","dalla","m","re","never","describ","chunki","thi","attract","slim","actress","whose","role","mgm","seldom","live","talentsbr","br","m","re","support","cast","compet","charact","actor","unfortun","must","flounder","thi","alleg","screwbal","comedi","clearli","mgm","depth","make","thi","typ","film","typ","well","produc","columbia","paramount","rko","even","univers","neither","touch","ernst","lubitsch","wit","preston","sturg","save","thi","film","rather","convent","romant","comedi","mark","prewar","wwii","effortbr","br","irv","thalberg","still","aliv","screenplai","either","go","signific","rewrit","never","see","light","dai","fit","loui","b","mayer","safezon","none","challeng","famili","entertain","form","stand","postwar","challeng","dehavilland","decis","loss","theater","chain","televis","contribut","mgm","declin","fortunetli","donna","re","well","dai","ahead","culmin","etern","oscar","win","well","support","actress"],"filtered2":["ye","chunki","nicknam","donna","re","romant","lead","plai","tom","drake","tag","let","get","clear","right","awai","ingénu","role","getawai","last","dalla","m","re","never","describ","chunki","attract","slim","actress","whose","role","mgm","seldom","live","talentsbr","m","re","support","cast","compet","charact","actor","unfortun","must","flounder","alleg","screwbal","comedi","clearli","mgm","depth","make","typ","typ","well","produc","columbia","paramount","rko","even","univers","neither","touch","ernst","lubitsch","wit","preston","sturg","save","rather","convent","romant","comedi","mark","prewar","wwii","effortbr","irv","thalberg","still","aliv","screenplai","either","go","signific","rewrit","never","see","light","dai","fit","loui","b","mayer","safezon","none","challeng","famili","entertain","form","stand","postwar","challeng","dehavilland","decis","loss","theater","chain","televis","contribut","mgm","declin","fortunetli","donna","re","well","dai","ahead","culmin","etern","oscar","win","well","support","actress"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,10,20,40,41,42,64,68,92,116,121,124,127,128,132,141,144,155,157,160,182,189,195,207,209,227,261,353,354,370,377,384,424,458,489,494,590,598,642,648,663,668,676,690,703,717,718,745,759,851,864,913,914,979,1048,1221,1322,1360,1463,1483,1598,1746,1873,1895,2299,2442,2648,2788,2967,3156,3280,3312,3330,3558,3702,4389,4731,5081,5406,5657,5877,6033,6386,6394,6509,6852,8094,8126,8309],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,10,20,40,41,42,64,68,92,116,121,124,127,128,132,141,144,155,157,160,182,189,195,207,209,227,261,353,354,370,377,384,424,458,489,494,590,598,642,648,663,668,676,690,703,717,718,745,759,851,864,913,914,979,1048,1221,1322,1360,1463,1483,1598,1746,1873,1895,2299,2442,2648,2788,2967,3156,3280,3312,3330,3558,3702,4389,4731,5081,5406,5657,5877,603

{"value":"It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought ''Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons''. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it's a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.<br /><br />The second thing is I wonder why it got it's TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride.

{"value":"Ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. Here, he raids two recent classics  'The Usual Suspects' and 'Fight Club'  and still comes out empty-handed.<br /><br />Despite parading itself as a con-mystery (with the sub-'Usual Suspects' twaddle \"the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you\" or whatever it was...) and attempting a 'Fight-Club' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. By the last third, you know you're being lead down a blind alley, and tediously slowly at that.<br /><br />Cons, chess and game theory are all great subjects, but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) watchable is Ritchie's bold way with with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to tighter editing, there's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper.<br /><br />As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity. If you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'Lost Highway'.","finished_norm":["ritchi","two","film","be","snappi","stylish","entertain","here","he","raid","two","recent","classic","the","usual","suspect","and","fight","club","and","still","come","out","emptyhandedbr","br","despit","parad","itself","a","a","conmysteri","with","the","subusu","suspect","twaddl","the","great","con","he","ever","pull","be","convinc","you","that","he","be","you","or","whatev","it","be","and","attempt","a","fightclub","twist","about","which","charact","be","real","and","which","be","intern","manifest","the","film","struggl","to","maintain","interest","in","it","half","by","the","last","you","know","you","re","be","lead","down","a","blind","allei","and","tedious","slowli","at","thatbr","br","con","chess","and","game","theori","be","all","great","subject","but","ritchi","delv","into","them","too","superfici","and","too","repetit","to","make","much","us","of","the","materialbr","br","the","onli","thing","that","keep","the","movi","almost","watchabl","be","ritchi","bold","wai","with","with","a","scene","and","mauricejo","dynam","camera","if","ritchi","stick","to","a","much","satisfi","plot","and","succumb","to","tight","edit","there","no","reason","why","he","can","not","have","make","anoth","enjoy","gangster","caperbr","br","a","it","be","revolv","be","a","wast","of","your","time","incomprehens","doe","not","equal","profund","if","you","want","to","see","a","great","film","that","doe","not","make","logic","sens","but","make","a","virtu","of","it","and","incident","which","conjur","involv","a","inexplic","escap","from","solitari","confin","watch","lose","highwai"],"filtered":["ritchi","two","film","snappi","stylish","entertain","raid","two","recent","classic","usual","suspect","fight","club","still","come","emptyhandedbr","br","despit","parad","conmysteri","subusu","suspect","twaddl","great","con","ever","pull","convinc","whatev","attempt","fightclub","twist","charact","real","intern","manifest","film","struggl","maintain","interest","half","last","know","re","lead","blind","allei","tedious","slowli","thatbr","br","con","chess","game","theori","great","subject","ritchi","delv","superfici","repetit","make","much","us","materialbr","br","onli","thing","keep","movi","almost","watchabl","ritchi","bold","wai","scene","mauricejo","dynam","camera","ritchi","stick","much","satisfi","plot","succumb","tight","edit","reason","make","anoth","enjoy","gangster","caperbr","br","revolv","wast","time","incomprehens","doe","equal","profund","want","see","great","film","doe","make","logic","sens","make","virtu","incident","conjur","involv","inexplic","escap","solitari","confin","watch","lose","highwai"],"filtered2":["ritchi","two","snappi","stylish","entertain","raid","two","recent","classic","usual","suspect","fight","club","still","come","emptyhandedbr","despit","parad","conmysteri","subusu","suspect","twaddl","great","con","ever","pull","convinc","whatev","attempt","fightclub","twist","charact","real","intern","manifest","struggl","maintain","interest","half","last","know","re","lead","blind","allei","tedious","slowli","thatbr","con","chess","game","theori","great","subject","ritchi","delv","superfici","repetit","make","us","materialbr","onli","thing","keep","almost","watchabl","ritchi","bold","wai","scene","mauricejo","dynam","camera","ritchi","stick","satisfi","plot","succumb","tight","edit","reason","make","anoth","enjoy","gangster","caperbr","revolv","wast","time","incomprehens","doe","equal","profund","want","see","great","doe","make","logic","sens","make","virtu","incident","conjur","involv","inexplic","escap","solitari","confin","watch","lose","highwai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,10,11,18,19,26,29,32,33,34,37,39,44,47,51,56,60,64,68,73,80,89,95,131,134,144,157,173,177,195,206,221,231,232,241,265,332,348,374,391,416,435,478,544,550,556,562,638,736,842,906,973,977,1035,1178,1374,1382,1493,1506,1523,1589,1685,1705,1835,1872,2278,2444,2501,2593,2700,2947,3112,3168,3187,3241,3532,3617,3864,4361,4514,5066,5274,5282,6240,7297,7325,7405],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,10,11,18,19,26,29,32,33,34,37,39,44,47,51,56,60,64,68,73,80,89,95,131,134,144,157,173,177,195,206,221,231,232,241,265,332,348,374,391,416,435,478,544,550,556,562,638,736,842,906,973,977,1035,1178,1374,1382,1493,1506,1523,1589,1685,1705,1835,1872,2278,2444,2501,2593,2700,2947,3112,3168,3187,3241,3532,3617,3864,4361,4514,5066,5274,5282,6240,7297,7325,7405],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,1.3324924169

{"value":"\"CIA Codename:Alexa\" is an absolute horrible rip off of Luc Besson's classic film \"La Femme Nikita\"(1990). The film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them. (Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history. Lamas' \"acting\" is simply a bad Steven Segal impersonation. Watching Orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience.<br /><br />The writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable. There are so many action movie \"conventions\" in the film it is ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying thru glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The musical score resembles David Michael Frank's score for \"Hard to Kill\" (1990), which furthers the Steven Segal theme of this movie. There is plenty of martial arts in the film, and it is pretty well done for a low budget American production. The mindless action and over the top acting never lets up, and I have to admit I was mildly entertained. <br /><br />Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star, that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters. My recommendation is that you skip \"CIA Codename:Alexa\" and check out \"La Femme Nikita\" instead.","finished_norm":["cia","codenamealexa","be","a","absolut","horribl","rip","off","of","luc","besson","classic","film","la","femm","nikita","the","film","be","basic","about","a","woman","who","be","take","in","and","train","by","the","cia","and","be","forc","to","do","a","secret","mission","for","them","pretti","much","the","same","stori","structur","of","la","femm","nikita","the","act","combo","of","lorenzo","lama","and","oj","simpson","be","perhap","the","wrong","in","cinema","histori","lama","act","be","simpli","a","bad","steven","segal","imperson","watch","orenth","act","in","thi","film","be","a","excruci","experiencebr","br","the","write","and","act","be","so","poor","in","thi","film","at","time","it","be","laughabl","there","be","so","mani","action","movi","convent","in","the","film","it","be","ridicul","unnecessari","car","explos","peopl","fly","thru","glass","window","terrorist","bad","ponytail","etc","the","music","score","resembl","david","michael","frank","score","for","hard","to","kill","which","further","the","steven","segal","theme","of","thi","movi","there","be","plenti","of","martial","art","in","the","film","and","it","be","pretti","good","do","for","a","low","budget","american","product","the","mindless","action","and","over","the","top","act","never","let","up","and","i","have","to","admit","i","be","mildli","entertain","br","br","lorenzo","lama","have","the","look","of","a","action","star","back","in","the","earli","but","he","be","certainli","no","action","star","that","be","why","he","be","do","soap","opera","and","not","action","blockbust","my","recommend","be","that","you","skip","cia","codenamealexa","and","check","out","la","femm","nikita","instead"],"filtered":["cia","codenamealexa","absolut","horribl","rip","luc","besson","classic","film","la","femm","nikita","film","basic","woman","take","train","cia","forc","secret","mission","pretti","much","stori","structur","la","femm","nikita","act","combo","lorenzo","lama","oj","simpson","perhap","wrong","cinema","histori","lama","act","simpli","bad","steven","segal","imperson","watch","orenth","act","thi","film","excruci","experiencebr","br","write","act","poor","thi","film","time","laughabl","mani","action","movi","convent","film","ridicul","unnecessari","car","explos","peopl","fly","thru","glass","window","terrorist","bad","ponytail","etc","music","score","resembl","david","michael","frank","score","hard","kill","steven","segal","theme","thi","movi","plenti","martial","art","film","pretti","good","low","budget","american","product","mindless","action","top","act","never","let","admit","mildli","entertain","br","br","lorenzo","lama","look","action","star","back","earli","certainli","action","star","soap","opera","action","blockbust","recommend","skip","cia","codenamealexa","check","la","femm","nikita","instead"],"filtered2":["cia","codenamealexa","absolut","horribl","rip","luc","besson","classic","la","femm","nikita","basic","woman","take","train","cia","forc","secret","mission","pretti","stori","structur","la","femm","nikita","act","combo","lorenzo","lama","oj","simpson","perhap","wrong","cinema","histori","lama","act","simpli","bad","steven","segal","imperson","watch","orenth","act","excruci","experiencebr","write","act","poor","time","laughabl","mani","action","convent","ridicul","unnecessari","car","explos","peopl","fly","thru","glass","window","terrorist","bad","ponytail","etc","music","score","resembl","david","michael","frank","score","hard","kill","steven","segal","theme","plenti","martial","art","pretti","good","low","budget","american","product","mindless","action","top","act","never","let","admit","mildli","entertain","lorenzo","lama","look","action","star","back","earli","certainli","action","star","soap","opera","action","blockbust","recommend","skip","cia","codenamealexa","check","la","femm","nikita","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,9,16,17,21,23,25,31,42,50,63,65,70,76,78,100,118,124,129,146,152,171,190,195,201,217,222,223,230,256,266,274,284,286,298,318,332,338,364,382,389,409,429,466,499,504,518,533,552,652,675,691,713,766,798,824,887,931,1053,1081,1194,1343,1367,1386,1435,1560,1614,1616,1633,1682,1776,1817,1822,1873,2003,2935,2987,3605,3613,3622,4191,4918,5175,5269,6007,6745,7001,7377],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,9,16,17,21,23,25,31,42,50,63,65,70,76,78,100,118,124,129,146,152,171,190,195,201,217,222,223,230,256,266,274,284,286,298,318,332,338,364,382,389,409,429,466,499,504,518,533,552,652,675,691,713,766,798,824,887,931,1053,1081,1194,1343,1367,1386,1435,1560,1614,1616,1633,1682,1776,1817,1822

{"value":"One of the worst films I have ever seen. How to define \"worst?\" I would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy, sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of actual Elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be \"The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead one\" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script: In 1958, Elvis' words and songs that he would speak/perform in the 1970's are quoted! Worst special effect? That Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis' grave, potentially the most photographed/recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, this film's biggest audience would be Elvis fans. However, the rampant stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not FBI credentials...and I could go on and on) actually undercuts THAT conventional wisdom. Ugh.

{"value":"This is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain. It is 75% a rehash of The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was.<br /><br />I was initially confused as I thought that Annie (Kelly Galindo) may have been a different Lacey, but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film. Fans will immediately note that they are not the same person.<br /><br />After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials, head to the house, and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered.<br /><br />Then the movie shift to a rerunning of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original. Notably, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Sadly, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there. Why rerun this film? Did they find the footage in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /><br />We'll never know and, despite the psychologist telling Annie she is cured, we all know the bogeyman will never die.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","the","video","nasti","but","onli","becaus","it","come","out","in","when","thei","be","presum","tire","of","the","whole","thing","in","britain","it","be","a","rehash","of","the","boogeyman","and","would","have","be","ban","for","the","same","reason","whatev","that","wasbr","br","i","be","initi","confus","a","i","think","that","anni","kelli","galindo","mai","have","be","a","differ","lacei","but","she","be","someon","troubl","by","psychic","vision","of","a","boogeyman","similar","to","the","on","in","the","film","fan","will","immedi","note","that","thei","be","not","the","same","personbr","br","after","see","a","murder","in","a","bathroom","and","conjur","see","the","address","a","good","anni","her","psychiatrist","and","a","para","psychologi","student","who","greatli","resembl","the","gui","on","the","cheap","romanc","novel","and","butter","commerci","head","to","the","hous","and","sure","enough","it","the","same","bathroom","hour","late","a","murder","happen","just","a","she","describ","of","cours","we","have","no","idea","who","thi","boobilici","woman","be","or","why","she","be","murderedbr","br","then","the","movi","shift","to","a","rerun","of","the","boogeyman","stori","with","some","extra","footag","that","we","do","not","see","in","the","origin","notabl","the","boogeyman","be","show","unlik","the","origin","sadli","some","of","the","good","scene","be","cut","but","of","it","be","there","why","rerun","thi","film","do","thei","find","the","footag","in","the","trash","what","be","the","purpos","br","br","we","will","never","know","and","despit","the","psychologist","tell","anni","she","be","cure","we","all","know","the","bogeyman","will","never","die"],"filtered":["thi","video","nasti","onli","becaus","come","thei","presum","tire","whole","thing","britain","rehash","boogeyman","ban","reason","whatev","wasbr","br","initi","confus","think","anni","kelli","galindo","mai","differ","lacei","someon","troubl","psychic","vision","boogeyman","similar","film","fan","immedi","note","thei","personbr","br","see","murder","bathroom","conjur","see","address","good","anni","psychiatrist","para","psychologi","student","greatli","resembl","gui","cheap","romanc","novel","butter","commerci","head","hous","sure","enough","bathroom","hour","late","murder","happen","describ","cours","idea","thi","boobilici","woman","murderedbr","br","movi","shift","rerun","boogeyman","stori","extra","footag","see","origin","notabl","boogeyman","show","unlik","origin","sadli","good","scene","cut","rerun","thi","film","thei","find","footag","trash","purpos","br","br","never","know","despit","psychologist","tell","anni","cure","know","bogeyman","never","die"],"filtered2":["video","nasti","onli","becaus","come","presum","tire","whole","thing","britain","rehash","boogeyman","ban","reason","whatev","wasbr","initi","confus","think","anni","kelli","galindo","mai","differ","lacei","someon","troubl","psychic","vision","boogeyman","similar","fan","immedi","note","personbr","see","murder","bathroom","conjur","see","address","good","anni","psychiatrist","para","psychologi","student","greatli","resembl","gui","cheap","romanc","novel","butter","commerci","head","hous","sure","enough","bathroom","hour","late","murder","happen","describ","cours","idea","boobilici","woman","murderedbr","shift","rerun","boogeyman","stori","extra","footag","see","origin","notabl","boogeyman","show","unlik","origin","sadli","good","scene","cut","rerun","find","footag","trash","purpos","never","know","despit","psychologist","tell","anni","cure","know","bogeyman","never","die"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,11,12,17,19,22,26,28,29,34,38,39,42,46,55,69,70,90,93,94,95,111,119,123,139,140,150,174,199,204,208,213,240,273,293,303,351,391,427,474,556,560,591,615,626,658,668,671,705,752,794,892,900,987,1001,1052,1053,1125,1226,1509,1607,1721,2136,2229,2319,2320,2482,2568,2685,2936,2981,3027,3267,3296,3418,4039,4944,5085,5692,6066,8366],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,11,12,17,19,22,26,28,29,34,38,39,42,46,55,69,70,90,93,94,95,111,119,123,139,140,150,174,199,204,208,213,240,273,293,303,351,391,427,474,556,560,591,615,626,658,668,671,705,752,794,892,900,987,1001,1052,1053,1125,1226,1509,1607,1721,2136,2229,2319,2320,2482,2568,2685,2936,2981,3027,3267,3296,3418,4039,4944,5085,5692,6066,8366],"values":[1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,3.2439908614907673,1.655771293751733,1.9536997

{"value":"Oh dear! The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot \"JOHNY TEST\" while we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing \"Johny Quest\" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life\", and changing the \"Quest\" with \"Test\". Its something weird that I'm wrong, but actually I was wrong, he wasn't changing nothing, he heard of this show.<br /><br />One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released. I wasn't sure of what was the plot of this show, so I adventured myself to watch it, and here is my answer \"I WANT MY DAMN HOUR BACK\" (Because I watched this crap and \"My Gym Partner's a Monkey\".<br /><br />This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. First, the beginning, with the most stupid song in the world, then the plot. Oh, where are my manners? I haven't said the plot of this show. Is about a boy who has to AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters, that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother. OHHH, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he is the test of his sisters experiments.<br /><br />You know, I honestly miss Dexter's Lab (before it was transformed to the NEW Dexter, a total crap too). This is a bad copy of that old good show, except that this show is amazingly bad.

{"value":"After the superb AANKHEN(2002) which was a remake of a Gujarati play he comes with WAQT which too looks like a stage play<br /><br />In stage plays, we have characters shouting, overacting here too the same<br /><br />The first half shows Amitabh almost kidding the 40+ Akshay Kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd<br /><br />The film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way Amitabh wants to make Akki responsible is absolutely fake<br /><br />Even his reason for hiding his sickness, his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by Akki is a put off<br /><br />Some emotions do touch you but most are too over the top<br /><br />Rajpal's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half <br /><br />Direction by Vipul Shah is too overdone though some scenes are good Music is okay<br /><br />Amongst actors Amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes Akshay Kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes His chemistry with Bachchan is matchless Rajpal is a highlight, he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a

{"value":"Hilariously obvious \"drama\" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy--or something. To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally. We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice. I found them bland and boring. The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great. Excuse me? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with. Also these \"great\" kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun.<br /><br />I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! They're ALWAYS playing! It got to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe) There are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight, a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love hip hop here's your movie. But it you're looking for good drama mixed in--forget it. Also HOW did this get a PG rating?

{"value":"Well, how do you even rate a movie such as this one? Does it even have cinematic value really? It's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible. Basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl. Not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really.<br /><br />It's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended. The slapping and stumping is all soft and fake looking, as well as sounding. They are often just kicking into the floor, rather than into the girl, obviously. Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame. I mean if this was real, surely she would had screamed it out. There is more moaning than screaming in this one though.<br /><br />The movie is obviously low budget and it's a valor attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking, with very limited resources. Don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released, though it must had done something well, since a total of six sequels got released after this one.<br /><br />Fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie, though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie.<br /><br

{"value":"This movie was horrible, simply put. It was so bad I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers.<br /><br />I am a campy horror film expert, per se. I have watched \"Redneck Zombies\", \"House of the Psychotic Women\", \"Slumber Party Massacre II\" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this movie sucks.<br /><br />Three fourths of the film is comprised of scared individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are spouting non-sequitur lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls to pieces. There were so many jarring low-angle shots; I figured Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tall tripod. He used what I call the \"Leif Maneuver\" several millions times: that is, zooming out from an object of interest like an amateur. Apparently the film crew couldn't get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset... and played it in reverse. With direction this lazy, you are actually impressed with the final gory scene. The only thing you can figure is that the last five minutes was filmed before the first eighty-five minutes.<br /><br />If you want a good (bad) gory movie, rent \"Riki-Oh\" or the foundational \"Dead

{"value":"Is this the \"worse\" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe, at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense. Seeing something that makes you go mad? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feel to it, the music is heightened, almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress, to the point that it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion's or anything but Medusin's, these are very boring aliens to make an episode around. McCoy gets to utter his famous phrase \"He's Dead, Jim\". Spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but Kirk does not. They go through that freaking \"barrier\" now for the third time that I can remember, boring. At least season three's next episodes would be \"Spectre Of The Gun\", and \"Day of The Dove\" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the color purple, its kind of a pinkish purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the gangway that is normally grey is now purple. We never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode, in the ships corridor is pretty lame.","finished_norm":["be","thi","the","wrong","star","trek","to","episod","mayb","at","littl","it","get","my","vote","a","be","in","the","bottom","i","mean","thi","episod","make","absolut","no","freak","sens","see","someth","that","make","you","go","mad","give","me","a","break","thi","episod","conjur","have","a","differ","feel","to","it","the","music","be","heighten","almost","forc","to","enhanc","a","feel","of","distress","to","the","point","that","it","suck","give","me","some","klingon","gorn","tholian","romulan","high","be","like","triskelion","or","anyth","but","medusin","thi","be","veri","bore","alien","to","make","a","episod","around","mccoi","get","to","utter","hi","famou","phrase","he","dead","jim","spock","put","on","the","protect","goggl","when","transport","the","ambassador","awai","but","kirk","doe","not","thei","go","through","that","freak","barrier","now","for","the","time","that","i","can","rememb","bore","at","littl","season","three","next","episod","would","be","spectr","of","the","gun","and","dai","of","the","dive","and","other","to","follow","make","trek","a","decent","show","to","watch","in","syndic","where","it","would","pick","peopl","like","me","up","a","avid","fan","person","observ","trek","love","to","us","the","color","purpl","it","kind","of","a","pinkish","purpl","like","when","thei","be","in","the","corridor","outsid","the","compart","the","gangwai","that","be","normal","grei","be","now","purpl","we","never","have","a","purpl","bridg","but","it","interest","to","see","i","notic","it","in","sever","episod","it","be","do","by","a","light","filter","and","it","work","veri","good","but","in","thi","episod","in","the","ship","corridor","be","pretti","lame"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","star","trek","episod","mayb","littl","get","vote","bottom","mean","thi","episod","make","absolut","freak","sens","see","someth","make","go","mad","give","break","thi","episod","conjur","differ","feel","music","heighten","almost","forc","enhanc","feel","distress","point","suck","give","klingon","gorn","tholian","romulan","high","like","triskelion","anyth","medusin","thi","veri","bore","alien","make","episod","around","mccoi","get","utter","hi","famou","phrase","dead","jim","spock","put","protect","goggl","transport","ambassador","awai","kirk","doe","thei","go","freak","barrier","time","rememb","bore","littl","season","three","next","episod","spectr","gun","dai","dive","follow","make","trek","decent","show","watch","syndic","pick","peopl","like","avid","fan","person","observ","trek","love","us","color","purpl","kind","pinkish","purpl","like","thei","corridor","outsid","compart","gangwai","normal","grei","purpl","never","purpl","bridg","interest","see","notic","sever","episod","light","filter","work","veri","good","thi","episod","ship","corridor","pretti","lame"],"filtered2":["wrong","star","trek","mayb","littl","get","vote","bottom","mean","make","absolut","freak","sens","see","someth","make","go","mad","give","break","conjur","differ","feel","music","heighten","almost","forc","enhanc","feel","distress","point","suck","give","klingon","gorn","tholian","romulan","high","like","triskelion","anyth","medusin","veri","bore","alien","make","around","mccoi","get","utter","famou","phrase","dead","jim","spock","put","protect","goggl","transport","ambassador","awai","kirk","doe","go","freak","barrier","time","rememb","bore","littl","season","three","next","spectr","gun","dai","dive","follow","make","trek","decent","show","watch","syndic","pick","peopl","like","avid","fan","person","observ","trek","love","us","color","purpl","kind","pinkish","purpl","like","corridor","outsid","compart","gangwai","normal","grei","purpl","never","purpl","bridg","interest","see","notic","sever","light","filter","work","veri","good","ship","corridor","pretti","lame"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,14,15,18,23,25,28,30,39,42,43,48,53,54,56,60,66,78,88,98,100,104,108,118,122,131,132,140,153,155,159,163,173,204,211,222,224,228,260,290,297,309,316,338,353,360,372,421,446,501,565,688,700,791,817,831,860,865,875,986,1024,1190,1314,1358,1570,1855,2152,2306,2614,2934,3090,3531,3818,4311,4424,4529,4662,4930,5050,6542,7662,7872],"values":[4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,14,15,18,23,25,28,30,39,42,43,48,53,54,56,60,66,78,88,98,100,104,108,118,122,131,132,140,153,155,159,163,173,204,211,222,224,228,260,290,297,309,316,338,353,360,372,421,446,501,565,688,700,791,817,831,860,865,875,986,1024,1190,1314,1358,1570,1855,2152,2306,2614,2934,3090,3531,3818,4311,4424,4529,4662,4930,5050,6542,7662,7872],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.93811488367297

{"value":"This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but that's about as much as can be said about it. It starts off with some good atmosphere; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating, the mood is set to \"eerie\". And then...nothing. Well, somethings. Just somethings that clearly don't fit in...and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters, and the hospital they've taken over. I mean, come on, biker duds? Some band watched a bit too much Gwar.<br /><br />My personal favorite was the head demon, who looks rather a lot like a middle-aged trucker desperately attempting menace, while simultaneously looking like he'd really like prefer to sag down on an afghan-covered couch, undo his belt, pop a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz), and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far scarier truckers. At truckstops. Drinking coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo!!!! Scary!!<br /><br />The other monsters are even more cartoonish, and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital...they apparently just randomly pop up in places, play some bippy \"metal\", and cause people to be dead a bit. Barring a few good special effects, and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing, there's just nothing here.

{"value":"The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out. I have actually seen better acting in low budget porn. I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You watch yours (together): I wont leave you behind!<br /><br />The first action sequence shows how awful the production is, but its really kind of funny: Good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have fake HK MP5 sub-machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, to top it all off, they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M-16s!! I think they had a budget shortage for guns, not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys. Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell. You have to remove the pin/spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own. You can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter. Weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re-appear. When a gun is out of bullets, throwing it away is still pretty stupid. Unless you have no idea how to reload them.. Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes. I really cant believe movies like this are actually produced.

{"value":"I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I couldn't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over, it even tires me to write a review on it.<br /><br />Okay, #4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker. #5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares. Because of that Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is neither funny nor is it scary. What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox).<br /><br />The plot (Freddy killing Lisa's friends by using the dreams of Lisa's unborn child) has a good base but it just isn't enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because there isn't any) and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at. The screenplay must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself (let me say that I don't like cheese though, even if I am from Switzerland).

{"value":"Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2...... I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG!, I wish I'd stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)...

{"value":"This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film. They should have let it remain that way.<br /><br />What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus- What I'll Do to that Hungarian!<br /><br />The ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, let's fast forward to 300 years later, where Grable, just married to the Count Romero, faces a similar situation, when on her wedding night, there is an invasion by Hungarian soldiers.<br /><br />Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the entire wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news-an enraged Romero has annulled the marriage.<br /><br />This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran supporting player who is in it, died in 1949; this must have been his last film. What a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career.<br /><br />Walter Abel co-stars but he can do little with such poor writing.

{"value":"*spoliers* do not read any further if you haven't seen this movie<br /><br />Picking up after the depressing \"Phantasm II\" ended; The Tall Man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and new kid Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back, and not end up as slaves on the Tall Man's \"Red Planet\". This one gets really silly: the trio of thieves in the bright pink hearse were only there for comic relief, and the black karate chick (can't remember her name) was so irritating I couldn't wait to see if the Tall Man killed her character. This one sets it up to almost look like it was going to be Tim's character, who comes in late and ultimately is the hero, but ... it doesn't quite work out that way. By the very end of this story Liz is beheaded by the killer midgets, Mike gets a silver sphere implanted into his skull, the spheres get Reggie and the dwarfs get Tim, and there's no one left to stop The Tall Man. The bad guy wins - now how's that for a surprise twist at the end?<br /><br />This was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until '95, and the ending of this one was at the time final, and although it's disappointing and anticlimactic it was also a fitting and appropriate ending for this weird little series. But the fourth one changes this ending and adds nothing new but more bad jokes, and an even worse and more nonsensical ending ...<br /><br />*1/2 out of

{"value":"What the ........... is this ? This must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high, but this is too stupid to be true. I baught this film for 0.89$ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ?<br /><br />Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? Well actually, you couldn't possible care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. They didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director ( Stephen Carpenter -- I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors. Complete crap as well, but at least that one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! ( Who ?? ) Yeah that's right, the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She's the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ?

{"value":"I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison.<br /><br />A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world...or something. Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him? Usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close. Like I said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting. The problem was it wasn't really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb Seagal killed them all singlehandedly? I guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them.<br /><br />2 out of

{"value":"Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career

{"value":"You need to watch this show once to have seen them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife, at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her, she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully. In fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that I'll take a stab at one now.<br /><br />Episode 'Valentines Pay'<br /><br />Jims wife notices that all of Jims weekly pay has disappeared, he then explains to her he lost it at the casino. She screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is. Then on Valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a Ball (hence explaining the missing wages). She realizes 'Her' mistake and the usual 'Oh Jim, you're so lovely'. ..The end<br /><br />Another very obvious item is the fact that Jims character is based on Homer Simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant, when this is attempted with Human beings it does not work and Jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk. <br /><br />IMO the only reason that this is successful is simply because we're so many now in terms of Human beings with TVs, these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you'd get an audience.<br /><br

{"value":"The movie and acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante but the movie forgets it's suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie. The makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original Carlito's Way or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it. Not one of Carlito's close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie, they're not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier, wouldn't you think one of Carlito's long time friends would make an appearance? In the original, Carlito start's out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail. That's only a few month's between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! ***Semi Spoiler*** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending it's an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original. What happen to Gail?

{"value":"Why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of \"Beowulf\" I've been disappointed with in a year. But I have to say, the previous version (\"Beowulf & Grendel\", starring Gerald Butler) was far superior to this. That one was only a little disappointing. This one is a mess!!! <br /><br />What bugged me most? Was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason (Human sacrifices? Pointless love interest?), or the bad CGI, or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting? Even worse was the way they made beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible!!! And lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? <br /><br />And why did they continually remind us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film. He was tossed around by both monsters he fought, relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon. Even when he slugged the arrogant prince, he didn't knock him out. He was much too reliant on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like it. This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /><br />I'd like to end this on a positive note but I can't really think of one offhand.

{"value":"I wasn't sure how to rate this movie, since it was so bad it was actually very funny. I'm not a Gackt fan by any means, though he is talented, despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album.<br /><br />But on topic here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsensical it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films.<br /><br />The movie has almost no plot here, except it's just about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them.<br /><br />The action scenes were laughable. Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that's so laughably bad. Though Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was horribly done. Though the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie.<br /><br />It keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, or an action flick, or a horror, or a romance... what the hell.<br /><br />If this review is making you mad, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love?

{"value":"OK..... This is the third in the series of carnosaur. Lets star with the dinosaur puppets! In the start of the film you cant See the Dino's cause when the body count starts you can only See the Dino's eye vision, pretty smart to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance, the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body's after the Dino rampage, after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream, pretty creepy!!! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found! It pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can See that its just a guy with a hand puppet!? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist's attacks some truck cause they though It wash some weapons in there. 2. They where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-Rex in there! How did the t-Rex fit in there??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive=( 4.

{"value":"Simply, I found the TV show \"Mash\" trite, preachy, oh ever so \"politically correct\", repetitious, pretentious and biggest sin of all, and that is,? that it is (was) incredibly dull. You have Alan Alda as the main lead, \"(star)\", who is so in love with himself and his cleverness, that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, whom I'll happily admit had a certain panache and style to their character presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both singularly and compositely together is like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found dull, also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on. Seeing one show a year showed that to me. Jamie Farr was just low brow \"comedy\" and is not even worth really mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give it a (one) rating, which anyone reading this by now would be wondering, is that ratings of any sort is not only a subjective call, but a relative one. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is such crud. That relatively speaking, Mash had some production quality, (by television standards) of that era and today, and therefore it is deserved of a two.

{"value":"Every year I watch hundreds of films, including many low budget amateurish straight-to-DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time, many excellent, many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films I have ever seen  in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it.<br /><br />The day after, it seems like some kind of weird dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work out of a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' film, and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad its good'. However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you. Now, whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is, I will say Zombie Nation.<br /><br />Seriously  I think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one.","finished_norm":["everi","year","i","watch","hundr","of","film","includ","mani","low","budget","amateurish","straighttodvd","abomin","that","nobodi","in","their","right","mind","would","ever","want","to","see","i","have","see","thousand","of","film","in","my","time","mani","excel","mani","forgett","zombi","nation","i","will","rememb","forev","a","on","of","the","much","hopelessli","laughabl","horror","film","i","have","ever","see","in","fact","i","still","have","not","recov","from","the","experi","of","watch","itbr","br","the","dai","after","it","seem","like","some","kind","of","weird","dream","do","i","realli","see","what","i","think","i","see","why","do","the","polic","work","out","of","a","warehous","do","the","voodoo","priestess","realli","recommend","that","the","zombi","eat","cheeseburg","be","it","safe","be","it","safe","be","it","safe","br","br","i","would","not","recommend","zombi","nation","if","you","want","to","see","a","good","film","and","neither","would","i","recommend","it","a","so","bad","it","good","howev","if","you","be","entertain","by","the","prospect","of","watch","probabl","the","much","indefensibli","abysm","film","ever","thi","be","for","you","now","whenev","anyon","ask","me","what","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","be","i","will","sai","zombi","nationbr","br","serious","i","think","it","a","great","crime","to","make","a","bore","film","than","a","bad","on","and","ulli","lommel","deserv","credit","for","produc","a","film","that","actual","stun","you","with","it","ineptitud","he","realli","be","the","ed","wood","jr","of","the","digit","ag","and","i","for","on","ca","not","wait","to","see","if","he","make","anoth","film","a","consist","ridicul","a","thi","on"],"filtered":["everi","year","watch","hundr","film","includ","mani","low","budget","amateurish","straighttodvd","abomin","nobodi","right","mind","ever","want","see","see","thousand","film","time","mani","excel","mani","forgett","zombi","nation","rememb","forev","much","hopelessli","laughabl","horror","film","ever","see","fact","still","recov","experi","watch","itbr","br","dai","seem","like","kind","weird","dream","realli","see","think","see","polic","work","warehous","voodoo","priestess","realli","recommend","zombi","eat","cheeseburg","safe","safe","safe","br","br","recommend","zombi","nation","want","see","good","film","neither","recommend","bad","good","howev","entertain","prospect","watch","probabl","much","indefensibli","abysm","film","ever","thi","whenev","anyon","ask","wrong","film","ever","see","sai","zombi","nationbr","br","serious","think","great","crime","make","bore","film","bad","ulli","lommel","deserv","credit","produc","film","actual","stun","ineptitud","realli","ed","wood","jr","digit","ag","ca","wait","see","make","anoth","film","consist","ridicul","thi"],"filtered2":["everi","year","watch","hundr","includ","mani","low","budget","amateurish","straighttodvd","abomin","nobodi","right","mind","ever","want","see","see","thousand","time","mani","excel","mani","forgett","zombi","nation","rememb","forev","hopelessli","laughabl","horror","ever","see","fact","still","recov","experi","watch","itbr","dai","seem","like","kind","weird","dream","realli","see","think","see","polic","work","warehous","voodoo","priestess","realli","recommend","zombi","eat","cheeseburg","safe","safe","safe","recommend","zombi","nation","want","see","good","neither","recommend","bad","good","howev","entertain","prospect","watch","probabl","indefensibli","abysm","ever","whenev","anyon","ask","wrong","ever","see","zombi","nationbr","serious","think","great","crime","make","bore","bad","ulli","lommel","deserv","credit","produc","actual","stun","ineptitud","realli","ed","wood","jr","digit","ag","ca","wait","see","make","anoth","consist","ridicul"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,9,12,13,25,35,37,44,48,50,51,52,57,64,73,81,83,85,97,108,113,121,122,132,148,158,195,217,238,256,261,268,274,290,298,301,306,331,333,356,371,423,431,442,471,552,580,599,607,625,655,718,753,828,866,1055,1188,1324,1328,1376,1391,1393,1498,1555,1606,1845,2104,2420,2630,2708,3006,3988,4091,4516,5411,5671],"values":[2.0,1.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,9,12,13,25,35,37,44,48,50,51,52,57,64,73,81,83,85,97,108,113,121,122,132,148,158,195,217,238,256,261,268,274,290,298,301,306,331,333,356,371,423,431,442,471,552,580,599,607,625,655,718,753,828,866,1055,1188,1324,1328,1376,1391,1393,1498,1555,1606,1845,2104,2420,2630,2708,3006,3988,4091,4516,5411,5671],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,5.245601643755157,1.357228929984541,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,2.133457220525

{"value":"\"The Deadly Look of Love\" is essentially \"Fatal Attraction\" with a couple of twists added onto the back half. The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three Movies of the Week. It is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation, and it adds nothing fresh to the genre.<br /><br />Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund. Even though he has it all, he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a doe-eyed blonde from Cedar Falls, falls hard for Brett, and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large, luxurious home she shared with her new husband. When the police question Brett, he promptly points the finger at Janet. Following her arrest, Janet seems to get loonier by the minute - not that she was the picture of stability before. Her defense attorney (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it.<br /><br />Did she do it or didn't she? How will it end? You can find out the answers to these questions the next time \"The Deadly Look of Love\" airs on your local station.

{"value":"I'll keep this short as a movie like this doesn't deserve a full review.<br /><br />Given the setting, this movie could have been something really special. It could have been another \"28 days later\" or even a \"Blair Witch Project\"<br /><br />The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was really excited, directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although I don't think He managed to capture true eeriness of an empty London Underground.<br /><br />Characters were a big let down. Our \"heroine\" in this movie is a worthless piece of crap, and you really don't care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy, who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not).<br /><br />The main villain, is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when he is revealed I was really disappointed. I won't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.<br /><br />All in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark.<br /><br />Just to highlight how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain.

{"value":"You MUST be kidding!!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just some entry in the \"quirk of the month club\" of actors. Really, unless this is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on David Mamet-- terse, confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone (think Ben Stein) blandness--or a flat out dry comedy; this film has got to be in the running for a Rotten Tomato Award---or worse.<br /><br />As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey weren't enough, we've got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory.<br /><br />Adding to this already bizarre casting, are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, who look or sound like escapees from America's Next Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the kid, who pronounces the word \"been\" like \"bean\", which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film, we are analyzing his accent to guess if he's Canadian or not!! I think I laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious, and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans music for Mamet's \"The House of Games\". If taken as a spoof, the film is almost droll; if taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of

{"value":"The wonderful \"Z\" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after \"Butterfly\". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film.<br /><br />Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann ripped into him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so. Which is why this work smelt. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire. The supporting cast was not a help either.<br /><br />Oooooh... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done. It would be tough for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters casting her in \"Hairspray\" was a spark) although she has a nice singing voice.<br /><br />Hey, Pia, wherever you are...Hairspray may go on tour!
