{"value":"What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte's classic? I don't think I can improve on a comment I read below, so I'll just paraphrase it: \"Jane Eyre is a great great book, the screenwriter should read it sometime.\" It's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast. But pity the actors, because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes. The dialog that makes you understand the Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun...deleted from the script. The marriage proposal, the fortune teller...gone. The allusions, half joking, half sincerely felt, to Jane as a fairy sprite from olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despair...eliminated.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 (?) mini series with Timothy Dalton.","finished_norm":["what","be","franco","zeffirelli","think","be","hollywood","respons","for","thi","travesti","or","can","i","take","comfort","in","the","idea","that","someon","who","do","not","speak","english","a","a","languag","just","complet","miss","the","point","of","charlott","bront","classic","i","do","not","think","i","can","improv","on","a","comment","i","read","below","so","i","will","just","paraphras","it","jane","eyr","be","a","great","great","book","the","screenwrit","should","read","it","sometim","it","true","that","thi","movi","two","lead","be","sadli","miscast","but","piti","the","actor","becaus","the","screenwrit","leav","out","all","of","the","well","scene","the","dialog","that","make","you","understand","the","jane","and","rochest","have","a","meet","of","mind","and","a","share","sens","of","fundelet","from","the","script","the","marriag","propos","the","fortun","tellergon","the","allus","half","joke","half","sincer","feel","to","jane","a","a","fairi","sprite","from","old","england","come","to","rescu","rochest","in","hi","despaireliminatedbr","br","it","be","unfortun","that","zeffirelli","feel","the","ne","to","complet","rewrit","the","end","of","the","novel","and","jane","interact","with","the","river","famili","but","it","be","unforgiv","that","he","have","surgic","remov","the","love","from","on","of","the","well","love","stori","ever","writtenbr","br","do","yourself","a","favor","and","go","find","the","mini","seri","with","timothi","dalton"],"filtered":["franco","zeffirelli","think","hollywood","respons","thi","travesti","take","comfort","idea","someon","speak","english","languag","complet","miss","point","charlott","bront","classic","think","improv","comment","read","paraphras","jane","eyr","great","great","book","screenwrit","read","sometim","true","thi","movi","two","lead","sadli","miscast","piti","actor","becaus","screenwrit","leav","well","scene","dialog","make","understand","jane","rochest","meet","mind","share","sens","fundelet","script","marriag","propos","fortun","tellergon","allus","half","joke","half","sincer","feel","jane","fairi","sprite","old","england","come","rescu","rochest","hi","despaireliminatedbr","br","unfortun","zeffirelli","feel","ne","complet","rewrit","end","novel","jane","interact","river","famili","unforgiv","surgic","remov","love","well","love","stori","ever","writtenbr","br","favor","go","find","mini","seri","timothi","dalton"],"filtered2":["franco","zeffirelli","think","hollywood","respons","travesti","take","comfort","idea","someon","speak","english","languag","complet","miss","point","charlott","bront","classic","think","improv","comment","read","paraphras","jane","eyr","great","great","book","screenwrit","read","sometim","true","two","lead","sadli","miscast","piti","actor","becaus","screenwrit","leav","well","scene","dialog","make","understand","jane","rochest","meet","mind","share","sens","fundelet","script","marriag","propos","fortun","tellergon","allus","half","joke","half","sincer","feel","jane","fairi","sprite","old","england","come","rescu","rochest","despaireliminatedbr","unfortun","zeffirelli","feel","ne","complet","rewrit","end","novel","jane","interact","river","famili","unforgiv","surgic","remov","love","well","love","stori","ever","writtenbr","favor","go","find","mini","timothi","dalton"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,12,17,19,20,22,24,31,34,38,41,43,44,47,51,54,66,67,74,77,103,110,123,139,145,151,157,173,182,206,212,214,227,238,255,280,300,304,332,344,350,432,474,500,588,706,915,1067,1094,1110,1117,1124,1190,1266,1465,1478,1499,1527,1541,1665,1913,1998,2221,2295,2449,2458,2738,2811,2826,3106,3689,3932,4238,4723,4981,5767,6010,6337,7466,8228],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,12,17,19,20,22,24,31,34,38,41,43,44,47,51,54,66,67,74,77,103,110,123,139,145,151,157,173,182,206,212,214,227,238,255,280,300,304,332,344,350,432,474,500,588,706,915,1067,1094,1110,1117,1124,1190,1266,1465,1478,1499,1527,1541,1665,1913,1998,2221,2295,2449,2458,2738,2811,2826,3106,3689,3932,4238,4723,4981,5767,6010,6337,7466,8228],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,2.133457220525776,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,3.4279798616619646,3.6227786505458823,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,1.9486336368009016,1.9463902258768238,4.197164082437498,2.1290479736304078,2.2619070973220485,2.2939035841256437,4.69198042906518,2.8002454868101863,2.3360150694757706,2.4368824319140248,2.7365296724240786,5.19460

{"value":"While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout, and in fact got drawn back into crime. Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much more severe and never healed right. It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up, and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe. I know, I'm being nit picky, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this \"TRUE\" story, the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives, rather than being a cohesive flowing story.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.","finished_norm":["while","it","contain","fact","that","be","not","wide","report","it","be","not","exactli","the","truth","thei","take","a","lot","of","liberti","in","rearrang","event","exclud","peopl","and","us","set","that","do","not","meet","the","fact","of","their","live","in","the","there","be","much","than","just","bonni","clyd","and","wd","in","the","gang","at","variou","time","and","that","peopl","have","a","much","to","do","with","the","fact","a","that","includ","buck","and","blanch","go","to","convinc","clyd","to","go","straight","much","earli","than","the","on","shootout","and","in","fact","get","draw","back","into","crime","some","of","the","event","that","be","portrai","in","daylight","actual","take","place","at","night","bonni","wind","be","much","much","sever","and","never","heal","right","it","be","so","bad","she","have","to","be","carri","around","by","someon","until","it","heal","up","and","even","then","it","stiffen","up","so","she","walk","stiffli","clyd","conjur","walk","with","a","limp","becaus","while","in","prison","he","cut","off","a","big","toe","i","know","i","be","be","nit","picki","and","it","be","a","tv","movi","but","even","without","thi","factual","error","in","thi","true","stori","the","movi","move","too","fast","from","event","to","event","and","come","across","much","a","sever","separ","snapshot","of","their","live","rather","than","be","a","cohes","flow","storybr","br","i","have","recommend","read","a","book","or","see","a","documentari","if","you","want","to","get","close","to","the","truth"],"filtered":["contain","fact","wide","report","exactli","truth","thei","take","lot","liberti","rearrang","event","exclud","peopl","us","set","meet","fact","live","much","bonni","clyd","wd","gang","variou","time","peopl","much","fact","includ","buck","blanch","go","convinc","clyd","go","straight","much","earli","shootout","fact","get","draw","back","crime","event","portrai","daylight","actual","take","place","night","bonni","wind","much","much","sever","never","heal","right","bad","carri","around","someon","heal","even","stiffen","walk","stiffli","clyd","conjur","walk","limp","becaus","prison","cut","big","toe","know","nit","picki","tv","movi","even","without","thi","factual","error","thi","true","stori","movi","move","fast","event","event","come","across","much","sever","separ","snapshot","live","rather","cohes","flow","storybr","br","recommend","read","book","see","documentari","want","get","close","truth"],"filtered2":["contain","fact","wide","report","exactli","truth","take","lot","liberti","rearrang","event","exclud","peopl","us","set","meet","fact","live","bonni","clyd","wd","gang","variou","time","peopl","fact","includ","buck","blanch","go","convinc","clyd","go","straight","earli","shootout","fact","get","draw","back","crime","event","portrai","daylight","actual","take","place","night","bonni","wind","sever","never","heal","right","bad","carri","around","someon","heal","even","stiffen","walk","stiffli","clyd","conjur","walk","limp","becaus","prison","cut","big","toe","know","nit","picki","tv","even","without","factual","error","true","stori","move","fast","event","event","come","across","sever","separ","snapshot","live","rather","cohes","flow","storybr","recommend","read","book","see","documentari","want","get","close","truth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,8,9,17,22,23,26,31,34,37,39,42,52,56,63,72,82,97,98,109,116,121,125,139,145,151,160,164,172,210,266,275,294,295,298,301,303,304,316,350,462,469,470,478,503,542,548,576,621,624,711,753,758,852,942,990,997,1009,1407,1582,1789,1899,1911,1930,3217,3839,3940,4176,4371,5041,5284,5340,5358,5449,6778,8509],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,8,9,17,22,23,26,31,34,37,39,42,52,56,63,72,82,97,98,109,116,121,125,139,145,151,160,164,172,210,266,275,294,295,298,301,303,304,316,350,462,469,470,478,503,542,548,576,621,624,711,753,758,852,942,990,997,1009,1407,1582,1789,1899,1911,1930,3217,3839,3940,4176,4371,5041,5284,5340,5358,5449,6778,8509],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3324924169710188,2.814133962290301,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,8.218223169849034,2.0881990796736947,2.125691139326857,4.493325799357863,2.2190595059394194,2.2242236634876535,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.3722295531801256,2.3930275298746078,2.5001408943598484,2.687151791517189,2.74770297302

{"value":"Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /><br />International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs. The army commando team now have to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles.<br /><br />You look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film. That is pretty much it. The acting is only just acceptable from a few characters. The story is poor, with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This film came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this film looks to have come out 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. The dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and i do mean costumes. There are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempts at hiding this. A scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the creature. The is one good thing, which comes out of this film. The short running time. At only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether.<br /><br />\"It's like a Friday the 13th Nightmare.\" - Officer (Brian

{"value":"I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, i had listened to the original Broadway recording of it, and I really loved it! But when I saw this, I was like, what the heck?! This movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud! Who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />I really am a very huge fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did! The movie looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the heck decided to cut all of Meg's songs out of the movie?! <br /><br />I am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe were probably wondering: \"Who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?\" Well they had a right to say that if they did, they were probably mad at the fact that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie.<br /><br />Song and acting wise Mr. Kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text.<br /><br />So in short, if you want a good movie based on a

{"value":"... but the trouble of this production is that it's very far from a good musical.<br /><br />Granted, one can't always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty. It's deadly dull and uninventive (with one or two exceptions) and just after I watched it I couldn't recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole Another Hundred People from three listenings.<br /><br />It is also strangely un-theatrical. It takes place on an incredibly large stage (one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and does absolutely nothing with it. When there's supposed to be one person singing on-stage, that's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty. For me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />The fact remains, Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these no-talents can ever come close to.

{"value":"This is just flat out unwatchable. If there's a story in here somewhere, it's so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that's it's indiscernible. There's a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them. They pop their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod, well, that's what you get here. These folks are loud, obnoxious, violent, and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human humans, who stand around in their CGI spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take. These folks make Hillary Clinton seem like a right-wing extremist in comparison. They're friends with some vampires, or something...who cares.<br /><br />Then there's the camera work. Remember how everybody hated the thousand-cuts-a-minute crap from the recent Rolleball remake? The folks who made this movie LOVE that stuff.

{"value":"1st watched 12/24/2009  4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that doesn't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual-based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make Christmas happen for them. The three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to Washington D.C. to enlist the then President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, which makes the story kind of like a Disney \"animals on the run\" movie and doesn't quite fit here. At the ending, there isn't any details given as to how the President helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie, in my opinion. The movie does eventually bring tears, but it takes too long to get to this. The movie isn't supposed to have been an original TV movie(according to IMDb) but it has the obvious fade-outs that make it look this way  so I'm not sure their information is accurate. All in all, this is a simple movie(that could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas-like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance.","finished_norm":["st","watch","out","of","dirrobert","elli","miller","emot","christma","fluff","that","doe","not","realli","get","specif","enough","to","explain","how","the","real","stori","happen","in","thi","factualbas","incid","of","a","man","who","be","wrongli","put","in","jail","try","to","get","a","job","for","hi","famili","to","make","christma","happen","for","them","the","three","kid","in","the","famili","then","run","awai","from","home","on","a","trek","to","washington","dc","to","enlist","the","then","presid","of","the","unit","state","herbert","hoover","thi","trek","provid","some","side","stori","like","their","posit","encount","with","a","hobo","and","a","puppet","which","make","the","stori","kind","of","like","a","disnei","anim","on","the","run","movi","and","doe","not","quit","fit","here","at","the","end","there","be","not","ani","detail","give","a","to","how","the","presid","help","the","famili","and","thi","be","anoth","downpoint","to","the","movi","in","my","opinion","the","movi","doe","eventu","bring","tear","but","it","take","too","long","to","get","to","thi","the","movi","be","not","suppos","to","have","be","a","origin","tv","movieaccord","to","imdb","but","it","have","the","obviou","fadeout","that","make","it","look","thi","wai","so","i","be","not","sure","their","inform","be","accur","all","in","all","thi","be","a","simpl","moviethat","can","have","be","much","complex","with","a","happi","christmaslik","stori","but","blandli","plai","and","without","a","lot","of","substanc"],"filtered":["st","watch","dirrobert","elli","miller","emot","christma","fluff","doe","realli","get","specif","enough","explain","real","stori","happen","thi","factualbas","incid","man","wrongli","put","jail","try","get","job","hi","famili","make","christma","happen","three","kid","famili","run","awai","home","trek","washington","dc","enlist","presid","unit","state","herbert","hoover","thi","trek","provid","side","stori","like","posit","encount","hobo","puppet","make","stori","kind","like","disnei","anim","run","movi","doe","quit","fit","end","ani","detail","give","presid","help","famili","thi","anoth","downpoint","movi","opinion","movi","doe","eventu","bring","tear","take","long","get","thi","movi","suppos","origin","tv","movieaccord","imdb","obviou","fadeout","make","look","thi","wai","sure","inform","accur","thi","simpl","moviethat","much","complex","happi","christmaslik","stori","blandli","plai","without","lot","substanc"],"filtered2":["st","watch","dirrobert","elli","miller","emot","christma","fluff","doe","realli","get","specif","enough","explain","real","stori","happen","factualbas","incid","man","wrongli","put","jail","try","get","job","famili","make","christma","happen","three","kid","famili","run","awai","home","trek","washington","dc","enlist","presid","unit","state","herbert","hoover","trek","provid","side","stori","like","posit","encount","hobo","puppet","make","stori","kind","like","disnei","anim","run","doe","quit","fit","end","ani","detail","give","presid","help","famili","anoth","downpoint","opinion","doe","eventu","bring","tear","take","long","get","suppos","origin","tv","movieaccord","imdb","obviou","fadeout","make","look","wai","sure","inform","accur","simpl","moviethat","complex","happi","christmaslik","stori","blandli","plai","without","lot","substanc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,13,16,17,18,24,27,30,31,33,36,40,45,69,72,73,80,93,94,99,114,119,120,122,125,137,149,155,159,172,182,185,224,250,277,289,302,383,395,425,498,506,509,538,591,605,676,695,716,736,740,748,841,1043,1120,1128,1288,1434,1472,1481,1601,1662,1698,2014,2023,2277,2304,2455,2687,3944,5528,6061,6269,6586,7482,8181],"values":[3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,13,16,17,18,24,27,30,31,33,36,40,45,69,72,73,80,93,94,99,114,119,120,122,125,137,149,155,159,172,182,185,224,250,277,289,302,383,395,425,498,506,509,538,591,605,676,695,716,736,740,748,841,1043,1120,1128,1288,1434,1472,1481,1601,1662,1698,2014,2023,2277,2304,2455,2687,3944,5528,6061,6269,6586,7482,8181],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.2920765891153156,2.389902141215977,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,5.108214776042387,3.6459479802144523,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9951803900462557,2.035389827120098,4.16224563969396,2.056430207256609,2.4433074195966826,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2489347673732487,2.2242236634876535,4.587807168251287,2.3253197803590226,2.3074766467914385,2.300267965194495,2.50014

{"value":"Why in the world would someone make this piece of trash movie? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were stupid enough, but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy (Perhaps of all time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but no longer the screenwriter, which isn't a negative or a positive, considering he's just as untalented as the guy who wrote this one. The writing is too heavily reliant on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times at nausea. The acting is about on par with the last two Bloodbath movies, so naturally, it's some of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look godawful. The plot has become too complicated for it's own good, and was about some government experiment gone wrong and zombies being produced. Also featured is cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids that know how to time travel, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie it goes to outtakes, which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake. Only see this to make fun of it, because if you go into this with a serious mind, you might possibly kill yourself.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 95

{"value":"I thought this was a great idea but, boy, was it poorly executed. We do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are, but virtually no specifics about any of it works. The producers don't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a \"through-line.\" (Which is not to say they didn't try, but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the program's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera.)<br /><br />We see lots of things happening, but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why. There's little sense of who is who, or how the various production departments fit and work together. For instance, several times we hear about a problem of some sort -- one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and/or how it gets resolved. But instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else (generally, pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets.) <br /><br />Overall the film ends up feeling more

{"value":"We rented the DVD hoping for a good western. The film was pretty and the scenes reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the film.<br /><br />In the first part, why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner? Not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout.<br /><br />The bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers. At least keep us guessing. No character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee.<br /><br />Very long delay in much of anything happening.<br /><br />Absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in-laws. Even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy. even more ridiculous that Martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee. Wouldn't he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy? Just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail????!!!

{"value":"I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina)... I just couldn't watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed. I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. I just don't get how you can love that kind of movies! The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and I just don't think it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say \"Well, at least 'x' thing about it was good\".

{"value":"I watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed.<br /><br />Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours (or however long it actually was). From the beginning, every single element of this movie is unbelievable. This movie made me chuckle several times, but they were mainly out of shock that the director/writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together.<br /><br />The movie's focus is Gray (Graham) and her issues with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much in common.<br /><br />Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable, the director keeps taking Gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all. Being an LGBT individual, this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming-out process. (I'll be insulted if the writer's queer.) Had it not been for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was understandably forced), I would give it a negative 3 stars.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","movi","yesterdai","and","be","highli","disappointedbr","br","heather","graham","and","tom","cavanaugh","basic","have","to","carri","thi","awkwardli","unbeliev","script","for","five","hour","or","howev","long","it","actual","be","from","the","begin","everi","singl","elem","of","thi","movi","be","unbeliev","thi","movi","make","me","chuckl","sever","time","but","thei","be","mainli","out","of","shock","that","the","directorwrit","actual","expect","u","to","believ","the","mani","messi","scatter","elem","that","attempt","to","piec","thi","movi","togetherbr","br","the","movi","focu","be","grai","graham","and","her","issu","with","intimaci","thing","get","interest","when","she","realiz","that","she","and","her","brother","have","unexpectedli","wai","too","much","in","commonbr","br","interest","intrigu","howev","instead","of","unravel","thi","stori","into","someth","believ","and","palat","the","director","keep","take","grai","into","thi","ludicr","twist","that","never","actual","make","ani","sens","at","all","be","a","lgbt","individu","thi","movi","seem","to","echo","what","all","heterosexu","think","we","go","through","in","the","comingout","process","i","will","be","insult","if","the","writer","queer","have","it","not","be","for","the","cute","chemistri","between","cavanaugh","and","graham","which","by","the","wai","be","understand","forc","i","would","give","it","a","neg","star"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","yesterdai","highli","disappointedbr","br","heather","graham","tom","cavanaugh","basic","carri","thi","awkwardli","unbeliev","script","five","hour","howev","long","actual","begin","everi","singl","elem","thi","movi","unbeliev","thi","movi","make","chuckl","sever","time","thei","mainli","shock","directorwrit","actual","expect","u","believ","mani","messi","scatter","elem","attempt","piec","thi","movi","togetherbr","br","movi","focu","grai","graham","issu","intimaci","thing","get","interest","realiz","brother","unexpectedli","wai","much","commonbr","br","interest","intrigu","howev","instead","unravel","thi","stori","someth","believ","palat","director","keep","take","grai","thi","ludicr","twist","never","actual","make","ani","sens","lgbt","individu","thi","movi","seem","echo","heterosexu","think","go","comingout","process","insult","writer","queer","cute","chemistri","cavanaugh","graham","wai","understand","forc","give","neg","star"],"filtered2":["watch","yesterdai","highli","disappointedbr","heather","graham","tom","cavanaugh","basic","carri","awkwardli","unbeliev","script","five","hour","howev","long","actual","begin","everi","singl","elem","unbeliev","make","chuckl","sever","time","mainli","shock","directorwrit","actual","expect","u","believ","mani","messi","scatter","elem","attempt","piec","togetherbr","focu","grai","graham","issu","intimaci","thing","get","interest","realiz","brother","unexpectedli","wai","commonbr","interest","intrigu","howev","instead","unravel","stori","someth","believ","palat","director","keep","take","grai","ludicr","twist","never","actual","make","ani","sens","lgbt","individu","seem","echo","heterosexu","think","go","comingout","process","insult","writer","queer","cute","chemistri","cavanaugh","graham","wai","understand","forc","give","neg","star"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,8,12,17,27,29,30,31,33,35,42,50,52,53,58,60,77,85,91,99,100,112,113,130,134,147,152,173,174,177,212,218,286,287,316,338,381,405,435,443,479,504,508,571,619,621,709,759,806,855,896,1017,1132,1147,1210,1394,1492,1537,2051,2197,3115,3176,3231,3567,3612,3974,4799,4880,5012,5109,5128,5525,7596,8076,8563],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,8,12,17,27,29,30,31,33,35,42,50,52,53,58,60,77,85,91,99,100,112,113,130,134,147,152,173,174,177,212,218,286,287,316,338,381,405,435,443,479,504,508,571,619,621,709,759,806,855,896,1017,1132,1147,1210,1394,1492,1537,2051,2197,3115,3176,3231,3567,3612,3974,4799,4880,5012,5109,5128,5525,7596,8076,8563],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,5.136645922417841,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,3.676353282473182,1.9463902258768238,2.011190219103739,4.021185338082285,2.056430207256609,2.1405462403177813,2.2466628996789315,4.3043565130405606,2.2642139034199635,2.2443961816702407,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,2.458149992634611,2.5983793339432615,2.5940874818617203,2.780700890737216,2.8418901

{"value":"And the Oscar for the most under-rated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as Karloff, Lugosi, and Price, and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie.<br /><br />The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession myself I have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self-pity prone hypochondriac. Though other \"medical mistakes\" did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication... \"Well continue giving it to her\" Unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie. The plot is predictable with only few minor twists. The filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow.<br /><br />My recommendation - watch this once to see Frye and

{"value":"Extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. The action is at best average, a bit of nudity chucked in and yes Tia Carrera does use a body double! <br /><br />The set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case, the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making Lundgren the cop with Oriental values and Lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical, Lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. The action sequences are by the numbers and Lee(who would go on to make the excellent The Crow) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance. But given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in The Crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.<br /><br />Unless your a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies (think Cobra etc.)

{"value":"I like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story. This doesn't occur in this movie. It's a series of vignettes with no cohesion.<br /><br />There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses. This woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. She disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is vastly overplayed (I used to like the song). The dialogue is mostly concerned with food (pineapples, chef's salad and ordering drinks). I assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed.<br /><br />There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is purportedly a romance - it is no such thing. I just wonder why I didn't hit the Fast-forward. I kept waiting for something significant to happen  it doesn't. Maybe that's the only consolation to this movie - scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense.","finished_norm":["i","like","a","movi","that","have","at","littl","a","vestig","of","a","stori","thi","doe","not","occur","in","thi","movi","it","a","seri","of","vignett","with","no","cohesionbr","br","there","be","scene","of","a","person","collect","pineappl","can","a","woman","with","a","blond","wig","never","remov","her","sun","glass","thi","woman","shoot","at","other","peopl","at","the","begin","of","the","movi","and","we","never","find","out","why","she","disappear","complet","after","about","minut","there","be","anoth","coquettish","woman","who","endlessli","clean","a","man","apart","there","be","endless","scene","at","a","fast","food","joint","where","the","mama","papa","california","dream","be","vastli","overplai","i","us","to","like","the","song","the","dialogu","be","mostli","concern","with","food","pineappl","chef","salad","and","order","drink","i","assum","much","of","the","actor","gain","weight","dure","thi","movi","becaus","a","lot","of","fast","food","be","consumedbr","br","there","be","no","passion","in","thi","movi","becaus","there","be","no","stori","thi","be","purportedli","a","romanc","it","be","no","such","thing","i","just","wonder","why","i","do","not","hit","the","fastforward","i","keep","wait","for","someth","signific","to","happen","it","doe","not","mayb","that","the","onli","consol","to","thi","movi","scene","shift","so","rapidli","that","it","trick","you","into","assum","that","there","be","go","to","be","a","revel","to","all","the","nonsens"],"filtered":["like","movi","littl","vestig","stori","thi","doe","occur","thi","movi","seri","vignett","cohesionbr","br","scene","person","collect","pineappl","woman","blond","wig","never","remov","sun","glass","thi","woman","shoot","peopl","begin","movi","never","find","disappear","complet","minut","anoth","coquettish","woman","endlessli","clean","man","apart","endless","scene","fast","food","joint","mama","papa","california","dream","vastli","overplai","us","like","song","dialogu","mostli","concern","food","pineappl","chef","salad","order","drink","assum","much","actor","gain","weight","dure","thi","movi","becaus","lot","fast","food","consumedbr","br","passion","thi","movi","becaus","stori","thi","purportedli","romanc","thing","wonder","hit","fastforward","keep","wait","someth","signific","happen","doe","mayb","onli","consol","thi","movi","scene","shift","rapidli","trick","assum","go","revel","nonsens"],"filtered2":["like","littl","vestig","stori","doe","occur","vignett","cohesionbr","scene","person","collect","pineappl","woman","blond","wig","never","remov","sun","glass","woman","shoot","peopl","begin","never","find","disappear","complet","minut","anoth","coquettish","woman","endlessli","clean","man","apart","endless","scene","fast","food","joint","mama","papa","california","dream","vastli","overplai","us","like","song","dialogu","mostli","concern","food","pineappl","chef","salad","order","drink","assum","actor","gain","weight","dure","becaus","lot","fast","food","consumedbr","passion","becaus","stori","purportedli","romanc","thing","wonder","hit","fastforward","keep","wait","someth","signific","happen","doe","mayb","onli","consol","scene","shift","rapidli","trick","assum","go","revel","nonsens"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,11,14,17,18,19,22,23,29,38,41,42,45,53,56,59,70,72,73,94,103,117,134,147,153,163,175,239,248,328,331,388,439,510,542,572,607,667,874,892,905,920,985,1026,1203,1259,1320,1390,1437,1464,1495,1527,1746,1755,1777,2117,2254,2546,2600,2978,3036,3252,4024,4123,4132,4415,4546,4631,5003,5122,6516,6867,7811],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,11,14,17,18,19,22,23,29,38,41,42,45,53,56,59,70,72,73,94,103,117,134,147,153,163,175,239,248,328,331,388,439,510,542,572,607,667,874,892,905,920,985,1026,1203,1259,1320,1390,1437,1464,1495,1527,1746,1755,1777,2117,2254,2546,2600,2978,3036,3252,4024,4123,4132,4415,4546,4631,5003,5122,6516,6867,7811],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,2.430631986809635,3.9371420340352055,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.8162961064622165,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.8693254449200722,6.2840273587550515,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,2.2443961816702407,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.4000574358028657,2.3791142619576227,2.6593400337329487,2.689504733779216,3.1550424959247185,2.932274249550174,3.0914425013694116,3.2872346624216657,3.374440724508766,6.894223829612251,3.4933926673701317,3.68099128126493,3.6652429242967908,3.872882289075035,3.9

{"value":"Brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing. No one knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldn't be able to get boring. Unfortunately, while it starts off quite well, it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichés and predictable plot.<br /><br />There are some good things about it-Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, aloof and very creepy countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter here.<br /><br />It maintains a bit of a Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent.<br /><br />But overall, it just didn't manage to hold my interest

{"value":"By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. <br /><br />First, the story was \"moved outside,\" so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /><br />Second & Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! <br /><br />The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I've now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories. If you want to see a musical which includes a great \"cattle call\" audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, see it on stage.","finished_norm":["by","the","time","thi","film","be","releas","i","have","see","choru","line","on","stage","time","and","have","be","anticip","much","eagerli","the","longrumor","product","of","a","film","of","the","stori","my","wife","and","i","be","in","line","hour","befor","the","box","offic","open","on","the","dai","the","film","be","releas","it","be","not","just","a","disappoint","it","be","a","kick","in","the","abdomen","br","br","the","stori","be","move","outsid","so","to","speak","by","includ","scene","not","in","the","confin","of","the","theater","that","confin","be","a","larg","portion","of","the","mean","and","impact","of","the","stori","br","br","togeth","assign","your","own","order","on","of","the","origin","song","with","veri","dynam","danc","numb","be","remov","a","song","which","be","not","in","the","stage","product","be","add","sai","what","i","be","confus","br","br","the","onli","reason","i","give","thi","film","star","instead","of","be","my","admir","for","the","talent","and","hard","work","of","the","perform","i","have","now","see","choru","line","on","stage","time","and","would","not","mind","see","it","much","time","befor","i","die","it","be","superbli","write","with","wonder","music","and","heart","wrenchingli","true","stori","if","you","want","to","see","a","music","which","includ","a","great","cattl","call","audit","i","recommend","all","that","jazz","if","you","want","to","see","the","stori","of","a","choru","line","see","it","on","stage"],"filtered":["time","thi","film","releas","see","choru","line","stage","time","anticip","much","eagerli","longrumor","product","film","stori","wife","line","hour","befor","box","offic","open","dai","film","releas","disappoint","kick","abdomen","br","br","stori","move","outsid","speak","includ","scene","confin","theater","confin","larg","portion","mean","impact","stori","br","br","togeth","assign","order","origin","song","veri","dynam","danc","numb","remov","song","stage","product","add","sai","confus","br","br","onli","reason","give","thi","film","star","instead","admir","talent","hard","work","perform","see","choru","line","stage","time","mind","see","much","time","befor","die","superbli","write","wonder","music","heart","wrenchingli","true","stori","want","see","music","includ","great","cattl","call","audit","recommend","jazz","want","see","stori","choru","line","see","stage"],"filtered2":["time","releas","see","choru","line","stage","time","anticip","eagerli","longrumor","product","stori","wife","line","hour","befor","box","offic","open","dai","releas","disappoint","kick","abdomen","stori","move","outsid","speak","includ","scene","confin","theater","confin","larg","portion","mean","impact","stori","togeth","assign","order","origin","song","veri","dynam","danc","numb","remov","song","stage","product","add","confus","onli","reason","give","star","instead","admir","talent","hard","work","perform","see","choru","line","stage","time","mind","see","time","befor","die","superbli","write","wonder","music","heart","wrenchingli","true","stori","want","see","music","includ","great","cattl","call","audit","recommend","jazz","want","see","stori","choru","line","see","stage"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,11,15,17,19,30,37,48,51,65,69,79,88,95,100,105,107,118,132,142,152,171,174,175,187,190,238,242,263,270,275,276,293,298,299,301,304,327,328,344,424,427,439,492,516,564,587,614,654,669,791,869,1273,1527,1795,2270,2401,2415,2735,2960,3134,3812,3843,4602,5818,8215],"values":[6.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,11,15,17,19,30,37,48,51,65,69,79,88,95,100,105,107,118,132,142,152,171,174,175,187,190,238,242,263,270,275,276,293,298,299,301,304,327,328,344,424,427,439,492,516,564,587,614,654,669,791,869,1273,1527,1795,2270,2401,2415,2735,2960,3134,3812,3843,4602,5818,8215],"values":[3.934201232816368,3.7675747436216462,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,6.385268470052984,1.312380678011735,1.3364419891718522,2.975308642954861,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,3.893901213901217,2.0317223413467334,2.0323326556775485,2.1405462403177813,2.1765612129984904,8.575813594557582,4.70875905096179,2.253494045787767,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.373087554090762,2.456282578459816,2.3791142619576227,2.4732161909892554,5.116663665627972,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.902686292364678,2.731603554088023,2.7832848715031413,2.7884729505849193,2.9012296278682137,2.7819920465008363,2.7949961309240425,5.661952055802453,2.871119826396843,5.934838391705887,6.310084991849437,2.983093497946387,3.212973749990824,3.233054746047873,3.2872346624216657,3.6016814428070463,3.442099372982581,3.469984576472117,3.6105180246075443,3.553030933

{"value":"If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please don't give up on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and already I'm almost finished with book 10. I dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a sniff of justice. While \"Left Behind: the movie\" only vaguely follows the story of the \"Left Behind\" (the book), the characters aren't even close to accurate.<br /><br />A few examples: Rayford never acts on his feelings for Hattie (he is about to when he's informed of the vanishings); Buck Williams is a blonde haired, magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and a lot of the book details Rayford wondering if she 'survived'; Buck and Chloe don't meet until much later, at a meeting in New York, set up by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never 'in the book,' rather just in Rayford's flashback thoughts; the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that Rayford and Hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs... etc, etc, etc...<br /><br />And that's just from the first movie; they're about to release the third.

{"value":"I can't imagine anyone would ever, in a million years, want to watch this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the mainstream. I was trying to find out where I saw an actor before and this popped up. So, yeah, a kid stops playing little league because he doesn't like nukes, this prompts major media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war. The end. A fantasy, to be sure, but one so cockeyed it would make John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as the -ism that scares the hell out of us, this movie really has no relevance, except as an (innaccurate) look back at those times. The writing, acting, and film craft are similarly undeveloped. The reason I rated it as highly as I did was because I watched this movie around 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it, but I now realize that it doesn't quite cut mustard. So, if the law of large numbers holds true and someone eventually does decide to check out this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also much worse ones.

{"value":"From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics. Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable.

{"value":"This film is awful. The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge. The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive. It is mostly a photo-shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed, and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies.<br /><br />Aside from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters/Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building (and crushing Kate) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water.

{"value":"**WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER**<br /><br />If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter, this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama. Surprisingly enough, this movie has been copied and ripped-off several times over the years, although it's hard to fathom ANY filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama. Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here (although Mariel HAS improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney, and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking, smarmy bad guy of the piece.<br /><br />Veteran director Lamont Johnson can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear of a script, which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations. For example, the final sequence, where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead. Add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure, even though you're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it.

{"value":"\"Grey Matter\" AKA \"The Brain Machine\" but the video people thought better of that; the screen says 1972 but IMDb says 1977; it's that kind of movie. The government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine' project that has drafted four people - who turn out to be, roughly, a philosopher, a horny priest, a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts. In the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; MY s*** has better production values than this. It held my interest, though, just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing, dabbling in four-guys-in-a-room character drama. The answer: a tract about how science is inferior to God. Thanks a lot. It's like opening a Kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle. The priest is played by James \"Roscoe P. Coltrane\" Best, the philosopher by Gerald \"the Republican Simon\" McRaney. Also featuring very, very, very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity, this moves almost as slow as the Liberal

{"value":"I bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title \"Grey Matter\". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me. As the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.<br /><br />And yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it. Some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript I guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. It's actually kinda funny. After awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching \"Grey Matter\".<br /><br />I also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling. At one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a \"Scientific b*tch!\". It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that \"scientific b**tard!\". It just sounded very awkward to me.<br /><br />Someday this movie will disappear forever.

{"value":"Let's be honest here: the only reason anyone bought this, the only reason anyone reviewed this, and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because David Lynch made it and because you want to have David Lynch's children.

{"value":"I've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as I was by Ali McGraw's in this movie. God is she bothersome or what?! She says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, by contrast, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /><br />There is not much of a story. He's rich, she's wooden, they both have to Sacrifice A Lot for Love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, hers is called by his first name, in case you didn't notice the Difference in The Two of Them that They Overcame in the Name of Love. <br /><br />The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year. John Marley is fine as Wooden's father, but a Supporting Nomination? At least Ali didn't win. <br /><br />I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but then again, if it were up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in a lot more movies. She's certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /><br />I didn't even cry when she got sick, never occured to me to even feel sad. <br /><br />It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones looking like he was about 15, and the score is good.

{"value":"Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind. This show isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. The voice acting could've been better. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. Then there's the humor, or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! They just take these B-grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me. And finally, last and least, the music. It's just plain annoying. It sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn the TV off. If you've never watched this show then don't.

{"value":"Odd slasher movie from Producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's greatest success Band said that he would never make \"real killer films\" because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better - people killing each other is thus real and less fun. A nice philosophy and a true shame that Band, having destroyed the Full Moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this one also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Birth Rite' - both equally bland by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a 'murder club'. She - as one would obviously - does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly Ms Rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not.

{"value":"Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring film maker, lives in a battered NYC apartment and relies on his mother to help make the rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals)who may or may not be married but who Aldolpho would love to star in his movie. When Al unexpectedly gets a financial promise of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he's got it made. That is, until Joe takes Al along on an adventure to steal a Porsche for part of the financial backing. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And, will Angelica star in the film? This is, in this viewer's opinion, an awful movie. The script is abysmal, with a plot that wanders willy nilly. Beals practically snarls all of her lines and Buscemi, though likable, is nondescript. There is a good deal of distasteful material and unsavory characters to boot. Finally, the production values are very poor, too, making the film look second rate at all times. If you have time on your hands, it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie.

{"value":"The movie was TERRIBLE!!! Easily the worst movie I have seen in the past few years. One of those movies I will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question \"What is the worst movie you have seen?\" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me...I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience like we are r*tarded. There is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. They didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.

{"value":"The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring.

{"value":"REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost ancestor to the classic George A. Romero zombie flicks. This is a low-budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time... but seems awfully routine these days. There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers... and a close-up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I'm sure it had audiences gasping. The story concerns the search for the secret of mind control... ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army... but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves. The movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail's pace so it seems feature-length, believe me! There really isn't much to recommend it... you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star \"wading\" through a \"swamp\". The ending is interesting... so I'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap \"4 movies on 1 DVD\" compilation at Wal-Mart for five bucks.
