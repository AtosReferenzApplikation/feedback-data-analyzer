{"value":"I never finished this movie for a reason, it was dreadful and thats just the acting. I wasn't even sure what the film was about tbh it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful. I mean ususally i like some nude in a film (lol) but it was just sick because of what was happening. ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities. This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it.

{"value":"There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled \"Baby Buggy Bunny\" that was EXACTLY this plot. Baby-faced Finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into Bug's rabbit hole. He dressed up as a baby to get into Bugg's hole to retrieve the money. The scene in \"Little Man\" where he's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon. This was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much an entire movie. If you are really interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It's was much more original the first time (1954). Plus you'll get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to

{"value":"'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. Don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.","finished_norm":["major","payn","be","a","film","about","a","major","who","make","life","a","live","hell","for","hi","small","group","of","boi","in","the","marin","thi","film","doe","not","realli","have","a","lot","to","offer","but","it","provid","sever","hilari","moment","that","be","wellworth","a","watch","do","not","expect","it","to","be","a","memor","film","howev","just","expect","to","laugh","your","wai","through","the","film","and","at","the","expens","of","other","peopl","the","confront","between","major","payn","and","the","chubbi","boi","be","hilari","and","that","realli","all","i","rememb","about","the","film","except","for","the","boi","want","reveng","on","major","payn","again","it","be","not","a","great","film","and","it","be","probabl","well","watch","on","a","raini","dai","when","you","ne","some","laughter"],"filtered":["major","payn","film","major","make","life","live","hell","hi","small","group","boi","marin","thi","film","doe","realli","lot","offer","provid","sever","hilari","moment","wellworth","watch","expect","memor","film","howev","expect","laugh","wai","film","expens","peopl","confront","major","payn","chubbi","boi","hilari","realli","rememb","film","except","boi","want","reveng","major","payn","great","film","probabl","well","watch","raini","dai","ne","laughter"],"filtered2":["major","payn","major","make","life","live","hell","small","group","boi","marin","doe","realli","lot","offer","provid","sever","hilari","moment","wellworth","watch","expect","memor","howev","expect","laugh","wai","expens","peopl","confront","major","payn","chubbi","boi","hilari","realli","rememb","except","boi","want","reveng","major","payn","great","probabl","well","watch","raini","dai","ne","laughter"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,13,18,20,23,33,37,51,72,75,110,113,116,130,132,133,148,188,232,282,290,316,363,394,404,410,507,632,695,871,1074,1733,1743,1834,4060,4335,7075],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,13,18,20,23,33,37,51,72,75,110,113,116,130,132,133,148,188,232,282,290,316,363,394,404,410,507,632,695,871,1074,1733,1743,1834,4060,4335,7075],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9218995441445863,2.2635883139467947,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.7139899308309823,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,2.1290479736304078,2.1521782565202803,2.2466628996789315,4.528427806839927,2.253494045787767,2.3212364753796515,2.3018654096236517,2.5378812223426954,2.6102777977348763,8.7565536876541,2.8612813773965557,2.878207028279898,3.0349689855553557,3.0967381889441223,12.567979122128973,3.2070272508030975,3.365138331846453,7.083839416529584,3.6715125373103863,3.9954846111673676,4.110553940952155,4.760735085628657,4.724033718778229,4.77960356993304,5.907203395474402,5.9370563586240825,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035198E-4,2.5580823473939307E-4,2.558713957686224E-4,2.5581995743348244E-4,2.558441677579872E-4,2.5580682428995955E-4,2.5588638376375974E-4,2.557687644066795E-4,2.5580828880184843E-4,2.560726389488425E-4,2.5810450080632446E-4,2.558087113309913E-4,2.5605097834607805E-4,2.560776544404392E-4,2.5596132504838103E-4,2.558209650712687E-4,2.559089773770747E-4,2.5602940901184947E-4,2.558341720046745E-4,2.5583323664955863E-4,2.5606339753655283E-4,2.558588685280095E-4,2.558592557482336E-4,2.5602316192690794E-4,2.558342642905023E-4,2.5608071520047084E-4,2.558982858246215E-4,2.5580766142005993E-4,2.559236336818261E-4,2.560017452638825E-4,2.558601235571695E-4,2.559971566675944E-4,2.5612284488059524E-4,2.563605665947128E-4,2.5589784362518934E-4,2.55820809911798E-4,2.559130477609908E-4,2.558467909040109E-4,2.5576903739242454E-4,2.5583409277699467E-4,2.560904822574155E-4,2.559500005077446E-4,2.559977400410072E-4,2.557817669888662E-4,2.558341578291235E-4,2.5582071371340595E-4,2.5590730670555515E-4,2.559516813523955E-4,2.5589963502432053E-4,2.558590744800586E-4,2.5582134633837355E-4,2.5634548273227814E-4,2.5588571835822855E-4,2.558340991922593E-4,2.5588434799543206E-4,2.558079231460725E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539957E-4,2.5582170547880085E-4,2.558077771243864E-4,2.5601242948243737E-4,2.5590965967558344E-4,2.558076701900188E-4,2.5578166277759047E-4,2.557559411059886E-4,2.559871849625101E-4,2.5582020202291356E-4,2.5593648837176627E-4,2.560115992428352E-4,2.558954517621165E-4,2.558344380360487E-4,2.5578199809030594E-4,2.5584743185131737E-4,2.5578186032295384E-4,2.5579528334132145E-4,2.55782005329574E-4,2.5594804359407825E-4,2.5587186526541906E-4,2.5580801162741436E-4,2.5583279142898734E-4]}}

{"value":"I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent! The film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest.<br /><br />Saif has over acted. Kareena has improved her figure, but is not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. May I say the role wasn't good..<br /><br />Great deal of cheapness is filled in. Wondered if that was supposed to be the \"comedy part\" of the movie. Just because last few movies were flops does that mean Yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish? It has a history of so many good films. <br /><br />Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.","finished_norm":["i","have","never","think","the","standard","of","yashraj","film","would","ever","degrad","to","such","a","extent","the","film","have","a","nonsens","storylin","which","catch","no","interestbr","br","saif","have","over","act","kareena","have","improv","her","figur","but","be","not","a","good","actress","anywai","akshai","be","good","anil","be","conjur","good","mai","i","sai","the","role","be","not","goodbr","br","great","deal","of","cheap","be","fill","in","wonder","if","that","be","suppos","to","be","the","comedi","part","of","the","movi","just","becaus","last","few","movi","be","flop","doe","that","mean","yashraj","film","should","make","thi","kind","of","rubbish","it","have","a","histori","of","so","mani","good","film","br","br","overal","i","be","total","disappoint","with","the","movi"],"filtered":["never","think","standard","yashraj","film","ever","degrad","extent","film","nonsens","storylin","catch","interestbr","br","saif","act","kareena","improv","figur","good","actress","anywai","akshai","good","anil","conjur","good","mai","sai","role","goodbr","br","great","deal","cheap","fill","wonder","suppos","comedi","part","movi","becaus","last","movi","flop","doe","mean","yashraj","film","make","thi","kind","rubbish","histori","mani","good","film","br","br","overal","total","disappoint","movi"],"filtered2":["never","think","standard","yashraj","ever","degrad","extent","nonsens","storylin","catch","interestbr","saif","act","kareena","improv","figur","good","actress","anywai","akshai","good","anil","conjur","good","mai","role","goodbr","great","deal","cheap","fill","wonder","suppos","comedi","part","becaus","last","flop","doe","mean","yashraj","make","kind","rubbish","histori","mani","good","overal","total","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,12,18,21,22,39,42,44,46,50,51,61,88,122,127,128,144,149,175,184,187,351,355,386,412,415,468,499,512,515,553,616,905,1098,1117,1956,2353,2486,2759,2975,3202,3821,4291,5611],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,12,18,21,22,39,42,44,46,50,51,61,88,122,127,128,144,149,175,184,187,351,355,386,412,415,468,499,512,515,553,616,905,1098,1117,1956,2353,2486,2759,2975,3202,3821,4291,5611],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.714457859969082,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,2.0317223413467334,2.2489347673732487,2.4359679371086367,2.3409902041158843,2.2931108769894046,2.3253197803590226,2.3791142619576227,2.496249838866882,2.4732161909892554,3.0135689919434205,3.0316467233633775,3.0433232530252132,3.107414446935464,3.1588018988486244,3.304513710030018,3.3814747511661465,3.369778711402955,3.3956930001684253,3.454678155189441,3.5173618574831282,3.9121030022283168,4.186539847930077,4.181290492043933,4.85885294158718,5.102830579804232,5.143104478942172,5.7959777603641776,5.521540914662417,5.999576715605417,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278283E-4,2.505862069158131E-4,2.5064807858603353E-4,2.505976903047262E-4,2.506214064035924E-4,2.505848252590656E-4,2.5066276061866855E-4,2.5054754232407134E-4,2.505862598746463E-4,2.508452136206051E-4,2.5283559887802126E-4,2.5058667377834775E-4,2.5082399519387317E-4,2.5085012672676965E-4,2.5073617206405766E-4,2.505986773727581E-4,2.5068489300962495E-4,2.5080286617253593E-4,2.5061161470196693E-4,2.5061069844103874E-4,2.508361608610074E-4,2.506358070744792E-4,2.5063618639005247E-4,2.5079674661457346E-4,2.5061170510388677E-4,2.508531250049423E-4,2.506744197127899E-4,2.505856453001279E-4,2.5069925012294775E-4,2.507757671478342E-4,2.5063703648367747E-4,2.507712722224067E-4,2.5089439465660816E-4,2.5112726355820133E-4,2.506739865403452E-4,2.505985253806877E-4,2.506888803013838E-4,2.506239760011385E-4,2.5054780973712956E-4,2.506115370916281E-4,2.5086269267877027E-4,2.5072507870075743E-4,2.507718436869292E-4,2.505602794736537E-4,2.506116008157933E-4,2.50598431146074E-4,2.506832564429229E-4,2.507267252329182E-4,2.50675741370145E-4,2.506360088222566E-4,2.505990508567381E-4,2.511124876152885E-4,2.50662108796618E-4,2.506115433759326E-4,2.5066076640818544E-4,2.505859016833081E-4,0.98019445678154,2.50624997268677E-4,2.5059940266573095E-4,2.50585758642485E-4,2.50786233260484E-4,2.506855613798026E-4,2.5058565389105827E-4,2.5056017738972995E-4,2.505349807961613E-4,2.5076150407809297E-4,2.5059792990114835E-4,2.5071184239933196E-4,2.5078541996925843E-4,2.506716435043773E-4,2.5061187530261986E-4,2.505605058574261E-4,2.5062460386425056E-4,2.5056037090243435E-4,2.505735199054816E-4,2.505605129489129E-4,2.507231617352094E-4,2.5064853849859876E-4,2.505859883584062E-4,2.50610262309128E-4]}

Forget the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot-holes. This wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.<br /><br />What a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we've had Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director).

{"value":"I just finished a marathon of this series, and it became agonising to watch as it progressed. From the fictionalising of the historical elements, to O'Herlihy's awful accent in later episodes, the show just slumps the further it goes. If you are looking for some low quality production generalised WW2 fluff, then I could recommend season 1, but avoid anything after that, it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera, with

I couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes. I was getting bored. \"The Animal\" is an alright film. I do usually enjoy Adam Sandler films that have the same plot.

{"value":"\"Giant\" is one of the most boring, overly-long Hollywood contraptions ever. Many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production. A central notion to this movie, that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land, is absurd, and I know this because I'm from Houston.

{"value":"It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie, hardly worth your money...

{"value":"\"The Second Coming Of Suzanne\" is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated, yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other movies of this type, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot. However, the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention.<br /><br />The video box states that this film is \"one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film.\" Yeah...sure. It's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile.

{"value":"This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then blackmails them for money. One of the victims is a candidate for DA, which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife. Another is a plastic surgeon, also married, and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too! Meanwhile, the evil lesbian's girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around. It ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven. The women get naked a lot too, mostly in situations that stretch reality. bad bad

{"value":"I'm a big fan of the old westerns, and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy. fallen but virtuous woman, bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation, etc. I can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young \"actor\" who plays Granger's son.

{"value":"I don't know what would be so great about this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one ? First of all there is no story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />You are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above. But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money ?

{"value":"This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes, as a family movie should, and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing. Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie, then maybe it would be better. Hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There's really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watch this movie, please proceed to them.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","doe","not","realli","promot","kid","to","be","nice","and","have","well","attitud","a","a","famili","movi","should","and","thi","would","not","be","consid","famili","anywai","becaus","it","have","some","thing","in","it","that","child","should","not","be","see","not","the","well","abc","famili","film","if","you","ask","me","if","there","be","littl","sexual","theme","in","the","movi","then","mayb","it","would","be","well","hollywood","be","not","do","anyth","to","make","a","movi","well","by","add","in","sexual","situat","there","realli","no","reason","for","them","at","littl","thi","be","a","tv","movi","i","would","not","want","to","wast","my","monei","on","thi","garbag","by","rent","it","if","you","have","other","thing","to","do","other","than","watch","thi","movi","pleas","proce","to","them"],"filtered":["thi","movi","doe","realli","promot","kid","nice","well","attitud","famili","movi","thi","consid","famili","anywai","becaus","thing","child","see","well","abc","famili","film","ask","littl","sexual","theme","movi","mayb","well","hollywood","anyth","make","movi","well","add","sexual","situat","realli","reason","littl","thi","tv","movi","want","wast","monei","thi","garbag","rent","thing","watch","thi","movi","pleas","proce"],"filtered2":["doe","realli","promot","kid","nice","well","attitud","famili","consid","famili","anywai","becaus","thing","child","see","well","abc","famili","ask","littl","sexual","theme","mayb","well","hollywood","anyth","make","well","add","sexual","situat","realli","reason","littl","tv","want","wast","monei","garbag","rent","thing","watch","pleas","proce"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,13,14,18,20,22,29,37,89,95,104,114,126,163,172,180,182,262,299,300,306,317,346,386,473,519,534,661,702,1476,1822,1878,4151],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,13,14,18,20,22,29,37,89,95,104,114,126,163,172,180,182,262,299,300,306,317,346,386,473,519,534,661,702,1476,1822,1878,4151],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,2.2635883139467947,2.2350163994518417,1.2153159934048174,4.661380160092228,1.2979240167361772,2.6390769554676132,1.4876543214774305,1.9940046109572438,2.0323326556775485,2.0728240170322856,2.4433074195966826,2.2391270689902285,2.4000574358028657,2.5001408943598484,2.7097314792693545,8.209589017272236,2.726701583487816,2.7949961309240425,2.932274249550174,2.8739486825973213,2.8529247828056143,3.023389038124396,3.0433232530252132,3.335489637924323,7.1228922612302945,3.4933926673701317,3.5727776966246974,3.6466665387238555,4.589376833631972,4.789173020949191,4.828393734102471,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7310929654841826E-4,2.728672805936191E-4,2.729346536330478E-4,2.7287978503727256E-4,2.7290560987210105E-4,2.7286577608575313E-4,2.7295064113039654E-4,2.728251781086751E-4,2.7286733826132936E-4,2.731493170874148E-4,2.7531667741558343E-4,2.7286778896761063E-4,2.7312621200724265E-4,2.7315466704635663E-4,2.7303058001336346E-4,2.728808598712506E-4,2.729747414406556E-4,2.731032042820177E-4,2.7289494753346795E-4,2.72893949802464E-4,2.731394593944328E-4,2.7292129099019605E-4,2.729217040329178E-4,2.730965405986481E-4,2.7289504597354707E-4,2.7315793191883903E-4,2.729633369022279E-4,2.728666690414245E-4,2.7299037512823075E-4,2.730736957257882E-4,2.7292262971329967E-4,2.7306880113045923E-4,2.7320287109470077E-4,2.734564457215512E-4,2.7296286521390765E-4,2.7288069436468324E-4,2.7297908326566093E-4,2.7290840794747505E-4,2.7282546929898E-4,2.7289486302234356E-4,2.7316835031006325E-4,2.730185002747632E-4,2.730694234072083E-4,2.7283904779213384E-4,2.7289493241259405E-4,2.7288059175112334E-4,2.729729593573119E-4,2.730202932096524E-4,2.729647760758073E-4,2.7292151067653895E-4,2.728812665638584E-4,2.7344035596381686E-4,2.729499313510653E-4,2.72894869865422E-4,2.7294846960308804E-4,2.728669482211209E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.7290952002183625E-4,2.728816496542302E-4,2.7286679246170826E-4,2.7308509244124303E-4,2.72975469239504E-4,2.7286667839622437E-4,2.7283893663133615E-4,2.728114996624306E-4,2.730581644437551E-4,2.728800459376028E-4,2.7300408705697467E-4,2.730842068355755E-4,2.7296031384501637E-4,2.72895231305637E-4,2.7283929430500103E-4,2.7290909163753957E-4,2.728391473503779E-4,2.728534655075829E-4,2.728393020270331E-4,2.7301641286068515E-4,2.7293515443910785E-4,2.7286704260300493E-4,2.728934748915345E-4]}}
{"value":"Not the best of actors' movies.The director has concentrated on projected actor's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer. May be hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it.But definitely it's not worth for neutral audience.The fight sequences are a total comedy.The dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic. The music is average.This film was the biggest flop for the actor. Inspite of the hype created over the movie, the movie failed miserably. Don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time. You can watch some cartoon instead.A good movie buff cannot digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.","finished_norm":["not","the","well","of","actor","moviesth","director","have","concentr","on","project","actor","stardom","rather","than","give","a","good","entertain","mai","be","hero","himself","hi","famili","and","hi","sincer","fan","can","enjoi","itbut","definit","it","not","worth","for","neutral","audienceth","fight","sequenc","be","a","total","comedyth","danc","move","in","the","song","sequenc","be","pathet","the","music","be","averagethi","film","be","the","big","flop","for","the","actor","inspit","of","the","hyp","creat","over","the","movi","the","movi","fail","miser","do","not","even","think","of","watch","thi","move","even","if","you","want","to","kill","time","you","can","watch","some","cartoon","insteada","good","movi","buff","cannot","digest","thi","crap","for","hour"],"filtered":["well","actor","moviesth","director","concentr","project","actor","stardom","rather","give","good","entertain","mai","hero","hi","famili","hi","sincer","fan","enjoi","itbut","definit","worth","neutral","audienceth","fight","sequenc","total","comedyth","danc","move","song","sequenc","pathet","music","averagethi","film","big","flop","actor","inspit","hyp","creat","movi","movi","fail","miser","even","think","watch","thi","move","even","want","kill","time","watch","cartoon","insteada","good","movi","buff","digest","thi","crap","hour"],"filtered2":["well","actor","moviesth","director","concentr","project","actor","stardom","rather","give","good","entertain","mai","hero","famili","sincer","fan","enjoi","itbut","definit","worth","neutral","audienceth","fight","sequenc","total","comedyth","danc","move","song","sequenc","pathet","music","averagethi","big","flop","actor","inspit","hyp","creat","fail","miser","even","think","watch","move","even","want","kill","time","watch","cartoon","insteada","good","buff","digest","crap","hour"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,12,20,30,37,41,46,58,76,82,118,140,160,174,182,184,195,200,215,219,233,275,313,328,349,362,375,392,492,602,653,659,1330,1589,1956,2221,2326,2507,4923,5773,6278,7151],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,12,20,30,37,41,46,58,76,82,118,140,160,174,182,184,195,200,215,219,233,275,313,328,349,362,375,392,492,602,653,659,1330,1589,1956,2221,2326,2507,4923,5773,6278,7151],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,4.70627975028631,1.655771293751733,1.865701314626681,2.1337665533324026,2.020196584395323,2.354379525480895,2.317169775997098,2.3722295531801256,2.456282578459816,2.7365296724240786,2.496249838866882,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,2.605934685587711,2.5792094178355414,2.8377834061292515,5.566569743006283,2.907069060519773,3.1550424959247185,6.113673944383873,3.058539100262467,3.2597778161886266,3.0670934723591254,3.6016814428070463,3.506637894120152,3.9911462095687695,3.6405503117064195,4.370968887063596,4.662879295624898,4.85885294158718,5.02684467282631,5.089758498236879,5.156897801074508,6.137727054086234,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651712E-4,2.3166917872259976E-4,2.3172637963242865E-4,2.3167979521786176E-4,2.3170172096235683E-4,2.3166790136863876E-4,2.317399533022822E-4,2.316334329633869E-4,2.3166922768351236E-4,2.3190863272655842E-4,2.3374876022784927E-4,2.3166961034116847E-4,2.3188901610218278E-4,2.3191317493693832E-4,2.318078228369683E-4,2.3168070777104298E-4,2.3176041489471837E-4,2.318694821338904E-4,2.3169266844704967E-4,2.3169182135566606E-4,2.3190026336973309E-4,2.3171503451076988E-4,2.3171538519139352E-4,2.3186382454808482E-4,2.3169275202442925E-4,2.3191594687179613E-4,2.3175073223857318E-4,2.3166865950389987E-4,2.3177368817377573E-4,2.3184442884434942E-4,2.317161711105164E-4,2.3184027324578305E-4,2.31954101032096E-4,2.321693904043488E-4,2.3175033176679247E-4,2.31680567253021E-4,2.3176410118143972E-4,2.317040965781598E-4,2.3163368018913947E-4,2.3169259669560065E-4,2.3192479227141045E-4,2.3179756692385693E-4,2.318408015698206E-4,2.3164520857154718E-4,2.316926556091586E-4,2.3168048013228195E-4,2.317589018742355E-4,2.3179908915749512E-4,2.3175195412256184E-4,2.317152210283858E-4,2.316810530603068E-4,2.321557299136075E-4,2.3173935068699473E-4,2.3169260250549607E-4,2.3173810963694042E-4,2.3166889653243198E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.317050407490893E-4,2.316813783108521E-4,2.3166876428991787E-4,2.318541048586514E-4,2.3176103280889666E-4,2.3166866744629146E-4,2.316451141940511E-4,2.3162181971902592E-4,2.3183124250942028E-4,2.3168001672688664E-4,2.317853298453748E-4,2.3185335296367437E-4,2.317481656091851E-4,2.3169290937467287E-4,2.3164541786535977E-4,2.3170467704319544E-4,2.3164529309826871E-4,2.3165744946862315E-4,2.3164542442150247E-4

{"value":"Admittedly, I watched this piece with already VERY low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego.<br /><br />This was the first cartoon movie that I watched that was 100 per cent humor free. It is rude, offensive, redneck and blatantly anti- women. As such, it is a creation befitting Bohlen, but the average viewer will be rather put off by it.

{"value":"The first one was the best. The second one sucked because the dialog was terrible. Although, the storyline wasn't so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I dosed off a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, wasn't good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (But that's based on her script). All the characters there were not that good. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan doesn't do those things which is good for him.","finished_norm":["the","on","be","the","well","the","on","suck","becaus","the","dialog","be","terribl","although","the","storylin","be","not","so","bad","in","fact","all","stori","line","be","good","and","bad","throughout","the","movi","i","dose","off","a","few","time","i","know","that","jacki","chan","be","a","great","martial","art","expertis","but","not","a","good","actor","in","rush","hour","chri","tucker","too","be","not","good","and","zhang","ziyi","what","can","i","sai","a","few","line","terribl","act","but","that","base","on","her","script","all","the","charact","there","be","not","that","good","but","some","of","the","thing","i","like","in","rush","hour","be","alwai","the","action","and","littl","sex","scene","i","know","that","jacki","chan","doe","not","do","that","thing","which","be","good","for","him"],"filtered":["well","suck","becaus","dialog","terribl","although","storylin","bad","fact","stori","line","good","bad","throughout","movi","dose","time","know","jacki","chan","great","martial","art","expertis","good","actor","rush","hour","chri","tucker","good","zhang","ziyi","sai","line","terribl","act","base","script","charact","good","thing","like","rush","hour","alwai","action","littl","sex","scene","know","jacki","chan","doe","thing","good"],"filtered2":["well","suck","becaus","dialog","terribl","although","storylin","bad","fact","stori","line","good","bad","throughout","dose","time","know","jacki","chan","great","martial","art","expertis","good","actor","rush","hour","chri","tucker","good","zhang","ziyi","line","terribl","act","base","script","charact","good","thing","like","rush","hour","alwai","action","littl","sex","scene","know","jacki","chan","doe","thing","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,9,10,14,17,18,19,20,21,22,26,29,41,51,77,97,107,129,166,174,197,237,254,334,382,421,432,438,515,1140,1364,1386,3008,3441,3676,5097,7386],"values":[1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,9,10,14,17,18,19,20,21,22,26,29,41,51,77,97,107,129,166,174,197,237,254,334,382,421,432,438,515,1140,1364,1386,3008,3441,3676,5097,7386],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.3930723249613526,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.6649848339420377,2.6390769554676132,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.9463902258768238,2.0545557924622586,4.287906797278791,2.4106958340079214,4.884774065938707,4.912565156919632,2.558331832813986,2.640097787510554,2.889652074525771,2.942840385588056,3.235085203598255,3.2597778161886266,3.235085203598255,3.1797351085150902,3.3956930001684253,4.558366596889411,8.872703292652895,4.715065048795469,5.390512652256013,11.756431717202299,11.645292014892677,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651712E-4,2.3166917872259976E-4,2.3172637963242865E-4,2.3167979521786176E-4,2.3170172096235683E-4,2.3166790136863876E-4,2.317399533022822E-4,2.316334329633869E-4,2.3166922768351236E-4,2.3190863272655842E-4,2.3374876022784927E-4,2.3166961034116847E-4,2.3188901610218278E-4,2.3191317493693832E-4,2.318078228369683E-4,2.3168070777104298E-4,2.3176041489471837E-4,2.318694821338904E-4,2.3169266844704967E-4,2.3169182135566606E-4,2.3190026336973309E-4,2.3171503451076988E-4,2.3171538519139352E-4,2.3186382454808482E-4,2.3169275202442925E-4,2.3191594687179613E-4,2.3175073223857318E-4,2.3166865950389987E-4,2.3177368817377573E-4,2.3184442884434942E-4,2.317161711105164E-4,2.3184027324578305E-4,2.31954101032096E-4,2.321693904043488E-4,2.3175033176679247E-4,2.31680567253021E-4,2.3176410118143972E-4,2.317040965781598E-4,2.3163368018913947E-4,2.3169259669560065E-4,2.3192479227141045E-4,2.3179756692385693E-4,2.318408015698206E-4,2.3164520857154718E-4,2.316926556091586E-4,2.3168048013228195E-4,2.317589018742355E-4,2.3179908915749512E-4,2.3175195412256184E-4,2.317152210283858E-4,2.316810530603068E-4,2.321557299136075E-4,2.3173935068699473E-4,2.3169260250549607E-4,2.3173810963694042E-4,2.3166889653243198E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.317050407490893E-4,2.316813783108521E-4,2.3166876428991787E-4,2.318541048586514E-4,2.3176103280889666E-4,2.3166866744629146E-4,2.316451141940511E-4,2.3162181971902592E-4,2.3183124250942028E-4,2.3168001672688664E-4,2.317853298453748E-4,2.3185335296367437E-4,2.317481656091851E-4,2.3169290937467287E-4,2.3164541786535977E-4,2.3170467704319544E-4,2.3164529309826871E-4,2.3165744946862315E-4,2.3164542442150247E-4,2.3179579467214514E-4,2.317268048256888E-4,2.3166897666433166E-4,2.3169141814783267E-4]}}
{"value":"A mummy narrates vignettes about men, women, and the sex between them. Huh? At the beginning, the mummy randomly asks the viewer, \"Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this boy\" about 37 times, while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths. Later, said mods boys pelt mod girls with...vegetables? If you ignore (or fast forward) through the mummy's rambling, the shorts aren't bad in their own right. I found a few of them rather funny. My personal favorite is one where the sexually-confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed. This is one, well, bizarre movie.","finished_norm":["a","mummi","narrat","vignett","about","man","woman","and","the","sex","between","them","huh","at","the","begin","the","mummi","randomli","ask","the","viewer","imagin","have","sex","with","thi","girl","imagin","have","sex","with","thi","boi","about","time","while","flash","pictur","of","half","nake","mod","youth","late","sai","mod","boi","pelt","mod","girl","withveget","if","you","ignor","or","fast","forward","through","the","mummi","rambl","the","short","be","not","bad","in","their","own","right","i","find","a","few","of","them","rather","funni","my","person","favorit","be","on","where","the","sexuallyconfus","man","try","to","convinc","a","girl","to","have","sex","with","him","while","hi","pet","lizard","sit","on","the","bed","thi","be","on","good","bizarr","movi"],"filtered":["mummi","narrat","vignett","man","woman","sex","huh","begin","mummi","randomli","ask","viewer","imagin","sex","thi","girl","imagin","sex","thi","boi","time","flash","pictur","half","nake","mod","youth","late","sai","mod","boi","pelt","mod","girl","withveget","ignor","fast","forward","mummi","rambl","short","bad","right","find","rather","funni","person","favorit","sexuallyconfus","man","try","convinc","girl","sex","hi","pet","lizard","sit","bed","thi","good","bizarr","movi"],"filtered2":["mummi","narrat","vignett","man","woman","sex","huh","begin","mummi","randomli","ask","viewer","imagin","sex","girl","imagin","sex","boi","time","flash","pictur","half","nake","mod","youth","late","mod","boi","pelt","mod","girl","withveget","ignor","fast","forward","mummi","rambl","short","bad","right","find","rather","funni","person","favorit","sexuallyconfus","man","try","convinc","girl","sex","pet","lizard","sit","bed","good","bizarr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,9,36,38,45,62,70,84,121,147,150,153,160,206,244,254,272,279,282,306,311,340,478,542,699,762,822,823,893,1065,1214,1452,1640,2141,2205,2534,2655,2721,4546,5076],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,9,36,38,45,62,70,84,121,147,150,153,160,206,244,254,272,279,282,306,311,340,478,542,699,762,822,823,893,1065,1214,1452,1640,2141,2205,2534,2655,2721,4546,5076],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,3.632592212924433,2.0226120445069267,2.094675786251684,6.6638083547706675,2.2190595059394194,2.2844323215331563,2.332712011146513,2.3409902041158843,2.3722295531801256,2.597304642813496,2.634508058031767,11.558608298103085,2.8028805344481915,2.7910771187233068,5.837702458436066,2.8739486825973213,2.9203338091782562,5.897857368910622,3.3243163373261977,3.4471119148061256,3.5813614403160887,3.7465885637507435,3.813163054373413,3.850067611308864,4.017463517886143,4.1302590120314875,4.456830177669989,4.499089986959872,4.688631791727313,5.039114765418124,17.23405339792988,5.322690055917252,5.259176650194926,5.3064295350454715,6.255510089742618,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918357E-4,2.3612552253122072E-4,2.3618382374676042E-4,2.361363432433457E-4,2.3615869074724904E-4,2.3612422060632438E-4,2.361976585171192E-4,2.360890891734519E-4,2.3612557243393603E-4,2.3636958262639044E-4,2.382451064667311E-4,2.361259624523213E-4,2.363495886603975E-4,2.3637421220985646E-4,2.3626683357713397E-4,2.361372733502246E-4,2.3621851370481594E-4,2.3632967894044433E-4,2.3614946409949682E-4,2.361486007136261E-4,2.3636105227822535E-4,2.3617226039252128E-4,2.3617261781877004E-4,2.3632391252640525E-4,2.361495492845548E-4,2.3637703746512062E-4,2.362086447949576E-4,2.361249933249297E-4,2.362320423061189E-4,2.363041437306395E-4,2.3617341885568216E-4,2.362999081957776E-4,2.36415925551517E-4,2.366353561887684E-4,2.3620823661977863E-4,2.3613713012922495E-4,2.3622227090024038E-4,2.3616111205994116E-4,2.3608934115479155E-4,2.3614939096785068E-4,2.3638605301314235E-4,2.3625638038324856E-4,2.3630044668255482E-4,2.3610109129494817E-4,2.3614945101465851E-4,2.3613704133264808E-4,2.3621697158016179E-4,2.3625793189828052E-4,2.362098901828719E-4,2.3617245049795422E-4,2.3613762528140636E-4,2.3662143292745195E-4,2.3619704431003982E-4,2.3614939688950415E-4,2.3619577938738514E-4,2.361252349128971E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276123E-4,2.3613795678840865E-4,2.361251001265914E-4,2.3631400587089343E-4,2.3621914350507265E-4,2.361250014200996E-4,2.361009951020247E-4,2.3607725253895376E-4,2.3629070374590533E-4,2.3613656901327564E-4,2.3624390791467602E-4,2.363132395126091E-4,2.3620602879437976E-4,2.3614970966155747E-4,2.3610130461469632E-4,2.3616170369069066E-4,2.3610117744760948E-4,2.3611356765556828E-4,2.361013112969517E-4,2.3625457404084337E-4,2.3618425711895643E-4,2.3612531658619862E-4,2.3614818974976428E-4]}}
{"value":"\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" consists mostly of rambling, poorly assembled footage in search of a movie. The plot makes no sense, and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all. Watching this silly spoof, you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately: that it's easy to make a cheap, low-quality film and then use the \"parody\" angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (in one scene, female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them; how far can \"suspension of disbelief\" go - even in a parody?).

{"value":"I have been a fan of Without A Trace from the premier episode. I really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week. This is a REAL problem that far too many Afican-American families have dealt with and continue to deal with. The lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study. Law enforcement including local , state, and federal are also complicit. What was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending? Seemingly, television can deal with almost ANY subject matter EXCEPT RACE.

{"value":"I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. Judging it on it's own, it was pretty boring.<br /><br />You never get a real good look at the maniac cop's (Robert Z'Dar) face, but what I did see was pretty grim. The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film, not to give any thrills. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I may be more impressed.<br /><br />The ending with the car chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany, and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the

{"value":"Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.<br /><br />That's it, folks.

{"value":"Despite being a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' movies, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire/Rogers record (yes, vinyl) but knew nothing of the plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers' character is sweet and funny, you just can't like 'Bake Baker'. While trying to make up to his longtime partner, he continually sabotages her career. His character doesn't have the usual humour and elan of the other films' Astaire characters.<br /><br />Worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.","finished_norm":["despit","be","a","huge","fan","of","fred","astair","and","ginger","roger","movi","it","be","not","until","about","year","ago","that","i","see","follow","the","fleet","i","know","all","the","song","from","a","old","astairerog","record","ye","vinyl","but","know","noth","of","the","plotbr","br","unfortun","while","the","song","be","catchi","and","ginger","roger","charact","be","sweet","and","funni","you","just","ca","not","like","bake","baker","while","try","to","make","up","to","hi","longtim","partner","he","continu","sabotag","her","career","hi","charact","doe","not","have","the","usual","humour","and","elan","of","the","other","film","astair","charactersbr","br","worth","watch","for","the","song","and","a","great","solo","tap","routin","by","ginger","roger"],"filtered":["despit","huge","fan","fred","astair","ginger","roger","movi","year","ago","see","follow","fleet","know","song","old","astairerog","record","ye","vinyl","know","noth","plotbr","br","unfortun","song","catchi","ginger","roger","charact","sweet","funni","ca","like","bake","baker","try","make","hi","longtim","partner","continu","sabotag","career","hi","charact","doe","usual","humour","elan","film","astair","charactersbr","br","worth","watch","song","great","solo","tap","routin","ginger","roger"],"filtered2":["despit","huge","fan","fred","astair","ginger","roger","year","ago","see","follow","fleet","know","song","old","astairerog","record","ye","vinyl","know","noth","plotbr","unfortun","song","catchi","ginger","roger","charact","sweet","funni","ca","like","bake","baker","try","make","longtim","partner","continu","sabotag","career","charact","doe","usual","humour","elan","astair","charactersbr","worth","watch","song","great","solo","tap","routin","ginger","roger"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,10,18,26,36,49,51,57,62,67,81,140,209,219,227,260,265,328,391,433,444,511,610,1020,1235,1388,1479,1496,1514,1573,2553,2931,3070,3101,3896,4976,4980,5035,5130,5750,8574],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,10,18,26,36,49,51,57,62,67,81,140,209,219,227,260,265,328,391,433,444,511,610,1020,1235,1388,1479,1496,1514,1573,2553,2931,3070,3101,3896,4976,4980,5035,5130,5750,8574],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.2153159934048174,2.6649848339420377,1.4680183469605717,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,2.0226120445069267,1.9570915389266579,1.949757232424728,2.317169775997098,2.6026896854443837,2.5792094178355414,2.6005321873043625,2.6754694156628323,2.73529586597515,9.465127487774156,3.109204957709252,3.164467636384302,3.2535472664379905,3.3909310864081816,3.477726550625732,4.100845126825194,4.4637506205145625,4.443131333311827,14.145195146386406,4.9676558014359795,4.581533656170946,4.605250182788262,5.501738287366237,5.3560264761848435,5.583416318380505,5.426230734858092,5.7959777603641776,6.137727054086234,6.137727054086234,19.46737482277237,6.1754673820690815,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651693E-4,2.3166917872259957E-4,2.3172637963242846E-4,2.3167979521786157E-4,2.3170172096235664E-4,2.3166790136863857E-4,2.3173995330228202E-4,2.316334329633867E-4,2.3166922768351217E-4,2.3190863272655823E-4,2.3374876022784908E-4,2.3166961034116828E-4,2.318890161021826E-4,2.3191317493693813E-4,2.3180782283696813E-4,2.316807077710428E-4,2.3176041489471818E-4,2.318694821338902E-4,2.316926684470495E-4,2.3169182135566587E-4,2.3190026336973292E-4,2.317150345107697E-4,2.3171538519139334E-4,2.3186382454808464E-4,2.3169275202442906E-4,2.3191594687179594E-4,2.31750732238573E-4,2.3166865950389968E-4,2.3177368817377554E-4,2.3184442884434923E-4,2.3171617111051622E-4,2.3184027324578286E-4,2.3195410103209584E-4,2.321693904043486E-4,2.3175033176679228E-4,2.3168056725302082E-4,2.3176410118143953E-4,2.3170409657815962E-4,2.3163368018913928E-4,2.3169259669560046E-4,2.3192479227141026E-4,2.3179756692385674E-4,2.3184080156982042E-4,2.31645208571547E-4,2.316926556091584E-4,2.3168048013228176E-4,2.3175890187423533E-4,2.3179908915749493E-4,2.3175195412256165E-4,2.317152210283856E-4,2.316810530603066E-4,2.3215572991360731E-4,2.3173935068699454E-4,2.3169260250549588E-4,2.3173810963694023E-4,2.3166889653243182E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.317050407490891E-4,2.316813783108519E-4,2.3166876428991768E-4,2.318541048586512E-4,2.3176103280889647E-4,2.3166866744629127E-4,2.316451141940509E-4,2.3162181971902573E-4,2.318312425094201E-4,2.3168001672688645E-4,2.3178532984537462E-4,2.3185335296367418E-4,2.317481656091849E-4,2.3169290937467268E-4,2.3164541786535958E-4,2.3170467704319525E-4,2.3164529309826852E-4,2.3165744946862296E-4,2.3164542442150228E-4,2.3179579467214495E-4,2.3172680482568862E-4,2.3166897666433147E-4,2.31

{"value":"If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I can't stand it!!

Please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.","finished_norm":["if","you","be","under","the","ag","of","or","then","you","re","go","to","realli","enjoi","thi","movi","my","young","daughter","be","glue","to","the","tv","when","she","watch","it","a","a","adult","i","ca","not","stand","it","i","be","all","up","for","sequelswhen","thei","have","a","decent","storylin","but","thi","be","nowher","near","up","to","standard","pleas","forgiv","me","for","slate","what","be","after","all","a","kid","film","but","when","you","have","to","sit","through","it","nearli","everi","dai","when","your","kid","who","love","it","so","much","you","will","understand","why","my","daughter","would","watch","thi","film","over","and","over","again","on","the","same","dai","if","we","let","herbr","br","i","have","give","thi","film","out","of","pure","for","the","fact","that","it","keep","my","young","entertain"],"filtered":["ag","re","go","realli","enjoi","thi","movi","young","daughter","glue","tv","watch","adult","ca","stand","sequelswhen","thei","decent","storylin","thi","nowher","near","standard","pleas","forgiv","slate","kid","film","sit","nearli","everi","dai","kid","love","much","understand","daughter","watch","thi","film","dai","let","herbr","br","give","thi","film","pure","fact","keep","young","entertain"],"filtered2":["ag","re","go","realli","enjoi","young","daughter","glue","tv","watch","adult","ca","stand","sequelswhen","decent","storylin","nowher","near","standard","pleas","forgiv","slate","kid","sit","nearli","everi","dai","kid","love","understand","daughter","watch","dai","let","herbr","give","pure","fact","keep","young","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,13,30,54,68,81,85,97,114,124,132,134,135,172,195,200,212,244,309,346,377,426,442,515,555,611,616,726,734,799,1311,2736,4449,8360],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,13,30,54,68,81,85,97,114,124,132,134,135,172,195,200,212,244,309,346,377,426,442,515,555,611,616,726,734,799,1311,2736,4449,8360],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,1.3364419891718522,1.8113893252729412,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.011190219103739,2.0545557924622586,4.886614839193365,2.2323930368088845,4.506988091575534,2.2443961816702407,4.732488142874176,2.5001408943598484,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,2.5983793339432615,2.634508058031767,2.848772527704847,3.023389038124396,3.0602441305135506,6.781862172816363,3.257696649984802,3.3956930001684253,3.432149042129413,3.520060914452293,3.5173618574831282,3.6466665387238555,3.79165684915245,3.7636829971100436,4.456830177669989,5.290429193699031,6.032366538428407,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.9976296075729617E-4,2.9949732564315705E-4,2.9957127384642074E-4,2.995110504379537E-4,2.9953939560615957E-4,2.9949567430525653E-4,2.995888216179574E-4,2.994511142336534E-4,2.994973889388551E-4,2.9980688703667345E-4,3.021857674234294E-4,2.994978836310938E-4,2.9978152705322186E-4,2.9981275911628626E-4,2.996765620081259E-4,2.995122301686317E-4,2.996152739593816E-4,2.997562739259176E-4,2.9952769269367126E-4,2.995265975907086E-4,2.997960672979393E-4,2.995566070978501E-4,2.9955706045081454E-4,2.997489599110464E-4,2.9952780074085216E-4,2.9981634261876745E-4,2.9960275641329885E-4,2.994966544075059E-4,2.9963243339164666E-4,2.997238855294228E-4,2.9955807647149006E-4,2.99718513253905E-4,2.998656675614939E-4,3.001439893977633E-4,2.996022386913128E-4,2.995120485097161E-4,2.9962003951784164E-4,2.995424667552165E-4,2.9945143384220956E-4,2.995275999348191E-4,2.998277777761904E-4,2.9966330336679163E-4,2.997191962607564E-4,2.994663375066467E-4,2.995276760970999E-4,2.995119358817502E-4,2.996133179564693E-4,2.9966527128028855E-4,2.9960433604071785E-4,2.9955684822412964E-4,2.995126765517529E-4,3.001263293859027E-4,2.995880425688496E-4,2.9952760744573684E-4,2.995864381639205E-4,2.994969608332975E-4,0.9763286762691502,2.995436873606932E-4,2.995130970292157E-4,2.994967898727945E-4,2.997363944890621E-4,2.9961607278659245E-4,2.9949666467527246E-4,2.9946621549728904E-4,2.994361008613639E-4,2.997068384968046E-4,2.995113368004337E-4,2.9964748351410646E-4,2.9973542245412846E-4,2.995994383256625E-4,2.9952800416013054E-4,2.9946660807754217E-4,2.9954321716891744E-4,2.994664467811181E-4,2.994821622959343E-4,2.9946661655319356E-4,2.9966101223488113E-4,2.995718235278458E-4,2.994970644262302E-4,2.9952607633160786E-4]}}
{"value":"Woody Allen made \"September\", proving that even a genius could screw up. This is Mel Brook's \"September\". Monumentally stupid, boring, and unfunny, I must confess I did not watch it through to the end. The flick ranks among the dishonored few (e.g., \"The Money Pit\", \"Out to Sea\", \"Spitfire Grill\") which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the \"rewind\" button. And I say this, sadly, as a devoted Mel Brooks fan. He should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone. How the same fellow that made \"Young Frankenstein\" and \"Spaceballs\" could crank out a dog like this is beyond me. To be avoided at all costs.","finished_norm":["woodi","allen","make","septemb","prove","that","even","a","geniu","can","screw","up","thi","be","mel","brook","septemb","monument","stupid","bore","and","unfunni","i","must","confess","i","do","not","watch","it","through","to","the","end","the","flick","rank","among","the","dishonor","few","eg","the","monei","pit","out","to","sea","spitfir","grill","which","either","put","me","to","sleep","or","forc","me","to","reach","for","the","rewind","button","and","i","sai","thi","sadli","a","a","devot","mel","brook","fan","he","should","stick","to","straight","comedi","and","leav","social","commentari","alon","how","the","same","fellow","that","make","young","frankenstein","and","spacebal","can","crank","out","a","dog","like","thi","be","beyond","me","to","be","avoid","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["woodi","allen","make","septemb","prove","even","geniu","screw","thi","mel","brook","septemb","monument","stupid","bore","unfunni","must","confess","watch","end","flick","rank","among","dishonor","eg","monei","pit","sea","spitfir","grill","either","put","sleep","forc","reach","rewind","button","sai","thi","sadli","devot","mel","brook","fan","stick","straight","comedi","leav","social","commentari","alon","fellow","make","young","frankenstein","spacebal","crank","dog","like","thi","beyond","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["woodi","allen","make","septemb","prove","even","geniu","screw","mel","brook","septemb","monument","stupid","bore","unfunni","must","confess","watch","end","flick","rank","among","dishonor","eg","monei","pit","sea","spitfir","grill","either","put","sleep","forc","reach","rewind","button","sadli","devot","mel","brook","fan","stick","straight","comedi","leav","social","commentari","alon","fellow","make","young","frankenstein","spacebal","crank","dog","like","beyond","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,24,74,108,126,127,135,136,140,141,159,207,257,335,338,416,457,502,540,548,609,706,732,826,836,934,948,975,1341,1345,1457,1517,1598,1655,1705,1761,2209,2244,2358,2549,2836,3033,3230,3342,5065,5398,6239,6927],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,24,74,108,126,127,135,136,140,141,159,207,257,335,338,416,457,502,540,548,609,706,732,826,836,934,948,975,1341,1345,1457,1517,1598,1655,1705,1761,2209,2244,2358,2549,2836,3033,3230,3342,5065,5398,6239,6927],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.3210361566119257,1.9486336368009016,2.138507503627933,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.366244071437088,2.346825985579986,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.300267965194495,2.5531798379045583,2.7602659523229094,2.908534262247101,2.9720957437368454,3.1401446412440817,3.3243163373261977,3.3132665011396125,3.432149042129413,3.459754308221302,3.68099128126493,3.6284289511740746,3.7099788181381825,3.8204358137024927,3.7881170224473255,3.9405024767500145,4.049068857301474,4.086456389373095,4.449957298382227,4.760735085628657,4.597282013139085,4.550761997504193,4.751432692966343,4.637773374493822,4.751432692966343,5.156897801074508,5.143104478942172,5.089758498236879,10.781025304512026,5.185068678041204,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.822646007446338,11.591955520728355,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,13.321950395701563,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805357E-4,2.19255310437206E-4,2.1930944626706036E-4,2.192653580532819E-4,2.1928610891855602E-4,2.192541015295697E-4,2.1932229259911853E-4,2.1922148009526651E-4,2.1925535677457444E-4,2.1948193342720786E-4,2.212234586864771E-4,2.1925571892772596E-4,2.1946336794909408E-4,2.1948623224568863E-4,2.1938652538130768E-4,2.1926622170779193E-4,2.1934165776813397E-4,2.1944488069798184E-4,2.1927754147741063E-4,2.19276739776963E-4,2.1947401253786465E-4,2.192987090676411E-4,2.1929904095723224E-4,2.1943952627086742E-4,2.1927762057634127E-4,2.1948885564790862E-4,2.1933249395190827E-4,2.192548190405608E-4,2.1935421980567513E-4,2.1942116987548022E-4,2.192997847633018E-4,2.19417236952427E-4,2.195249653380588E-4,2.1972871854514223E-4,2.1933211493919245E-4,2.1926608871935258E-4,2.1934514652716488E-4,2.1928835723826446E-4,2.1922171407356015E-4,2.192774735707244E-4,2.1949722707154413E-4,2.193768190257819E-4,2.1941773696650528E-4,2.1923262471379974E-4,2.1927752932743102E-4,2.1926600626693142E-4,2.1934022582203956E-4,2.1937825969134964E-4,2.1933365036190088E-4,2.1929888559081093E-4,2.1926654849491637E-4,2.1971579004444688E-4,2.1932172227464696E-4,2.192774790692997E-4,2.1932054772559205E-4,2.1925504336804655E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630274E-4,2.192668563170862E-4,2.192549182116764E-4,2.1943032740576228E-4,2.193422425717135E-4,2.192548265573636E-4,2.19232535393471E-4,2.1921048914035575E-4,2.1940869012321298E-4,2.19265567

{"value":"Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaks and moans attempt to make-up for a muddled, but thin story. Acting is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess. Owen Wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror-movie history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much else although Lili Tayor did an above-average job. The special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous.

{"value":"Don't even ask me why I watched this! The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Bronchitis. The acting is deplorable, Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy, gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops. Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is dismal, peppered with clichéd lines, \"Are you ready, Pardner?\" purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims. Dire.

{"value":"Very outdated film with awful, cliché-ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk overact constantly. A pseudo \"good movie\". It takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total bore, filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges. The sound is horrible. Camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. The actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages.

{"value":"This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last. This time the spoof is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some weird reason. In my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb. If your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies, they just keep getting worse
