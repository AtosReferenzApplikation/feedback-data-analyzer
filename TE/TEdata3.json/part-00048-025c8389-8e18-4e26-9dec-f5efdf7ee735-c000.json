{"value":"I never understood why some people dislike Bollywood films: they've got charismatic actors, great dance numbers, and heightened emotion--what's not to like? What I didn't realize was that I had only seen the upper-crust of Bollywood. Then I watched \"Garam Masala\". I could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie I was going to like (the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models), but I kept hoping things would improve. Sadly, they didn't. The main problem is that the two protagonists, Mac & Sam, are completely unsympathetic. They spend the entire movie lying to women--and lying brutally- -in order to get them into bed, and the audience is supposed to find this funny, and be charmed. The boys are unscrupulous and inept, and not in a lovable way. Mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating. The script is extremely poor, with repetitive scenes, setups that never lead to anything, and illogical actions and statements by the characters. In fact, the characters are never really developed at all. The males are boorish, greedy jerks, and the women merely interchangeably beautiful. If you go by this movie, you would think that \"air hostesses\" are pretty easy to pass from man to man. In reality, betrayal is not so humorous. <br /><br />The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets, and a few slapsticky moments involving the French-farce, door-slamming aspects of the story. But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan, and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, who seem to have influenced writer/director Priyadarshan not a little. Priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story: the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play \"Boeing Boeing.\" The original author of that work, Marc Camoletti, is credited nowhere. At least Priyadarshan changed the title for this remake, rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit, as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale.

That said, after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it, one can appreciate what the film might have been in surer hands. <br /><br />One suspects that those many of us who actively suffered through the film may have had any campy delights its crueler fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are only a misstep or two away from the deplorable plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a squalor they seem incapable of controlling or escaping.<br /><br />The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have slid to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no cautionary clues or explanations, only a horror show unredeemed by humor or insight. <br /><br />This soul crushing flatness of the film makes the achievement of the stage version (hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable) all the more remarkable. Act II is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely, setting the sad inmates' plight to music, raises the human tragedy to art. Even more important, this act is preceded by a fine Act I where we meet the women before their decent into mutually enabled madness, and are offered hints how their isolated purgatory came about. In short, everything which the FILM is lacking.<br /><br />To the filmmakers' credit (or their successors), the excellent Criterion DVD release includes out-takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film - behind the scenes photographs, interviews and commentary - filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression. They can't make the amateurish film itself satisfying, but they can at least make it a bit more comprehensible. <br /><br />Ultimately though, it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and

{"value":"I'll have to add dissenting comment here. Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiao-hsien. i.e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years. Unfortunately this isn't quite accurate. The film plays out rather like a film school graduate's attempt to emulate these masters. All the pieces are there - the beautiful backdrop, the vaguely minimalist dialogue, the slow swaying camerawork, and male leads, in particular, who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative. Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par. The dialogue is leaden. The acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving. Unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical \"Chekovian\" (i.e. very predictable) plot, the results are at best tedious and at worst painful. I couldn't help but see the \"Blue Danube\" river scene, for example, as verging on genre parody (although the smoggy looking \"springtime\" sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour...) I actually went to this movie on the basis that Mark Li Ping was photographing it. While the setting is elegant, and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of \"Flowers of Shanghai\", the film is not in the same league, visually. In fact I must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film, I suddenly remembered that I was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave (and I can't recall the last film I walked out of). I'm guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point I couldn't care. If you'd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then I'd recommend anything by the above two directors, for example \"In the Mood for Love\" or \"Flowers of Shanghai\", both of which were filmed by the talented Mr Ping (the former with Chris Doyle), and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this. It's not often Mr Hoberman leads me astray, and perhaps you'd rather listen to him, but don't say you weren't warned.

{"value":"I'm guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind, much less a Dickens novel, and certainly not David Copperfield, and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay, possibly an adaptation of Copperfield, though just as likely anything else, from which they randomly discarded about a third of the pages and then shuffled the rest, along with some random pages from a screenplay that someone's eighth grade nephew had written for an English class, and for which he had received a failing grade. <br /><br />If the casting was a bad joke - e.g., Richards as Kramer playing Micawber - which it was, then the direction and acting were the poorly- delivered punch lines. Getting beyond Kramer as Micawber, if possible, Ham was such a complete ogre, hunch-back and all, that I was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch-fork and torch wielding mob of villagers. Uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as Micawber. Mr. Murdstone evoked about as much terror as that Muppet vampire from Sesame street. The actor playing older David was, I believe, actually a woman. In any case, looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked, and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed, he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen. And while we're on that subject, in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the half-wit producers of this embarrassment, in the unnecessary shots of David writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old, when he should be in his forties. Perhaps the greatest transgression, although it's difficult to choose, was the invented showdown between David and Murdstone as he courted a third wife in Switzerland, preceded of course by the invented death of Murdstone's second wife. While they were at it it is a wonder they didn't send Heep to the guillotine, and have him deliver Sidney Carton's famous last words. It couldn't have made things much worse really. It might have been far far better.<br /><br />There are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this miscarriage of art, and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their

{"value":"I'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the American Revolutionary War. This ain't it. (And for that matter, neither was the Emmerich/Devlin/Gibson THE PATRIOT. But I digress.)<br /><br />I saw this film at a publicity screening at the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE fame), and starring Al Pacino.<br /><br />But it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats, whispering derisive comments about Pacino's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an American frontiersman of Scottish ancestry(!) -- and that of Nastassja Kinski, who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England(!!). Then the story started and it all went downhill fast.<br /><br />Motivations were muddled, dialogue was atrocious, events had no historical or political context. What there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence; by the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer/pederast. His accent was all over the map too. I guess there weren't any English actors available.<br /><br />Lots of people left. Those who stayed tried to stifle giggles, then openly guffawed. I stuck it out -- I figured that at least the battle scenes might be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras, not even Steadicam, the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale.<br /><br />There was a semi-famous TV reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the late) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us. And sure enough, on his TV segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'Franklin Scale of 1 to 10', while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before, who clearly didn't know art when they saw it. What a buffoon.<br /><br />After this disaster, Pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career never recovered.

{"value":"This serial is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature, but for todays audience that's all it is. I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952. Considering that fact alone makes this a solid (lowly?) 2 in my book. The cars used don't even look contemporary, they look like stuff from the 30's. It's basically Cody (the lone world's salvation? Sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else, like the military), anyway it's Cody in his nipple ring flying suit against Graber and Daley two dumb*ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right, enjoy. If you want to watch a really good serial see Flash Gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women, this has NONE of that. And Flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack. Something made in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. Nuff said. give it a 6 if your watching it as a MST3K episode, those guys have some good fun with it; a tweak of the nipples here, a tweak there and I'm flying! And now as an added bonus, I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song as originally sung by Joel and his two character bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight The Enemy Planet:<br /><br />(Singing at the very beginning credits);<br /><br />(TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR WATCHING COMMANDER CODY.... HE IS THE NEW CHARACTER FROM REPUBLIC,<br /><br />HE GETS IN TROUBLE EVERY WEEK... BUT HE'S SAVED BY EDITING,<br /><br />JUST A TWEAK OF HIS NIPPLES... SENDS HIM ON HIS WAY,<br /><br />A PUMPKIN HEAD AND A ROCKET PACK.... WILL SAVE THE DAY,<br /><br />(JOEL SINGING) HIS LABRATORY IS A BOXING RING... WHEN BAD GUYS COME TO MIX IT UP,<br /><br />SOMEBODY ALWAYS GETS KIDNAPPED... AND CODY HAS TO FIX IT UP,<br /><br />HE DRINKS HIS TEA AT AL'S CAFE... AND FLIES ALONG ON WIRES,<br /><br />HE BEATS THE CROOKS AND FLIES WITH HOOKS... AND PUTS OUT FOREST FIRES,<br /><br />(CROW SINGING)<br /><br />BAD GUYS BEWARE...

{"value":"A very weak movie, mainly because of a poor story, but also poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and irrational behaviour by many of the characters. If you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it's creativity or acting criteria, then you may like this movie. Personally I can't do that with a drama and found this too far-fetched.<br /><br />I'm particularly annoyed when a main character, that is supposed to be an intelligent person, continually acts like a complete imbecile. In this movie, if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie.<br /><br />The first highly unlikely act is when the main character, a successful attorney named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, is leaving a party and happens upon a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who is screaming that her car has been stolen. They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home.<br /><br />She tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things. When they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town, they notice that her car is in the driveway. Also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken.<br /><br />Things are very odd, she's weird (looking like a tramp, she undresses in front of him until she's completely naked  oh yeah!). Also, the father's strange, the house is a wreck -- everything should have told Magruder, \"hey this is too weird for me, I'm out of here!' But not Magruder, he sleeps with her and then, motivated by her story and sex, takes up the case of trying to have her father committed. It all screams set-up!<br /><br />Then, being the top-flight attorney that he is, he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before, (a fact that all of the women in the office notice). Is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16-year-old? Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming, with ample evidence, that the father is terrorising them, the police ignore him. I could have believed begrudging assistance. But no help at all -- not likely!<br /><br />It's just too unlikely.","finished_norm":["a","veri","weak","movi","mainli","becaus","of","a","poor","stori","but","conjur","poor","act","in","the","case","of","robert","downei","jr","and","irrat","behaviour","by","mani","of","the","charact","if","you","be","someon","who","like","to","switch","your","mind","off","and","simpli","watch","a","movi","for","it","creativ","or","act","criterium","then","you","mai","like","thi","movi","person","i","ca","not","do","that","with","a","drama","and","find","thi","too","farfetchedbr","br","i","be","particularli","annoi","when","a","main","charact","that","be","suppos","to","be","a","intellig","person","continu","act","like","a","complet","imbecil","in","thi","movi","if","the","main","charact","act","the","wai","a","person","would","normal","act","in","thi","situat","there","would","be","no","moviebr","br","the","highli","unlik","act","be","when","the","main","charact","a","success","attornei","name","magrud","plai","by","kenneth","branagh","be","leav","a","parti","and","happen","upon","a","girl","mallori","doss","plai","by","embeth","davidtz","who","be","scream","that","her","car","have","be","steal","thei","be","stand","around","in","a","tropic","rainstorm","a","he","badger","her","into","accept","a","ride","homebr","br","she","tell","him","about","her","weird","father","who","belong","to","some","kind","of","weird","sect","and","doe","crazi","thing","when","thei","arriv","at","her","dilapid","shack","in","the","poor","part","of","town","thei","notic","that","her","car","be","in","the","drivewai","conjur","the","hous","light","be","on","and","some","object","in","the","hous","have","be","brokenbr","br","thing","be","veri","odd","she","weird","look","like","a","tramp","she","undress","in","front","of","him","until","she","complet","nake","oh","ye","conjur","the","father","strang","the","hous","be","a","wreck","everyth","should","have","tell","magrud","hei","thi","be","too","weird","for","me","i","be","out","of","here","but","not","magrud","he","sleep","with","her","and","then","motiv","by","her","stori","and","sex","take","up","the","case","of","try","to","have","her","father","commit","it","all","scream","setupbr","br","then","be","the","topflight","attornei","that","he","be","he","arriv","late","at","the","offic","wear","the","same","shirt","he","have","on","the","night","befor","a","fact","that","all","of","the","woman","in","the","offic","notic","be","it","like","that","a","success","attornei","would","act","like","a","yearold","magrud","have","upset","the","polic","in","some","of","hi","case","so","when","he","go","to","the","polic","claim","with","ampl","evid","that","the","father","be","terroris","them","the","polic","ignor","him","i","can","have","believ","begrudg","assist","but","no","help","at","all","not","likelybr","br","it","just","too","unlik"],"filtered":["veri","weak","movi","mainli","becaus","poor","stori","conjur","poor","act","case","robert","downei","jr","irrat","behaviour","mani","charact","someon","like","switch","mind","simpli","watch","movi","creativ","act","criterium","mai","like","thi","movi","person","ca","drama","find","thi","farfetchedbr","br","particularli","annoi","main","charact","suppos","intellig","person","continu","act","like","complet","imbecil","thi","movi","main","charact","act","wai","person","normal","act","thi","situat","moviebr","br","highli","unlik","act","main","charact","success","attornei","name","magrud","plai","kenneth","branagh","leav","parti","happen","upon","girl","mallori","doss","plai","embeth","davidtz","scream","car","steal","thei","stand","around","tropic","rainstorm","badger","accept","ride","homebr","br","tell","weird","father","belong","kind","weird","sect","doe","crazi","thing","thei","arriv","dilapid","shack","poor","part","town","thei","notic","car","drivewai","conjur","hous","light","object","hous","brokenbr","br","thing","veri","odd","weird","look","like","tramp","undress","front","complet","nake","oh","ye","conjur","father","strang","hous","wreck","everyth","tell","magrud","hei","thi","weird","magrud","sleep","motiv","stori","sex","take","case","try","father","commit","scream","setupbr","br","topflight","attornei","arriv","late","offic","wear","shirt","night","befor","fact","woman","offic","notic","like","success","attornei","act","like","yearold","magrud","upset","polic","hi","case","go","polic","claim","ampl","evid","father","terroris","polic","ignor","believ","begrudg","assist","help","likelybr","br","unlik"],"filtered2":["veri","weak","mainli","becaus","poor","stori","conjur","poor","act","case","robert","downei","jr","irrat","behaviour","mani","charact","someon","like","switch","mind","simpli","watch","creativ","act","criterium","mai","like","person","ca","drama","find","farfetchedbr","particularli","annoi","main","charact","suppos","intellig","person","continu","act","like","complet","imbecil","main","charact","act","wai","person","normal","act","situat","moviebr","highli","unlik","act","main","charact","success",

{"value":"I've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. My belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed. However, things have quickly changed after watching that horrible Black (no songs) & this movie, Page 3 (plenty of songs). While Black was weak to an extreme, Page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting & good direction. The songs were almost incidental & blended in almost seamlessly with the film. There certainly weren't any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. There was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable.<br /><br />I'd recommend this films for Hindi-speaking people with at least a slight understanding of Mumbai life. The former because the English subtitling was below par and contained many errors which, at times, completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter because you'll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you've lived it yourself.<br /><br />I'd definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash. The movie does fall short in a few places though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film.<br /><br />I also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well. It was a touch amusing to watch, rather than arouse any feelings of sadness & the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish. These are minor issues though, because the film, on the whole, is truly a rare treat to watch.<br /><br />Overall, it's a cynical, pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that! Actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key. A chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life. A behind-the-scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema.<br /><br

{"value":"I bought a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks at my local Suncoast, which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks (including its sequel \"Witchcraft XI\"). So basically I paid the rock bottom price of $2.50 for this movie, if you do the math. I can't exactly say I was ripped off. I have a thing for trashy horror movies, but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name. The budget couldn't be over $1,000 (though it appears as if they spent a total of $1.50). I know it's a low-budget film, but that's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork. The film \"Blood Cult,\" though not very good, was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting. The acting in this movie is the definition of \"effortless,\" especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent. Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. You can take that figuratively or literally. I wouldn't be surprised if the script was off-camera as they were performing. I said before that I've never seen a bad English actor. This movie has quite a few bad ones. And though English movies aren't always good, they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication, which is why I don't see why any Englishman, or Englishwoman, would volunteer to do a home-video-style schlock flick like this. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors. Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing, acting and cinematography departments. Even when you watch a movie like \"Glitter\" you can't honestly say it looks like a third-grader shot those scenes (though a third-grader could've written the script). I've seen home movies that are shot better than \"Witchcraft X,\" and that's no exaggeration whatsoever. Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City. Not a single effort was put into making this movie--let's just sum it up like that. You get the picture. There's a good deal of nudity, though that doesn't save it. However, I must say that girl with the red-orange hair, who's either naked or wearing a cleavage-popping outfit throughout the film, is really hot! <br /><br />My score: 1 (out of

{"value":"Rented a batch of films from Blockbuster last night, and this was the first one I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, wanted a \"horror film fix\")...<br /><br />Wow, this was awful, almost embarrassingly so... Stupid slasher-type story I really thought films like Scream had put an end to; amateur actors delivering clichéd' and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read off a page; and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about (especially when occurring in a film this poorly scripted).<br /><br />But I've always believed no film is 100% percent totally worthless. Here's the few good things I can say about this mess: <br /><br />#1 Bobbie Phillips: love this actress. She's the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever. The only reason I took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover. She acquits her presence in this dreck with professionalism, even though she looks bemused at times that she's acting in such a moronic story.<br /><br />#2 Unintentional Hilarity: This is the kind of film I can remember seeing back when there were still grind house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple-bill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making it's way to the hinterlands. Unfortunately, in this direct-to-video age, most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the communal experience of being part of an audience jeering and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible. Which leads to--<br /><br />#3 Porn Stars Trying To Act!: Mostly on hand because the producers don't need to cajole or plead with them to disrobe for extended sex scenes, but this trade-off usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story (other than \"ooh yeah baby\", or \"harder!\"). And, proudly, they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act. I'd almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character wasn't supposed to be an Irish mom and she's actually attempting at times to do an accent, which just keeps the smiles coming.<br /><br />It's nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what I took from this cesspool a.k.a \"Evil

{"value":"From the start, you know this is a Sam Sherman film more than an Al Adamson film because as the credits roll, \"A Sam Sherman Production\" appears in letters as big as the title credit. Not only that, Mr. Sherman co-wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use Bob Livingstone, a washed-up, 69 year old Western star of the old Hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that Sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of \"Swinging Stewardesses\". <br /><br />Now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft-core exploitation feature? It defies explanation, but that is Sam Sherman for you. His obsession with old Hollywood colored a lot of his films for Independent International Pictures, and he and Al Adamson frequently tried to get has-been actors for their films (e.g. J. Carrol Naish, Russ Tamblyn, Lon Chaney Jr.,etc.). But Bob Livingstone? Tell me the drive-in demographic knew who this '40's second-rater was; it's ridiculous! <br /><br />But then again, \"Naughty Stewardesses\" was a successful picture for them, so we can't just write this off as a Sherman fiasco. Still, by any aesthetic standard, it's an incoherent mess. Al Adamson wanted out of this picture, and it is easy to see why. First off, it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core (tits and ass/simulated sex only) to a kidnapping thriller (shades of Steckler's \"Rat Pfink and Boo Boo\"!) In between, we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around Vegas to the hackneyed music of Sparrow, or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann on a photo shoot in San Francisco. Worst of all, we get Bob Livingstone as a Jack LaLanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy...gag! (Thankfully, his big sex scene with Connie Hoffmann was deleted, but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the DVD in the Special Features section. Creepy.) <br /><br />This is a terrible, terrible movie, but I'll give it three stars for Gary Graver's photography and out of sympathy to Connie Hoffmann for having to make it with \"Wrinkles\" Livingstone. \"Naughty Stewardesses\" is for Al Adamson completists and/or scholars of exploitation film as Sam Sherman's commentary offers vital inside info. All others,

{"value":"In short, the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing, somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast, and the 3rd act ... there virtually wasn't ANY 3rd act!<br /><br />Regarding the 3rd act, the movie just abruptly ends. There is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there wasn't much of a 3rd act. The bad guys die and that's that; the end credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. The audience would've likely left the theater after the movie, asking \"that's it?\" A real letdown.<br /><br />Music was composed by David Bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time, but it's certainly nothing outstanding. It's just functional, but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative. It is also apparent that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. What least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of James Horner from \"48 HRS.\" and \"Commando,\" particularly the brass.<br /><br />In all, the film had potential as the basic story itself is good, but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction, weak acting, and somewhat inconsistent pacing.<br /><br />There was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story, and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn't allow the movie to end satisfactorily. This could either be the screenplay or, possibly, the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints (but I'm speculating as to why there isn't a 3rd act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall. <br /><br />This is good for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap as well as to learn the reason WHY you need to have the 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) if you write screenplays and make movies.<br /><br />Otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to at least get some laughs out of it.","finished_norm":["in","short","the","movi","have","a","littl","bite","of","a","weak","st","act","with","some","forc","act","and","a","somewhat","disjoint","rhythm","and","pace","somewhat","of","a","decent","nd","act","that","manag","to","build","some","tension","and","intrigu","despit","some","inconsist","pace","and","some","inferior","perform","by","the","cast","and","the","rd","act","there","virtual","be","not","ani","rd","actbr","br","regard","the","rd","act","the","movi","just","abruptli","end","there","be","no","resolut","and","no","path","down","from","the","climax","of","the","nd","act","so","there","be","not","much","of","a","rd","act","the","bad","gui","die","and","that","that","the","end","credit","roll","there","be","noth","to","show","what","happen","to","the","protagonist","and","the","support","charact","and","so","on","the","audienc","would","have","like","leav","the","theater","after","the","movi","ask","that","it","a","real","letdownbr","br","music","be","compos","by","david","bell","which","work","adequ","enough","to","serv","the","film","much","of","the","time","but","it","certainli","noth","outstand","it","just","function","but","achiev","thi","by","be","mere","gener","and","deriv","it","be","conjur","appar","that","the","score","be","veri","date","with","the","us","of","synthes","timpani","for","some","of","the","percuss","what","littl","impress","me","about","the","score","be","that","some","moment","of","tension","herald","music","cue","sound","like","thei","be","rip","off","of","jame","horner","from","hr","and","commando","particularli","the","brassbr","br","in","all","the","film","have","potenti","a","the","basic","stori","itself","be","good","but","the","execut","be","lacklust","with","mediocr","direct","weak","act","and","somewhat","inconsist","pacingbr","br","there","be","virtual","no","rd","act","to","properli","finish","the","stori","and","thi","omiss","be","major","and","unforgiv","a","it","doe","not","allow","the","movi","to","end","satisfactorili","thi","can","either","be","the","screenplai","or","possibli","the","product","have","to","cut","out","film","or","edit","the","rd","act","into","the","finish","movi","due","to","budget","constraint","but","i","be","specul","a","to","why","there","be","not","a","rd","act","whatev","the","reason","the","abrupt","end","realli","hurt","the","movi","overal","br","br","thi","be","good","for","a","view","if","you","re","curiou","and","you","can","get","the","movi","for","veri","cheap","a","good","a","to","learn","the","reason","why","you","ne","to","have","the","act","begin","middl","end","if","you","write","screenplai","and","make","moviesbr","br","otherwis","you","mai","not","want","to","wast","your","time","unless","you","can","get","the","mstk","version","to","at","littl","get","some","laugh","out","of","it"],"filtered":["short","movi","littl","bite","weak","st","act","forc","act","somewhat","disjoint","rhythm","pace","somewhat","decent","nd","act","manag","build","tension","intrigu","despit","inconsist","pace","inferior","perform","cast","rd","act","virtual","ani","rd","actbr","br","regard","rd","act","movi","abruptli","end","resolut","path","climax","nd","act","much","rd","act","bad","gui","die","end","credit","roll","noth","show","happen","protagonist","support","charact","audienc","like","leav","theater","movi","ask","real","letdownbr","br","music","compos","david","bell","work","adequ","enough","serv","film","much","time","certainli","noth","outstand","function","achiev","thi","mere","gener","deriv","conjur","appar","score","veri","date","us","synthes","timpani","percuss","littl","impress","score","moment","tension","herald","music","cue","sound","like","thei","rip","jame","horner","hr","commando","particularli","brassbr","br","film","potenti","basic","stori","good","execut","lacklust","mediocr","direct","weak","act","somewhat","inconsist","pacingbr","br","virtual","rd","act","properli","finish","stori","thi","omiss","major","unforgiv","doe","allow","movi","end","satisfactorili","thi","either","screenplai","possibli","product","cut","film","edit","rd","act","finish","movi","due","budget","constraint","specul","rd","act","whatev","reason","abrupt","end","realli","hurt","movi","overal","br","br","thi","good","view","re","curiou","get","movi","veri","cheap","good","learn","reason","ne","act","begin","middl","end","write","screenplai","make","moviesbr","br","otherwis","mai","want","wast","time","unless","get","mstk","version","littl","get","laugh"],"filtered2":["short","littl","bite","weak","st","act","forc","act","somewhat","disjoint","rhythm","pace","somewhat","decent","nd","act","manag","build","tension","intrigu","despit","inconsist","pace","inferior","perform","cast","rd","act","virtual","ani","rd","actbr","regard","rd","act","abruptli","end","resolut","path","climax","nd","act","rd","act","bad","gui","die","end","credit","roll","noth","show","happen","protagonist","support","charact","audienc","like","leav","theater","ask"

If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror, as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /><br />Sure, the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazed brute of a brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins' hair; the crazed mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). <br /><br />An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night, a raging storm immediately breaks out. That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside. Since it's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored, a basement mausoleum and, later, a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what a story she'll have to give her editor. <br /><br />If you sample this moist slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast he's a sad, ironic man protective of his two young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and begins to flay the man alive, ah, well, it's a great

{"value":"Having just watched this movie, I almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life, but I guess there is some good in everything:<br /><br />If I was to rate this as any other movie, it can only receive 1 or 2 tops, but if I grade it like a low budget ind. movie, it may get 3 or 4. That is a movie is supposed to be 'complete' and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time. This movie isn't. But I guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and considering this, this movie has a few highlights. If I am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project, I guess the distorted sound effects had some quality. They also manage to build some characters, this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project, because the character building takes too long, since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot. Neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project - whats the point? I guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not a lot)<br /><br />This movie tries too much and too hard, and I guess it should have been cut to a short film. I could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie.<br /><br />There is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie. The story should have been more streamlined. I know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie, but a slight surprise to who the killer is, doesn't make a mystery. The story behind the \"mystery\" receives almost no attention during the film, which leaves the final \"point\" as a quick an unsatisfying wrap-up. <br /><br />Therefore I would like to say this movie was a nice try, but I cant. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes, and produce a better product next time.<br /><br />If you don't have an interest in bench learning from producing low budget movies, there is no need to watch this - not even too see why everyone thinks its bad.<br /><br />As others have stated I am pretty sure the many 10's given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie. This movie could not receive a \"10\" judging from any remotely objective standpoint.","finished_norm":["have","just","watch","thi","movi","i","almost","feel","like","have","wast","hour","of","my","life","but","i","guess","there","be","some","good","in","everythingbr","br","if","i","be","to","rate","thi","a","ani","other","movi","it","can","onli","receiv","or","top","but","if","i","grade","it","like","a","low","budget","ind","movi","it","mai","get","or","that","be","a","movi","be","suppos","to","be","complet","and","without","too","long","passag","of","boredom","or","wast","of","time","thi","movi","be","not","but","i","guess","a","lot","of","independ","movi","be","about","show","movi","skill","and","consid","thi","thi","movi","have","a","few","highlight","if","i","be","to","comment","on","what","the","director","should","take","with","them","to","their","next","project","i","guess","the","distort","sound","effect","have","some","qualiti","thei","conjur","manag","to","build","some","charact","thi","howev","take","me","to","what","thei","should","leav","out","in","their","next","project","becaus","the","charact","build","take","too","long","sinc","it","be","mostli","irrelev","for","the","movi","plot","neither","should","the","long","space","of","time","dedic","to","walk","around","be","continu","in","the","next","project","what","the","point","i","guess","thi","movi","try","to","be","a","littl","bite","of","everyth","build","charact","suspens","and","a","plot","and","end","up","be","noth","not","a","lotbr","br","thi","movi","try","too","much","and","too","hard","and","i","guess","it","should","have","be","cut","to","a","short","film","i","can","easili","manag","to","find","on","hour","of","walk","around","or","pointless","dialogu","to","cut","from","the","moviebr","br","there","be","too","much","irrelev","thing","go","on","in","thi","movi","the","stori","should","have","be","much","streamlin","i","know","there","be","suppos","to","be","some","mysteri","in","thi","movi","but","a","slight","surpris","to","who","the","killer","be","doe","not","make","a","mysteri","the","stori","behind","the","mysteri","receiv","almost","no","attent","dure","the","film","which","leav","the","final","point","a","a","quick","a","unsatisfi","wrapup","br","br","therefor","i","would","like","to","sai","thi","movi","be","a","nice","try","but","i","cant","i","hope","the","director","learn","from","their","mistak","and","produc","a","well","product","next","timebr","br","if","you","do","not","have","a","interest","in","bench","learn","from","produc","low","budget","movi","there","be","no","ne","to","watch","thi","not","even","too","see","why","everyon","think","it","badbr","br","a","other","have","state","i","be","pretti","sure","the","mani","give","to","thi","movi","be","from","peopl","somehow","involv","in","the","movi","thi","movi","can","not","receiv","a","judg","from","ani","remot","object","standpoint"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","almost","feel","like","wast","hour","life","guess","good","everythingbr","br","rate","thi","ani","movi","onli","receiv","top","grade","like","low","budget","ind","movi","mai","get","movi","suppos","complet","without","long","passag","boredom","wast","time","thi","movi","guess","lot","independ","movi","show","movi","skill","consid","thi","thi","movi","highlight","comment","director","take","next","project","guess","distort","sound","effect","qualiti","thei","conjur","manag","build","charact","thi","howev","take","thei","leav","next","project","becaus","charact","build","take","long","sinc","mostli","irrelev","movi","plot","neither","long","space","time","dedic","walk","around","continu","next","project","point","guess","thi","movi","try","littl","bite","everyth","build","charact","suspens","plot","end","noth","lotbr","br","thi","movi","try","much","hard","guess","cut","short","film","easili","manag","find","hour","walk","around","pointless","dialogu","cut","moviebr","br","much","irrelev","thing","go","thi","movi","stori","much","streamlin","know","suppos","mysteri","thi","movi","slight","surpris","killer","doe","make","mysteri","stori","behind","mysteri","receiv","almost","attent","dure","film","leav","final","point","quick","unsatisfi","wrapup","br","br","therefor","like","sai","thi","movi","nice","try","cant","hope","director","learn","mistak","produc","well","product","next","timebr","br","interest","bench","learn","produc","low","budget","movi","ne","watch","thi","even","see","everyon","think","badbr","br","state","pretti","sure","mani","give","thi","movi","peopl","somehow","involv","movi","thi","movi","receiv","judg","ani","remot","object","standpoint"],"filtered2":["watch","almost","feel","like","wast","hour","life","guess","good","everythingbr","rate","ani","onli","receiv","top","grade","like","low","budget","ind","mai","get","suppos","complet","without","long","passag","boredom","wast","time","guess","lot","independ","show","skill","consid","highlight","comment","director","take","next","project","guess","distort","sound","effect","qualiti","conjur","manag","build"

{"value":"Silly, simplistic, and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE) goes nowhere.<br /><br />This brief (just over sixty minutes) tale isn't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns as it is a rip-off of Sam Raimi's THE QUICK & THE DEAD (his admitted homage to the spaghetti Westerns) brought into a contemporary setting. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father (a brief cameo by Gary Sinise) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by the nimble Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the dastardly Mr. Tojo (played with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadistically cripples Saki with  well, I won't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it.<br /><br />In short, Saki  a pale imitation of the Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name'  rides into the town  basically, there's a auto shop and a tavern alongside an American military base, so I guess that suffices for a town  corrupted by Tojo, the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter, Saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, by the end of the film Saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but she rises to the occasion  on her knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending  and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher.<br /><br />Don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh.<br /><br />The image quality is average for the DVD release. There is a grainy quality to several sequences, but, all in all, this isn't a bad transfer. The sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times, but, again, it isn't a bad transfer.<br /><br />Rather, it's a bad

{"value":"Hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. For every \"Godfather II,\" there are dozens of \"More American Graffiti's,\" \"Stayin' Alives,\" and \"Grease 2's.\" While the original \"Grease\" is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.<br /><br />Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.<br /><br />Reviewers have complained that, because \"Grease 2\" is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's, and the only nostalgia evoked is for \"Our Miss Brooks\" and \"Sid Caesar's Comedy Hour.\" The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, \"Grease 2\" is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse

{"value":"Dreary. Schlocky. Just plain dreadful and awful. Let's be honest, when you sit down to watch something called The Double-D Avenger you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment. You are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts. You don't get really either of these in the video. The story, as it consistent with most of these types, is inane: Kitten Natividad runs a local pub, finds out she has breast cancer, flies down to South America for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super-human abilities giver, returns and fights, dressed as the Double-D Avenger, a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition. As stories go, I have seen a lot worse, but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous. The action sequences lack zip, drive, motivation, and are tissue thin. The acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references. All could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it, but they all fall way short. Kitten, Haji, and Raven de la Croix are all quite older(still lovely in their own ways) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be: older, campy caricatures of their former selves. Instead, they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are \"starring\" in rather than their own abilities. There are some other lovely ladies, but you really do not see much of anything. PG -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this. The material, the actresses, and director are all tired, tiresome, and dated - and again - NOT FUNNY! It was a brutal hour plus sitting through this, and that is a shame as I was expecting something campy and fun. The guy playing Bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me. Not that he was good at all mind you, but every time he opened his mouth I kept thinking how truly awful he was. The lone bright spot here at all is seeing Mr. Sci-fi himself, Forrest J. Ackerman, play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax Frankenstein affectionately called Frankie.

{"value":"There is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst I have seen in some time. As F. Scott Fitzgerald (Gregory Peck) and Sheilah Graham (Deborah Kerr) are lounging on the beach, suddenly things become tense and Sheilah begins to cry--at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past. This \"dramatic scene\" becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I couldn't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was...as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo. NO ONE experiences moments like this--no one. Now how much of the rest of the film is true, I cannot say, but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an $8 Rolex--and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct--the film is a lot of bunk. However, I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn't seem to clear this up, either. <br /><br />Just who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship really like? What I do know about Fitzgerald, however, does seem different from what I saw in the film. Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film? Well, considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish, I'd assume he wasn't. Was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film? Perhaps, but if he was this bad AND yet Ms. Graham stayed with him, then this makes her out to be a complete dummy--and not someone you'd like to see featured in a film. And, if he wasn't, then the film does a poor disservice to his memory. Either way, it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience.<br /><br />The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people. In a dark and salacious way, some might find this all very entertaining, but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way! Unpleasant but with glossy production values (especially the music, which was lovely but way over the top) it begs the question \"why did they even choose to make this in the first place?\". The bottom line--it's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time--even if, like me, you are big Gregory Peck

{"value":"Why is this film so bad? Well, if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason, then this film is it. The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst. The gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad. They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say.<br /><br />Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy. His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history. However, it isn't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family. Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there. Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again.<br /><br />I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes. Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film. It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor. Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it. The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke. There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine. It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture.<br /><br />The other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes. The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it. It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it. Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired. There is no chemistry too. This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors. No body seemed to care about it, or even try. Sad thing is, no body told Chris Kattan

{"value":"Seriously, I can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women. He, John Cassavetes of \"Rosemary's Baby\", talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine. That being said, \"Incubus\" is an ultimately STRANGE horror effort. It isn't necessarily awful  although it isn't very good, neither  but just plain weird. The muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of flesh and blood (even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters. None of these characters, especially not the main ones, come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets. The aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like he's a suspect himself, the town's sheriff (John Ireland) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesn't even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district, the female reporter is even too weird for words and the Galens (an old witch and her grandson) are just plain spooky. All together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns' women reproducing organs. The sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling. Basically these are very positive factors in a horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for \"Incubus\" to be a really good film. Also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through (like footage of a Bruce Dickinson concert!) and the usually very reliable John Hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable. The final shot is effectively nightmarish, though. For me personally, \"Incubus\" was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open-minded genre

{"value":"EPSILON, a.k.a. ALIEN VISITOR, is not what I expected. This is a no-budget Australian film with no special effects other than speeded-up film and quick scene cuts. The female alien (who comes over immediately able to speak perfectly accented Australian) can \"blip\" from place to place or time to time and alter her perception of the flow of time to match the \"faster\" humans.<br /><br />An elderly grandmother tells her two granddaughters about a story a wandering man told her 40 years before, when an unnamed \"She\" came to the planet naked and completely disoriented, unable to recognize which star in the sky she came from...She meets a man alone camping in the Australian Outback, apparently bewildering him. She is here by \"mistake\", and gets angry when she is told she is on Earth. The Earthlings are known as consummate despoilers of the environment and a metaphor for the most insulting thing imaginable to the rest of the universe: those who \"breathe the foul air\" but do nothing about it, sticking their heads under the sand like an ostrich. In another amusing metaphor, Earthlings are \"frogs\".<br /><br />From there, it is entirely a film about dialogue, as the perplexed man tries to understand She's peculiar psychology and viewpoints, even as She calls him unintelligent and \"quaint\". The man begins to realize maybe it's humans who are irrational and not thinking straight. Yet, while waiting to be \"beamed up\" back home, She sees that this human is not entirely faulty in his thinking and even falls in love with him.<br /><br />The dialogue about perspectives is in spots interesting, but it is all layered with a heavy-handed environmental message and a low-budget feel (there are only two main actors, who blip around various deserted scenes, and the evil despoiling humans on the planet are never seen at all). The environmental message offers no solutions, but paints one or two dire metaphors about what will happen to nature and man if something isn't done. The logic also doesn't hang together: the rest of the universe has \"given up\" on Earth, yet one space woman caught on Earth by mistake manages to effect some positive change by the conclusion of the movie.

{"value":"The version of this film I saw was titled 'Horror Rises from the Tomb'. The horror in question is a wicked Medieval magician played by Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy looking like he's playing Abanazer in a church hall panto. He rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant (I think he's a descendant, as he's also played by Naschy)returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magician's head and body, which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him, in an attempt to stop him, er, rising from the tomb.<br /><br />Obviously, once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die. Like all good magicians, Abanazer here has a lovely assistant. This one's played by another Spanish horror great, the beautiful Helga Line. Like practically every other woman in the film Line periodically gets her kit off. There's a LOT of nudity in this film, and not just female - we even get to see Naschy's paunchy body, which isn't a pretty sight, I can tell you. Most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous. There's one particularly funny scene where Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they've possessed.<br /><br />It's also pretty gory in places - notably a Herschell Gordon Lewis-esquire moment where Line plunges her hands into a man's chest to remove his heart.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end. They're quickly scared off by a fire though, and don't bother coming back. Which is a shame. The scene where the zombies rise, however, is the film's most ludicrously inept moment. It all happens in long shot, and we haven't really got a clue what's happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance. There are several rubbish moments like this, thanks largely to poor editing. When a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of Naschy's head there's a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all, not a great horror film, but entertaining enough. Of course, the version I saw was a dubbed American version that had probably been chopped to pieces. For all I know, the original Spanish version could be a

{"value":"I had high hopes for it when I heard that it was being made back in 2001 because I read \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\" when I was a kid and I found it very interesting. They made some changes to the story that don't make much sense to me. Daniel Webster in the story was a famous lawyer from New Hampshire in the story. In the movie he is an editor. A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil him/herself (he was a man in the story, but was a woman in the movie) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line. As an editor, it doesn't seem likely that Daniel Webster would have the skill to do this.<br /><br />The acting was decent by all except for Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd. These are two actors that I like, they just did an awful job in this movie. It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy, but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy. This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind, and was then re-edited by somebody else. Given this fact, it's surprising that it was at all coherent. I was surprised to see a fair amount of SNL cast members in the movie, which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy.<br /><br />All in all I would have to say it wasn't completely awful, but it wasn't much good. If I could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it, I would. The ending was especially disappointing. As in the original story, Daniel Webster defeats the devil in the trial. Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally, we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez, and then the movie abruptly ends. It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez' first scene over and called it the end. There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained, so who is to say he didn't just repeat his mistakes over again, and perhaps over and over in an endless loop? It was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense. The decent cast, and the acting of everyone except for Baldwin and Aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich.","finished_norm":["i","have","high","hope","for","it","when","i","hear","that","it","be","be","make","back","in","becaus","i","read","the","devil","and","daniel","webster","when","i","be","a","kid","and","i","find","it","veri","interest","thei","make","some","chang","to","the","stori","that","do","not","make","much","sens","to","me","daniel","webster","in","the","stori","be","a","famou","lawyer","from","new","hampshir","in","the","stori","in","the","movi","he","be","a","editor","a","lawyer","make","much","sens","sinc","he","end","up","repres","jabez","stone","against","the","devil","himherself","he","be","a","man","in","the","stori","but","be","a","woman","in","the","movi","in","a","trial","where","both","of","their","soul","be","on","the","line","a","a","editor","it","doe","not","seem","like","that","daniel","webster","would","have","the","skill","to","do","thisbr","br","the","act","be","decent","by","all","except","for","alec","baldwin","and","dan","aykroyd","thi","be","two","actor","that","i","like","thei","just","do","a","aw","job","in","thi","movi","it","be","a","though","thei","think","thei","be","act","in","a","comedi","but","the","movi","be","much","a","seriou","on","than","a","comedi","thi","mai","be","partli","due","to","the","fact","that","the","movi","be","film","with","a","particular","vision","in","mind","and","be","then","reedit","by","somebodi","els","give","thi","fact","it","surpris","that","it","be","at","all","coher","i","be","surpris","to","see","a","fair","amount","of","snl","cast","member","in","the","movi","which","far","lead","me","to","believ","it","mai","have","origin","be","film","with","the","intent","of","it","be","much","of","a","comedybr","br","all","in","all","i","would","have","to","sai","it","be","not","complet","aw","but","it","be","not","much","good","if","i","can","get","the","hour","and","a","half","back","and","do","someth","els","with","it","i","would","the","end","be","especi","disappoint","a","in","the","origin","stori","daniel","webster","defeat","the","devil","in","the","trial","jabez","then","start","out","again","at","the","begin","of","the","movieliter","we","be","just","bring","back","to","the","scene","with","jabez","and","then","the","movi","abruptli","end","it","actual","look","a","though","thei","just","replai","jabez","scene","over","and","call","it","the","end","there","be","no","indic","that","jabez","have","the","benefit","of","ani","of","the","knowledg","or","experi","he","gain","so","who","be","to","sai","he","do","not","just","repeat","hi","mistak","over","again","and","perhap","over","and","over","in","a","endless","loop","it","be","a","extrem","disappoint","end","and","do","not","make","a","lot","of","sens","the","decent","cast","and","the","act","of","everyon","except","for","baldwin","and","aykroyd","be","the","onli","thing","that","keep","thi","from","be","a","complet","and","total","crap","sandwich"],"filtered":["high","hope","hear","make","back","becaus","read","devil","daniel","webster","kid","find","veri","interest","thei","make","chang","stori","make","much","sens","daniel","webster","stori","famou","lawyer","new","hampshir","stori","movi","editor","lawyer","make","much","sens","sinc","end","repres","jabez","stone","devil","himherself","man","stori","woman","movi","trial","soul","line","editor","doe","seem","like","daniel","webster","skill","thisbr","br","act","decent","except","alec","baldwin","dan","aykroyd","thi","two","actor","like","thei","aw","job","thi","movi","though","thei","think","thei","act","comedi","movi","much","seriou","comedi","thi","mai","partli","due","fact","movi","film","particular","vision","mind","reedit","somebodi","els","give","thi","fact","surpris","coher","surpris","see","fair","amount","snl","cast","member","movi","far","lead","believ","mai","origin","film","intent","much","comedybr","br","sai","complet","aw","much","good","get","hour","half","back","someth","els","end","especi","disappoint","origin","stori","daniel","webster","defeat","devil","trial","jabez","start","begin","movieliter","bring","back","scene","jabez","movi","abruptli","end","actual","look","though","thei","replai","jabez","scene","call","end","indic","jabez","benefit","ani","knowledg","experi","gain","sai","repeat","hi","mistak","perhap","endless","loop","extrem","disappoint","end","make","lot","sens","decent","cast","act","everyon","except","baldwin","aykroyd","onli","thing","keep","thi","complet","total","crap","sandwich"],"filtered2":["high","hope","hear","make","back","becaus","read","devil","daniel","webster","kid","find","veri","interest","make","chang","stori","make","sens","daniel","webster","stori","famou","lawyer","new","hampshir","stori","editor","lawyer","make","sens","sinc","end","repres","jabez","stone","devil","himherself","man","stori","woman","trial","soul","line","editor","doe","seem","like","daniel","webster","skill","thisbr","act","decent","except","alec","baldwin","dan","aykroyd","two","actor","like","aw","job","t

{"value":"It seems a shame that Greta Garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken-identity marital romp. Coming off the success of her first romantic comedy, Ernst Lubitsch's masterful \"Ninotchka\" (1939), where she was ideally cast as an austere Russian envoy, Garbo is reunited with her leading man Melvyn Douglas for a sitcom-level story that has her playing Karin Borg, a plain-Jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive Larry Blake when he becomes smitten with her. Once he makes clear that work is his priority, Karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high-living twin sister Katherine to test her husband's fidelity when he is back in Manhattan.<br /><br />It's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by George Cukor, who led Garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937's \"Camille\", because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend. Only someone with Carole Lombard's natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by-the-numbers script by S.N. Behrman, Salka Viertel and George Oppenheimer. MGM's intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and Americanize Garbo's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties.<br /><br />However, Garbo appears ill-at-ease mostly as the bogus party girl Katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like Douglas and Constance Bennett as romantic rival Griselda. Photographed unflatteringly by Joseph Ruttenberg, Garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the \"chica-choca\" dance sequence. The story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where Larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of Sonny Bono's death. Roland Young and Ruth Gordon (in a rare appearance at this point of her career) show up in comic supporting roles as Douglas' associates. This movie is not yet on DVD, and I wouldn't consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in Garbo's otherwise legendary career. She was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming. I can see

{"value":"When this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel. There's nothing special here that you need to see. Story is about two married couples from Arkansas who go on a trip together to Reno. Couple number one is Lonnie Earl Dodd (Billy Bob Thornton) who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage. His wife is Darlene (Natasha Richardson) and she has a low self opinion of herself and they haven't been intimate in a long time. Lonnie has been sleeping with Candy (Charlize Theron) who is the wife of his best friend Roy Kirkendall (Patrick Swayze). They all drive to Reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite. Roy and Candy have been trying to have a baby and finally Candy discovers that she is pregnant. But Roy phones his doctor in Arkansas and finds out that he's sterile. Candy and Lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos. This film is directed by Jordan Brady and he's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive. Unfortunately Brady doesn't show much comedic flair but you can't lay all the blame on him. This script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level. Just because they're all from the south doesn't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic. Thornton's character doesn't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar. And Swayze's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day. Penelope Cruz pops up as a prostitute and it's a totally worthless and pointless cameo. She barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines! I think she was fulfilling an obligation to Harvey and Bob Weinstein who are executive producers for this film. The only person who actually isn't to bad is Richardson. We watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche. All of these actors should know better and it's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it. It's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid.

I generally love mystery-horror films like this. \"Cube\", Spielberg's \"Duel\" and \"The Birds\" are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more. Apparently, \"Disappearance\" writer/director Walter Klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film, and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer. I personally think he got about half way there, then the film just sunk.<br /><br />The actors are all kind of just \"ho-hum\". Their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways. Is anyone else absolutely SICK of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them SOME kind of justification for doing so!?!?!?<br /><br />As far as made-for-TV films go it's an above average fair for sure. Director Klenhard Should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking. There's a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see. I wonder if that was real<br /><br />No gore to speak of, and the 'creatures'or what ever the hell it is that's after these peopleare never shown, not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are (Mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil Indian spiritsOh, that really narrows it down for us!) or where the come from. <br /><br />There are lots of clichés here, too. Why is it that towns-folk in these kinds of films are always really, really dumb? Why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? How 'bout a NEW scenario, folks! <br /><br />\"Disappearance\" tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways it's too familiar to us fans of direct-to-video horror fodder. Hey, I've seen much worse films, and disappearance ain't bad, it's just too Average.<br /><br

{"value":"This is one of those films the British Lottery Fund wastes its money on. The main problem is a rambling script which gets nowhere. The characters are not interesting, the story is conventional and insipid, the only thing of interest is the location: the city of Genoa (Genova in Italian). Having only a superficial acquaintance with Genoa, I had no idea of the intricate alleyways of its Old Town, and that the city was so interesting. I had thought Genoa was dull. I am delighted to say that I have been proved wrong. So from the travelogue point of view, this film has interest. The film contains one splendid performance, by a little girl named Perla Haney-Jardine. She has already made seven films despite being only 12, so she seems determined upon a career as an actress, and judging by her performance in this film, she should go far, as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent. Colin Firth, a reliable and professional actor, was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest, he was earnest, and when asked to be anguished, he was anguished. But somebody forgot to give him any worthwhile dialogue. The script is a total shambles. Catherine Keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role, and showing sympathy comes naturally to her, so that everybody would like to have her around (I would like to tell her every time I feel a cold coming on, as I know she would get me a soothing hot drink). So there we have it: Genoa's fascinating narrow alleys, an interesting little girl, and a sympathetic woman. Forget the rest. The older sister played by Willa Holland is such a disgusting character that the fact that the young actress does a good job of being repellent is not exactly the kind of acting tribute she would like to hear, I suspect. The notion that this family go off to Genoa to forget the unfortunate death of the mother is so trite that if we have another film like that, all dead mothers have a right to complain at being exploited. If Michael Winterbottom wanted to make a film about how interesting the old portion of Genoa is, why didn't he just go to the BBC and say he wanted to make a travel film with some mindless celebrity presenter? Why waste money on a feature film which is nothing but a vanity project of idle and meandering vacuity?","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","that","film","the","british","lotteri","fund","wast","it","monei","on","the","main","problem","be","a","rambl","script","which","get","nowher","the","charact","be","not","interest","the","stori","be","convent","and","insipid","the","onli","thing","of","interest","be","the","locat","the","citi","of","genoa","genova","in","italian","have","onli","a","superfici","acquaint","with","genoa","i","have","no","idea","of","the","intric","alleywai","of","it","old","town","and","that","the","citi","be","so","interest","i","have","think","genoa","be","dull","i","be","delight","to","sai","that","i","have","be","prove","wrong","so","from","the","travelogu","point","of","view","thi","film","have","interest","the","film","contain","on","splendid","perform","by","a","littl","girl","name","perla","haneyjardin","she","have","alreadi","make","seven","film","despit","be","onli","so","she","seem","determin","upon","a","career","a","a","actress","and","judg","by","her","perform","in","thi","film","she","should","go","far","a","she","be","a","natur","and","have","a","great","deal","of","talent","colin","firth","a","reliabl","and","profession","actor","be","on","hand","for","the","film","and","when","ask","to","be","earnest","he","be","earnest","and","when","ask","to","be","anguish","he","be","anguish","but","somebodi","forget","to","give","him","ani","worthwhil","dialogu","the","script","be","a","total","shambl","catherin","keen","doe","exception","good","in","a","support","role","and","show","sympathi","come","natur","to","her","so","that","everybodi","would","like","to","have","her","around","i","would","like","to","tell","her","everi","time","i","feel","a","cold","come","on","a","i","know","she","would","get","me","a","sooth","hot","drink","so","there","we","have","it","genoa","fascin","narrow","allei","a","interest","littl","girl","and","a","sympathet","woman","forget","the","rest","the","old","sister","plai","by","willa","holland","be","such","a","disgust","charact","that","the","fact","that","the","young","actress","doe","a","good","job","of","be","repel","be","not","exactli","the","kind","of","act","tribut","she","would","like","to","hear","i","suspect","the","notion","that","thi","famili","go","off","to","genoa","to","forget","the","unfortun","death","of","the","mother","be","so","trite","that","if","we","have","anoth","film","like","that","all","dead","mother","have","a","right","to","complain","at","be","exploit","if","michael","winterbottom","want","to","make","a","film","about","how","interest","the","old","portion","of","genoa","be","why","do","not","he","just","go","to","the","bbc","and","sai","he","want","to","make","a","travel","film","with","some","mindless","celebr","present","why","wast","monei","on","a","featur","film","which","be","noth","but","a","vaniti","project","of","idl","and","meander","vacuiti"],"filtered":["thi","film","british","lotteri","fund","wast","monei","main","problem","rambl","script","get","nowher","charact","interest","stori","convent","insipid","onli","thing","interest","locat","citi","genoa","genova","italian","onli","superfici","acquaint","genoa","idea","intric","alleywai","old","town","citi","interest","think","genoa","dull","delight","sai","prove","wrong","travelogu","point","view","thi","film","interest","film","contain","splendid","perform","littl","girl","name","perla","haneyjardin","alreadi","make","seven","film","despit","onli","seem","determin","upon","career","actress","judg","perform","thi","film","go","far","natur","great","deal","talent","colin","firth","reliabl","profession","actor","hand","film","ask","earnest","earnest","ask","anguish","anguish","somebodi","forget","give","ani","worthwhil","dialogu","script","total","shambl","catherin","keen","doe","exception","good","support","role","show","sympathi","come","natur","everybodi","like","around","like","tell","everi","time","feel","cold","come","know","get","sooth","hot","drink","genoa","fascin","narrow","allei","interest","littl","girl","sympathet","woman","forget","rest","old","sister","plai","willa","holland","disgust","charact","fact","young","actress","doe","good","job","repel","exactli","kind","act","tribut","like","hear","suspect","notion","thi","famili","go","genoa","forget","unfortun","death","mother","trite","anoth","film","like","dead","mother","right","complain","exploit","michael","winterbottom","want","make","film","interest","old","portion","genoa","go","bbc","sai","want","make","travel","film","mindless","celebr","present","wast","monei","featur","film","noth","vaniti","project","idl","meander","vacuiti"],"filtered2":["british","lotteri","fund","wast","monei","main","problem","rambl","script","get","nowher","charact","interest","stori","convent","insipid","onli","thing","interest","locat","citi","genoa","genova","italian","onli","superfici","acquaint","genoa","idea","intric","alleywai","old","town","citi","interest","think","genoa","dull","delight","prove","wron

{"value":"This movie was bad beyond belief. I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival. Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before, which happened to be its \"world premiere.\" I don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. We all understood by the end. <br /><br />Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige, in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. A scene would start going then someone would say \"wow you're so great Bettie, why don't we make another movie.\" this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring than) the normal part of the movie. by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up. it was that ludicrous. I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre, but people were not laughing with the movie maker, they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure. This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory. <br /><br />I know movies are expensive. I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen. The movie looks like it was made for $12. The cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. This movie makes \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" look like Citizen Kane. <br /><br />My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured. The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. Apparently, the previous night, the night of the \"world premiere\" the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie.

{"value":"I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub. I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work.<br /><br />This said, I should have LOVED 1408.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** <br /><br />I walked in eager. I walked out disappointed.<br /><br />This is not the fault of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts Cusack in the \"guy in a locked room\" scenario.<br /><br />This wasn't a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one either. It was a muddied mess that had moments of \"ouch, that's just WRONG,\" combined with moments of \"ouch, that's just painful,\" and moments of \"oh, now THAT'S just unfortunate\" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room. <br /><br />A previous commenter described the Olin/Enslin argument as worth watching, and I very much agree. But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before upping the ante...at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters \"We've Only Just Begun.\") it's mostly \"stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it!\" type horror that was fun when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends my age, clutching each other in the summer while Jason stalked Camp Crystal Lake.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was \"let's make him relive some of his most painful experiences\" mindgaming, with \"let's animate the paintings in creepy ways\" cliché cheesiness.<br /><br />******END SPOILERS***** <br /><br />I expected better from this movie with Stephen King's name attached to it, as well as the actors I mentioned above.<br /><br />We never find out the origin of the evil.

{"value":"\"Metamorphosis\" hold a tiny bit of cult-value, simply because it was written and directed by George Eastman. This Italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid Joe D'Amato production during the late 70's/early 80's. Wouldn't it be interesting for avid Euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in \"Erotic Nights of the Living Dead\" all the time? I thought so! Now, unlike the movies he starred in, Eastman's own \"Metamorphosis\" is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. There are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen Laura Gemser!) on display, but it's mainly a talkative movie. The handsome & eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. Needless to say (and like the title implies), he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! In other words, his research sucked! Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie \"borrows\" a lot of ideas from David Cronenberg's \"The Fly\"  the dramatic romance sub plot included - but doesn't add any originality from its own. The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblum's character in \"The Fly\", whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. The rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodato's sadly underrated giallo \"Phantom of Death\", only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't inflict it on himself. The physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films, though. Few scares or excitement to discover here, instead the movie features loads of bad acting, poor lighting, lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. Feel free to skip this

{"value":"Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath Stanley Kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.<br /><br />Film pokes gleeful fun at Hollywood, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. Brian Krause, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison(..played by Dahlia Salem)seem to be taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.","finished_norm":["preposter","sequel","stretch","credibl","to","a","great","degre","a","diabol","sociopath","stanlei","kaldwel","return","thi","time","infiltr","the","movi","product","of","the","novel","he","write","for","the","garden","drown","assum","the","ident","of","a","unit","director","he","murderedbr","br","film","poke","gleeful","fun","at","hollywood","with","a","tongueincheek","script","take","shot","at","tyrann","director","who","sleep","with","their","actresseslook","for","a","wai","up","the","ladderand","dislik","anyon","challeng","them","for","complet","spotlight","brian","kraus","who","i","think","be","dread","overact","to","the","point","where","the","satir","feel","incredibli","forc","portrai","the","loud","temperament","director","who","doe","not","like","the","fact","that","hi","unit","director","and","screenplai","writer","alisonplai","by","dahlia","salemseem","to","be","take","over","the","product","andrew","moxham","be","paul","parson","who","be","the","brother","of","a","victim","from","the","film","the","film","dark","humor","thi","time","take","the","idea","of","a","serial","killer","actual","oper","a","director","of","a","movi","set","and","exploit","it","for","all","it","worth","nelson","again","abli","slide","back","into","hi","psycho","role","without","ani","difficulti","with","stanlei","a","clever","a","ever","us","hi","brain","to","command","a","film","product","kill","whoever","he","have","to","in","order","to","maintain","full","control","of","hi","work","let","no","on","stand","in","hi","waythat","be","until","alison","realiz","who","stanlei","realli","be","alison","be","the","typ","of","ambiti","writer","who","want","to","captur","the","essenc","of","her","subjectwhat","motiv","stanlei","to","kill","why","would","he","do","such","a","thing","and","what","lead","such","a","man","down","thi","dark","path","the","humor","of","alison","actual","work","with","that","veri","man","be","conjur","part","of","the","satir","at","the","heart","of","thi","dark","comedi","thriller","of","cours","you","get","the","inevit","showdown","between","alison","and","stanlei","with","a","realli","ridicul","unbeliev","conclus","regard","the","killer","fatequit","a","hard","pill","to","swallow","unlik","the","film","which","be","photograph","with","sophist","polish","director","pochih","leong","us","unnecessari","techniqu","which","be","not","neededsuch","a","shoot","a","all","kind","of","weird","angl","slowmot","in","a","sepium","color","and","sever","instanc","which","be","captur","on","videoand","rather","annoi","instead","of","impress","thi","sequel","to","me","just","be","not","on","target","a","much","a","the","origin","with","a","lot","of","the","humor","littl","effect","and","much","obviou"],"filtered":["preposter","sequel","stretch","credibl","great","degre","diabol","sociopath","stanlei","kaldwel","return","thi","time","infiltr","movi","product","novel","write","garden","drown","assum","ident","unit","director","murderedbr","br","film","poke","gleeful","fun","hollywood","tongueincheek","script","take","shot","tyrann","director","sleep","actresseslook","wai","ladderand","dislik","anyon","challeng","complet","spotlight","brian","kraus","think","dread","overact","point","satir","feel","incredibli","forc","portrai","loud","temperament","director","doe","like","fact","hi","unit","director","screenplai","writer","alisonplai","dahlia","salemseem","take","product","andrew","moxham","paul","parson","brother","victim","film","film","dark","humor","thi","time","take","idea","serial","killer","actual","oper","director","movi","set","exploit","worth","nelson","abli","slide","back","hi","psycho","role","without","ani","difficulti","stanlei","clever","ever","us","hi","brain","command","film","product","kill","whoever","order","maintain","full","control","hi","work","let","stand","hi","waythat","alison","realiz","stanlei","realli","alison","typ","ambiti","writer","want","captur","essenc","subjectwhat","motiv","stanlei","kill","thing","lead","man","thi","dark","path","humor","alison","actual","work","veri","man","conjur","part","satir","heart","thi","dark","comedi","thriller","cours","get","inevit","showdown","alison","stanlei","realli","ridicul","unbeliev","conclus","regard","killer","fatequit","hard","pill","swallow","unlik","film","photograph","sophist","polish","director","pochih","leong","us","unnecessari","techniqu","neededsuch","shoot","kind","weird","angl","slowmot","sepium","color","sever","instanc","captur","videoand","rather","annoi","instead","impress","thi","sequel","target","much","origin","lot","humor","littl","effect","much","obviou"],"filtered2":["preposter","sequel","stretch","credibl","great","degre","diabol","sociopath","stanlei","kaldwel","return","time","infiltr","product","novel","write","garden","drown","assum","ident","unit","director","murderedbr","poke","gleeful","fun","hollywood","tongueincheek","script","take","shot","tyrann","director","sleep","actresseslook","wai",

{"value":"Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover, and is later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments.<br /><br />Upon hearing of Naschy's death from colleague Jon Kitley, I rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch. In my scramble, I found I own not one but three(!) copies of \"Fury of the Wolfman\". The film is of questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion, the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times. And the American versions have two love scenes removed. Quite frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory.<br /><br />This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you wouldn't know this from the film itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there's really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you'll see that I'm not alone in my confusion.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. While floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involved in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. Those really aren't light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf.<br /><br />Chances are, sooner or later you'll come across a low-grade version of \"Fury of the Wolfman\". It appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets, so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know. What really needs to happen is an American uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in. As far as I know, this does not exist. Let us honor Paul Naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he
