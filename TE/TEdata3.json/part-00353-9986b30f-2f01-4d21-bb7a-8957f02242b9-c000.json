{"value":"Weak plot, unlikely car malfunction, and helpless fumbling characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.","finished_norm":["weak","plot","unlik","car","malfunct","and","helpless","fumbl","charact","at","i","think","thi","movi","be","make","dure","the","seventi","sinc","the","pictur","qualiti","a","good","a","the","storylin","and","drama","seem","take","from","a","old","kojac","episod","when","i","check","and","find","that","it","be","realli","make","a","late","a","i","be","astonish","thi","be","by","far","on","of","the","wrong","and","littl","thriller","movi","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","if","you","read","thi","be","advis","if","you","see","it","you","wast","time","when","you","can","have","do","someth","much","excit","like","watch","paint","spindri"],"filtered":["weak","plot","unlik","car","malfunct","helpless","fumbl","charact","think","thi","movi","make","dure","seventi","sinc","pictur","qualiti","good","storylin","drama","seem","take","old","kojac","episod","check","find","realli","make","late","astonish","thi","far","wrong","littl","thriller","movi","ever","seenbr","br","read","thi","advis","see","wast","time","someth","much","excit","like","watch","paint","spindri"],"filtered2":["weak","plot","unlik","car","malfunct","helpless","fumbl","charact","think","make","dure","seventi","sinc","pictur","qualiti","good","storylin","drama","seem","take","old","kojac","check","find","realli","make","late","astonish","far","wrong","littl","thriller","ever","seenbr","read","advis","see","wast","time","someth","excit","like","watch","paint","spindri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,10,12,13,14,25,31,32,35,38,44,53,67,89,101,145,150,162,239,284,311,319,379,463,504,515,524,615,714,868,1447,2043,2930,3065,4228,4729,6235],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,10,12,13,14,25,31,32,35,38,44,53,67,89,101,145,150,162,239,284,311,319,379,463,504,515,524,615,714,868,1447,2043,2930,3065,4228,4729,6235],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,1.9570915389266579,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.34599021453259,2.332712011146513,2.3586007221245198,2.6593400337329487,3.110998680163279,2.9203338091782562,2.9056060024680126,3.1272886331425473,3.3467891931782563,3.41740676039221,3.3956930001684253,3.4028786598293,3.5013187326425523,3.7297814454343623,3.944626193933877,4.477736862489302,4.900964426937307,5.373120909544144,5.5623629091826725,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1013413654173507E-4,1.0939147631177488E-4,1.1024189072995018E-4,1.0960491191086633E-4,1.0960670766394664E-4,1.0945349939023779E-4,1.0977902943327885E-4,1.0940722796957845E-4,1.096532153017191E-4,1.2165425664408353E-4,0.617758834487997,1.0923062058200622E-4,1.1126935594802422E-4,1.1285663776050916E-4,1.0931027041105173E-4,1.0900818398657645E-4,1.1172725677807174E-4,1.0978931489968988E-4,1.0944869397790387E-4,1.0953940748556513E-4,1.1059926549914216E-4,1.0989808832884215E-4,1.1002322397465096E-4,1.1014176165837639E-4,1.1098704309411629E-4,1.1040661210397792E-4,1.1504789633509414E-4,1.0926309384397365E-4,1.0926601688761475E-4,1.0954284172349848E-4,1.1187114918007465E-4,1.0978295354641128E-4,1.1784270072913788E-4,1.1009175679444113E-4,1.0938202180793244E-4,1.0988689194394722E-4,1.0927241828864415E-4,1.0933699024816873E-4,1.0900763632064641E-4,1.0903591793066264E-4,1.0928134453046207E-4,1.104340311547766E-4,1.0987286943460589E-4,1.0943846282261654E-4,1.1076825489914757E-4,1.0948046590267156E-4,0.2426365126938212,1.1145452557959866E-4,1.0906301931703796E-4,1.0930405525938998E-4,1.092661444949771E-4,1.1234130453711384E-4,1.0930568149535334E-4,1.0902623803274072E-4,1.1022295702371734E-4,1.093338357372297E-4,1.1757652423603635E-4,1.0924373045002063E-4,1.0906175806578701E-4,1.0958249595092578E-4,1.106694622132889E-4,1.0957524644550306E-4,1.0904158139672373E-4,1.0929546801849098E-4,1.0900895478730384E-4,1.1153119605916688E-4,1.0994801576174767E-4,1.0971381039036903E-4,1.0961786070461464E-4,1.1001743523163101E-4,1.0900497796775055E-4,1.0962015879171435E-4,0.13111307205163986,1.0920032094304978E-4,1.119029719894139E-4,1.0948903549743861E-4,1.1034595159045943E-4,1.0967156567718101E-4,1.0897080169670843E-4,1.0910587848958958E-4]}}

{"value":"This picture started out with good intentions, Bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is cute as usual in her role. It all falls apart after that, it's your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul. In other words, don't waste your time watching this. Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead, also starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike with this mess.","finished_norm":["thi","pictur","start","out","with","good","intent","bacon","the","scientist","out","to","test","the","theori","of","invis","and","shue","be","cute","a","usual","in","her","role","it","all","fall","apart","after","that","it","your","typic","hollywood","thriller","now","film","on","a","soundstag","with","special","effect","galor","minu","ani","kind","of","humour","wit","or","soul","in","other","word","do","not","wast","your","time","watch","thi","get","the","audiocassett","tape","with","john","delanci","a","the","invis","man","instead","conjur","star","leonard","nimoi","now","that","be","good","and","hg","well","be","good","serv","unlik","with","thi","mess"],"filtered":["thi","pictur","start","good","intent","bacon","scientist","test","theori","invis","shue","cute","usual","role","fall","apart","typic","hollywood","thriller","film","soundstag","special","effect","galor","minu","ani","kind","humour","wit","soul","word","wast","time","watch","thi","get","audiocassett","tape","john","delanci","invis","man","instead","conjur","star","leonard","nimoi","good","hg","well","good","serv","unlik","thi","mess"],"filtered2":["pictur","start","good","intent","bacon","scientist","test","theori","invis","shue","cute","usual","role","fall","apart","typic","hollywood","thriller","soundstag","special","effect","galor","minu","ani","kind","humour","wit","soul","word","wast","time","watch","get","audiocassett","tape","john","delanci","invis","man","instead","conjur","star","leonard","nimoi","good","hg","well","good","serv","unlik","mess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,20,27,39,45,71,89,100,106,122,128,152,170,203,258,265,291,300,311,407,572,613,615,714,805,811,815,851,855,1007,1243,1306,1403,1523,1784,2543,3227,3634,6879,7114],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,20,27,39,45,71,89,100,106,122,128,152,170,203,258,265,291,300,311,407,572,613,615,714,805,811,815,851,855,1007,1243,1306,1403,1523,1784,2543,3227,3634,6879,7114],"values":[2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,1.9214926742550966,1.9940046109572438,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.2489347673732487,2.3409902041158843,2.3131195476980753,2.4071371113909277,2.569760528637609,2.7061321952397077,2.73529586597515,3.016831637578237,2.932274249550174,2.9203338091782562,3.120015873813468,3.4933926673701317,3.5364100524538222,3.5013187326425523,3.7297814454343623,4.096025840389245,3.8425769395797067,3.7881170224473255,3.857614816944247,3.9201351739255808,4.181290492043933,4.4637506205145625,4.499089986959872,4.550761997504193,4.733083554298147,10.612859070090943,5.7446844659766265,5.541743621979936,6.0662680901040895,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.43230169659224E-5,8.375440714940906E-5,8.440551780105236E-5,8.39178218199958E-5,8.39191967190254E-5,8.380189445227202E-5,8.40511330281051E-5,8.376646723677089E-5,8.395480479161828E-5,0.4247961659323723,1.0847862516027464E-4,8.363124969018472E-5,8.519218549316E-5,8.640747073901243E-5,8.369223272502599E-5,8.346094350357237E-5,0.22463384741415307,8.405900798482529E-5,8.379821524000883E-5,8.386766906137382E-5,8.46791379489195E-5,8.414228919081516E-5,8.423809795198503E-5,8.43288550544579E-5,8.497603569331337E-5,8.453163494922221E-5,8.808518429598423E-5,8.365611249390571E-5,8.36583504908273E-5,8.387029844870651E-5,8.56529420079844E-5,8.405413748311454E-5,9.02249962174776E-5,8.4290569368272E-5,8.374716841024115E-5,8.413371679915623E-5,8.366325165466765E-5,8.371269048089798E-5,8.34605241890441E-5,8.34821776995369E-5,8.367008593569884E-5,8.455262805052836E-5,8.412298061571464E-5,8.37903818660163E-5,8.480852286526937E-5,8.38225410724469E-5,8.660754786578358E-5,8.533395862976517E-5,8.350292758449432E-5,8.368747416101054E-5,8.365844819203163E-5,8.601291139979247E-5,8.368871927108299E-5,8.347476638981651E-5,8.439102141253895E-5,8.371027526352956E-5,0.2952169901445586,8.364128711961134E-5,8.350196192104092E-5,0.04892373999271536,8.473288330802262E-5,8.389510877554221E-5,8.34865138714065E-5,8.368089943238638E-5,8.346153365885804E-5,8.539266055772705E-5,8.418051559276603E-5,8.400119876944133E-5,8.39277359246432E-5,8.423366586315944E-5,8.345848884974443E-5,8.392949543031132E-5,8.52907761300483E-5,8.360805109754113E-5,8.567730679964735E-5,8.382910229049994E-5,8.448519087955229E-5,8.396885455920163E-5,8.343232215544411E-5,8.353574224893622E-5]}}
{"value":"Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due, though. Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, that has any form of self-respect to account for.","finished_norm":["shortli","after","see","thi","film","i","question","the","mental","compet","of","everi","actor","and","actress","that","accept","a","role","elizabeth","shue","be","a","commend","actress","why","would","she","embrac","such","a","overr","opportun","i","must","give","credit","where","credit","be","due","though","some","moment","in","the","movi","be","unpredict","and","rather","transfix","but","thei","hardli","make","up","for","the","scath","pervers","tendenc","of","kevin","bacon","charact","sebastian","cain","i","would","not","recommend","thi","movi","to","anyon","man","or","woman","that","have","ani","form","of","selfrespect","to","account","for"],"filtered":["shortli","see","thi","film","question","mental","compet","everi","actor","actress","accept","role","elizabeth","shue","commend","actress","embrac","overr","opportun","must","give","credit","credit","due","though","moment","movi","unpredict","rather","transfix","thei","hardli","make","scath","pervers","tendenc","kevin","bacon","charact","sebastian","cain","recommend","thi","movi","anyon","man","woman","ani","form","selfrespect","account"],"filtered2":["shortli","see","question","mental","compet","everi","actor","actress","accept","role","elizabeth","shue","commend","actress","embrac","overr","opportun","must","give","credit","credit","due","though","moment","unpredict","rather","transfix","hardli","make","scath","pervers","tendenc","kevin","bacon","charact","sebastian","cain","recommend","anyon","man","woman","ani","form","selfrespect","account"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,27,30,41,45,70,85,86,128,141,158,160,188,298,354,356,378,568,665,690,742,911,993,1360,1485,1501,1908,2111,2759,2983,3253,3634,3690,3709,4041,4225,4968,6492],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,27,30,41,45,70,85,86,128,141,158,160,188,298,354,356,378,568,665,690,742,911,993,1360,1485,1501,1908,2111,2759,2983,3253,3634,3690,3709,4041,4225,4968,6492],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.1238870241028365,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,2.094675786251684,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,2.3409902041158843,2.2657547357741192,2.3106972614914807,2.3722295531801256,2.5378812223426954,2.7819920465008363,6.063293446726755,6.056670924119444,3.130944944345658,3.4471119148061256,3.5929222627171646,3.607563812710113,3.7165362186843414,3.969732115064953,4.026392148630444,4.396611317676934,4.679973728984199,4.597282013139085,5.444579873526289,4.9909126636002465,5.444579873526289,5.408212229355414,5.626901430320244,6.0662680901040895,5.672363804397,6.342521466732247,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.192992645449403E-5,8.137745380675817E-5,8.201008591270418E-5,8.153623076261788E-5,8.153756664195938E-5,8.14235934181131E-5,8.16657585934398E-5,8.138917162837013E-5,8.157216415606278E-5,9.049986328216128E-5,0.431779197150785,8.125779156103168E-5,8.277442794501728E-5,8.395522334817701E-5,8.131704389496486E-5,8.109231867064004E-5,8.31150651217116E-5,8.167341005858099E-5,8.142001862203748E-5,8.148750134124234E-5,8.227594071009932E-5,8.175432774069559E-5,8.184741744548541E-5,8.193559885784913E-5,0.08144861198996453,8.21326238512884E-5,8.55853233289445E-5,8.128194875741304E-5,8.128412323989467E-5,8.149005610645994E-5,8.322210817197414E-5,8.166867778189883E-5,8.766440730461928E-5,0.06356090397907907,8.137042050329026E-5,8.17459986338464E-5,8.128888530851402E-5,8.133692105892703E-5,8.109191125627446E-5,8.111295023929463E-5,8.12955256323829E-5,8.215302116756042E-5,8.173556714370976E-5,8.14124075595045E-5,8.240165367747512E-5,8.144365408640186E-5,8.41496222782842E-5,8.29121775544742E-5,8.113311124170738E-5,8.131242037918183E-5,8.128421816833502E-5,8.357186161839819E-5,8.131363015298185E-5,8.110574926283327E-5,0.05812573227501802,8.133457438552176E-5,0.20975135867198358,8.126754412781958E-5,8.113217298382046E-5,8.151955529752589E-5,8.232816077381417E-5,8.151416231525205E-5,8.11171633504374E-5,8.130603224161255E-5,8.109289207729568E-5,0.14926709550824402,8.179146927586765E-5,8.161724147098512E-5,8.154586350458857E-5,8.18431111395136E-5,8.108993367998352E-5,8.154757307541718E-5,8.287022057578409E-5,8.123525134535244E-5,8.324578148989907E-5,8.145002909683058E-5,8.208749786612776E-5,8.158581519069397E-5,8.106450959748836E-5,8.116499462469213E-5]}}
{"value":"This 'Movie' has to be the biggest pile of steaming C*^p I have ever<br /><br />seen, What more can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is NOTHING to save this 'movie' and I pray that they NEVER even talk about making a sequel. If you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth. Movies like Men in Black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this 'Comedy' but have TOTALLY failed.

{"value":"This film, although not totally bad, should have been filmed where the actual events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless, flat Platte River Valley in Hall county. The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie.","finished_norm":["thi","film","although","not","total","bad","should","have","be","film","where","the","actual","event","take","place","grand","island","nebraska","be","devast","by","no","littl","than","seven","tornado","on","the","night","of","june","grand","island","be","situat","in","the","nearli","treeless","flat","platt","river","vallei","in","hall","counti","the","maker","of","thi","movi","film","in","the","tree","cover","hill","of","ontario","and","move","the","whole","event","to","a","nonexist","town","call","blainsworth","the","peopl","of","grand","island","brave","surviv","thi","aw","night","onli","to","be","forget","becaus","of","a","poorli","make","movi"],"filtered":["thi","film","although","total","bad","film","actual","event","take","place","grand","island","nebraska","devast","littl","seven","tornado","night","june","grand","island","situat","nearli","treeless","flat","platt","river","vallei","hall","counti","maker","thi","movi","film","tree","cover","hill","ontario","move","whole","event","nonexist","town","call","blainsworth","peopl","grand","island","brave","surviv","thi","aw","night","onli","forget","becaus","poorli","make","movi"],"filtered2":["although","total","bad","actual","event","take","place","grand","island","nebraska","devast","littl","seven","tornado","night","june","grand","island","situat","nearli","treeless","flat","platt","river","vallei","hall","counti","maker","tree","cover","hill","ontario","move","whole","event","nonexist","town","call","blainsworth","peopl","grand","island","brave","surviv","aw","night","onli","forget","becaus","poorli","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,11,14,22,23,31,52,111,138,142,164,184,210,237,275,373,398,450,470,473,491,594,611,720,762,885,1018,1351,1484,1508,1665,1744,2349,2473,3800,4988,5133,5579],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,11,14,22,23,31,52,111,138,142,164,184,210,237,275,373,398,450,470,473,491,594,611,720,762,885,1018,1351,1484,1508,1665,1744,2349,2473,3800,4988,5133,5579],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,1.7122153074726136,2.1183455303375887,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.3930275298746078,2.496249838866882,5.374303583034378,2.640097787510554,2.7832848715031413,3.0316467233633775,3.143848349181566,3.469984576472117,6.762949502332293,3.335489637924323,3.369778711402955,3.490764544963862,3.520060914452293,12.216815263143413,3.749984152751882,3.9782428047328615,4.268777946167049,4.573751515728891,4.484804029712395,4.751432692966343,4.77960356993304,14.607647185868181,5.102830579804232,5.1994574154933035,5.770002273960917,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.96471581785033E-5,7.911007877092009E-5,7.972508419801599E-5,7.92644318121801E-5,7.926573047065355E-5,7.915493281977515E-5,7.939035068061361E-5,7.912147010534237E-5,7.9299364013336E-5,8.797831559107721E-5,0.6539857297381311,7.899375060823505E-5,0.06250460277234961,0.05115540779145343,7.905135202712369E-5,7.883288819756758E-5,8.079927598180398E-5,0.049279901565529007,7.915145762626757E-5,7.921706011175022E-5,7.99835316300713E-5,7.947645207465229E-5,7.956694807242793E-5,7.96526725348176E-5,0.17709276916121355,7.984420792971743E-5,8.320070674938198E-5,7.901723472600005E-5,7.901934862207765E-5,7.921954369495603E-5,8.090333655069642E-5,7.939318853333742E-5,8.522186235689904E-5,7.961650985689952E-5,7.910324143250094E-5,7.946835503710556E-5,7.902397800781001E-5,7.907067536464816E-5,7.883249213476338E-5,7.885294492022334E-5,7.90304333160036E-5,7.986403692683532E-5,7.945821419381539E-5,7.914405862656497E-5,8.010574192649125E-5,7.917443454874654E-5,8.180500784389722E-5,8.060204135876077E-5,7.887254418776444E-5,7.904685733380652E-5,7.901944090557931E-5,8.124334501007523E-5,7.904803340034752E-5,7.88459445805907E-5,7.971139165960252E-5,7.906839407530748E-5,8.502936798671415E-5,7.900323144464264E-5,7.887163207203865E-5,7.924822096635907E-5,8.003429671500151E-5,7.92429782457708E-5,7.8857040643778E-5,7.9040647185385E-5,7.883344562771039E-5,8.065748816213657E-5,7.951255875574989E-5,7.934318536393707E-5,7.927379616238318E-5,7.956276175068027E-5,7.883056965858806E-5,7.92754581003843E-5,8.056125340418743E-5,7.897183841813222E-5,8.092635027204309E-5,7.918063193578175E-5,7.980033926495004E-5,7.931263469673121E-5,7.880585395325712E-5,7.890353922166409E-5]}}
{"value":"I think Jason Lee has huge potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star. The plot is awful, the comedy is awful. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because in retrospect, they were fairly lame jokes. I found myself scared for the future of Fletch, and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed, not Lee.<br /><br />Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out, instead of this film.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie - the location shots were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography. But, even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really badly-made movie. The continuity and pacing were both simply awful.

{"value":"I've seen this film several times in a variety of short-film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer! <br /><br />For a school-film is very well produced and directed, but the story... well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film. The character named Tim Watcher needed some in-dept approach. This is something that lacks in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial.<br /><br />But still... i liked this movie...<br /><br />Parabens!

{"value":"I thought I was going to watch a scary movie.. and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie. In the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf I thought they was kidding. Todays computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget, is a fitting comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special effects as they should be (human transforming to werewolf). Unless you wish to have good laugh I would not recommend you to watch this movie. This movie is a joke.","finished_norm":["i","think","i","be","go","to","watch","a","scari","movi","and","end","up","laugh","all","the","wai","throughout","the","movi","in","the","scene","where","the","human","transform","to","a","werewolf","i","think","thei","be","kid","todai","comput","game","have","ten","time","well","anim","low","budget","be","a","fit","comment","i","would","recommend","wolf","with","jack","nicholson","for","a","good","werewolf","movi","it","have","good","special","effect","a","thei","should","be","human","transform","to","werewolf","unless","you","wish","to","have","good","laugh","i","would","not","recommend","you","to","watch","thi","movi","thi","movi","be","a","joke"],"filtered":["think","go","watch","scari","movi","end","laugh","wai","throughout","movi","scene","human","transform","werewolf","think","thei","kid","todai","comput","game","ten","time","well","anim","low","budget","fit","comment","recommend","wolf","jack","nicholson","good","werewolf","movi","good","special","effect","thei","human","transform","werewolf","unless","wish","good","laugh","recommend","watch","thi","movi","thi","movi","joke"],"filtered2":["think","go","watch","scari","end","laugh","wai","throughout","scene","human","transform","werewolf","think","kid","todai","comput","game","ten","time","well","anim","low","budget","fit","comment","recommend","wolf","jack","nicholson","good","werewolf","good","special","effect","human","transform","werewolf","unless","wish","good","laugh","recommend","watch","joke"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,7,8,12,19,20,24,33,106,114,133,203,214,217,256,277,280,292,298,374,396,399,438,460,545,676,765,777,789,962,1529,1857,3087],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,7,8,12,19,20,24,33,106,114,133,203,214,217,256,277,280,292,298,374,396,399,438,460,545,676,765,777,789,962,1529,1857,3087],"values":[2.0358433949768115,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,2.133457220525776,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,2.159084361316692,2.4433074195966826,4.642472950759303,2.569760528637609,2.7303758068497004,2.6113665294700725,2.748952192422636,3.1163992333432793,2.8028805344481915,5.950451273491547,5.563984093001673,3.4572130107926293,3.291526514503207,3.129115117668582,3.1797351085150902,3.216957819005698,3.442099372982581,3.6105180246075443,3.965503778955432,4.086456389373095,3.8059428063999263,15.117344296254373,9.342779970585614,5.143104478942172,5.7446844659766265]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0125060111076938E-4,1.0056784463702123E-4,1.0134966373269177E-4,1.0076406429593014E-4,1.0076571520167596E-4,1.0062486486866149E-4,1.0092413731562922E-4,1.0058232574951897E-4,1.008084714844105E-4,1.1184149619432077E-4,0.5101603715028151,1.0041996369980594E-4,1.0229425252429665E-4,1.0375350251428853E-4,1.0049318888976485E-4,1.0021546907440192E-4,1.0271521859119691E-4,1.0093359314548835E-4,1.006204470659468E-4,1.0070384352655361E-4,1.0167821227666478E-4,1.0103359279530059E-4,1.0114863486814352E-4,1.0125761117747272E-4,1.0203471132247642E-4,1.0150109850722946E-4,1.0576801186472759E-4,1.0044981763426689E-4,1.0045250490212977E-4,1.0070700075523882E-4,1.0284750448052738E-4,1.0092774490566407E-4,0.2980086978208853,1.0121163975852044E-4,1.0055915274341486E-4,1.010232995226017E-4,1.004583899594111E-4,1.0051775347668248E-4,1.0021496558378253E-4,1.002409659693527E-4,1.0046659620116415E-4,1.0152630590851689E-4,1.0101040808363036E-4,1.0061104116641894E-4,1.0183357081371029E-4,1.0064965623380508E-4,1.0399374450375958E-4,1.0246448617839415E-4,1.0026588132936369E-4,1.0048747505878104E-4,1.0045262221654789E-4,1.0327973661136747E-4,1.0048897012083907E-4,1.0023206686219064E-4,1.0133225723914193E-4,1.0051485341191767E-4,0.18403431343944424,1.0043201611206087E-4,1.0026472181196682E-4,1.0074345643092366E-4,1.017427468499273E-4,1.007367916782425E-4,1.0024617261427735E-4,1.0047958047377579E-4,1.0021617770153094E-4,1.0253497233634201E-4,1.0107949302889152E-4,1.0086417890939986E-4,1.007759686263389E-4,1.0114331305123143E-4,1.0021252165643065E-4,1.0077808134731313E-4,1.0241263492578103E-4,1.0039210806163497E-4,1.028767604285541E-4,1.0065753459603397E-4,1.0144533093461034E-4,1.0082534169926368E-4,1.0018110207940033E-4,1.0030528343592414E-4]}}
{"value":"This was a new alltime low among westerns. The writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism. 'Ride With the Devil' is among my five worst movie experiences ever, a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","new","alltim","low","among","western","the","write","be","excruciatingli","bad","charact","be","imposs","to","emphas","with","and","be","either","disgust","or","bland","the","violenc","be","appal","and","technic","not","veri","convincingli","execut","and","tobei","maguir","show","u","the","flip","side","of","hi","talent","sleepwalk","through","hi","part","with","that","expressionless","ey","and","that","raspi","voic","of","hi","that","here","betrai","onli","manner","ride","with","the","devil","be","among","my","five","wrong","movi","experi","ever","a","western","never","to","be","surpass","in","the","neg","respect"],"filtered":["thi","new","alltim","low","among","western","write","excruciatingli","bad","charact","imposs","emphas","either","disgust","bland","violenc","appal","technic","veri","convincingli","execut","tobei","maguir","show","u","flip","side","hi","talent","sleepwalk","hi","part","expressionless","ey","raspi","voic","hi","betrai","onli","manner","ride","devil","among","five","wrong","movi","experi","ever","western","never","surpass","neg","respect"],"filtered2":["new","alltim","low","among","western","write","excruciatingli","bad","charact","imposs","emphas","either","disgust","bland","violenc","appal","technic","veri","convincingli","execut","tobei","maguir","show","u","flip","side","talent","sleepwalk","part","expressionless","ey","raspi","voic","betrai","onli","manner","ride","devil","among","five","wrong","experi","ever","western","never","surpass","neg","respect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[9,10,11,15,25,28,42,44,61,65,87,112,207,217,276,281,333,425,428,452,505,662,695,770,826,901,944,963,1002,1028,1046,1147,1411,1561,2869,3161,3205,3633,3911,4125,4763,5150,8346],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[9,10,11,15,25,28,42,44,61,65,87,112,207,217,276,281,333,425,428,452,505,662,695,770,826,901,944,963,1002,1028,1046,1147,1411,1561,2869,3161,3205,3633,3911,4125,4763,5150,8346],"values":[1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.115024371522662,2.2466628996789315,2.5531798379045583,2.6113665294700725,2.7884729505849193,2.832333801361687,2.948928684455311,3.226987993365636,3.3721070011625462,3.41740676039221,3.3956930001684253,3.616452760127359,3.6284289511740746,8.107333133100207,7.6408716274049855,3.8962296530720266,3.969732115064953,4.035401218572811,4.072271754381138,4.086456389373095,4.067587905068712,4.246178114249808,4.715065048795469,4.550761997504193,5.426230734858092,5.604922523601468,5.482320201509136,5.695894301807195,5.770002273960917,5.822646007446338,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.707876768366227E-5,7.655900753362644E-5,7.71541808144242E-5,7.670838313572743E-5,7.670963991622111E-5,7.660241516913333E-5,7.683024148483797E-5,7.657003153045976E-5,7.674218887442737E-5,0.28828971326514086,0.3273229890799787,7.644643061774237E-5,7.787326533566127E-5,7.898414457723654E-5,7.650217455746734E-5,7.629075555457084E-5,7.81937330199747E-5,7.68374398985261E-5,7.659905204056538E-5,7.666253903562746E-5,7.740429406428032E-5,7.691356635794232E-5,7.700114412152325E-5,7.708410421793412E-5,7.767568511608752E-5,7.726946315030928E-5,8.051772459074365E-5,7.646915744063048E-5,7.647120316967342E-5,7.666494253045792E-5,7.829443793648552E-5,7.68329878250191E-5,8.24737037755275E-5,7.704910768178878E-5,7.65523906795963E-5,7.690573042643813E-5,7.647568327110508E-5,7.652087477324381E-5,7.629037226364657E-5,7.631016550592921E-5,7.648193041427953E-5,7.728865271961976E-5,7.68959165960146E-5,7.659189163720371E-5,7.752256343209874E-5,7.662128802374851E-5,7.916703293830455E-5,7.800285864308043E-5,7.632913275377737E-5,7.649782480501004E-5,7.647129247729906E-5,7.86234821064257E-5,7.649896294680652E-5,7.630339090700328E-5,7.714092982077285E-5,7.65186670488864E-5,0.11120821431587809,7.64556057245964E-5,7.63282500511457E-5,7.669269504279895E-5,7.745342212204488E-5,7.668762138478661E-5,7.631412915424494E-5,7.649181491591404E-5,7.629129500920374E-5,7.805651744741121E-5,7.694850870300268E-5,7.678459711321216E-5,7.671744551272016E-5,7.699709279654422E-5,7.62885117817677E-5,7.671905385802742E-5,7.796338598207468E-5,7.642522503239566E-5,0.26732475817274537,7.662728556297599E-5,7.722700912310318E-5,7.675503161666471E-5,7.626459308645064E-5,7.635912828747792E-5]}}

It should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire.","finished_norm":["my","mother","keep","a","cassett","of","thi","film","a","a","gener","threat","to","ani","film","love","person","who","annoi","her","everyth","about","it","stinksbr","br","a","such","it","be","a","true","classicbr","br","who","give","it","be","you","inadvert","watch","a","good","film","and","accident","vote","for","thi","onebr","br","everyon","involv","in","the","movi","make","process","should","be","forc","to","watch","at","littl","a","small","section","of","thi","film","it","should","be","a","indel","stain","on","the","mind","on","all","that","hold","film","sacr","and","be","rever","a","the","tide","mark","of","the","cinemat","dire"],"filtered":["mother","keep","cassett","thi","film","gener","threat","ani","film","love","person","annoi","everyth","stinksbr","br","true","classicbr","br","give","inadvert","watch","good","film","accident","vote","thi","onebr","br","everyon","involv","movi","make","process","forc","watch","littl","small","section","thi","film","indel","stain","mind","hold","film","sacr","rever","tide","mark","cinemat","dire"],"filtered2":["mother","keep","cassett","gener","threat","ani","love","person","annoi","everyth","stinksbr","true","classicbr","give","inadvert","watch","good","accident","vote","onebr","everyon","involv","make","process","forc","watch","littl","small","section","indel","stain","mind","hold","sacr","rever","tide","mark","cinemat","dire"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,14,27,30,54,134,153,193,225,238,241,246,271,304,338,363,397,414,717,1093,1190,1492,1587,1623,1879,1911,2851,5682,7483,7593,7802,7881,8209],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,14,27,30,54,134,153,193,225,238,241,246,271,304,338,363,397,414,717,1093,1190,1492,1587,1623,1879,1911,2851,5682,7483,7593,7802,7881,8209],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,1.1175081997259209,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.8113893252729412,2.2443961816702407,2.3409902041158843,2.517840471459249,2.641219492619754,2.597304642813496,2.6627744961815836,2.673149229007135,2.757740698455715,2.871119826396843,2.9720957437368454,3.0349689855553557,3.3176717946075294,3.1254654785810323,3.7398317812878634,4.150360191352575,4.291900363587903,4.499089986959872,4.573751515728891,4.613282354485526,4.869215728622727,4.8796870284900224,5.408212229355414,6.2980697041614135,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.709942731461974E-5,9.644466317624423E-5,9.71944284677134E-5,9.663283802458002E-5,9.663442124483462E-5,9.649934563518154E-5,9.678634820991014E-5,9.64585505775533E-5,9.66754245625639E-5,1.0725610624867379E-4,0.37011289467634795,9.630284521015982E-5,9.81002900597083E-5,9.949971225357817E-5,9.637306824026544E-5,9.610673466071306E-5,9.850399693716363E-5,9.679541636016343E-5,9.649510895797784E-5,9.657508624676578E-5,9.750950684863016E-5,9.689131612393677E-5,9.700164158637934E-5,9.710614997557052E-5,9.785138978864993E-5,9.733965456732974E-5,1.01431628727176E-4,9.633147516304351E-5,9.633405225560063E-5,9.657811403221962E-5,9.863085923679324E-5,9.678980789234686E-5,1.0389565954122968E-4,9.706206333900605E-5,9.643632764161827E-5,9.688144486516605E-5,9.633969603139516E-5,9.63966257035867E-5,9.610625181270756E-5,9.613118620836671E-5,9.634756582541005E-5,9.736382849027191E-5,9.686908196235216E-5,9.6486088690962E-5,9.765849584039974E-5,9.652312057904737E-5,0.2160681217451638,9.826354430354689E-5,9.615508006343389E-5,9.636758867066078E-5,9.633416476024445E-5,9.904537028078827E-5,9.636902243666357E-5,9.612265195573446E-5,9.717773562306158E-5,9.639384453858868E-5,0.3239981779863382,9.631440348551696E-5,9.615396808509536E-5,9.661307506151259E-5,9.757139556866778E-5,9.660668355705302E-5,9.613617938603547E-5,9.636001775577744E-5,9.610741423483561E-5,9.833114059922575E-5,0.08243661167579625,9.672884803861538E-5,9.664425428929916E-5,9.699653795865991E-5,9.610390808394286E-5,9.66462803908178E-5,9.821381890064512E-5,9.62761316254086E-5,9.865891572009089E-5,9.6530675936272E-5,9.728617340964141E-5,9.669160311541147E-5,9.607377667827573E-5,9.619286672287133E-5]}}
{"value":"A dreary and pointless bit of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Badly scripted, with inane and wooden dialogue. You do not care if the characters (indeed, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point to the whole thing. Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest--those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived. The framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting, and the Hoppalong Cassidy character himself is both boring and inept.","finished_norm":["a","dreari","and","pointless","bite","of","fluff","bloodi","fluff","but","fluff","badli","script","with","inan","and","wooden","dialogu","you","do","not","care","if","the","charact","ind","even","if","the","actor","themselv","live","or","die","littl","grace","or","charm","littl","action","littl","point","to","the","whole","thing","perhap","some","of","the","set","and","set","will","interestthos","gap","between","the","board","of","all","the","build","mai","be","true","to","the","wai","life","be","live","the","framework","encount","be","unnecessari","and","distract","and","the","hoppalong","cassidi","charact","himself","be","both","bore","and","inept"],"filtered":["dreari","pointless","bite","fluff","bloodi","fluff","fluff","badli","script","inan","wooden","dialogu","care","charact","ind","even","actor","themselv","live","die","littl","grace","charm","littl","action","littl","point","whole","thing","perhap","set","set","interestthos","gap","board","build","mai","true","wai","life","live","framework","encount","unnecessari","distract","hoppalong","cassidi","charact","bore","inept"],"filtered2":["dreari","pointless","bite","fluff","bloodi","fluff","fluff","badli","script","inan","wooden","dialogu","care","charact","ind","even","actor","themselv","live","die","littl","grace","charm","littl","action","littl","point","whole","thing","perhap","set","set","interestthos","gap","board","build","mai","true","wai","life","live","framework","encount","unnecessari","distract","hoppalong","cassidi","charact","bore","inept"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,14,29,33,41,46,66,75,77,108,109,111,116,129,154,205,248,293,304,318,436,448,477,534,797,829,890,1081,1149,1179,1288,1333,1356,1414,2192,2594,3082,3908,4056],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,10,14,29,33,41,46,66,75,77,108,109,111,116,129,154,205,248,293,304,318,436,448,477,534,797,829,890,1081,1149,1179,1288,1333,1356,1414,2192,2594,3082,3908,4056],"values":[0.926017105726131,2.247774048205673,3.3525245991777624,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,1.929723173391612,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,2.138507503627933,4.251382278653714,2.1183455303375887,4.493325799357863,2.4106958340079214,2.348499626138016,2.571852579609833,2.689504733779216,2.9012296278682137,2.871119826396843,2.902686292364678,3.2070272508030975,3.2681460658591432,3.351345009714117,3.4272107604888307,3.7987743169213135,3.8240921249056035,3.8767358583910254,4.1302590120314875,4.297765483040301,4.274508620876034,4.403125998698128,4.436351646326448,4.396611317676934,4.449957298382227,4.9676558014359795,5.214056214914456,5.501738287366237,17.55013494490336,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.475599932215068E-5,8.418446980438629E-5,8.483892378308616E-5,8.434872357764817E-5,8.435010553651792E-5,8.423220094534973E-5,8.448271931298475E-5,8.419659181796033E-5,8.438589644966522E-5,0.25504589297975777,0.5616381390054926,8.40606799554681E-5,8.562963086139168E-5,8.685115636154445E-5,8.412197612637904E-5,8.38894992795809E-5,8.598201790195665E-5,8.449063470608207E-5,8.422850284104434E-5,8.429831329432676E-5,8.511394891740418E-5,8.457434354493063E-5,8.46706442655281E-5,8.47618673881398E-5,8.541237117419754E-5,8.496568851837919E-5,8.853748465260797E-5,8.408567042486953E-5,8.408791991347174E-5,8.430095618305402E-5,8.609275327165739E-5,8.44857391952886E-5,9.068828409377262E-5,8.472338511237242E-5,8.41771938956951E-5,8.456572713570127E-5,8.409284624383893E-5,8.414253892886416E-5,8.388907781195378E-5,8.391084250902801E-5,8.40997156175792E-5,8.498678941519355E-5,8.455493582403762E-5,8.422062924419392E-5,8.524399820023377E-5,8.425295358191933E-5,8.705226084560063E-5,8.577213197558764E-5,8.393169894062483E-5,8.411719312805926E-5,8.408801811635284E-5,8.645457103655555E-5,8.411844463153071E-5,8.390339314366801E-5,8.48243529584261E-5,8.414011130982245E-5,9.04834424762934E-5,8.407076892515029E-5,8.393072831867665E-5,8.433147291273004E-5,8.51679702485142E-5,8.432589390611152E-5,8.391520094630013E-5,8.411058463947734E-5,8.389009246519964E-5,8.583113532657727E-5,0.12041403868680323,8.443252865157649E-5,8.435868858930227E-5,8.466618941878501E-5,8.38870320215811E-5,8.436045712969113E-5,8.572872774210044E-5,8.403736224254555E-5,8.611724317180533E-5,0.056456770848390805,8.491900596740911E-5,8.440001836008326E-5,8.386073096637482E-5,8.396468210201145E-5]}}

{"value":"An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century. It's a string of several jokes acted out. Some of them you could tell your Grandmother, some of them not, but it's a fairly safe bet she's heard them all before. For what it tries to be, it's not too bad. Before you rent it, remember that it's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation. Robin Williams has a couple of bits, but he's interchangeable with the other players.","finished_norm":["a","updat","of","the","skit","and","joke","you","would","have","see","on","a","burlesqu","stage","in","the","half","of","the","th","centuri","it","a","string","of","sever","joke","act","out","some","of","them","you","can","tell","your","grandmoth","some","of","them","not","but","it","a","fairli","safe","bet","she","hear","them","all","befor","for","what","it","try","to","be","it","not","too","bad","befor","you","rend","it","rememb","that","it","a","old","styl","of","entertain","and","have","much","valu","a","histori","than","a","comedi","or","titil","robin","william","have","a","coupl","of","bit","but","he","interchang","with","the","other","player"],"filtered":["updat","skit","joke","see","burlesqu","stage","half","th","centuri","string","sever","joke","act","tell","grandmoth","fairli","safe","bet","hear","befor","try","bad","befor","rend","rememb","old","styl","entertain","much","valu","histori","comedi","titil","robin","william","coupl","bit","interchang","player"],"filtered2":["updat","skit","joke","see","burlesqu","stage","half","th","centuri","string","sever","joke","act","tell","grandmoth","fairli","safe","bet","hear","befor","try","bad","befor","rend","rememb","old","styl","entertain","valu","histori","comedi","titil","robin","william","coupl","bit","interchang","player"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,21,36,67,79,90,127,195,206,214,216,253,290,316,380,451,499,531,669,719,819,853,999,1163,1381,1451,1606,1627,1729,2301,2559,2896,4674,8296],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,21,36,67,79,90,127,195,206,214,216,253,290,316,380,451,499,531,669,719,819,853,999,1163,1381,1451,1606,1627,1729,2301,2559,2896,4674,8296],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,1.4680183469605717,1.9570915389266579,3.893901213901217,2.0477128419653545,2.4359679371086367,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,5.460751613699401,2.6070186965339692,2.7073305177318163,2.8612813773965557,2.878207028279898,3.102062070196872,3.216957819005698,3.3814747511661465,3.424750734647968,3.7099788181381825,3.857614816944247,3.835141961092188,3.8962296530720266,4.1302590120314875,4.2860694432771105,4.449957298382227,4.499089986959872,4.679973728984199,4.944927550358424,4.6973654716960676,5.322690055917252,5.243909178064138,5.649374286172302,6.101359409915359,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.756228864096374E-5,9.690440332045655E-5,9.765774265316214E-5,9.70934751757294E-5,9.70950659430051E-5,9.695934644411838E-5,9.724771712570485E-5,9.691835692134236E-5,9.71362647186331E-5,1.0776738324555965E-4,0.4666778060905754,9.67619093251339E-5,9.856792237873981E-5,0.2515074691670684,9.683246710000325E-5,9.656486394021449E-5,9.897355367846952E-5,9.725682850274297E-5,9.69550895711825E-5,9.703544810211562E-5,9.797432297493816E-5,9.73531854091904E-5,9.746403677988278E-5,9.756904334803314E-5,9.831783562993616E-5,9.78036610281806E-5,1.0191514113815832E-4,9.679067575356983E-5,9.679326513081814E-5,9.703849032065963E-5,9.91010207154688E-5,9.725119330003286E-5,1.0439091769162866E-4,9.752474655575879E-5,9.689602805133659E-5,0.012330744610092384,9.679893580981511E-5,9.685613685892728E-5,9.656437879053046E-5,9.658943204546372E-5,9.680684311819437E-5,9.782795018531462E-5,9.733084526002374E-5,9.694602630563545E-5,0.18260173897322562,9.698323472029064E-5,1.0020550601009002E-4,9.873195483598217E-5,9.661343979967276E-5,9.682696140994736E-5,9.67933781717581E-5,9.951750768390452E-5,9.682840201054077E-5,9.658085711107255E-5,0.0795541719057684,9.685334243644921E-5,1.0415512533273937E-4,9.677352269740366E-5,9.661232252066685E-5,9.70736180049869E-5,9.803650671108282E-5,9.7067196032992E-5,9.659444902501166E-5,9.681935440542066E-5,9.65655467537854E-5,9.879987335509674E-5,9.739741360921252E-5,9.718994285798863E-5,9.710494586041348E-5,9.745890882378202E-5,9.656202388949179E-5,9.710698162011511E-5,9.86819923980476E-5,9.673506839992753E-5,9.912921094065793E-5,9.699082609299717E-5,9.774992493222676E-5,9.715252039270203E-5,9.653174885102703E-5,9.665140658358457E-5]}}
{"value":"\"Horrible People\" ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look out of your window at real life. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things, you'll have to watch this horrible film by Mike Leigh. The characters talk at length, but never actually manage to communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to film real life. But we're not, and he failed.","finished_norm":["horribl","peopl","ought","to","be","the","subtitl","of","thi","horribl","film","if","you","want","to","see","ordinari","peopl","do","ordinari","thing","then","look","out","of","your","window","at","real","life","but","if","you","want","to","see","unpleas","peopl","do","dull","thing","you","will","have","to","watch","thi","horribl","film","by","mike","leigh","the","charact","talk","at","length","but","never","actual","manag","to","commun","with","each","other","why","not","presum","becaus","leigh","thing","that","all","of","u","be","a","ineffect","and","pathet","a","hi","actor","and","he","want","to","film","real","life","but","we","re","not","and","he","fail"],"filtered":["horribl","peopl","subtitl","thi","horribl","film","want","see","ordinari","peopl","ordinari","thing","look","window","real","life","want","see","unpleas","peopl","dull","thing","watch","thi","horribl","film","mike","leigh","charact","talk","length","never","actual","manag","commun","presum","becaus","leigh","thing","u","ineffect","pathet","hi","actor","want","film","real","life","re","fail"],"filtered2":["horribl","peopl","subtitl","horribl","want","see","ordinari","peopl","ordinari","thing","look","window","real","life","want","see","unpleas","peopl","dull","thing","watch","horribl","mike","leigh","charact","talk","length","never","actual","manag","commun","presum","becaus","leigh","thing","u","ineffect","pathet","actor","want","real","life","re","fail"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,10,16,22,23,29,37,41,42,52,68,75,80,112,186,215,230,345,367,601,1061,1327,1367,1607,1650,1959,2254,2351,3363,5151],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,10,16,22,23,29,37,41,42,52,68,75,80,112,186,215,230,345,367,601,1061,1327,1367,1607,1650,1959,2254,2351,3363,5151],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,4.094543182127343,3.9586154332014196,4.4629629644322915,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.7122153074726136,2.0064197866819473,3.948450049740535,3.9903607800925114,2.2466628996789315,2.571852579609833,2.605934685587711,8.136414657899758,3.0022328381570844,3.0791938792932125,3.506637894120152,4.218628162481577,4.613282354485526,4.477736862489302,4.597282013139085,4.6295428753573065,9.823550686083045,5.143104478942172,5.102830579804232,11.935656034581672,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0289893437098113E-4,1.0220506280071052E-4,0.07808680959686018,1.0240447686426038E-4,1.0240615464631924E-4,1.022630113067836E-4,1.0256715583078385E-4,1.0221977966192594E-4,1.024496069901353E-4,1.1366224645186504E-4,0.6072162381965523,1.0205477440057956E-4,1.0395957615610237E-4,1.0544258235363356E-4,1.021291916774473E-4,1.0184695065624795E-4,1.043873954402861E-4,1.0257676559907582E-4,1.0225852158339809E-4,1.0234327571653518E-4,1.0333350693463073E-4,1.0267839321698887E-4,1.0279530814463868E-4,0.14296501357093422,1.0369580969151173E-4,1.0315350979942969E-4,1.0748988738853185E-4,1.0208511434927233E-4,1.0208784536515201E-4,1.0234648434407625E-4,1.0452183490923829E-4,1.0257082215143934E-4,0.16390444778256896,1.0285933873812477E-4,1.0219622940535336E-4,1.0266793237250711E-4,1.0209382622962409E-4,1.0215415616940446E-4,1.0184643896893318E-4,1.0187286263396879E-4,1.0210216606684298E-4,1.0317912757060619E-4,1.0265483106428663E-4,1.0224896255829009E-4,1.0349139466795815E-4,1.0228820626885682E-4,1.0568673541975403E-4,1.0413258116949035E-4,1.0189818360951337E-4,1.02123384826792E-4,1.0208796458941812E-4,1.0496110366593125E-4,1.0212490422806866E-4,1.0186381865167355E-4,1.0298191983973114E-4,1.0215120889234504E-4,1.0985239845547142E-4,1.020670230229485E-4,1.0189700521547706E-4,1.023835335086105E-4,1.0339909211383905E-4,1.0237676025550172E-4,1.0187815404170877E-4,1.021153617200111E-4,1.0184767081964098E-4,1.0420421482362348E-4,1.0272504069435761E-4,1.0250622131740911E-4,1.0241657499404946E-4,1.0278989968994148E-4,1.0184395525508428E-4,1.0241872210956766E-4,1.0407988579206881E-4,1.0202646527991686E-4,1.0455156713643434E-4,1.022962128887588E-4,1.0309683434533844E-4,1.0246675184766658E-4,1.0181202417557129E-4,1.0193822717204597E-4]}}
{"value":"At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue. This is absolutely not a girls film. Any blokes who like it, are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from. Dumb story, mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film. I've seen many, many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category. If you do happen to see it, the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending. So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can.","finished_norm":["at","littl","the","seat","in","the","theater","be","comfort","and","i","eat","the","pop","corn","a","loud","a","possibl","to","drown","out","the","inferior","dialogu","thi","be","absolut","not","a","girl","film","ani","bloke","who","like","it","be","the","on","u","ladi","can","be","sure","to","stai","far","awai","from","dumb","stori","mediocr","dialogu","and","a","overal","cheap","look","film","i","have","see","mani","mani","movi","but","thi","on","be","the","new","winner","in","the","bad","categori","if","you","do","happen","to","see","it","the","on","thing","you","will","look","forward","to","be","the","end","so","you","can","final","run","out","of","the","theater","a","fast","a","you","can"],"filtered":["littl","seat","theater","comfort","eat","pop","corn","loud","possibl","drown","inferior","dialogu","thi","absolut","girl","film","ani","bloke","like","u","ladi","sure","stai","far","awai","dumb","stori","mediocr","dialogu","overal","cheap","look","film","see","mani","mani","movi","thi","new","winner","bad","categori","happen","see","thing","look","forward","end","final","run","theater","fast"],"filtered2":["littl","seat","theater","comfort","eat","pop","corn","loud","possibl","drown","inferior","dialogu","absolut","girl","ani","bloke","like","u","ladi","sure","stai","far","awai","dumb","stori","mediocr","dialogu","overal","cheap","look","see","mani","mani","new","winner","bad","categori","happen","see","thing","look","forward","end","final","run","theater","fast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,14,16,17,24,27,29,50,84,87,94,101,112,119,137,155,156,222,248,351,365,402,412,420,424,472,542,599,699,787,952,956,1473,1751,2339,2357,2458,3124,4283,4734],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,14,16,17,24,27,29,50,84,87,94,101,112,119,137,155,156,222,248,351,365,402,412,420,424,472,542,599,699,787,952,956,1473,1751,2339,2357,2458,3124,4283,4734],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,3.43598877114071,2.2212694515902225,2.115024371522662,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.2939035841256437,2.3074766467914385,2.3451551414151686,2.5771019354959765,5.379009467558432,3.0135689919434205,3.008694896185175,3.084424928710765,3.107414446935464,3.3023374306074227,6.425947499981648,3.4222967456864013,3.4471119148061256,3.6254214301101193,3.5813614403160887,3.760240652919071,3.9868265484242533,3.969732115064953,4.535724120139652,4.751432692966343,5.170884043049248,5.143104478942172,5.129498826886393,5.463272006538442,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.210877602776345E-5,9.148766501773424E-5,9.219889437526234E-5,9.166616818133436E-5,9.166767002829543E-5,9.153953694429653E-5,9.181178835304493E-5,9.150083864369849E-5,9.170656588498143E-5,1.017434287852039E-4,0.6451427347483916,9.135313611642098E-5,9.305819710028109E-5,9.438569273015525E-5,9.141974987029032E-5,9.11671051255569E-5,9.344115452222256E-5,9.182039042458917E-5,9.153551802098823E-5,9.161138469068966E-5,9.24977785687295E-5,9.191136119657831E-5,9.201601622484491E-5,9.211515316189237E-5,9.282208963853592E-5,9.233665624114448E-5,9.621831385565778E-5,9.13802945661748E-5,9.138273920305592E-5,9.161425685605602E-5,9.356149643840184E-5,9.181507021704254E-5,9.855570006538062E-5,9.207333246072616E-5,9.147975790733033E-5,9.190199729414995E-5,9.138809290384475E-5,9.144209654290056E-5,9.116664709464958E-5,9.119029992895225E-5,9.139555821146138E-5,9.235958768899717E-5,9.1890269811529E-5,9.152696137161088E-5,9.263910992415595E-5,9.156208991953205E-5,9.460424348795711E-5,9.321306051191159E-5,9.121296570367089E-5,9.141455193593168E-5,9.138284592526145E-5,9.395470272157242E-5,9.14159120101904E-5,9.118220431411694E-5,9.218305949825202E-5,9.14394583223571E-5,0.2346913770433138,9.136410032728794E-5,9.121191087804974E-5,9.16474209817971E-5,9.255648637381386E-5,9.164135798359998E-5,9.119503647062174E-5,9.140737014585731E-5,9.116774977138417E-5,9.327718253848974E-5,9.1953117139645E-5,9.175724353701644E-5,9.167699768053092E-5,9.201117490996245E-5,9.116442382728511E-5,9.167891964584164E-5,9.316589086194107E-5,9.132779553859476E-5,9.358811089337505E-5,9.156925695156983E-5,0.11306695070504233,9.172191290341296E-5,9.113584109541169E-5,9.124881022971206E-5]}}
{"value":"\"Whipped\" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three unlikable New York Lotharios, ruthless \"scammers,\" end up wooing the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. That applies to the story and the film. Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, flaccid and ridiculous, \"Whipped\" mixes the philosophies of shock jock Tom Lykis with Penthouse letter fantasies. Though technically proficient it's dated, grating, poorly written, mean, and obvious. People don't act like this. People don't talk like this.

{"value":"This film is quite boring. There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin--she does a masterful job handling her character, but Day-Lewis garbles most of his lines.<br /><br />Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The incongruities in bouncing between domestic household/marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation throughout. Badly disjointed.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","quit","bore","there","be","snippet","of","nake","flesh","toss","around","in","a","lame","attempt","to","keep","the","viewer","awak","but","thei","do","not","succeedbr","br","the","well","thing","about","the","movi","be","lena","olinsh","doe","a","master","job","handl","her","charact","but","daylewi","garbl","much","of","hi","linesbr","br","kaufman","clearli","have","no","idea","how","to","film","thi","the","incongru","in","bounc","between","domest","householdmarriag","issu","and","polit","crisi","be","badli","match","charact","attitud","chang","without","explan","throughout","badli","disjoint"],"filtered":["thi","film","quit","bore","snippet","nake","flesh","toss","around","lame","attempt","keep","viewer","awak","thei","succeedbr","br","well","thing","movi","lena","olinsh","doe","master","job","handl","charact","daylewi","garbl","much","hi","linesbr","br","kaufman","clearli","idea","film","thi","incongru","bounc","domest","householdmarriag","issu","polit","crisi","badli","match","charact","attitud","chang","without","explan","throughout","badli","disjoint"],"filtered2":["quit","bore","snippet","nake","flesh","toss","around","lame","attempt","keep","viewer","awak","succeedbr","well","thing","lena","olinsh","doe","master","job","handl","charact","daylewi","garbl","linesbr","kaufman","clearli","idea","incongru","bounc","domest","householdmarriag","issu","polit","crisi","badli","match","charact","attitud","chang","without","explan","throughout","badli","disjoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,18,20,29,98,108,120,123,125,134,177,278,279,289,372,438,448,494,575,806,893,919,945,1000,1059,1344,1821,2158,2199,2243,2951,3718,4224,4374,5311,5331,6325,6514],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,18,20,29,98,108,120,123,125,134,177,278,279,289,372,438,448,494,575,806,893,919,945,1000,1059,1344,1821,2158,2199,2243,2951,3718,4224,4374,5311,5331,6325,6514],"values":[2.247774048205673,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.3195384777338066,2.0881990796736947,2.138507503627933,2.2044500422972613,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,2.2443961816702407,2.458149992634611,2.8336934208777267,2.7910771187233068,2.8282659991423613,3.070535816550098,3.1797351085150902,6.5362921317182865,3.3243163373261977,3.6314455447135003,3.880604335168946,4.017463517886143,4.235066888824737,3.9782428047328615,4.062925891962901,4.224077767249142,4.477736862489302,4.789173020949191,5.064116067623542,4.979216623837056,5.064116067623542,5.521540914662417,5.770002273960917,5.907203395474402,6.389041482367141,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.03457519306197745,8.242013577556675E-5,8.306087373957176E-5,8.25809471262274E-5,8.258230012207029E-5,8.246686656959647E-5,8.271213458545177E-5,8.243200373656915E-5,8.261734093099842E-5,0.2149007749661279,0.3379882794191411,8.229894030828899E-5,0.07795663458209845,8.503093404539683E-5,8.235895183702749E-5,8.213134722869177E-5,8.418001094742585E-5,8.271988408812505E-5,8.246324596998147E-5,8.253159333917511E-5,8.333013491048436E-5,8.280183856119526E-5,8.289612101596834E-5,8.29854322888076E-5,8.362230284811598E-5,8.318498174570023E-5,8.668192035005126E-5,8.232340702864665E-5,8.2325609372576E-5,8.25341808383688E-5,8.428842553062748E-5,8.271509117720898E-5,0.21158719958208996,8.294775652270645E-5,8.241301235501649E-5,8.279340273425197E-5,8.233043245715064E-5,8.237908368529699E-5,8.21309345941627E-5,8.21522431477729E-5,8.233715786288976E-5,8.320564041094416E-5,8.278283758637398E-5,8.245553738759137E-5,0.0617666589193404,8.248718427341692E-5,8.522782379144501E-5,8.397452380010627E-5,8.217266247128941E-5,8.235426908055416E-5,8.232570551732588E-5,8.464266033638454E-5,8.235549435507666E-5,8.214494990585025E-5,8.304660828954714E-5,8.237670694417723E-5,8.858709488419464E-5,8.230881783383466E-5,8.217171219158889E-5,8.256405799990667E-5,8.338302406516112E-5,8.255859591783783E-5,8.215651024112838E-5,0.05517125280863373,8.213192798235512E-5,8.403229056173201E-5,8.283945598750433E-5,8.266299581748724E-5,8.259070329165131E-5,8.28917595336869E-5,8.212893167936527E-5,8.259243476705661E-5,8.39320292304361E-5,8.227611128686119E-5,8.431240217263774E-5,8.249364096627871E-5,8.313927756536574E-5,8.26311668751039E-5,8.210318184039642E-5,8.22049543731819E-5]}}

{"value":"Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking, and before digital triumphed over -- strike that. You get the point. This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments. Corin Nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator. The pace is slow, but elegantly so, because the cinematography is so beautiful.

{"value":"This film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core. The settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank! The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","overblown","predict","pretenti","and","hollow","to","it","core","the","set","be","faith","to","the","era","but","selfconsci","in","their","magnif","by","prolong","exposur","the","linger","over","artifact","stop","the","action","and","cloi","almost","a","much","a","the","empti","dialogu","tom","hank","seem","to","be","sleepwalk","much","a","bruce","willi","do","in","hart","war","tom","you","ca","not","give","depth","to","a","charact","simpli","by","make","your","face","blank","the","content","do","not","warrant","the","histrion","act","by","paul","newman","thi","be","a","dud","wrap","in","a","atom","bomb","case"],"filtered":["thi","film","overblown","predict","pretenti","hollow","core","set","faith","era","selfconsci","magnif","prolong","exposur","linger","artifact","stop","action","cloi","almost","much","empti","dialogu","tom","hank","seem","sleepwalk","much","bruce","willi","hart","war","tom","ca","give","depth","charact","simpli","make","face","blank","content","warrant","histrion","act","paul","newman","thi","dud","wrap","atom","bomb","case"],"filtered2":["overblown","predict","pretenti","hollow","core","set","faith","era","selfconsci","magnif","prolong","exposur","linger","artifact","stop","action","cloi","almost","empti","dialogu","tom","hank","seem","sleepwalk","bruce","willi","hart","war","tom","ca","give","depth","charact","simpli","make","face","blank","content","warrant","histrion","act","paul","newman","dud","wrap","atom","bomb","case"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,21,30,35,81,109,129,131,201,248,251,288,314,315,337,759,840,914,1047,1072,1078,1142,1144,1204,1335,1988,2040,2167,2197,2314,2752,2795,3161,3429,3491,4020,4303,4360,4549,4736,5636,6593,6655,6951],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,21,30,35,81,109,129,131,201,248,251,288,314,315,337,759,840,914,1047,1072,1078,1142,1144,1204,1335,1988,2040,2167,2197,2314,2752,2795,3161,3429,3491,4020,4303,4360,4549,4736,5636,6593,6655,6951],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.1238870241028365,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.949757232424728,2.125691139326857,2.4106958340079214,2.2512118082053005,2.561435818751577,2.689504733779216,2.6942272927333892,2.8015621426949333,3.189397019426827,2.854312708080462,2.973659465713028,7.939464230129906,4.049068857301474,3.9612932464190886,4.140259095366071,4.268777946167049,4.280272325592784,4.263079925052412,4.229557233013768,4.3215761317340196,4.933754249760298,4.911775343041523,5.089758498236879,5.390512652256013,5.039114765418124,5.185068678041204,5.3064295350454715,5.482320201509136,5.604922523601468,5.695894301807195,5.626901430320244,5.907203395474402,6.600350576034347,5.907203395474402,6.032366538428407,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.443229422299901E-5,6.399781220001259E-5,6.449533416480856E-5,6.412267943691249E-5,6.412373001482098E-5,6.403409785462999E-5,6.422454423365707E-5,6.400702746679517E-5,6.41509385978695E-5,7.117196451257831E-5,0.2754262905562529,6.390370601247299E-5,6.509643699553496E-5,6.60250519733088E-5,6.395030392826023E-5,6.377357288016061E-5,6.536432488146211E-5,6.423056158866457E-5,6.40312865215494E-5,6.408435707350688E-5,6.470441081442418E-5,6.429419782181492E-5,6.436740651987816E-5,6.443675518101208E-5,6.49312741728434E-5,6.459170188847206E-5,6.730701432966529E-5,6.392270399833973E-5,6.392441408037083E-5,6.408636622194987E-5,6.544850693321672E-5,6.422683997610216E-5,0.26041637697699527,6.440750059921911E-5,6.399228098696242E-5,0.06399583310427061,6.392815912225808E-5,6.396593596080501E-5,6.377325247657417E-5,6.378979820049669E-5,6.39333812836803E-5,6.460774298530044E-5,6.427944389297477E-5,6.402530094043518E-5,6.480327548148942E-5,6.404987420080075E-5,6.617793346122592E-5,6.520476765991755E-5,6.380565345260668E-5,6.394666784872045E-5,6.392448873510888E-5,0.12122826655625513,6.394761925322914E-5,6.378413512408333E-5,6.448425728920002E-5,6.396409046236706E-5,6.878634945690126E-5,6.391137574049422E-5,6.380491557682864E-5,6.410956532196564E-5,6.474547832974152E-5,6.410532410955833E-5,6.379311152480311E-5,6.39416440146074E-5,6.377402382535177E-5,6.524962255280432E-5,0.06989043278781203,6.418638882886015E-5,6.413025493089485E-5,0.05340782542150273,6.377169724782027E-5,6.413159939164797E-5,0.15092856776029379,6.388597967154551E-5,6.546712438170937E-5,6.405488771131385E-5,6.455621338166146E-5,6.416167420472121E-5,6.37517029425088E-5,6.383072755681009E-5]}}
{"value":"Historically accurate? Hmm... Perhaps... if you squint, and light falls upon the subject just-so. But core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal, patchy and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion. The principal characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes that range from the 'enigmatic and noble' American Indians through to the 'stuffy but sadistic' British officers. A wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in American history.

{"value":"Sugar &Spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails . When I saw last January I was so disgusted by the film that I walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. I've heard that the DVD has a director's cut maybe I'll check it out, but this PG-13 trash movie is s*** and the worst kind of s***. Maybe if the film had some T&A that would've have made it okay. But the gags are lame and the acting is horrible. Worse than a Troma film.","finished_norm":["sugar","spice","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","of","the","film","try","to","cross","heather","and","bring","it","on","and","fail","when","i","see","last","januari","i","be","so","disgust","by","the","film","that","i","walk","and","talk","on","my","cell","phone","to","my","girlfriend","for","the","last","half","hour","of","the","movi","i","have","hear","that","the","dvd","have","a","director","cut","mayb","i","will","check","it","out","but","thi","pg","trash","movi","be","and","the","wrong","kind","of","mayb","if","the","film","have","some","ta","that","would","have","have","make","it","okai","but","the","gag","be","lame","and","the","act","be","horribl","wrong","than","a","troma","film"],"filtered":["sugar","spice","wrong","movi","film","try","cross","heather","bring","fail","see","last","januari","disgust","film","walk","talk","cell","phone","girlfriend","last","half","hour","movi","hear","dvd","director","cut","mayb","check","thi","pg","trash","movi","wrong","kind","mayb","film","ta","make","okai","gag","lame","act","horribl","wrong","troma","film"],"filtered2":["sugar","spice","wrong","try","cross","heather","bring","fail","see","last","januari","disgust","walk","talk","cell","phone","girlfriend","last","half","hour","hear","dvd","director","cut","mayb","check","pg","trash","wrong","kind","mayb","ta","make","okai","gag","lame","act","horribl","wrong","troma"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,21,25,36,58,122,144,163,174,186,191,206,215,216,230,247,250,294,303,372,504,671,730,963,983,998,1255,1730,2020,2835,3666,3777,3974,4142,7050],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,21,25,36,58,122,144,163,174,186,191,206,215,216,230,247,250,294,303,372,504,671,730,963,983,998,1255,1730,2020,2835,3666,3777,3974,4142,7050],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.162015545335049,3.838916364248105,1.4680183469605717,1.865701314626681,2.2489347673732487,4.586221753978809,4.800114871605731,2.456282578459816,2.571852579609833,2.5460113484259455,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,2.6070186965339692,2.7121382192999195,2.7303758068497004,2.6812935439488212,2.886778509330039,2.868298950055202,3.070535816550098,3.41740676039221,3.6466665387238555,3.767137231978131,4.035401218572811,4.165705761027235,4.135246553542527,4.3095999406873045,4.8184434032493035,5.0768550934009715,5.501738287366237,5.822646007446338,5.999576715605417,6.137727054086234,5.9370563586240825,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.64554404659334E-5,9.580501888143043E-5,9.654981154843968E-5,9.59919457087332E-5,9.599351842868879E-5,9.585933867309581E-5,9.61444377774459E-5,9.581881417814062E-5,9.603424980251375E-5,1.0654475785274923E-4,1.240865655645526E-4,9.566414148634208E-5,0.2100639130406171,0.7823747351184451,9.573389878035518E-5,9.546933158941434E-5,9.785069464357718E-5,9.615344578553701E-5,9.585513009455837E-5,9.593457695465483E-5,9.68628002534518E-5,9.624870951891994E-5,9.635830327625516E-5,9.646211854057345E-5,9.72024157432584E-5,9.669407447349542E-5,1.0075890967261882E-4,9.569258155846492E-5,9.569514155912191E-5,9.593758465910441E-5,9.797671556180204E-5,9.61478745144333E-5,1.0320659843932068E-4,9.641832429722832E-5,9.579673863008291E-5,9.623890372872103E-5,9.570074790403256E-5,9.575730000489125E-5,9.546885194377341E-5,9.54936209684996E-5,9.570856550367323E-5,9.671808806914333E-5,9.62266228196639E-5,9.584616965213151E-5,9.701080111425137E-5,9.588295593579295E-5,9.906867042535478E-5,9.761183674988902E-5,9.551735635375029E-5,9.57284555525793E-5,9.569525331760777E-5,9.838847746846073E-5,9.572987980949975E-5,9.548514331709159E-5,9.653322941476445E-5,9.575453728525106E-5,1.0297348115443549E-4,9.567562310442606E-5,9.551625175032062E-5,9.597231381840904E-5,9.692427851255377E-5,9.59659647039504E-5,9.549858103020836E-5,9.572093484983163E-5,9.547000665643721E-5,9.767898473061237E-5,9.629243594819476E-5,9.608731896117181E-5,9.600328625802803E-5,9.635323349702715E-5,9.546652375918382E-5,9.600529892195216E-5,9.756244113786656E-5,9.56376050725355E-5,9.800458596772762E-5,9.589046118406407E-5,9.664094801575906E-5,9.605032105529216E-5,9.543659219227494E-5,9.555489240293795E-5]}}
{"value":"After watching about half of this movie I noticed something peculiar ... I found myself constantly switching through tv-channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait.<br /><br />This movie is listed as being in a number of genres, and I must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them. 80% through the movie I switched over to watch an old rerun instead. Bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste.","finished_norm":["after","watch","about","half","of","thi","movi","i","notic","someth","peculiar","i","find","myself","constantli","switch","through","tvchannel","to","see","what","els","be","on","not","exactli","a","good","movi","traitbr","br","thi","movi","be","list","a","be","in","a","numb","of","genr","and","i","must","sai","it","mostli","fail","misser","in","everi","on","of","them","through","the","movi","i","switch","over","to","watch","a","old","rerun","instead","bottom","line","the","whole","movi","feel","a","if","the","on","make","it","do","not","exactli","know","what","to","make","and","end","up","in","a","concoct","with","no","discern","tast"],"filtered":["watch","half","thi","movi","notic","someth","peculiar","find","constantli","switch","tvchannel","see","els","exactli","good","movi","traitbr","br","thi","movi","list","numb","genr","must","sai","mostli","fail","misser","everi","movi","switch","watch","old","rerun","instead","bottom","line","whole","movi","feel","make","exactli","know","make","end","concoct","discern","tast"],"filtered2":["watch","half","notic","someth","peculiar","find","constantli","switch","tvchannel","see","els","exactli","good","traitbr","list","numb","genr","must","mostli","fail","misser","everi","switch","watch","old","rerun","instead","bottom","line","whole","feel","make","exactli","know","make","end","concoct","discern","tast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,24,26,38,43,53,67,85,107,111,141,152,196,206,215,462,467,510,516,602,688,860,872,1157,1579,3418,3738,5995,6047],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,24,26,38,43,53,67,85,107,111,141,152,196,206,215,462,467,510,516,602,688,860,872,1157,1579,3418,3738,5995,6047],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.9570915389266579,2.011190219103739,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,2.2657547357741192,2.3131195476980753,2.478925055209576,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,6.5279063751982145,3.342254038012865,3.374440724508766,3.442099372982581,3.555828138310924,3.6016814428070463,3.8538340941043407,3.857614816944247,4.224077767249142,9.210500365576523,5.626901430320244,5.719991853386255,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.16464701741119864,0.06891537600340493,1.2054653972150401E-4,1.1985002053076787E-4,1.1985198413841821E-4,1.1968445501559548E-4,1.200404133541559E-4,1.1963385846276471E-4,1.1990283898830303E-4,1.3302565461943694E-4,0.6799570605313282,1.194407430388535E-4,0.07731144418575624,1.234056952085328E-4,1.1952783798268358E-4,1.1919751460990561E-4,1.2217074750799306E-4,1.2005166023478414E-4,1.1967920042657352E-4,1.1977839320512766E-4,1.2093731941082733E-4,1.201706010513025E-4,1.2030743351125205E-4,1.2043705127728533E-4,1.2136134377167728E-4,1.2072665810958443E-4,1.2580177746957053E-4,1.1947625167661112E-4,1.1947944794614221E-4,1.197821484518556E-4,1.2232808997589536E-4,1.2004470426622623E-4,1.2885782083629497E-4,1.2038237230473935E-4,1.1960629620357297E-4,1.201583581058347E-4,1.194864477058375E-4,1.1955705540525362E-4,1.191969157519547E-4,1.1922784093114597E-4,1.1949620831096449E-4,1.2075664010349204E-4,1.2014302486936609E-4,1.1966801293369695E-4,1.2112210477041597E-4,1.1971394217098372E-4,1.2369144199307988E-4,1.2187252328458452E-4,1.1925747556755838E-4,1.1952104188165786E-4,1.1947958748135764E-4,1.2284219220189433E-4,1.1952282012690432E-4,1.1921725622335823E-4,1.2052583622344752E-4,1.1955360603246351E-4,1.2856676400675282E-4,1.194550783266001E-4,1.192560964232693E-4,1.1982550928202676E-4,1.210140776280003E-4,1.1981758214300898E-4,1.1923403377881916E-4,1.1951165196490954E-4,1.191983574597505E-4,1.2195636038996742E-4,1.2022519535510196E-4,1.1996909808647796E-4,1.1986417968814071E-4,1.2030110367659689E-4,1.1919400891462786E-4,1.1986669258451808E-4,1.2181085076538186E-4,1.194076111993429E-4,1.223628873612147E-4,1.1972331279216179E-4,1.20660327471077E-4,1.199229046298652E-4,1.1915663808229331E-4,1.1930434091894356E-4]}}
