{"value":"Marie Dressler carries this Depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner, which recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month. If you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you'll be disappointed, as this is really a very downbeat film. It's also very poorly made, surprisingly so considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's bare bones cinematography is strictly from the 'set up the camera and don't move it' school, frequently to the detriment of the cast, who find themselves delivering lines off screen (it's like a pan and scan print before such existed!) or having their heads cut off. The film doesn't even have a credited director, underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production. Overall, it's an unsatisfying mess, with Dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre, final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart.","finished_norm":["mari","dressler","carri","thi","depressionera","drama","about","a","kindli","bank","owner","which","recent","air","on","tcm","dure","their","april","fool","comedi","month","if","you","come","with","the","expect","of","big","laugh","courtesi","the","dresslerpolli","moran","team","you","will","be","disappoint","a","thi","be","realli","a","veri","downbeat","film","it","conjur","veri","poorli","make","surprisingli","so","consid","it","come","from","mgm","leonard","smith","bare","bone","cinematographi","be","strictli","from","the","set","up","the","camera","and","do","not","move","it","school","frequent","to","the","detrim","of","the","cast","who","find","themselv","deliv","line","off","screen","it","like","a","pan","and","scan","print","befor","such","exist","or","have","their","head","cut","off","the","film","doe","not","even","have","a","credit","director","underli","the","appar","fly","by","night","natur","of","the","product","overal","it","a","unsatisfi","mess","with","dressler","frequent","overemot","and","onli","that","bizarr","final","reel","dash","to","the","bathroom","to","set","it","apart"],"filtered":["mari","dressler","carri","thi","depressionera","drama","kindli","bank","owner","recent","air","tcm","dure","april","fool","comedi","month","come","expect","big","laugh","courtesi","dresslerpolli","moran","team","disappoint","thi","realli","veri","downbeat","film","conjur","veri","poorli","make","surprisingli","consid","come","mgm","leonard","smith","bare","bone","cinematographi","strictli","set","camera","move","school","frequent","detrim","cast","find","themselv","deliv","line","screen","like","pan","scan","print","befor","exist","head","cut","film","doe","even","credit","director","underli","appar","fly","night","natur","product","overal","unsatisfi","mess","dressler","frequent","overemot","onli","bizarr","final","reel","dash","bathroom","set","apart"],"filtered2":["mari","dressler","carri","depressionera","drama","kindli","bank","owner","recent","air","tcm","dure","april","fool","comedi","month","come","expect","big","laugh","courtesi","dresslerpolli","moran","team","disappoint","realli","veri","downbeat","conjur","veri","poorli","make","surprisingli","consid","come","mgm","leonard","smith","bare","bone","cinematographi","strictli","set","camera","move","school","frequent","detrim","cast","find","themselv","deliv","line","screen","like","pan","scan","print","befor","exist","head","cut","doe","even","credit","director","underli","appar","fly","night","natur","product","overal","unsatisfi","mess","dressler","frequent","overemot","onli","bizarr","final","reel","dash","bathroom","set","apart"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,11,13,15,18,34,38,39,58,79,82,92,107,109,127,130,133,156,187,190,192,208,210,231,239,275,296,303,308,317,356,398,407,412,436,456,463,517,528,562,572,594,621,629,652,679,723,823,921,1057,1231,1265,1398,1528,1763,1774,1999,2335,2364,2416,2545,2638,2947,3026,3130,3225,4856,5552,6005,6098,6702,6719,6790,7038],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,11,13,15,18,34,38,39,58,79,82,92,107,109,127,130,133,156,187,190,192,208,210,231,239,275,296,303,308,317,356,398,407,412,436,456,463,517,528,562,572,594,621,629,652,679,723,823,921,1057,1231,1265,1398,1528,1763,1774,1999,2335,2364,2416,2545,2638,2947,3026,3130,3225,4856,5552,6005,6098,6702,6719,6790,7038],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.2153159934048174,2.7965700178917925,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.865701314626681,1.9469506069506084,2.020196584395323,2.0489535369135887,2.1439533986393955,4.251382278653714,2.4359679371086367,2.2642139034199635,2.3212364753796515,2.3451551414151686,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.6289494000279396,2.687151791517189,2.7049353070058615,2.6593400337329487,2.7832848715031413,2.9504565686333644,2.868298950055202,2.8753661172782943,2.8529247828056143,3.028335462059722,3.143848349181566,3.120015873813468,3.107414446935464,3.2070272508030975,3.3001658770939146,3.3467891931782563,3.4198487640477615,3.4198487640477615,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.496027715008137,3.5446859617576822,3.488143311483988,3.7810747398219124,3.6715125373103863,3.865219416329466,3.850067611308864,4.3521595551061,4.181290492043933,4.327618446189983,4.760735085628657,4.429617614145104,4.848596441419991,9.48443207572284,4.828393734102471,4.979216623837056,5.0768550934009715,5.116075806554253,5.156897801074508,5.7446844659766265,5.339219357868463,5.822646007446338,5.482320201509136,5.463272006538442,5.541743621979936,6.101359409915359,6.3425214667

{"value":"I'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film. But I can't understand how this one got made. Who made it? How could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at some film school, get a nice big cheque from daddy and kidnap David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or was he by any chance a longtime family friend/distant relation doing this out of sheer, misplaced kindness? I don't care, don't want to know. Even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it, mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile the DOP must have been the gaffer from Neighbours, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, the direction and editing were all abysmal, and quite frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means that I can't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film.","finished_norm":["i","be","rare","move","to","make","a","comment","onlin","about","a","film","but","i","ca","not","understand","how","thi","on","get","make","who","make","it","how","can","thei","have","possibli","think","thei","be","capabl","of","make","a","featur","film","do","thei","do","a","weekend","cours","at","some","film","school","get","a","nice","big","chequ","from","daddi","and","kidnap","david","badiel","famili","on","by","on","until","he","agre","to","be","in","it","or","be","he","by","ani","chanc","a","longtim","famili","frienddist","relat","do","thi","out","of","sheer","misplac","kind","i","do","not","care","do","not","want","to","know","even","he","look","utterli","embarrass","to","be","in","it","mumbl","hi","line","and","hide","hi","face","from","the","camera","meanwhil","the","dop","must","have","be","the","gaffer","from","neighbour","there","seem","to","be","absolut","no","sound","design","the","script","the","direct","and","edit","be","all","abysm","and","quit","frankli","the","apathi","that","overwhelm","me","right","now","mean","that","i","ca","not","be","bother","to","spend","ani","much","of","my","life","think","about","thi","film"],"filtered":["rare","move","make","comment","onlin","film","ca","understand","thi","get","make","make","thei","possibli","think","thei","capabl","make","featur","film","thei","weekend","cours","film","school","get","nice","big","chequ","daddi","kidnap","david","badiel","famili","agre","ani","chanc","longtim","famili","frienddist","relat","thi","sheer","misplac","kind","care","want","know","even","look","utterli","embarrass","mumbl","hi","line","hide","hi","face","camera","meanwhil","dop","must","gaffer","neighbour","seem","absolut","sound","design","script","direct","edit","abysm","quit","frankli","apathi","overwhelm","right","mean","ca","bother","spend","ani","much","life","think","thi","film"],"filtered2":["rare","move","make","comment","onlin","ca","understand","get","make","make","possibli","think","capabl","make","featur","weekend","cours","school","get","nice","big","chequ","daddi","kidnap","david","badiel","famili","agre","ani","chanc","longtim","famili","frienddist","relat","sheer","misplac","kind","care","want","know","even","look","utterli","embarrass","mumbl","line","hide","face","camera","meanwhil","dop","must","gaffer","neighbour","seem","absolut","sound","design","script","direct","edit","abysm","quit","frankli","apathi","overwhelm","right","mean","ca","bother","spend","ani","life","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,12,16,26,27,35,37,75,77,81,82,88,102,107,120,121,122,141,178,182,199,205,212,222,231,251,262,275,280,283,296,305,348,486,496,556,558,622,675,681,707,816,903,1013,1333,1370,1536,1565,1626,1728,2102,2710,2969,3488,4059,5270,5750,6569],"values":[4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,12,16,26,27,35,37,75,77,81,82,88,102,107,120,121,122,141,178,182,199,205,212,222,231,251,262,275,280,283,296,305,348,486,496,556,558,622,675,681,707,816,903,1013,1333,1370,1536,1565,1626,1728,2102,2710,2969,3488,4059,5270,5750,6569],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,1.3324924169710188,2.600540117735859,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,3.899514464849456,2.020196584395323,2.0317223413467334,2.087553710177271,2.1439533986393955,2.2044500422972613,2.2190595059394194,2.2489347673732487,2.2657547357741192,2.532833256045391,5.473059344848157,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,2.5983793339432615,2.5771019354959765,2.7049353070058615,2.6942272927333892,2.726701583487816,2.7832848715031413,2.8028805344481915,2.7678802023081546,2.9504565686333644,2.8612813773965557,3.0103169565570433,3.3066947359763783,3.293679367864308,3.43462735814388,3.4572130107926293,3.4933926673701317,3.749984152751882,3.706716172503366,3.6375061693251913,3.7881170224473255,3.948766986599908,4.039936373738201,4.383707912841026,4.520909034354511,4.5432147918688095,4.671389985292807,4.613282354485526,4.760735085628657,4.944927550358424,5.463272006538442,5.373120909544144,5.626901430320244,5.850044981634453,6.214688095222362,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7809600260830546E-4,1.7793818273669404E-4,1.7798211704855185E-4,1.779463369498888E-4,1.7796317745993035E-4,1.7793720163923523E-4,1.7799254257930275E-4,1.7791072748576272E-4,1.7793822034210992E-4,1.7812210021138085E-4,1.7953544723228764E-4,1.7793851425003637E-4,1.7810703326759457E-4,1.7812558894762562E-4,1.780446711435417E-4,1.7794703785475497E-4,1.780082585178409E-4,1.7809202980947921E-4,1.7795622449306685E-4,1.779555738674539E-4,1.7811567195816054E-4,1.779734031991653E-4,1.7797367254648739E-4,1.78087684386

{"value":"I liked it but then I think I might have been ironing at the same time. This reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac/Roxanne is an utterly undemanding, formulaic romcom rescued from straight-to-video ignominy on its release by the sharp turn of Janeane Garofalo. Playing the Frasier of Pets, she finds herself caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend (Uma Thurman) off as herself when a caller comes a-courtin'.<br /><br />This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this film. He is unremarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is unsurprising on the basis of it, although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both the later Terence Malick films. Uma Thurman does a ditzy turn on autopilot and Michael Lehmann packages it all together competently.

{"value":"This movie starts out very VERY slow, but when the action finally gets started, it's a little had to follow. I couldn't understand why some of the events were taking place, and a lot of events happened before they were explained, making them sort of confusing. The only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood/gore it has, although most times the special effects are lacking. Blood looks like red Kool-Aid. Skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks. Again, the story has a sort of amateur feel to it, like the writer didn't take a long time to perfect it. I feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script. I honestly wish I hadn't watched it, not because of the gore, but because I feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life.

{"value":"The most positive thing I can say for this dull witted local \"comedy\" production is that it's inoffensive. In fact it's so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re-writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality. It's not witty, it's not entertaining, it's not insightful, and it's not charming. It's just a staid, laughless, progression of four losers who must change their ways - and their attitudes towards women - to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding.<br /><br />With acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society, a plot line so tired it'd make a forty third season of 'Allo 'Allo look fresh, and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying

{"value":"An excellent performance by Alix Elias highlights an otherwise mis-directed and confused pile of dreck. I have seen this movie, perhaps 12 times, and with each run through, I find less and less pleasure. Why are Munchies so lustful? Is that ever explained? Are they a reflection of our wanton, boorish 'animal selves?' If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie, and make that connection explicit? Another part of this movie that bothers me to no end - motorcycles. The jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest 'street-wise' traveler. The sun glasses say 'pretty cool dude.' With all this I'm ready for Easy Rider meets the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives?

{"value":"Despite some occasionally original touches, like the \"virtual sets\" that provide the background for the Victorian interiors featuring Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film falls short and ultimately disappoints. Newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented, but is wasted as Emmy, a character who by mid-film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching Lady Ada narrate an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' takes off briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera lingers on her facial expressions, mannerisms, even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible, apporting into scenes to dramatize Emmy's \"virtual\" rendering of her.<br /><br />A straightforward biopic of Ada Lovelace would have been worthwhile, but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both

{"value":"Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life. Abundant \"emotionally powerful\" scenes do not go with this plot and, because of bad acting, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve, although it is difficult to speak of any characters... perhaps except for Sonny. Beside him, actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to, they come off as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie more: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad acting, disturbing any appeal that might be

{"value":"So the wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was just very little excitement. The acting was atrocious, to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes (the church lady for example). The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin, although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like The Ring. Rather then get the police involved -- which I'm sure those earplugs she found would have DNA all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister. I call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too, which the movie then fades to black.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential. The premise is good, the cast is great (I was especially pumped to witness the return of David Naughton) and, God love 'em, you can tell everyone tried their best. It just falls short over and over again. \"Brutal Massacre\" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can do Christopher Guest movies and, despite the fact he makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often...they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me.

{"value":"The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />Second, the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah, I know one star more is not much, but in this movie's case, it is a lot.<br /><br />The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah...we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Watch the first eighteen minutes with

{"value":"Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came along, there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the Hong Kong movie industry. Don't believe it. The people now making movies in HK give new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name draw, here, but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin. He flips the coin over and over and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy. But once again: who knows why? There's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera. Nothing makes any sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what?

{"value":"I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at a low-key Sci-Fi con in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a nice chat with him and his \"career\" and life. All these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. Wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (The cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How 'bout a remake of Creature, but 50 years older!

{"value":"This movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people don't have a southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who does meth and I don't know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about. It has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it's really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar. I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug. The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don't want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions.

{"value":"So don't even think about renting this from the shops, because this is one hell of a bad movie. You'd think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie. Basically, a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out. Fans of the completely terrible \"Shrek\" might enjoy, but \"Wallace & Gromit\" fans will probably turn away in disgust. Also, why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation?? For an AARDMAN movie??!! Obviously, Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, WRONG!!! Nearly every single character is awful, apart from that freaky frog guy, who is just right for a movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL!!! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I DID fall asleep with boredom watching this movie. It's just terrible.

{"value":"I'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake.<br /><br />After seeing Der Untergang this is a huge disappointment. There's no connection between different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor I couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential.<br /><br />And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound to it, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he's speaking/yelling German.<br /><br />The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened.<br /><br />Whether it's the English or the fact that I've already

{"value":"Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it isn't a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intended humor, but on quite a few occasions the poor acting, poor directing, and appalling script had the audience laughing out loud in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist just reaching his peak shot dead by an assassin he walks in on by mistake. The killer sees the young artists work portfolio he is carrying and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the exhibition the assassin meets the dead artists sister and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and the end will not have anyone guessing as it is so poorly scripted. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is.

{"value":"This grainy film has a cult following and one of those word-of-mouth features you just had to see. Maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, that knows the legend is true. This tale is told in documentary-style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved. The legend changes with the telling, but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek. Long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall, this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the 'bejeebers' out of most of the community. I personally crossed over the small Boggy Creek bridge in 1974, and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise. Of course it was about 1 a.m. in the rain.

{"value":"Basic slasher movie premise, 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family.

YAWN<br /><br />23 minutes of watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the heck they are eating ... OK there might be a drinking game here ... nope - YAWN <br /><br />Complimentary shower scenes ... OK got my interest for a couple of seconds.<br /><br />Completely random and uninspired killings ... YAWN <br /><br />The ending ... dude! that psycho is deranged - why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes... unfortunately that is it - My advice - fast forward to the last five

{"value":"I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. First, I'm going to say that it looks great. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer. I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. I would not call this a horror movie. Putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie. There's no mystery, there's no suspense, you know who did it the entire time. <br /><br />It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides the entire movie. The acting was okay, I guess, but nothing special.<br /><br />And the tagline, \"Revenge can be deadly\"....really?...they should have check how many hundreds of horror/thriller movies have that exact

{"value":"Well, the artyfartyrati of Cannes may have liked this film but not me I am afraid. If you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. A large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. I did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. The plot, however, has little to recommend. A large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people. But lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth.

{"value":"I was very disappointed in this movie. Plotwise it was weak bordering on silly: Souls who can affect reality in the way they do? A mission apparently critical to the Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole B-story with the \"holobrothel\" and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point I blurted out to the television, \"Why are you wasting my time with this?\"<br /><br />Thematically, \"River of Souls\" didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode \"Soul Hunter\" did. We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still don't get a feeling for their culture. (Are there any female Soul Hunters?)<br /><br />The acting was okay, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive.

{"value":"I had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience, and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post-screening survey. I felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot. Instead, it was composed of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact any one sub-plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film. (The time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub-plots and characters.)

{"value":"If you're after the real story of early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you'll be disappointed- however if you're after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme, you've found you're movie.<br /><br />This film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that it almost made me weep. (Type in Artemisia inaccuracies in Google and check out some of the fact vs. fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES let it down a bit.<br /><br />I wonder how the director/co-writer Agnès Merlet defended her film at the time?

{"value":"...but it's certainly not without merit. Already writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (No wonder the Coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to Sturges.)<br /><br />The major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise, the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. The coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon, and the ending is thoroughly predictable. Frank Capra does this sort of thing much better.<br /><br />If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out \"The Lady Eve\" or \"Sullivan's Travels\" or \"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\" first.

{"value":"This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter).<br /><br />The main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from \"A clockwork orange\") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. At least in my opinion.<br /><br />To wrap it up: shockingly brutal, revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.

{"value":"This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good film. Sure, the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties--I especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel, and the tram rising up the hillside--but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating, because it creates a mood that \"something's going to happen\"--and nothing does. The script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma--and time after time not delivering. Not even delivering the (I assume) theme of the movie, the characters' essential misfit. The lead actors, both too pretty for their roles, didn't convey any repression or agony, and the script didn't expose us to any.<br /><br />Now, Donald Sutherland? That's another story.

{"value":"How cynical are the writers, to pander so. I may be an American citizen, but I don't need to see other Americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film. I'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic, sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in \"U-571\" (which changes British submariners to American ones) but you still walk away feeling a little slimy. Really, the Germans in this film do nothing but admire the Americans between battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I'd just like to say to the writers: it's obvious to many of us that you can't capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you've taken some very well tested shortcuts.

{"value":"I just watched the 30th Anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my all time Favorites!! The TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. The plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. It was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of Blazing Saddles and there have been TV shows that have succeeded in doing take-offs of big movies, but this one would never have worked. Considering that for so many years TV would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on TV with the \"N\" word thrown around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces!!! There were quite a few actors/actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and do a few searches. That was fun. I was arguing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash.

{"value":"Many people thought that this is a good movie but I don't agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, then hey killed some people on the earth, but for no reason. Also, it is in a dark forest, I can't see anything on the screen, I can only hardly hear the sound.<br /><br />After a few days, the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that, he should not know what happened on the earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason. He was not live on earth, t is none of his business about the things happened here. Lastly, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly.<br /><br />In conclusion, I don't think this is a good

{"value":"It is obviously illegal. Pedophiles pray on stuff like this. How did they get away with making such a movie? This movie is all summed up in one word, SICK. Where do people get off making, and watching these kinds of films. As I was watching the movie I didn't actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman. Sorry if this is a spoiler to you but I would have rater not seen this. Where has the sanity of these people gone? Maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles? Our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children, yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior. I noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked. This is a kid here, and someone is asking something like this?

{"value":"This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This to me was the greatest flaw - I know the ages and general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude.<br /><br />As a native Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about the history. I can accept a decent production from either perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne's or Fess Parker's versions had more life than this stolid mess, while being only slightly less accurate.<br /><br />Very disappointing - avoid
