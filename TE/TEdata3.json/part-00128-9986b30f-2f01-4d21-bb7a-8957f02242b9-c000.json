{"value":"This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. <br /><br />There wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /><br />Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /><br />Examples<br /><br />>The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /><br />>The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????<br /><br />>And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator.....<br /><br />There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? <br /><br />There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either. <br /><br />Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least.

money.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","make","it","into","on","of","my","top","much","aw","movi","horribl","br","br","there","be","not","a","continu","minut","where","there","be","not","a","fight","with","on","monster","or","anoth","there","be","no","chanc","for","ani","charact","develop","thei","be","too","busi","run","from","on","sword","fight","to","anoth","i","have","no","emot","attach","except","to","the","big","bad","machin","that","want","to","destroi","them","br","br","scene","be","blatantli","steal","from","other","movi","lotr","star","war","and","matrix","br","br","examplesbr","br","the","ghost","scene","at","the","end","be","steal","from","the","final","scene","of","the","old","star","war","with","yoda","obe","on","and","vader","br","br","the","spider","machin","in","the","begin","be","exactli","like","frodo","be","attack","by","the","spider","in","return","of","the","king","elijah","wood","be","the","victim","in","both","film","and","waitit","hypnot","sting","it","victim","and","wrap","them","upuh","hellobr","br","and","the","whole","machin","v","human","theme","be","the","matrixor","terminatorbr","br","there","be","much","exampl","but","why","wast","the","time","and","will","someon","tell","me","what","be","with","the","nazi","nazi","br","br","there","be","a","juvenil","stori","line","rush","to","a","juvenil","conclus","the","movi","can","not","decid","if","it","be","a","child","movi","or","a","adult","movi","and","be","not","much","of","either","br","br","just","aw","a","real","disappoint","to","sai","the","littl","save","your","monei"],"filtered":["thi","movi","make","top","much","aw","movi","horribl","br","br","continu","minut","fight","monster","anoth","chanc","ani","charact","develop","thei","busi","run","sword","fight","anoth","emot","attach","except","big","bad","machin","want","destroi","br","br","scene","blatantli","steal","movi","lotr","star","war","matrix","br","br","examplesbr","br","ghost","scene","end","steal","final","scene","old","star","war","yoda","obe","vader","br","br","spider","machin","begin","exactli","like","frodo","attack","spider","return","king","elijah","wood","victim","film","waitit","hypnot","sting","victim","wrap","upuh","hellobr","br","whole","machin","v","human","theme","matrixor","terminatorbr","br","much","exampl","wast","time","someon","tell","nazi","nazi","br","br","juvenil","stori","line","rush","juvenil","conclus","movi","decid","child","movi","adult","movi","much","either","br","br","aw","real","disappoint","sai","littl","save","monei"],"filtered2":["make","top","aw","horribl","continu","minut","fight","monster","anoth","chanc","ani","charact","develop","busi","run","sword","fight","anoth","emot","attach","except","big","bad","machin","want","destroi","scene","blatantli","steal","lotr","star","war","matrix","examplesbr","ghost","scene","end","steal","final","scene","old","star","war","yoda","obe","vader","spider","machin","begin","exactli","like","frodo","attack","spider","return","king","elijah","wood","victim","waitit","hypnot","sting","victim","wrap","upuh","hellobr","whole","machin","v","human","theme","matrixor","terminatorbr","exampl","wast","time","someon","tell","nazi","nazi","juvenil","stori","line","rush","juvenil","conclus","decid","child","adult","either","aw","real","disappoint","littl","save","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,9,10,14,17,19,24,27,37,59,67,73,80,82,89,90,100,107,111,126,137,138,139,147,156,180,187,189,207,230,232,233,249,292,307,314,320,364,413,433,462,486,488,495,506,533,535,541,578,655,727,734,738,790,957,1071,1363,1417,1856,1934,1941,1949,1988,2600,3240,3954,3989,6096,7893],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,9,10,14,17,19,24,27,37,59,67,73,80,82,89,90,100,107,111,126,137,138,139,147,156,180,187,189,207,230,232,233,249,292,307,314,320,364,413,433,462,486,488,495,506,533,535,541,578,655,727,734,738,790,957,1071,1363,1417,1856,1934,1941,1949,1988,2600,3240,3954,3989,6096,7893],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,3.9371420340352055,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.4876543214774305,1.8693254449200722,1.9570915389266579,3.7901378413541957,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,4.281092480635563,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,2.2391270689902285,2.2939035841256437,4.581473037857885,2.2939035841256437,2.2844323215331563,2.3451551414151686,2.7097314792693545,2.4732161909892554,2.498193474075453,2.5531798379045583,2.7121382192999195,5.675566812258503,2.6102777977348763,2.6754694156628323,2.9752256367457734,2.8767855639325206,6.378794038853654,2.938

{"value":"This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, it's, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named Seth - like the snake in \"King Cobra\" the same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the Unisols, and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're lookin' at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin': drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges). But, though he takes a lickin', he keeps on kickin'! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you're a

{"value":"For domestic audiences I can see how they would applaud this movie. For outsiders, with no vested interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction. How a young woman could 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense. How she could, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me. I mentioned the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the marsh. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening. I suppose they did not want to get their boots wet, but I am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh. But that would have ended the story. Also, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof.

{"value":"I give this five out of 10. All five marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? We don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point! Also we're given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete waste of film! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes.

{"value":"When I was in school I made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking, and I realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a cliché of Canadian cinema: sodden lyricism married to vacant, metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary. But whatever my own film's failings I feel much better after seeing this...this...thing. For one thing, mine ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content at that: every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four, five, six relentless minutes. The male lead is just incredible, a brow-beating, loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the U of T pub, and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him. Admittedly if he weren't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense, as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values; but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper \"please\" in closeup until the magazine runs out. I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN, which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery: this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst Canadian movie of all time.

{"value":"Apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his 14-year old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges himself alcoholically in the meantime; as I said earlier, although I've always wanted to catch one of Paul Naschy's werewolf pictures, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as awful as it most certainly is, I still intend to pursue other entries in the series, albeit very gradually.<br /><br />Despite some high profile disappointments like Joe Dante's THE HOWLING (1981), I love werewolf pictures in general but, to be honest, I quickly lost interest in this film's \"plot\" and just stood there gazing at my TV screen counting its absurdities as it were. There were far too many to mention them here but I have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona (i.e. going from a raging beast in one shot to a dazed, zombie-like state in the very next one - as if he's on a casual midnight stroll in the countryside, and sporting an entirely different wardrobe to boot...and, yes, I did know the reasons for this beforehand), as well as the \"Phantom Of The Opera\" look of the Wolfstein character! But what do I know - perhaps the elusive full-length version of this mess could very well have been a bona-fide horror classic!","finished_norm":["appar","thi","be","what","happen","when","a","director","allow","hi","year","old","nephew","to","rewrit","the","dialogu","on","the","set","while","he","indulg","himself","alcohol","in","the","meantim","a","i","sai","earli","although","i","have","alwai","want","to","catch","on","of","paul","naschi","werewolf","pictur","thi","atroc","serv","a","my","introduct","and","a","aw","a","it","much","certainli","be","i","still","intend","to","pursu","other","entri","in","the","seri","albeit","veri","graduallybr","br","despit","some","high","profil","disappoint","like","joe","dant","the","howl","i","love","werewolf","pictur","in","gener","but","to","be","honest","i","quickli","lose","interest","in","thi","film","plot","and","just","stand","there","gaze","at","my","tv","screen","count","it","absurd","a","it","be","there","be","far","too","mani","to","mention","them","here","but","i","have","to","sai","two","which","strike","me","a","particularli","hilari","be","the","schizophren","natur","of","the","werewolf","persona","ie","go","from","a","rage","beast","in","on","shoot","to","a","daze","zombielik","state","in","the","veri","next","on","a","if","he","on","a","casual","midnight","stroll","in","the","countrysid","and","sport","a","entir","differ","wardrob","to","bootand","ye","i","do","know","the","reason","for","thi","beforehand","a","good","a","the","phantom","of","the","opu","look","of","the","wolfstein","charact","but","what","do","i","know","perhap","the","elus","fulllength","version","of","thi","mess","can","veri","good","have","be","a","bonafid","horror","classic"],"filtered":["appar","thi","happen","director","allow","hi","year","old","nephew","rewrit","dialogu","set","indulg","alcohol","meantim","sai","earli","although","alwai","want","catch","paul","naschi","werewolf","pictur","thi","atroc","serv","introduct","aw","much","certainli","still","intend","pursu","entri","seri","albeit","veri","graduallybr","br","despit","high","profil","disappoint","like","joe","dant","howl","love","werewolf","pictur","gener","honest","quickli","lose","interest","thi","film","plot","stand","gaze","tv","screen","count","absurd","far","mani","mention","sai","two","strike","particularli","hilari","schizophren","natur","werewolf","persona","ie","go","rage","beast","shoot","daze","zombielik","state","veri","next","casual","midnight","stroll","countrysid","sport","entir","differ","wardrob","bootand","ye","know","reason","thi","beforehand","good","phantom","opu","look","wolfstein","charact","know","perhap","elus","fulllength","version","thi","mess","veri","good","bonafid","horror","classic"],"filtered2":["appar","happen","director","allow","year","old","nephew","rewrit","dialogu","set","indulg","alcohol","meantim","earli","although","alwai","want","catch","paul","naschi","werewolf","pictur","atroc","serv","introduct","aw","certainli","still","intend","pursu","entri","albeit","veri","graduallybr","despit","high","profil","disappoint","like","joe","dant","howl","love","werewolf","pictur","gener","honest","quickli","lose","interest","plot","stand","gaze","tv","screen","count","absurd","far","mani","mention","two","strike","particularli","hilari","schizophren","natur","werewolf","persona","ie","go","rage","beast","shoot","daze","zombielik","state","veri","next","casual","midnight","stroll","countrysid","sport","entir","differ","wardrob","bootand","ye","know","reason","beforehand","good","phantom","opu","look","wolfstein","charact","know","perhap","elus","fulllength","version","mess","veri","good","bonafid","horror","classic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,10,15,16,26,32,37,47,50,54,57,58,60,64,67,83,94,95,101,109,117,138,172,187,192,197,198,204,209,211,220,221,225,237,248,266,285,297,308,311,318,332,377,389,391,407,456,497,498,512,521,632,771,815,821,840,884,926,928,962,1056,1103,1200,1416,1676,1852,1905,2289,2305,2442,2463,2487,2964,2991,3009,3099,3148,3507,3590,3638,3663,3882,4012,4160,4864,5031,5374,5431,6197,6405,7236,7808,8202],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,10,15,16,26,32,37,47,50,54,57,58,60,64,67,83,94,95,101,109,117,138,172,187,192,197,198,204,209,211,220,221,225,237,248,266,285,297,308,311,318,332,377,389,391,407,456,497,498,512,521,632,771,815,821,840,884,926,928,962,1056,1103,1200,1416,1676,1852,1905,2289,2305,2442,2463,2487,2964,2991,3009,3099,3148,3507,3590,3638,3663,3882,4012,4160,4864,5031,5374,5431,6197,6405,7236,7808,8202],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,3.6001823395697077,1.1966138720291084,2.6649848339420377,1.37113112

{"value":"First of all, this is a low-budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low going into it. I assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest, and essentially that's all it is.<br /><br />Plot? There really is none. It's basically Saw but in China and a whole hell of a lot worse. Cast? There is none, period. Special Effects? Absolutely awful in my opinion... There were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts, splatter, color, texture, etc.<br /><br />I believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal, shock film. Now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting, poor dialogue, awful acting, what seemed like camcorder video shots, and just plain unbelievable \"gore,\" made this movie truly awful.<br /><br />There are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews, even \"b-rate\" movies deserve some opportunities (blood trails for example was the most recent I saw against reviews that was worth it), but this was simply awful. I hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it.<br /><br />I'm all for brutality and shock, but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience. Save your time/money and chance something else, you won't be

{"value":"Martin Weisz, who directed the solid \"Rohtenburg\", will be taking the heat, with Wes Craven, for another shabby \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\". The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only). A bunch of National Guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off. That's it. There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little else to get excited about. The film's \"heroes\" are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants, a far cry from Craven's original \"family\", mostly resemble Brian Thompson from \"Cobra\" coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the \"Wrong Turn\" shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves, ala \"The Descent\", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original \"Chainsaw\". Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle, but he's not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations.

{"value":"The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story \"Julia\" from her book \"Pentimento\". As one of the most odious of a plethora of Western-based USSR apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in Spain.<br /><br />As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian went to her grave an American-loathing communist. This film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the American Left then, just as now the full mooner Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy America.","finished_norm":["the","sign","of","a","classic","movi","be","that","it","ag","like","a","fine","red","wine","thi","movi","be","no","cabarnet","and","certainli","no","casablanca","i","agre","with","the","other","review","that","the","child","in","the","movi","be","a","unfortun","mutat","that","now","plagu","u","nightli","in","sitcom","and","the","dialogu","be","stilt","and","preachi","but","let","look","at","the","obsolet","theme","of","the","moviebr","br","with","the","passag","of","sixti","plu","year","of","histori","come","wisdom","sinc","watch","on","the","rhine","author","lillian","hellman","have","be","expos","a","a","bidenesqu","plagiarist","with","her","so","call","reallif","stori","julia","from","her","book","pentimento","a","on","of","the","much","odiou","of","a","plethora","of","westernbas","ussr","apologist","it","be","obviou","her","theme","in","the","plai","and","movi","be","to","stir","america","to","action","to","save","the","bloodi","soviet","dictat","stalin","and","intern","commun","from","the","fascist","who","have","just","prove","their","militari","superior","in","spainbr","br","a","on","review","correctli","note","thi","be","not","a","proamerican","plai","and","movi","a","lillian","go","to","her","grave","a","americanloath","communist","thi","film","chronicl","that","familiar","smug","stupid","of","the","intellectu","elit","that","make","up","the","american","leav","then","just","a","now","the","full","mooner","leav","of","the","daili","ko","and","michael","moor","have","bui","into","the","conspiraci","theori","and","onc","again","give","aid","and","comfort","to","that","who","would","destroi","america"],"filtered":["sign","classic","movi","ag","like","fine","red","wine","thi","movi","cabarnet","certainli","casablanca","agre","review","child","movi","unfortun","mutat","plagu","u","nightli","sitcom","dialogu","stilt","preachi","let","look","obsolet","theme","moviebr","br","passag","sixti","plu","year","histori","come","wisdom","sinc","watch","rhine","author","lillian","hellman","expos","bidenesqu","plagiarist","call","reallif","stori","julia","book","pentimento","much","odiou","plethora","westernbas","ussr","apologist","obviou","theme","plai","movi","stir","america","action","save","bloodi","soviet","dictat","stalin","intern","commun","fascist","prove","militari","superior","spainbr","br","review","correctli","note","thi","proamerican","plai","movi","lillian","go","grave","americanloath","communist","thi","film","chronicl","familiar","smug","stupid","intellectu","elit","make","american","leav","full","mooner","leav","daili","ko","michael","moor","bui","conspiraci","theori","onc","give","aid","comfort","destroi","america"],"filtered2":["sign","classic","ag","like","fine","red","wine","cabarnet","certainli","casablanca","agre","review","child","unfortun","mutat","plagu","u","nightli","sitcom","dialogu","stilt","preachi","let","look","obsolet","theme","moviebr","passag","sixti","plu","year","histori","come","wisdom","sinc","watch","rhine","author","lillian","hellman","expos","bidenesqu","plagiarist","call","reallif","stori","julia","book","pentimento","odiou","plethora","westernbas","ussr","apologist","obviou","theme","plai","stir","america","action","save","bloodi","soviet","dictat","stalin","intern","commun","fascist","prove","militari","superior","spainbr","review","correctli","note","proamerican","plai","lillian","go","grave","americanloath","communist","chronicl","familiar","smug","stupid","intellectu","elit","make","american","leav","full","mooner","leav","daili","ko","michael","moor","bui","conspiraci","theori","onc","give","aid","comfort","destroi","america"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,16,17,30,34,40,57,74,112,124,129,136,142,151,162,176,180,189,223,227,236,248,332,336,347,383,389,442,464,465,466,499,533,540,560,622,738,749,779,809,876,984,1061,1095,1112,1179,1382,1444,1523,1642,1702,1756,1791,1869,1924,1951,2130,2458,2580,2690,2757,3247,3451,3509,3593,3626,3645,3854,4054,4063,4143,4239,4320,4636,4971,5196,5428,7193,7337],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,16,17,30,34,40,57,74,112,124,129,136,142,151,162,176,180,189,223,227,236,248,332,336,347,383,389,442,464,465,466,499,533,540,560,622,738,749,779,809,876,984,1061,1095,1112,1179,1382,1444,1523,1642,1702,1756,1791,1869,1924,1951,2130,2458,2580,2690,2757,3247,3451,3509,3593,3626,3645,3854,4054,4063,4143,4239,4320,4636,4971,5196,5428,7193,7337],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,3.2569937516641474,1.834162586674748,3.8972

{"value":"First off, I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen. Its not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, its just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.<br /><br />Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting:3/10<br /><br

{"value":"It's not really about gymnastics; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery, or microbiology, or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it's about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abo's hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain. It's my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys, but on the other hand at least they're in the movie. But D'Abo doesn't quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick, and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter; it's all just bodies hurtling around, and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion, it's all performed by an obvious

{"value":"We have all been asking ourselves \"why don't they remake the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking the ones that were great already, that way they can only make it better?\" well with Prom Night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis film and made it even WORSE. Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.The cast who include Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.More annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it). It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office!!!

{"value":"Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them.<br /><br />Unfortunately 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one to both actors and audience alike: not to fall asleep during a mind-numbingly boring, very predictable and unimaginative story.<br /><br />'Watching the Detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule.<br /><br />After a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and relatives, is even hinted at, not to mention actually happening.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like Neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old B&W film she couldn't care less about. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is nowhere near category B, it falls somewhere between Q & R, like -Questions? and -Repress the questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to bore the viewer to death, he has done a very good job!<br /><br />'Watching the Detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur

{"value":"The main problem with \"Power\" is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever. It gets boring after awhile, sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward. You could probably pass it all off as character development, but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie, or are just simply to flat and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom. He should have cut a few of the characters (hackman, the wife) and concentrated harder on others (Billings). It could have been a great, hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting, a fact that amazed me considering the cast. Even Gene Hackman performance wasn't up to par. Denzel Washington is the only real actor of note here. Gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere. <br /><br />Sidney Lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies (i.e, Serpico) and stop trying to recapture his success with \"12 Angry Men\" and \"Fail Safe\". It hasn't worked yet Sidney, and it most likely never will. leave the ensemble dramas to Altman. <br /><br />3/10<br /><br />* / * * *

{"value":"And a few more \"no\"s on top of that. Voodoo Academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time. What exactly is it trying to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; as has been pointed out, most of it's just barely-legal guys rubbing themselves. Could it, then, be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism? Well, maybe, if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact. (Which is, to the delight of none, repeated about eighty thousand times.) Well, it is sort of a horror movie; is it trying to scare us? Not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his \"work.\"<br /><br />Never in my life have I enjoyed a movie less. This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's like Voodoo Academy takes the genres of horror, zombie, and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, then runs them through a coffee filter--only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans, it's the kind that takes out everything vital, edgy, or in any way interesting.

{"value":"Years ago a movie going friend and I went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated for Oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat. Up until seeing The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him. Had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether. But we did not walk out. At the time, my friend and I jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made. Now frankly, this is not true. I have seen many poorly made films on Friday nights on Cinemax (did I just say that out loud?) that are far worse than The Incubus. Almost any movie starring Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus. However, I have since consistently used The Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall.

{"value":"Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing, but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films), and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's \"work\"). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g., Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off, painfully aware the movie \"Taboo\" robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced, boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it... I rented \"Taboo\" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson, who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue, the reviews to which I'd better read first.

{"value":"I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed the whole time. Why? Because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane. I look back on it and realize there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie. At leat nothing intentional. It IS awfully funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic, carnivorous demon...yet her itty-bitty little dress is perfectly intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on. Or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious, and return to conciousness without ANY medical attention. And don't let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the \"villain\" that they decided they needed to create \"conflict.\" Uh huh.<br /><br />To the person complaining about Disney only targetting kids-The raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes? You do if you're Disney and you're out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above-8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script! I am thoroughly convinced that Disney pays off the ratings board so it's movies can get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings.<br /><br />What a waste of the DVD format.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","bomb","when","it","hit","theater","i","laugh","the","whole","time","why","becaus","the","stupid","of","it","seem","to","have","make","me","go","insan","i","look","back","on","it","and","realiz","there","be","not","on","funni","thing","in","the","whole","movi","at","leat","noth","intent","it","be","awfulli","funni","that","lizzi","cn","chew","a","piec","of","nurplex","and","becom","a","gigant","carnivor","demonyet","her","ittybitti","littl","dress","be","perfectli","intact","despit","the","fact","that","she","be","now","hundr","of","time","larg","than","she","be","when","she","put","it","on","or","the","kind","of","movi","in","which","a","man","can","be","shock","with","a","defibul","and","onli","fall","unconci","and","return","to","concious","without","ani","medic","attent","and","do","not","let","me","get","start","on","the","ridicul","fate","of","the","villain","that","thei","decid","thei","ne","to","creat","conflict","uh","huhbr","br","to","the","person","complain","about","disnei","onli","target","kidsth","raunchi","part","of","thi","film","seem","to","disprov","that","statem","do","we","realli","ne","daryl","hannah","accus","jeff","bridg","of","have","kinki","video","tape","you","do","if","you","re","disnei","and","you","re","out","of","idea","for","make","the","movi","appeal","to","the","abov","crowd","without","write","a","much","intellig","script","i","be","thoroughli","convinc","that","disnei","pai","off","the","rate","board","so","it","movi","can","get","awai","with","murder","and","still","get","familyfriendli","ratingsbr","br","what","a","wast","of","the","dvd","format"],"filtered":["see","thi","bomb","hit","theater","laugh","whole","time","becaus","stupid","seem","make","go","insan","look","back","realiz","funni","thing","whole","movi","leat","noth","intent","awfulli","funni","lizzi","cn","chew","piec","nurplex","becom","gigant","carnivor","demonyet","ittybitti","littl","dress","perfectli","intact","despit","fact","hundr","time","larg","put","kind","movi","man","shock","defibul","onli","fall","unconci","return","concious","without","ani","medic","attent","let","get","start","ridicul","fate","villain","thei","decid","thei","ne","creat","conflict","uh","huhbr","br","person","complain","disnei","onli","target","kidsth","raunchi","part","thi","film","seem","disprov","statem","realli","ne","daryl","hannah","accus","jeff","bridg","kinki","video","tape","re","disnei","re","idea","make","movi","appeal","abov","crowd","without","write","much","intellig","script","thoroughli","convinc","disnei","pai","rate","board","movi","get","awai","murder","still","get","familyfriendli","ratingsbr","br","wast","dvd","format"],"filtered2":["see","bomb","hit","theater","laugh","whole","time","becaus","stupid","seem","make","go","insan","look","back","realiz","funni","thing","whole","leat","noth","intent","awfulli","funni","lizzi","cn","chew","piec","nurplex","becom","gigant","carnivor","demonyet","ittybitti","littl","dress","perfectli","intact","despit","fact","hundr","time","larg","put","kind","man","shock","defibul","onli","fall","unconci","return","concious","without","ani","medic","attent","let","get","start","ridicul","fate","villain","decid","ne","creat","conflict","uh","huhbr","person","complain","disnei","onli","target","kidsth","raunchi","part","seem","disprov","statem","realli","ne","daryl","hannah","accus","jeff","bridg","kinki","video","tape","re","disnei","re","idea","make","appeal","abov","crowd","without","write","intellig","script","thoroughli","convinc","disnei","pai","rate","board","get","awai","murder","still","get","familyfriendli","ratingsbr","wast","dvd","format"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,8,11,13,14,16,22,27,29,35,45,49,61,62,63,64,65,68,71,77,89,97,110,111,115,122,123,124,125,133,136,153,155,159,170,202,218,240,247,249,273,274,322,362,388,391,405,424,478,488,508,520,564,603,636,689,704,811,841,873,1078,1271,1285,1328,1331,1333,1403,1475,1590,1594,1697,1720,1819,1831,1871,2053,2152,2280,2407,2778,3716,4890,5341,5669,5764,6834],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,8,11,13,14,16,22,27,29,35,45,49,61,62,63,64,65,68,71,77,89,97,110,111,115,122,123,124,125,133,136,153,155,159,170,202,218,240,247,249,273,274,322,362,388,391,405,424,478,488,508,520,564,603,636,689,704,811,841,873,1078,1271,1285,1328,1331,1333,1403,1475,1590,1594,1697,1720,1819,1831,1871,2053,2152,2280,2407,2778,3716,4890,5341,5669,5764,6834],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,2.389902141215977,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.11750819

{"value":"I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's basically all the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","big","fan","of","italian","film","from","the","seventi","and","i","would","not","hesit","to","list","the","beauti","barbara","bouchet","among","my","favourit","actress","of","all","time","so","i","do","go","into","thi","film","with","some","hope","howev","it","soon","becom","appar","that","thi","be","a","larg","pointless","film","that","be","not","go","to","go","anywher","clearli","nobodi","would","go","into","thi","expect","much","much","but","the","fact","that","thi","be","pointless","get","much","annoi","when","you","consid","that","it","conjur","rather","dull","and","none","of","the","charact","be","interest","a","the","titl","suggest","the","film","focu","on","a","rogu","in","thi","case","on","that","steal","womanis","and","smuggl","stuff","that","basic","all","the","plot","that","thi","movi","have","the","film","doe","have","a","real","seventi","styl","to","it","and","the","idea","of","it","all","be","veri","carefre","get","across","good","it","sometim","seem","like","director","boro","draskov","and","gregori","simpson","be","try","to","put","across","some","sort","of","point","although","whatev","that","point","be","doe","not","come","across","veri","good","see","barbara","bouchet","on","screen","be","alwai","a","pleasur","and","that","be","the","case","here","too","she","definit","the","well","thing","about","the","film","and","the","sequenc","in","which","she","hang","out","of","a","car","nake","be","the","well","part","of","the","film","overal","the","rogu","will","probabl","have","some","appeal","for","peopl","who","love","the","seventi","styl","but","unfortun","it","doe","not","have","much","els","to","offer"],"filtered":["big","fan","italian","film","seventi","hesit","list","beauti","barbara","bouchet","among","favourit","actress","time","go","thi","film","hope","howev","soon","becom","appar","thi","larg","pointless","film","go","go","anywher","clearli","nobodi","go","thi","expect","much","much","fact","thi","pointless","get","much","annoi","consid","conjur","rather","dull","none","charact","interest","titl","suggest","film","focu","rogu","thi","case","steal","womanis","smuggl","stuff","basic","plot","thi","movi","film","doe","real","seventi","styl","idea","veri","carefre","get","across","good","sometim","seem","like","director","boro","draskov","gregori","simpson","try","put","across","sort","point","although","whatev","point","doe","come","across","veri","good","see","barbara","bouchet","screen","alwai","pleasur","case","definit","well","thing","film","sequenc","hang","car","nake","well","part","film","overal","rogu","probabl","appeal","peopl","love","seventi","styl","unfortun","doe","much","els","offer"],"filtered2":["big","fan","italian","seventi","hesit","list","beauti","barbara","bouchet","among","favourit","actress","time","go","hope","howev","soon","becom","appar","larg","pointless","go","go","anywher","clearli","nobodi","go","expect","fact","pointless","get","annoi","consid","conjur","rather","dull","none","charact","interest","titl","suggest","focu","rogu","case","steal","womanis","smuggl","stuff","basic","plot","doe","real","seventi","styl","idea","veri","carefre","get","across","good","sometim","seem","like","director","boro","draskov","gregori","simpson","try","put","across","sort","point","although","whatev","point","doe","come","across","veri","good","see","barbara","bouchet","screen","alwai","pleasur","case","definit","well","thing","sequenc","hang","car","nake","well","part","overal","rogu","probabl","appeal","peopl","love","seventi","styl","unfortun","doe","els","offer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,8,10,15,18,20,23,29,32,34,35,36,39,54,58,60,61,66,80,82,97,113,115,123,130,140,148,159,160,181,192,196,197,227,237,264,269,271,284,286,288,308,317,325,349,354,361,367,370,380,392,412,449,494,500,503,507,534,556,564,578,602,619,646,689,826,848,866,893,1030,1292,1638,2003,2310,3065,3138,3855,4000,5159,6791],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,8,10,15,18,20,23,29,32,34,35,36,39,54,58,60,61,66,80,82,97,113,115,123,130,140,148,159,160,181,192,196,197,227,237,264,269,271,284,286,288,308,317,325,349,354,361,367,370,380,392,412,449,494,500,503,507,534,556,564,578,602,619,646,689,826,848,866,893,1030,1292,1638,2003,2310,3065,3138,3855,4000,5159,6791],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,3.8833076578815384,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.4001215597131385,3.6459479802144523,2.330690080046114,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.553894005

{"value":"Yeah, I'm sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times. Man, I am REALLY glad that I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of the George Romero movies and I'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard. I mean, what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlie's Devils? It really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer, especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop/police station/apartment/flat/whatever room it was with the gong in the background, and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop. I couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either. Oh well, what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world.

{"value":"This \"movie\" is such a bad work! Nothing seems to even try and be realistic. Plot is weak, acting - miserable, actors wondering around like in a 1st year production, trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort to all concerned including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, here too are murders, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago, committed a murder with a knife, and came out calm and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent. Also, this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male, and she cut his throat!!! Did she ask him, politely, to bend down for her? Much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another huge problem as for instance: The eager-hungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his virgin-bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while, falls asleep(!?!). Next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception-area, asking for guidance to scenery spots! NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT???

{"value":"I wouldn't call it awful, but nothing at all shines in this movie, and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development. It starts out well, but once the main hit is done, it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling, and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic. For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly, and just enough to let Snipes do his incredible escape schtick? This is one of far too few action scenes punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into suspending belief.<br /><br />In addition, the whole premise seems to be that the United States CIA team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying \"national security\" to the Brits. This gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying.<br /><br />There are a lot better action movies out there. Better formulated, better executed. This one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring -- something that should never happen in a good action movie.","finished_norm":["i","would","not","call","it","aw","but","noth","at","all","shine","in","thi","movi","and","it","be","encumb","with","some","serious","unbeliev","basic","plot","develop","it","start","out","good","but","onc","the","main","hit","be","do","it","devolv","into","a","long","subplot","around","a","young","girl","which","be","not","compel","and","some","action","scene","which","be","theatr","of","the","absurd","unrealist","for","exampl","there","be","a","prolong","shootout","at","the","airport","in","which","the","light","be","all","stroboscop","no","explan","for","that","how","credibl","be","it","that","a","airport","storag","area","be","go","to","have","light","that","flash","on","and","off","confusingli","and","just","enough","to","let","snipe","do","hi","incred","escap","schtick","thi","be","on","of","far","too","few","action","scene","punctuat","by","pointlessli","draw","out","set","up","that","just","fail","to","draw","on","into","suspend","beliefbr","br","in","addit","the","whole","premis","seem","to","be","that","the","unit","state","cia","team","can","shoot","the","place","up","but","get","awai","with","it","by","sai","nation","secur","to","the","brit","thi","gimmick","reli","on","a","stereotyp","that","be","to","far","afield","from","realiti","to","be","satisfyingbr","br","there","be","a","lot","well","action","movi","out","there","well","formul","well","execut","thi","on","be","entertain","at","time","but","there","be","just","not","enough","meat","on","the","bone","and","after","a","while","it","becom","downright","bore","someth","that","should","never","happen","in","a","good","action","movi"],"filtered":["call","aw","noth","shine","thi","movi","encumb","serious","unbeliev","basic","plot","develop","start","good","onc","main","hit","devolv","long","subplot","around","young","girl","compel","action","scene","theatr","absurd","unrealist","exampl","prolong","shootout","airport","light","stroboscop","explan","credibl","airport","storag","area","go","light","flash","confusingli","enough","let","snipe","hi","incred","escap","schtick","thi","far","action","scene","punctuat","pointlessli","draw","set","fail","draw","suspend","beliefbr","br","addit","whole","premis","seem","unit","state","cia","team","shoot","place","get","awai","sai","nation","secur","brit","thi","gimmick","reli","stereotyp","far","afield","realiti","satisfyingbr","br","lot","well","action","movi","well","formul","well","execut","thi","entertain","time","enough","meat","bone","becom","downright","bore","someth","never","happen","good","action","movi"],"filtered2":["call","aw","noth","shine","encumb","serious","unbeliev","basic","plot","develop","start","good","onc","main","hit","devolv","long","subplot","around","young","girl","compel","action","scene","theatr","absurd","unrealist","exampl","prolong","shootout","airport","light","stroboscop","explan","credibl","airport","storag","area","go","light","flash","confusingli","enough","let","snipe","incred","escap","schtick","far","action","scene","punctuat","pointlessli","draw","set","fail","draw","suspend","beliefbr","addit","whole","premis","seem","unit","state","cia","team","shoot","place","get","awai","nation","secur","brit","gimmick","reli","stereotyp","far","afield","realiti","satisfyingbr","lot","well","action","well","formul","well","execut","entertain","time","enough","meat","bone","becom","downright","bore","someth","never","happen","good","action"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,8,19,20,32,35,42,49,53,71,72,84,93,94,98,99,101,108,109,111,115,117,124,129,135,138,142,155,164,179,195,215,236,286,307,320,353,371,388,484,498,571,576,604,638,656,662,723,928,1000,1055,1118,1156,1185,1208,1254,1264,1309,1409,1418,1428,1455,1481,1556,1707,2395,2416,2696,2783,2843,2935,3192,3478,4169,4360,5507,5895,6739,7679,8529],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,8,19,20,32,35,42,49,53,71,72,84,93,94,98,99,101,108,109,111,115,117,124,129,135,138,142,155,164,179,195,215,236,286,307,320,353,371,388,484,498,571,576,604,638,656,662,723,928,1000,1055,1118,1156,1185,1208,1254,1264,1309,1409,1418,1428,1455,1481,1556,1707,2395,2416,2696,2783,2843,2935,3192,3478,4169,4360,5507,5895,6739,7679,8529],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.62476135602347,3.4960351200691706,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,2.2212694515902225,4.070779654240196,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,4.197164082437498,2.138507503627933,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.201553588425805,2

{"value":"I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCM's \"Essentials\" series. The eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos. This beholder saw little of value in this one. I was puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive. I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. Of course part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. Malone's performance outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, though, I would have to say that I'm just not much of a fan of melodrama.

{"value":"Perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films I ever did see. I'll start with the bad points of t he movie, which pretty much covers the entire film. First of all, something no one can avoid: TERRIBLE ACTING. I swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked. Secondly, BAD/UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK/DEVELOPMENT. You hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here. All you figure is that they deserved it one way or another. The scarecrow's character was overdone, and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killers such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The Scarecrow was full of horrid one-liners that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible. Lines like \"Let's go find some small animals to torture!\" really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised. Last but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? The back of his head was balding for God's sake. There is much more I could say about this film, like it's cheap special effects, it's \"high school film class\" effort, but the point is understood. It's just bad film making at it's worst. As for what I found to be \"good\" in the movie: -Entertaining for those with low, low, LOW standards -Would help put insomniacs to sleep. -A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.","finished_norm":["perhap","on","of","the","wrong","teenag","slasher","film","i","ever","do","see","i","will","start","with","the","bad","point","of","t","he","movi","which","pretti","much","cover","the","entir","film","of","all","someth","no","on","can","avoid","terribl","act","i","swear","thei","pick","up","some","random","kid","off","the","street","base","on","how","thei","look","secondli","badunconvinc","charact","workdevelop","you","hardli","even","know","half","the","kid","who","be","kill","in","here","all","you","figur","be","that","thei","deserv","it","on","wai","or","anoth","the","scarecrow","charact","be","overdo","and","a","cheap","ripoff","of","the","other","great","fantasi","killer","such","a","freddi","or","pinhead","next","bad","dialog","the","scarecrow","be","full","of","horrid","onelin","that","would","make","you","laugh","onli","becaus","it","be","so","terribl","line","like","let","go","find","some","small","anim","to","tortur","realli","just","leav","you","with","a","eyebrow","rais","last","but","not","littl","next","off","bad","cast","how","old","be","the","gui","who","plai","lester","like","the","back","of","hi","head","be","bald","for","god","sake","there","be","much","much","i","can","sai","about","thi","film","like","it","cheap","special","effect","it","high","school","film","class","effort","but","the","point","be","understand","it","just","bad","film","make","at","it","wrong","a","for","what","i","find","to","be","good","in","the","movi","entertain","for","that","with","low","low","low","standard","would","help","put","insomniac","to","sleep","a","veri","cheap","laugh","or","even","a","giggl"],"filtered":["perhap","wrong","teenag","slasher","film","ever","see","start","bad","point","movi","pretti","much","cover","entir","film","someth","avoid","terribl","act","swear","thei","pick","random","kid","street","base","thei","look","secondli","badunconvinc","charact","workdevelop","hardli","even","know","half","kid","kill","figur","thei","deserv","wai","anoth","scarecrow","charact","overdo","cheap","ripoff","great","fantasi","killer","freddi","pinhead","next","bad","dialog","scarecrow","full","horrid","onelin","make","laugh","onli","becaus","terribl","line","like","let","go","find","small","anim","tortur","realli","leav","eyebrow","rais","last","littl","next","bad","cast","old","gui","plai","lester","like","back","hi","head","bald","god","sake","much","much","sai","thi","film","like","cheap","special","effect","high","school","film","class","effort","point","understand","bad","film","make","wrong","find","good","movi","entertain","low","low","low","standard","help","put","insomniac","sleep","veri","cheap","laugh","even","giggl"],"filtered2":["perhap","wrong","teenag","slasher","ever","see","start","bad","point","pretti","cover","entir","someth","avoid","terribl","act","swear","pick","random","kid","street","base","look","secondli","badunconvinc","charact","workdevelop","hardli","even","know","half","kid","kill","figur","deserv","wai","anoth","scarecrow","charact","overdo","cheap","ripoff","great","fantasi","killer","freddi","pinhead","next","bad","dialog","scarecrow","full","horrid","onelin","make","laugh","onli","becaus","terribl","line","like","let","go","find","small","anim","tortur","realli","leav","eyebrow","rais","last","littl","next","bad","cast","old","gui","plai","lester","like","back","head","bald","god","sake","like","cheap","special","effect","high","school","class","effort","point","understand","bad","make","wrong","find","good","entertain","low","low","low","standard","help","put","insomniac","sleep","veri","cheap","laugh","even","giggl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,21,22,25,26,33,38,40,44,51,53,55,63,66,67,71,73,74,76,78,92,106,107,114,124,133,144,159,166,185,195,198,203,206,208,211,212,217,252,277,296,297,318,334,335,336,351,352,363,401,415,423,432,446,491,616,628,664,665,692,731,732,802,859,996,1045,1136,1270,1413,1596,1713,1898,1977,2143,2478,2873,3284,4262,4870,7767],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,21,22,25,26,33,38,40,44,51,53,55,63,66,67,71,73,74,76,78,92,106,107,114,124,133,144,159,166,185,195,198,203,206,208,211,212,217,252,277,296,297,318,334,335,336,351,352,363,401,415,423,432,446,491,616,628,664,665,692,731,732,802,859,996,1045,1136,1270,1413,1596,1713,1898,1977,2143,2478,2873,3284,4262,4870,7767],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,4.273428342688829,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.131794156973397

{"value":"I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car. Well, I thought, this could be interesting...<br /><br />...but it isn't. First, the title. The Broken? The Broken...what? What is broken? The...oh, wait...I get it, the title itself is \"broken\"! WOW, clever! Unfortunately, this is virtually the only thing going for it.<br /><br />The premise is not that bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in 'Mirrors'. A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that. A more suited title would be 'The Boring', since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages. Or maybe 'The Confusing' since it doesn't explain anything at all, not in the narrative nor in the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible. It's just messed up.<br /><br />On the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not a difficult role to act.<br /><br />After watching the movie twice, I still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the E.

{"value":"I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking \"Where is this happening? What's going on?\" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it.

{"value":"Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity. The acting is hideous, except for Emmy Smith who shows some promise. The camera \"direction\" needs serious reworking. And no more \"hold the camera and run\" gimmicks either; it just doesn't work. The special effects are unimaginative, there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip off an ear, please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood. The scenery is bland and boring (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal (see the scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention the lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other \"home movies\" (which I will not plug) and they are just as bad. Normally, a \"director\" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.

{"value":"This movie is just crap. Even though the directors claim to be part of that oi-culture, it's still a very, very bad directorial debut. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact, that they are all amateurs and never acted before, but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing. There's no timing at all in that movie. I felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie (it's their first feature), that they actually never really asked themselves, what story they wanna tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy, but that doesn't make him a director. I think, that \"American History X\" is full of clichés, but somehow manages to transport a story. \"Oi!Warning\" is full of clichés, doesn't tell anything new or provocative and (-that's the sad thing about this movie) it's far from any Oi!-Reality.<br /><br />If you wanna see weird but great German films, watch the movies of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans

{"value":"This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton\" whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant. Madonna did OK in some movies however this one doesn't fire. If there is any picture that show Madonna can't act it is this one.<br /><br />I am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of \"The Admirable Crighton\" but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad. to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail.<br /><br />The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre. The script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location. While many here have canned Madoona for all her acting I think that in films like \"A League of Their own\" was quite good and enjoyable and \"Who's That Girl\" showed a quirkiness of Madonna's style not shown before or afterwards. Other Madonna films are not as enjoyable and I would have liked a to see a Madonna Animation series with the character from \"Who's That Girl\" I like the music from these two films however \"Swept

{"value":"To call a movie like \"Thinner\" bad is like calling the earth round or Pauly Shore un-talented. No news, but how they got that way is what people want to know.<br /><br />As far as this movie.... The book was good, even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the \"be careful what you wish for\" genre. Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father (Constantine from TV's \"Room 222\") to several pounds a day. <br /><br />Like I said, it starts out good, but why involve the mobster (Mantegna)? Why fire automatic weapons so much? Why turn it into something so heavily dependent on FX? I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy lore and such. <br /><br />But no, it's not to be. Remember, this is Stephen King we're talking about.<br /><br />And the ending... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact the whole movie talks too much, feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us. Not that I expected \"The Dead Zone\", but I could have done without another \"Pet Sematary\", thanks anyway.<br /><br />One star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job.

{"value":"I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it might be an underrated work, from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. It starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books, and was a Disney Studios production. What could possibly be wrong with it? As it turns outs, almost everything.<br /><br />Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's swanky score are the movie's two saving graces. Price is wickedly enjoyable, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. <br /><br />Meanwhile the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, blandly generic voice work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place on any of Disney's mid-1980s Saturday morning TV shows.<br /><br />This was a complete disappointment to me. It's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD has in its endless running time.<br /><br />The extra star that keeps this from being \"awful\" goes to Price and

{"value":"90 minutes of Mindy...Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill...Mindy prances at the high school dance...Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, shoplifts a loaf of \"shepherd's bread,\" Mindy nearly gets gang-raped... Ah, the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features. You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players. They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations. The lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to, out in the parking lot. The film is really irritating when watched as a story. It's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. With no luggage or change of underwear, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2)After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers, and after their innocent friend \"Pan\" is savagely beaten, Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road. Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps, \"I'm going' to Big Sur!!\" But again, it's a lot more fun to talk/read about than sit
