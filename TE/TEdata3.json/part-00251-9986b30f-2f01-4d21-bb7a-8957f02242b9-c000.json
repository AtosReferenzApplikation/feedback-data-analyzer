{"value":"Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production. It was very clearly made for TV, yet if I found it on my television, I would flick it straight over. The children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. This film lacked the music/dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie. The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. Sad to say this sequel was a total flop.","finished_norm":["not","even","worth","watch","thi","tacki","spoiler","ruin","everyth","about","anni","the","charact","seem","almost","cheapen","by","the","poorli","write","storylin","and","thei","low","qualiti","feel","to","the","product","it","be","veri","clearli","make","for","tv","yet","if","i","find","it","on","my","televis","i","would","flick","it","straight","over","the","child","in","the","film","do","a","alright","job","yet","the","adult","act","be","unbeliev","and","so","the","movi","fail","to","realli","draw","you","in","thi","film","lack","the","musicd","number","that","make","the","origin","brilliant","and","truli","doe","take","the","shine","of","the","anni","we","all","love","johnson","a","anni","be","at","time","annoi","and","over","actedy","cannot","convinc","yourself","that","she","truli","be","anni","the","differ","in","charact","appear","continu","to","irrit","me","throughout","the","durat","of","the","film","sad","to","sai","thi","sequel","be","a","total","flop"],"filtered":["even","worth","watch","thi","tacki","spoiler","ruin","everyth","anni","charact","seem","almost","cheapen","poorli","write","storylin","thei","low","qualiti","feel","product","veri","clearli","make","tv","yet","find","televis","flick","straight","child","film","alright","job","yet","adult","act","unbeliev","movi","fail","realli","draw","thi","film","lack","musicd","number","make","origin","brilliant","truli","doe","take","shine","anni","love","johnson","anni","time","annoi","actedy","convinc","truli","anni","differ","charact","appear","continu","irrit","throughout","durat","film","sad","sai","thi","sequel","total","flop"],"filtered2":["even","worth","watch","tacki","spoiler","ruin","everyth","anni","charact","seem","almost","cheapen","poorli","write","storylin","low","qualiti","feel","product","veri","clearli","make","tv","yet","find","televis","flick","straight","child","alright","job","yet","adult","act","unbeliev","fail","realli","draw","lack","musicd","number","make","origin","brilliant","truli","doe","take","shine","anni","love","johnson","anni","time","annoi","actedy","convinc","truli","anni","differ","charact","appear","continu","irrit","throughout","durat","sad","sequel","total","flop"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,10,13,15,18,21,31,35,38,43,54,65,69,131,169,172,180,183,184,190,193,194,204,215,217,219,257,271,289,319,343,387,398,433,438,455,478,490,494,515,548,571,576,663,710,734,912,959,1383,1551,1707,1952,2144,2482,3032,3901,8330],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,10,13,15,18,21,31,35,38,43,54,65,69,131,169,172,180,183,184,190,193,194,204,215,217,219,257,271,289,319,343,387,398,433,438,455,478,490,494,515,548,571,576,663,710,734,912,959,1383,1551,1707,1952,2144,2482,3032,3901,8330],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,2.2512118082053005,2.4214486257841834,2.5001408943598484,2.7097314792693545,2.4885128563647294,2.496249838866882,2.558331832813986,2.517840471459249,5.075762444685391,2.624524614047584,2.605934685587711,2.6113665294700725,2.5792094178355414,2.7602659523229094,2.757740698455715,2.8282659991423613,2.9056060024680126,5.941068926339787,3.360519385990158,3.143848349181566,3.164467636384302,3.1797351085150902,3.2787058260741455,3.3243163373261977,3.3490645070153917,3.3243163373261977,3.3956930001684253,3.459754308221302,3.467417180966871,3.587125145032839,3.7297814454343623,3.6528204042982337,3.79165684915245,3.9405024767500145,3.969732115064953,4.520909034354511,4.573751515728891,4.706176101378222,4.85885294158718,5.3064295350454715,22.006953149464948,5.463272006538442,5.7446844659766265,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.186098350349962E-5,6.144384042981816E-5,6.192150769943846E-5,6.156372456827919E-5,6.156473322059323E-5,6.147867802653529E-5,6.166152422894616E-5,6.145268794135397E-5,6.159085598600792E-5,6.833169260412127E-5,0.7684244287220126,6.135348975419551E-5,6.249862221544152E-5,0.2040511607368773,6.139822807889081E-5,6.122854986732182E-5,6.275581945313061E-5,6.166730144832571E-5,6.147597888581062E-5,6.152693154206403E-5,6.212224069100439E-5,6.17283981393036E-5,6.179868528518E-5,6.186526643728901E-5,6.234005057410663E-5,6.201402965967141E-5,6.462098165722334E-5,6.137172958415151E-5,6.137337142164296E-5,6.152886051107231E-5,6.283664203717301E-5,6.166372835480008E-5,6.619078874832384E-5,6.183717932315596E-5,6.14385299518447E-5,6.17221092682684E-5,6.137696700949531E-5,6.141323628120676E-5,6.1228242250136

{"value":"The only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in that light, it does deliver. <br /><br />If you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of \"issues\" with no insight whatsoever.<br /><br />Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable, stereotypical ways. <br /><br />Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable, and Michael Rappaport turns in a good performance, but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite, it's hard to find

{"value":"This movie was kind of interesting...I had to watch it for a college class about India, however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold, hard information on those details. It is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together. The gore factor is superb, however. Even right at the very beginning, you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense. Only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it. I've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events, however you can not find any information about it online...so basically this movie was a waste of time to

{"value":"Spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.<br /><br />Okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit, or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g, Cini's body?) This was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it.

{"value":"I was attracted to this movie when I looked at cast list, but after I watched it I must admit that I felt a bit disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. So if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing that you'll remember about this flick is Diane Lane scenes; rest of it is very

{"value":"This programme bugs me! There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called \"fun\"! It's just far too educational for my liking! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. The plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again. Where's the fun in it? Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much. Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows!

{"value":"This is the kind of movie that's so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that 'it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end. It just cant'. You know, 'worse than Jaws 4'-kind of bad.<br /><br />I honestly think I've only seen ONE movie that was worse than this, and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching football.<br /><br />Gore? Indeed and lots of it. Well made gore? No way.<br /><br />The acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clichés. Same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex, blood and violence, like so many other gore movies.<br /><br />If you're hoping for a mix between Ichi the Killer and August Underground keep looking. You wont find it in Live

{"value":"Williamson's accent is tough to wade through. He speaks incredibly quickly, like he is in a rush to get through the lines. During the soliloquies he acts as if he is talking to someone, when he is supposed to be talking to himself. All that and his bald spot just annoyed me. He was just too old for this role. In reading other accounts of Williamson, maybe he got this role because he was mad and the director decided to do a bit of life-imitates-art or forced method acting. When the actors declare Hamlet mad you believe it! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could botch the role of Ophelia and still get a pass.

{"value":"Jane Russell proved to be a delightful musical-comedy performer in the similarly titled \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" but, sadly, this film squanders those skills. There is a budget, and nice Paris photography, but the film just doesn't work. Ms. Russell seems to be playing Marilyn Monroe. That leaves nobody to adequately play Jane Russell. Some of the other players are WAY out of their element.<br /><br />There are several embarrassing scenes; most of all, be warned: there is a musical number where boneheaded African cannibals \"cook\" the brunettes in a pot, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla suit.<br /><br />This is an interesting, at times embarrassing, waste of resources. <br /><br />*** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55)

{"value":"Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, strung together without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fighting, and a resolution where all are happy in the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled in (over the closing credits!) without explanation, and everything is just a bit too sweet.<br /><br />Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon, and by my showing an interest in what they like, we are closer. Seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube, and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience.

{"value":"How this film could miss so many of the fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot, ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise, replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely \"plastered on\" over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless, brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently, this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder...

At the end when the owner of the park gets killed, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have even seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation.<br /><br />That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they on that island in particular? Well, it wasn't stated in the movie. And, why would the people keep coming into the cat's area? Makes no sense.<br /><br />One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a \"B made for TV movie\" movie, the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular.<br /><br />If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.","finished_norm":["the","cgi","in","thi","movi","be","horribl","i","watch","it","dure","a","marathon","of","bad","movi","on","the","scifi","channel","at","the","end","when","the","owner","of","the","park","get","kill","it","probabl","on","of","the","wrong","exampl","of","cgi","i","have","even","see","even","night","of","the","live","dead","have","well","animationbr","br","that","sai","the","movi","have","almost","no","plot","why","be","thei","on","that","island","in","particular","good","it","be","not","state","in","the","movi","and","why","would","the","peopl","keep","come","into","the","cat","area","make","no","sensebr","br","on","thing","that","stand","out","in","thi","movi","be","moder","good","act","in","what","can","be","call","a","b","make","for","tv","movi","movi","the","act","be","veri","good","parri","shen","stand","out","in","particularbr","br","if","you","have","absolut","noth","to","do","on","a","saturdai","watch","thi","movi","it","mai","be","good","for","some","memor","quot"],"filtered":["cgi","thi","movi","horribl","watch","dure","marathon","bad","movi","scifi","channel","end","owner","park","get","kill","probabl","wrong","exampl","cgi","even","see","even","night","live","dead","well","animationbr","br","sai","movi","almost","plot","thei","island","particular","good","state","movi","peopl","keep","come","cat","area","make","sensebr","br","thing","stand","thi","movi","moder","good","act","call","b","make","tv","movi","movi","act","veri","good","parri","shen","stand","particularbr","br","absolut","noth","saturdai","watch","thi","movi","mai","good","memor","quot"],"filtered2":["cgi","horribl","watch","dure","marathon","bad","scifi","channel","end","owner","park","get","kill","probabl","wrong","exampl","cgi","even","see","even","night","live","dead","well","animationbr","almost","plot","island","particular","good","state","peopl","keep","come","cat","area","make","sensebr","thing","stand","moder","good","act","call","b","make","tv","act","veri","good","parri","shen","stand","particularbr","absolut","noth","saturdai","watch","mai","good","memor","quot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,9,15,20,21,23,24,25,29,32,34,46,49,76,116,131,134,142,148,172,210,222,228,230,239,307,377,498,642,720,728,781,792,832,935,1012,1074,1156,1604,1778,1793,3868,4241,7390],"values":[2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,9,15,20,21,23,24,25,29,32,34,46,49,76,116,131,134,142,148,172,210,222,228,230,239,307,377,498,642,720,728,781,792,832,935,1012,1074,1156,1604,1778,1793,3868,4241,7390],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,2.714457859969082,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,2.1337665533324026,2.2466628996789315,2.2512118082053005,2.2443961816702407,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.5001408943598484,2.687151791517189,2.5771019354959765,2.7742700004069256,2.7121382192999195,2.6593400337329487,2.8767855639325206,6.120488261027101,3.386191741044285,3.622422927113863,4.072271754381138,3.7740817043309423,3.9363956947973615,4.115443926246347,3.7987743169213135,4.135246553542527,8.595530966080602,4.110553940952155,4.2860694432771105,4.637773374493822,4.828393734102471,4.77960356993304,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.443969071365093E-5,8.387029413878056E-5,8.452230570126229E-5,8.403393491847413E-5,8.403531171988611E-5,8.391784714756575E-5,8.416743058296111E-5,8.388237091311163E-5,8.407096906167533E-5,9.32721509205532E-5,0.5694210211827452,8.37469662724379E-5,8.531006186803742E-5,8.652702864627918E-5,8.380803368660381E-5,8.35764244412558E-5,8.566113380341402E-5,8.417531643588433E-5,8.391416284455153E-5,8.398371276586557E-5,8.479630444431322E-5,8.425871287411763E-5,8.435465420131317E-5,8.444553688007185E-5,8.509361299199398E-5,8.464859735173126E-5,8.820706357569885E-5,8.37718634776378E-5,8.377410457116927E-5,8.398634579135645E-5,8.577145590973538E-5,8.417043919509203E-5,9.034983625316726E-5,8.440719821980305E-5,8.386304538371357E-5,8.425012862124812E-5,8.377901251651691E-5,8.382851974889952E-5,8.357600454654196E-5,8.359768801796727E-5,8.37858562538177E-5,8.466961950019315E-5,8.423937758266017E-5,8.390631863189202E-5,8.49258683844176E-5,8.393852233548688E-5,8.67273826102539E-5,8.545203116938825E-5,8.361846661355354E-5,8.380326853838968E-5,8.377420240755812E-5,8.613192337406886E-5,8.380451537126171E-5,8.359026645357015E-5,8.450778925478561E-5,8.382610118970971E-5,0.4239865051331395,8.375701759017819E-5,8.361749961395754E-5,8.401674863287852E-5,8.48501241683133E-5,8

{"value":"Wow, I hated this movie. The subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic, but the script - if there even *was* a script - is a mess. This is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere. I'd say it goes nowhere fast, except that it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit through. As I've mentioned, the lead actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), as his sometimes-harsh-but-ultimately-loving-and-accepting mother. The film makers have a lot to answer for here, because this is a mess. A real shame,because I really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically out-takes from a movie that never got made. Skip this one - it wasn't even worth the $6 I shelled out for pay-per-view.","finished_norm":["wow","i","hate","thi","movi","the","subject","matt","should","have","result","in","a","realli","fine","film","and","the","lead","actor","be","definit","sensit","and","talent","enough","to","handl","the","topic","but","the","script","if","there","even","be","a","script","be","a","mess","thi","be","littl","a","movi","than","a","random","slide","show","that","go","nowher","i","have","sai","it","go","nowher","fast","except","that","it","actual","the","long","minut","you","will","ever","sit","through","a","i","have","mention","the","lead","actor","be","good","so","be","faruza","baulk","sp","a","hi","sometimesharshbutultimatelylovingandaccept","mother","the","film","maker","have","a","lot","to","answer","for","here","becaus","thi","be","a","mess","a","real","shamebecaus","i","realli","want","to","like","thi","movi","but","it","basic","outtak","from","a","movi","that","never","get","make","skip","thi","on","it","be","not","even","worth","the","i","shell","out","for","payperview"],"filtered":["wow","hate","thi","movi","subject","matt","result","realli","fine","film","lead","actor","definit","sensit","talent","enough","handl","topic","script","even","script","mess","thi","littl","movi","random","slide","show","go","nowher","sai","go","nowher","fast","except","actual","long","minut","ever","sit","mention","lead","actor","good","faruza","baulk","sp","hi","sometimesharshbutultimatelylovingandaccept","mother","film","maker","lot","answer","becaus","thi","mess","real","shamebecaus","realli","want","like","thi","movi","basic","outtak","movi","never","get","make","skip","thi","even","worth","shell","payperview"],"filtered2":["wow","hate","subject","matt","result","realli","fine","lead","actor","definit","sensit","talent","enough","handl","topic","script","even","script","mess","littl","random","slide","show","go","nowher","go","nowher","fast","except","actual","long","minut","ever","sit","mention","lead","actor","good","faruza","baulk","sp","sometimesharshbutultimatelylovingandaccept","mother","maker","lot","answer","becaus","mess","real","shamebecaus","realli","want","like","basic","outtak","never","get","make","skip","even","worth","shell","payperview"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,13,14,22,28,37,41,42,44,52,59,72,77,80,93,99,157,219,233,244,276,285,286,339,392,397,407,408,447,464,542,550,762,799,800,859,931,945,1003,1870,3010,3371,3373,5215,8358],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,13,14,22,28,37,41,42,44,52,59,72,77,80,93,99,157,219,233,244,276,285,286,339,392,397,407,408,447,464,542,550,762,799,800,859,931,945,1003,1870,3010,3371,3373,5215,8358],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,1.9416538289407692,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.2979240167361772,1.5452294193519092,1.4876543214774305,3.1375198335242067,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.9209463754160525,3.8927804517536475,1.9951803900462557,2.035389827120098,2.056430207256609,4.672030138951541,2.5792094178355414,2.6102777977348763,2.634508058031767,2.7884729505849193,2.808171552082607,2.780700890737216,3.003844442051426,3.0670934723591254,3.3176717946075294,6.240031747626936,3.130944944345658,3.2070272508030975,3.2872346624216657,3.4471119148061256,3.4751392270607813,3.749984152751882,7.527365994220087,3.9121030022283168,3.9405024767500145,3.9241755834625858,3.9782428047328615,4.035401218572811,4.848596441419991,5.444579873526289,5.604922523601468,5.719991853386255,6.2980697041614135,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.919371487753804E-5,7.865969314413963E-5,7.927119725245215E-5,7.881316743022313E-5,7.881445869523775E-5,7.870429183212007E-5,7.893836942352059E-5,7.867101962597456E-5,7.88479007570819E-5,0.16940062577603712,0.6361821396032411,7.854402725525431E-5,8.001001257422033E-5,8.1151372984674E-5,7.860130074056543E-5,7.838408065858653E-5,8.03392735001752E-5,7.894576535288378E-5,7.8700836423414E-5,7.876606542403857E-5,7.952817330424234E-5,7.902398062931873E-5,7.911396141971104E-5,7.9199197839789E-5,7.980701099486736E-5,7.938964279475725E-5,0.18831999005124306,7.856737767438995E-5,7.856947953573793E-5,7.876853486783007E-5,8.044274163653222E-5,7.894119111992023E-5,8.473668142307447E-5,7.91632410414581E-5,7.865289473172077E-5,7.901592968942969E-5,7.857408256567811E-5,7.862051406741088E-5,7.838368685062768E-5,7.840402319529093E-5,7.858050112282718E-5,7.940935890239967E-5,7.9005846579492E-5,7.86934795473342E-5,7.964968783898681E-5,7.8723682534803E-5,8.13392795788775E-5,8.014316176363018E-5,7.842351088124178E-5,7.859683163621615E-5,7.856957129385567E-5,8.078081437639883E-5,7.859800100723272E-5,7.839706270964912E-5,7.925758266772791E-5,7.861

{"value":"First, it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know Hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere, simply proving to us that Hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife. All of this should have taken 10-15 minutes at most simply as a set-up for the real action, intrigue and plot twists. By the time the real action gets going, I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as usual, and the other actors as well, but this is a dud of the first magnitude.","finished_norm":["it","take","a","full","half","hour","to","get","hackman","out","of","jail","and","to","start","do","the","job","what","a","wast","of","time","we","all","know","hackman","be","get","out","to","do","some","job","for","hi","master","why","wast","almost","a","of","the","movi","on","thi","sequenc","then","hackman","stai","in","a","hotel","and","the","stori","arc","again","go","nowher","simpli","prove","to","u","that","hackman","be","under","close","watch","and","anyth","he","sai","or","doe","be","know","by","the","master","again","anoth","minut","then","much","wast","time","show","the","reunion","with","hi","wife","all","of","thi","should","have","take","minut","at","much","simpli","a","a","setup","for","the","real","action","intrigu","and","plot","twist","by","the","time","the","real","action","get","go","i","be","so","bore","that","i","just","want","the","movi","to","end","hackman","be","great","a","usual","and","the","other","actor","a","good","but","thi","be","a","dud","of","the","magnitud"],"filtered":["take","full","half","hour","get","hackman","jail","start","job","wast","time","know","hackman","get","job","hi","master","wast","almost","movi","thi","sequenc","hackman","stai","hotel","stori","arc","go","nowher","simpli","prove","u","hackman","close","watch","anyth","sai","doe","know","master","anoth","minut","much","wast","time","show","reunion","hi","wife","thi","take","minut","much","simpli","setup","real","action","intrigu","plot","twist","time","real","action","get","go","bore","want","movi","end","hackman","great","usual","actor","good","thi","dud","magnitud"],"filtered2":["take","full","half","hour","get","hackman","jail","start","job","wast","time","know","hackman","get","job","master","wast","almost","sequenc","hackman","stai","hotel","stori","arc","go","nowher","simpli","prove","u","hackman","close","watch","anyth","doe","know","master","anoth","minut","wast","time","show","reunion","wife","take","minut","simpli","setup","real","action","intrigu","plot","twist","time","real","action","get","go","bore","want","end","hackman","great","usual","actor","good","dud","magnitud"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,7,8,17,18,24,26,28,31,32,37,41,51,59,71,73,80,89,104,108,112,129,131,174,201,206,263,265,289,295,336,349,365,435,540,799,1017,1059,1276,1985,2021,2752,3213,3450,3749],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,7,8,17,18,24,26,28,31,32,37,41,51,59,71,73,80,89,104,108,112,129,131,174,201,206,263,265,289,295,336,349,365,435,540,799,1017,1059,1276,1985,2021,2752,3213,3450,3749],"values":[0.6786144649922705,2.389902141215977,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,2.825681057716235,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,2.814133962290301,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,3.7386508898401445,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,3.9903607800925114,5.982013832871731,2.0728240170322856,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,4.821391668015843,2.2512118082053005,2.456282578459816,5.122871637503154,2.597304642813496,2.902686292364678,2.73529586597515,5.656531998284723,2.7910771187233068,2.9233055795674137,3.0568369721919364,3.008694896185175,3.2829611516442836,3.432149042129413,3.7636829971100436,4.0536665665501035,8.448155534498284,4.621379564718146,4.869215728622727,5.051537285416681,5.3064295350454715,30.161832692142035,5.770002273960917,5.770002273960917]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.0381561785447E-5,6.990696246046177E-5,7.045042243386755E-5,7.004335914251117E-5,7.004450672409072E-5,6.994659850125741E-5,7.015462948562556E-5,6.99170286062703E-5,7.007422757435713E-5,7.77435302923863E-5,0.6028998300806953,6.980416710709767E-5,7.110702727046943E-5,7.212138463925846E-5,6.98550675775621E-5,6.966201831040147E-5,7.139965021711944E-5,7.016120244485901E-5,6.994352758759063E-5,7.00014983362133E-5,7.067880388932042E-5,7.023071444236394E-5,7.031068276520739E-5,7.038643463990305E-5,7.092661436495201E-5,7.055568813919338E-5,7.352171523245833E-5,0.027268416983553995,6.982678722605799E-5,7.000369299662361E-5,7.149160510322496E-5,7.01571372023023E-5,0.07303272443941747,7.03544788764028E-5,6.990092053043687E-5,7.022355935784609E-5,6.983087806125415E-5,6.987214297240332E-5,6.966166832278906E-5,6.967974177344888E-5,6.983658240379267E-5,7.057321036870807E-5,7.02145982297292E-5,6.993698933604935E-5,7.078679708989414E-5,6.996383153472543E-5,0.29144640079713047,7.12253604982467E-5,6.969706099852786E-5,6.98510957656024E-5,6.982686877393894E-5,7.179205934338395E-5,6.985213501674222E-5,6.967355580463792E-5,7.043832279013402E-5,6.987012707239694E-5,7.513764274077568E-5,6.9812545008942E-5,6.969625499200134E-5,7.00290341537377E-5,7.072366331736869E-5,7.002440133479669E-5,6.9683

{"value":"Michael Keaton has really never been a good actor; in the Tim Burton Batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains. Here, he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living...<br /><br />Well, this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you. Because there's way too much stuff that ends up unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where's the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that WHITE NOISE makes a fool out of itself? Truly bad acting and horrifying edited, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever.","finished_norm":["michael","keaton","have","realli","never","be","a","good","actor","in","the","tim","burton","batman","movi","he","alwai","fall","in","the","shadow","of","hi","great","villain","here","he","star","a","a","widow","husband","that","pick","up","radio","frequenc","that","seem","like","be","dead","peopl","that","try","make","contact","with","the","livingbr","br","good","thi","be","suppos","to","be","a","pretti","shock","thriller","but","it","realli","miss","about","everi","spot","there","be","shock","you","becaus","there","wai","too","much","stuff","that","end","up","unexplain","undiscov","and","uninterest","so","where","the","shock","excit","when","it","all","get","so","bad","movi","make","in","the","place","that","white","nois","make","a","fool","out","of","itself","truli","bad","act","and","horrifi","edit","thi","movi","be","noth","to","watch","michael","keaton","try","make","a","thriller","comeback","but","end","up","miss","the","target","much","than","ever"],"filtered":["michael","keaton","realli","never","good","actor","tim","burton","batman","movi","alwai","fall","shadow","hi","great","villain","star","widow","husband","pick","radio","frequenc","seem","like","dead","peopl","try","make","contact","livingbr","br","good","thi","suppos","pretti","shock","thriller","realli","miss","everi","spot","shock","becaus","wai","much","stuff","end","unexplain","undiscov","uninterest","shock","excit","get","bad","movi","make","place","white","nois","make","fool","truli","bad","act","horrifi","edit","thi","movi","noth","watch","michael","keaton","try","make","thriller","comeback","end","miss","target","much","ever"],"filtered2":["michael","keaton","realli","never","good","actor","tim","burton","batman","alwai","fall","shadow","great","villain","star","widow","husband","pick","radio","frequenc","seem","like","dead","peopl","try","make","contact","livingbr","good","suppos","pretti","shock","thriller","realli","miss","everi","spot","shock","becaus","wai","stuff","end","unexplain","undiscov","uninterest","shock","excit","get","bad","make","place","white","nois","make","fool","truli","bad","act","horrifi","edit","noth","watch","michael","keaton","try","make","thriller","comeback","end","miss","target","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,9,13,21,22,23,24,33,35,36,41,42,44,49,51,78,85,100,149,164,170,197,228,255,343,348,359,361,446,466,508,520,524,536,714,1006,1057,1086,1248,1271,1274,1445,1499,1765,1768,2087,2095,2563,3089,3483,5569],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,9,13,21,22,23,24,33,35,36,41,42,44,49,51,78,85,100,149,164,170,197,228,255,343,348,359,361,446,466,508,520,524,536,714,1006,1057,1086,1248,1271,1274,1445,1499,1765,1768,2087,2095,2563,3089,3483,5569],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,2.2635883139467947,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,2.9360366939211433,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.1405462403177813,2.3253197803590226,2.3930275298746078,2.4071371113909277,2.558331832813986,2.7742700004069256,5.3509388313256645,2.9705344631698933,3.0103169565570433,3.2189558216683714,3.0399731661399314,3.233054746047873,6.889205006401399,10.244912116782986,3.5614461306151473,3.4028786598293,3.6254214301101193,7.459562890868725,4.062925891962901,4.181290492043933,5.116075806554253,4.327618446189983,4.3773181147422555,10.487818356128276,4.798834931860927,4.654440426979034,4.789173020949191,4.798834931860927,4.9676558014359795,5.541743621979936,5.259176650194926,5.501738287366237,5.672363804397,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.45203853690731E-5,6.408530932689469E-5,6.458351149841935E-5,6.421034728095029E-5,0.044956627284275505,6.412164459087241E-5,6.431235134615951E-5,6.40945371926918E-5,6.423864507753103E-5,0.24007258119936084,0.5295322159719339,6.399107447837826E-5,6.518543615053059E-5,6.611532072080678E-5,6.403773610233943E-5,6.386076342943409E-5,6.545369028992078E-5,6.431837692803066E-5,6.41188294141672E-5,6.41719725236178E-5,6.479287399540242E-5,6.438210016396087E-5,6.445540895217599E-5,6.452485242606044E-5,6.502004751898782E-5,6.468001097500775E-5,6.739903576243633E-5,6.401009843808884E-5,6.401181085812588E-5,6.417398441894714E-5,6.553798743447951E-5,6.431465022731922E-5,6.9036328814319E-5,0.08249983223112692,6.407977055162898E-5,6.437554093454441E-5,6.401556102019448E-5,6.405338950683254E-5,6.386044258779527E-5,6.387701093285523E-5,6.402079032130016E-5,6.469607400305278E-5,6.436732606370642E-5,6.411283564963026E-5,6.489187382918696E-5,6

{"value":"What is interesting is that the acting; was not bad, just not enough. It was rather lame., special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure. Standing alone they weren't horribly bad, but put together was a tragic move. The show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along, but it failed totally.<br /><br />Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects.Don't believe it, they were kinda cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton. An experienced actress would have brought something to the part, like Appleby never did. Scfi puts out some really good original movies, it's just too bad that this failed so

{"value":"My wife and I just finished watching Bûsu AKA The Booth. She fell asleep during some parts of the movie. I really wish I had taken a snooze with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. I was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Asian horror cinema, but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all. If you want some good Asian cinema, check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror.

{"value":"This is simply put, the worst movie I have ever seen. It ranges from like 2+ hours, and the box art was totally misleading. My friends and I rented it because, we thought it would be a poor man's 300. You know, to laugh at and make fun of. No. There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then, the movie starts up, and they are speaking some sort of different language. We think, 'Oh its just the beginning.' But no, from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this movie belongs in trash compactor.

{"value":"Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regretted it! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-I can't think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack haven't disappointed me ever since.

{"value":"I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in \"shaky hands\" camera mode is really annoying.<br /><br />i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:<br /><br />American \"military machine\" (people, who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something (sort of) patriotic.<br /><br />why these \"heroic\" efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of \"loving-war-like-a-drug\"?..

{"value":"This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line. Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event. There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane. I believe that Mister Bin would play it better. Generally speaking, film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie \"Stauffenberg\" from 2004, but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever. However, movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art

{"value":"I cannot believe that they managed to spend US$17million on this film. Spectacularly bad acting, egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average PC, unbelievable plot contrivances...a reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix. All this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have used the money to help people truly in need.

{"value":"So let me start off by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was really bored one fine 1997 day and so I biked over to the movie rental store. I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was. Without hesitation he walked me over to \"Lucky Stiff.\" He told me that he'd waive the $1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So watch it I did, for free...<br /><br />This movie is terrible. God-Awful even. I don't need to go into plot details, read the other reviews. The jokes make no sense. The acting was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting.

{"value":"The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style. Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too. Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over

{"value":"..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like \"continuity editing\" and \"geographic match\". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this

{"value":"The directors cut version, which was the one I saw, was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours is way too long. If you have the choice, definitely go for the non-directors cut.<br /><br />The main plot is almost not taken up at all, the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes, which are connected but the feeling is that they're only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence. The connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before I was there.<br /><br />As a horror movie it doesn't work. You never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition (character is presented, 15 minutes later character is dead). This pictures strong side lies in the splatter

{"value":"Beating the bad guys... Again is the tag line for this movie, it exposes so much truth about it.<br /><br />Home Alone one and two, film classics. Home Alone three and four, a good film if you're three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be funny, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He's a very bland actor with bland performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions. The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks, and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day.

{"value":"I love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I have seen most of this movie, since it's been airing on HBO for the past couple of months. I must admit, I MAY have missed a few scenes, but I'm usually drawn into movies, and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see some of \"Hollow Man,\" I feel depressed, almost like a \"film noir.\" I'm not sure why; perhaps it's that I don't want Kevin Bacon to be evil, and there's disappointment in that. But I think it's witnessing just HOW relentlessly evil he becomes. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps 12, if they are

{"value":"For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains?

{"value":"The movie was watchable while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep to carry scenes without Jack; she was as bland as could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been portrayed before -- and much better. It felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring, and not worth writing about or watching. Why Ephron felt her life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me. Perhaps she wrote it as therapy -- for many writers, putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic. Fine: but then why anyone in Hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me.","finished_norm":["the","movi","be","watchabl","while","nicolson","be","on","the","screen","howev","i","have","to","fight","against","pass","out","from","boredom","when","the","film","depend","on","meryl","streep","to","carri","scene","without","jack","she","be","a","bland","a","can","be","the","relationship","between","the","charact","be","noth","special","thi","charact","have","be","portrai","befor","and","much","well","it","feel","like","a","basedonreallif","scenario","in","the","absolut","wrong","sens","of","daili","life","be","bore","and","not","worth","write","about","or","watch","why","ephron","feel","her","life","and","relationship","with","carl","bernstein","be","interest","enough","to","write","about","escap","me","perhap","she","write","it","a","therapi","for","mani","writer","putt","a","episod","from","their","life","on","paper","be","cathart","fine","but","then","why","anyon","in","hollywood","feel","thi","stori","be","worth","film","remain","a","mysteri","to","me"],"filtered":["movi","watchabl","nicolson","screen","howev","fight","pass","boredom","film","depend","meryl","streep","carri","scene","without","jack","bland","relationship","charact","noth","special","thi","charact","portrai","befor","much","well","feel","like","basedonreallif","scenario","absolut","wrong","sens","daili","life","bore","worth","write","watch","ephron","feel","life","relationship","carl","bernstein","interest","enough","write","escap","perhap","write","therapi","mani","writer","putt","episod","life","paper","cathart","fine","anyon","hollywood","feel","thi","stori","worth","film","remain","mysteri"],"filtered2":["watchabl","nicolson","screen","howev","fight","pass","boredom","depend","meryl","streep","carri","scene","without","jack","bland","relationship","charact","noth","special","charact","portrai","befor","well","feel","like","basedonreallif","scenario","absolut","wrong","sens","daili","life","bore","worth","write","watch","ephron","feel","life","relationship","carl","bernstein","interest","enough","write","escap","perhap","write","therapi","mani","writer","putt","life","paper","cathart","fine","anyon","hollywood","feel","stori","worth","remain","mysteri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,10,17,19,20,25,43,49,50,60,65,75,79,93,108,113,125,158,173,192,203,219,222,232,287,300,318,403,464,469,487,577,621,638,682,777,1028,1178,1213,1399,1569,1766,1970,2757,3985,4167,4440,5421],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,10,17,19,20,25,43,49,50,60,65,75,79,93,108,113,125,158,173,192,203,219,222,232,287,300,318,403,464,469,487,577,621,638,682,777,1028,1178,1213,1399,1569,1766,1970,2757,3985,4167,4440,5421],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,4.982433610865464,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,5.722155020233252,5.922675074610803,1.9469506069506084,2.035389827120098,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,2.2242236634876535,2.3106972614914807,2.4368824319140248,2.5318267134339894,2.569760528637609,5.158418835671083,2.5771019354959765,2.8377834061292515,2.841890188081905,2.932274249550174,2.902686292364678,3.189397019426827,3.2872346624216657,3.328770687675578,3.3220965805878846,7.209236604960712,3.5446859617576822,3.613480989738201,3.6497387377608255,4.086456389373095,4.086456389373095,4.229557233013768,4.251780369798478,4.436351646326448,4.597282013139085,4.715065048795469,4.869215728622727,5.3560264761848435,6.0662680901040895,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.371893886128397E-5,7.32218348224613E-5,7.379106476758793E-5,7.336469920923826E-5,7.336590120723538E-5,7.326335033865608E-5,7.34812458077086E-5,7.323237828822994E-5,7.339703137099012E-5,8.14299997200761E-5,0.8753487219203814,7.311416508371678E-5,7.447880471790382E-5,7.554126123288148E-5,7.316747917017618E-5,7.296527582654459E-5,0.06223764513876053,7.348813044578107E-5,7.326013380735007E-5,7.332085343284637E-5,7.403027569335432E-5,7.356093858706405E-5,7.364469887531266E-5,7.372404277842666E-5,7.428983693125297E-5,7.39013219982922E-5,7.70079931832235E-5,7.313590125461504E-5,7.313785781124893E-5,7.332315216041799E-5,7.488161859445197E-5,7.348387243615621E-5,7.887871211491172E-5,7.369057172555457E-5,7.321550639412284E-5,7.355344422029045E-5,7.314214262707379E-5,7.318536425195612E-5,7.296490924309935E-5,7.298383970685155E-5,7.314811746008651E-5,7.391967510290565E-5,7.354405817032198E-5,7.325328552275103E-5,7.414338975261316E-5,7.328140053402539E-5,7.571617757253218E-5,7.460274911132838E-5,7.300198018089523E-5,7.316331902147249E-5,7.313794322599532E-5,7.519631987698977E-5,7.316440755217988E-5,7.297736040964638E-5,7.377839137879111E-5,7.318325276131068E-5,7.87

The acting is absolutely horrific. the plot makes no sense at all. The title \"cold vengeance\" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable. I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap.","finished_norm":["i","check","thi","on","out","on","dvd","for","a","dollar","so","i","can","easili","smile","a","thi","dread","movi","unfold","everi","time","that","you","think","it","cannot","get","ani","wrong","it","inevit","doe","the","act","be","absolut","horrif","the","plot","make","no","sens","at","all","the","titl","cold","vengeanc","in","the","u","dvd","version","have","absolut","noth","to","do","with","the","script","the","action","scene","be","so","obvious","take","in","their","take","there","be","lot","of","mistak","dure","dialogu","indic","that","there","be","just","no","intend","to","do","anoth","take","to","at","littl","try","to","make","thi","movi","bearabl","i","cannot","rememb","have","see","a","wrong","movi","and","i","do","occasion","get","bad","oneswel","except","for","unstopp","with","weslei","snipe","no","who","be","i","kid","while","a","bad","on","unstopp","deserv","well","pictur","award","at","the","oscar","when","compar","to","thi","piec","of","crap"],"filtered":["check","thi","dvd","dollar","easili","smile","thi","dread","movi","unfold","everi","time","think","get","ani","wrong","inevit","doe","act","absolut","horrif","plot","make","sens","titl","cold","vengeanc","u","dvd","version","absolut","noth","script","action","scene","obvious","take","take","lot","mistak","dure","dialogu","indic","intend","anoth","take","littl","try","make","thi","movi","bearabl","rememb","see","wrong","movi","occasion","get","bad","oneswel","except","unstopp","weslei","snipe","kid","bad","unstopp","deserv","well","pictur","award","oscar","compar","thi","piec","crap"],"filtered2":["check","dvd","dollar","easili","smile","dread","unfold","everi","time","think","get","ani","wrong","inevit","doe","act","absolut","horrif","plot","make","sens","titl","cold","vengeanc","u","dvd","version","absolut","noth","script","action","scene","obvious","take","take","lot","mistak","dure","dialogu","indic","intend","anoth","take","littl","try","make","bearabl","rememb","see","wrong","occasion","get","bad","oneswel","except","unstopp","weslei","snipe","kid","bad","unstopp","deserv","well","pictur","award","oscar","compar","piec","crap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,8,9,12,14,18,19,20,21,25,27,31,32,36,49,72,73,77,85,112,114,129,173,218,220,222,233,239,247,248,264,290,311,313,341,423,482,504,583,593,926,979,995,1004,1039,1099,1107,1303,1419,2093,2248,2711,3478,4704,4952,5205],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,8,9,12,14,18,19,20,21,25,27,31,32,36,49,72,73,77,85,112,114,129,173,218,220,222,233,239,247,248,264,290,311,313,341,423,482,504,583,593,926,979,995,1004,1039,1099,1107,1303,1419,2093,2248,2711,3478,4704,4952,5205],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,4.221200943435452,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.6920303308087352,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.011190219103739,2.2466628996789315,2.4433074195966826,2.4106958340079214,2.4368824319140248,2.5940874818617203,2.8336934208777267,5.154203870991953,2.6102777977348763,2.6593400337329487,5.460751613699401,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,2.8612813773965557,2.9203338091782562,2.907069060519773,2.933776879434709,3.164467636384302,3.3154667220492153,3.41740676039221,3.4986697244709752,3.5227672760500357,3.9323057095458362,4.096025840389245,4.030886538218284,4.176068548062782,4.145296889396028,4.135246553542527,4.213208095012239,4.390138803171316,4.436351646326448,4.933754249760298,5.014723312293965,5.373120909544144,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.96951638871437E-5,6.922519310365346E-5,6.976335297041065E-5,6.936025957373372E-5,6.936139596349591E-5,6.926444259299431E-5,6.94704447501124E-5,6.923516107912943E-5,6.939082696044504E-5,7.698533461662047E-5,0.8578973870349886,6.91234002644808E-5,7.04135542523254E-5,7.141801907612959E-5,6.917380432686528E-5,6.898263777739215E-5,7.070332338654953E-5,6.947695360640057E-5,6.926140162848798E-5,6.931880701597049E-5,6.998950713014774E-5,6.954578768645405E-5,6.962497611627811E-5,6.96999892189678E-5,7.023490082807029E-5,6.986759206937729E-5,7.280469291105757E-5,6.914395001758948E-5,6.914579978017911E-5,6.932098027290161E-5,7.079438148038501E-5,6.947292801022107E-5,7.45733030476756E-5,0.036891774720252866,6.921921009769855E-5,6.95387023820725E-5,6.914985071940522E-5,6.919071319350175E-5,6.898229120304247E-5,6.900018839193382E-5,6.915549943020399E-5,6.988494341292116E-5,6.952982864757619E-5,6.925492714140437E-5,7.009644712439833E-5,6.9
