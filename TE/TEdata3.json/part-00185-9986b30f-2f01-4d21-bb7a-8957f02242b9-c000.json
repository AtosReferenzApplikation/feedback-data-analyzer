{"value":"After watching this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the DVD, then thinking back to actual movie....I became a bit dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism. Where (zombies?) come out of nowhere and (vampires?) who (seduce?) pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world. Neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other. The only fighting i remember was getting that walrus Bonny Giroux's panties off. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution, but that actually made it more entertaining... In conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and acting then the entirety of this film. It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F***ING

{"value":"Before seeing this movie, please check out reviews available on the internet regarding the movie's falsification of events, particularly its prevarications regarding the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were bused out of Srebrenica and shot by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentarian also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Please watch this movie critically, and read reviews beforehand. Most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far, even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war. A review in the NYTimes by Stephen Holden states that it would be \"inaccurate to label this documentary pro-Serbian,\" but one should question both the presentation of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of those facts that inculpate Serbian forces. I do not advise against seeing this documentary, but I do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye (as one should do at all times anyway).","finished_norm":["befor","see","thi","movi","pleas","check","out","review","avail","on","the","internet","regard","the","movi","falsif","of","event","particularli","it","prevar","regard","the","wide","accept","fact","that","muslim","man","be","bu","out","of","srebrenica","and","shoot","by","serbian","paramilitari","the","documentarian","conjur","belong","to","variou","proserbian","american","organ","pleas","watch","thi","movi","critic","and","read","review","beforehand","much","review","argu","that","the","documentarian","take","hi","argum","too","far","even","if","he","rais","question","that","target","the","convent","wisdom","regard","the","war","a","review","in","the","nytim","by","stephen","holden","state","that","it","would","be","inaccur","to","label","thi","documentari","proserbian","but","on","should","question","both","the","present","of","fact","mani","of","which","be","take","from","reliabl","sourc","and","the","omiss","of","that","fact","that","inculp","serbian","forc","i","do","not","advis","against","see","thi","documentari","but","i","do","caution","you","to","examin","it","with","a","especi","critic","ey","a","on","should","do","at","all","time","anywai"],"filtered":["befor","see","thi","movi","pleas","check","review","avail","internet","regard","movi","falsif","event","particularli","prevar","regard","wide","accept","fact","muslim","man","bu","srebrenica","shoot","serbian","paramilitari","documentarian","conjur","belong","variou","proserbian","american","organ","pleas","watch","thi","movi","critic","read","review","beforehand","much","review","argu","documentarian","take","hi","argum","far","even","rais","question","target","convent","wisdom","regard","war","review","nytim","stephen","holden","state","inaccur","label","thi","documentari","proserbian","question","present","fact","mani","take","reliabl","sourc","omiss","fact","inculp","serbian","forc","advis","see","thi","documentari","caution","examin","especi","critic","ey","time","anywai"],"filtered2":["befor","see","pleas","check","review","avail","internet","regard","falsif","event","particularli","prevar","regard","wide","accept","fact","muslim","man","bu","srebrenica","shoot","serbian","paramilitari","documentarian","conjur","belong","variou","proserbian","american","organ","pleas","watch","critic","read","review","beforehand","review","argu","documentarian","take","argum","far","even","rais","question","target","convent","wisdom","regard","war","review","nytim","stephen","holden","state","inaccur","label","documentari","proserbian","question","present","fact","mani","take","reliabl","sourc","omiss","fact","inculp","serbian","forc","advis","see","documentari","caution","examin","especi","critic","ey","time","anywai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,31,39,45,50,79,97,101,117,145,176,223,267,281,314,338,346,378,386,411,470,497,498,504,579,624,742,942,1019,1045,1271,1347,1540,1582,1586,1588,1599,1811,1873,1992,2043,2047,2525,2598,2612,2650,3238,4054,4714,4898,5374,6710,8496],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,31,39,45,50,79,97,101,117,145,176,223,267,281,314,338,346,378,386,411,470,497,498,504,579,624,742,942,1019,1045,1271,1347,1540,1582,1586,1588,1599,1811,1873,1992,2043,2047,2525,2598,2612,2650,3238,4054,4714,4898,5374,6710,8496],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.814133962290301,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,1.9469506069506084,6.163667377386776,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,2.34599021453259,10.016188597307654,2.825563294794476,2.7085302779237206,2.832333801361687,3.189397019426827,2.9720957437368454,6.046778076248792,6.261889888691316,3.0433232530252132,3.229006157521873,3.3814747511661465,3.342254038012865,3.386191741044285,3.41740676039221,7.128534013913577,7.8483511669251715,3.7165362186843414,3.9739784059464043,12.273689004377257,4.1554492608600455,4.3773181147422555,4.566029469634981,4.528289141652134,4.621379564718146,4.589376833631972,4.654440426979034,4.688631791727313,4.798834931860927,4.9676558014359795,4.979216623837056,4.900964426937307,5.214056214914456,5.3064295350454715,5.259176650194926,5.850044981634453,5.290429193699031,5.583416318380505,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.02470635716347E-5,4.9908235875166645E-5,5.02962248191404E-5,0.02376863910625828,5.000643198197577E-5,4.99365329832595E-5,5.008505122910748E-5,4.991542233502249E-5,5.002765040076125E-5,5.5502947217812065E-5,0.577887497874145,4.983484783823874E-5,5.076499056018424E-5,5.148916430542268E-5,4.987118688941025E-5,4.9733364446239E-5,5.0973901011016015E-5,5.008974382034983E-5,4.

{"value":"I watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed. A lot of the \"time facts\" were off. At the beginning of the movie, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. This movie was supposed to be taking place in 1994. Also, one of the grandsons friends was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He hadn't even been drafted as of yet. The story line was good but the facts and actuality of the time frame was so far off base that it made the movie seem cheesy. My boyfriend is an avid reader of WWII books and memorabilia. I rented this movie hoping that it would be good. The acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way that this movie was carried out made me glad that I only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50 it would have taken me to watch it in a theater.

{"value":"I had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie. It was an epic of adolescence, a dream of summers gone, a great potential indie film or big budget drama. It somehow got into the hands of a hack, who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything at all. The script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags. I feel sorry for the actors, since the characters in the book were rich and textured, but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, as is Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special. Poor people = GOOD, Rich people = BAD. <br /><br />Though it's almost worth watching to see the Southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in

{"value":"I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite sick by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening. And when the film climaxed in an \"orgy\" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema.","finished_norm":["i","have","quit","high","hope","for","thi","film","even","though","it","get","a","bad","review","in","the","paper","i","be","extrem","toler","and","sit","through","the","entir","film","i","feel","quit","sick","by","the","endbr","br","although","i","be","not","in","the","littl","prude","or","particularli","sensit","to","tasteless","cinemai","thouroughli","enjoi","both","woodi","allen","everyth","you","ever","want","to","know","about","sex","and","michael","hannek","funni","gamesi","find","the","director","obsess","with","thi","tenyearold","want","to","drink","woman","milk","total","sicken","and","when","the","film","climax","in","a","orgi","where","the","boi","drink","both","hi","mother","milk","a","good","a","that","of","the","woman","he","have","be","lust","after","for","the","whole","film","i","almost","vomit","with","disgust","for","the","total","pervers","and","sentiment","pap","that","it","isbr","br","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","enjoi","the","vast","major","of","european","cinema","a","good","a","independ","make","film","so","thi","flick","should","have","pleas","me","enorm","avoid","thi","film","at","all","cost","it","should","be","releg","to","the","annal","of","histori","a","a","lesson","in","bad","cinema"],"filtered":["quit","high","hope","thi","film","even","though","get","bad","review","paper","extrem","toler","sit","entir","film","feel","quit","sick","endbr","br","although","littl","prude","particularli","sensit","tasteless","cinemai","thouroughli","enjoi","woodi","allen","everyth","ever","want","know","sex","michael","hannek","funni","gamesi","find","director","obsess","thi","tenyearold","want","drink","woman","milk","total","sicken","film","climax","orgi","boi","drink","hi","mother","milk","good","woman","lust","whole","film","almost","vomit","disgust","total","pervers","sentiment","pap","isbr","br","get","wrong","enjoi","vast","major","european","cinema","good","independ","make","film","thi","flick","pleas","enorm","avoid","thi","film","cost","releg","annal","histori","lesson","bad","cinema"],"filtered2":["quit","high","hope","even","though","get","bad","review","paper","extrem","toler","sit","entir","feel","quit","sick","endbr","although","littl","prude","particularli","sensit","tasteless","cinemai","thouroughli","enjoi","woodi","allen","everyth","ever","want","know","sex","michael","hannek","funni","gamesi","find","director","obsess","tenyearold","want","drink","woman","milk","total","sicken","climax","orgi","boi","drink","mother","milk","good","woman","lust","whole","almost","vomit","disgust","total","pervers","sentiment","pap","isbr","get","wrong","enjoi","vast","major","european","cinema","good","independ","make","flick","pleas","enorm","avoid","cost","releg","annal","histori","lesson","bad","cinema"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,9,14,25,26,37,38,43,44,58,62,70,86,111,120,131,176,181,184,193,198,200,211,237,244,254,257,282,329,335,346,397,404,409,466,497,499,667,778,837,963,1122,1137,1210,1272,1345,1399,1405,1673,1760,1932,2239,2633,2849,2937,2992,3010,3016,3093,3253,3338,3765,4321,7499,8335,8528],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,9,14,25,26,37,38,43,44,58,62,70,86,111,120,131,176,181,184,193,198,200,211,237,244,254,257,282,329,335,346,397,404,409,466,497,499,667,778,837,963,1122,1137,1210,1272,1345,1399,1405,1673,1760,1932,2239,2633,2849,2937,2992,3010,3016,3093,3253,3338,3765,4321,7499,8335,8528],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.975308642954861,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,4.189351572503368,2.031112399272319,2.1183455303375887,4.4089000845945225,2.2512118082053005,2.5040471493269134,2.4442286541160034,4.992499677733764,2.517840471459249,2.5439726117360975,5.061642365863941,2.5687161421197025,2.640097787510554,2.634508058031767,2.889652074525771,2.7602659523229094,2.918851229218033,2.951986790814132,2.908534262247101,3.023389038124396,3.3176717946075294,3.1419947805322432,6.441915648678089,3.4446025032006995,3.342254038012865,3.3814747511661465,7.3304858485935815,3.8059428063999263,3.7881170224473255,4.035401218572811,4.263079925052412,4.181290492043933,4.364659717870332,4.416284083275639,4.760735085628657,4.436351646326448,4.662879295624898,4.654440426979034,5.156897801074508,4.8184434032493035,5.014723312293965,5.3064295350454715,5.463272006538442,5.444579873526289,5.408212229355414,5.444579873526289,11.003476574732474,5.482320201509136,5.626901430320244,5.604922523601468,5.719991853386255,6.032366538428407,6.794506590475304,6.94865727030

{"value":"I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned. From the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein. Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.<br /><br />It's bleak, depressing and hopeless. While I don't mind a less than cheery ending, I'm really very tired of the \"humans suck\" cliché that's central to every movie. I know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil! Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired. This way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive.

{"value":"This movie is so bad it's funny. It stars Scott Backula as some coach, but that's not important, what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base. First off he has to be at least 75 years old, yet still plays minor league baseball, second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk, let alone run. Coach Backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film, (SPOILER), he tells his star player \"downtown\" to hit a home run, clearly \"downtown\" viewed this as a good move. He hit the home run and won the game for his team, a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie. Now if only Tony Muser, manager of the Royals, would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat, the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a

{"value":"I agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched, and I would also say rushed. It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school. But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it doesn't fully make sense. For example Jane & Mr Rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage!!! The actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story.The actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice. I'm sorry to say it but I didn't really enjoy this version.The 1970 version with Susanna York & George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke & Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles.

{"value":"A terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one. It needed some dependence on something.<br /><br />This totally miserable film deals with the interactions among Irish people. Were they trying to imitate the wonderful film \"Crash?\" If so, this film crashed entirely.<br /><br />There is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem.<br /><br />The film is just too choppy to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing. The older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.<br /><br />Then, we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry but there doesn't seem to be any punishment for the crooks.

{"value":"Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes, \"Salaam-e-Ishq\" is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love (which is at least four tales too many in my estimation).<br /><br />Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial, the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-stepping song-and-dance numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, winking character asides, corny dialogue and way-over-the-top comical performances - all pretty much standard-issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days. It's an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance, prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline.<br /><br />There's plenty for the viewer to

{"value":"This is really terrible.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched, I would have a suitable reply.<br /><br />I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies.<br /><br />There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.<br /><br />I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before.

{"value":"Truly bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen....ever.<br /><br />They tried to make up for it by giving it the, 'we know we are doing this' routine. That would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that 'The Simpsons' had already done it. And it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place.<br /><br />The flashbacks took place as part of the usual character's (mainly J.D's) fantasies. The flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred, just compilations of say, J.D falling over or, i don't know.... Elliott falling over. If I wanted to watch a Scrubs compilation i'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life.<br /><br />Scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit-coms have to, and it disappoints me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this. <br /><br />I was hoping that scrubs wouldn't have to be that kind of sit-com.<br /><br />And just as a passing thought,

{"value":"I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. Well, I didn't think it was that bad. It was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time.<br /><br />Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. That was funny.<br /><br />So, he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all.<br /><br />Also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriends's parents didn't even say anything about it.

{"value":"I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all.

{"value":"Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth.Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by Roth.this a zombie film,which owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier \"living dead movies\",and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie's \"Evil Dead\".there is nothing original here,and the story is not compelling.the acting is about par with this genre,it's just that the story fails.we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made.having said that,after having achieved commercial, if not artistic success from this movie,Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious,mean spirited,pointless(though much more ambitious)crap fest Hostel.Roth should have quit while he was behind.Cabin Fever is not a good film,however compared to Hostel it is a work of art.I hope somebody (preferably a psychiatrist)convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice.as for Cabin fever,a weak

{"value":"Joyce Reynolds seems a might grown-up for the role of Janie, a boy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town America who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier AND winds up on the cover of Life magazine (smooching at a blanket party) all in the same week! Non-stop barrage of wisecracks, put-downs, bull talk, and unfunny bits of business such as Janie's little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as the maid) constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis, Janie's mother involved with the Red Cross, and Janie's father trying to write an editorial on the problems with today's teenagers (as the parents, stuffy, sexless Edward Arnold and pert, chatty Ann Harding make an unlikely couple, even for 1944; he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them). Nominated for an Academy Award (!) for Owen Marks' editing, Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 with \"Janie Gets Married\".

{"value":"So this guy named George is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up. George's wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away George gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls. It isn't that great of a scene because it really doesn't show anything. After that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house. They make him a nice breakfast but George isn't hungry. George isn't very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house. The girls have had enough with old George and no longer want to cook for them. They both turn out to be major psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up George's house. George wasn't really that great to his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he really didn't seem to mean it. George looked like Tom Tucker on Family Guy.

{"value":"I watched the Malayalam movie \"Boeing Boeing\" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English movie of same name) long back. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way, the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of Hindi audience)... <br /><br />I haven't seen the English original. But had really enjoyed the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself)which was a side splitting comedy, back then. Of course the acting by Mohanlal,Mukesh and Sukumari (who did the cook's role) was so natural and spontaneous.<br /><br />Probably, I am too smitten by the Malayalam film that I cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overacted. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but doesn't reach anywhere near Sukumari.<br /><br />But all in all its OK, if one compares it to other recent Hindi comedy

{"value":"This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job, better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie, some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies, what's with the thing around raph's thigh?

{"value":"This movie is a re-write of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, \"Heaven Can Wait\", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, fail miserably.

{"value":"A slow, tedious, and one dimensional movie! Good casting with clichéd dialogue, boring story line, and soulless direction from Mr Marshal! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the Asian continent, lacks heart, new insights, and depth. The lead character looks out of place due to her tiny phisique and phony looking contact lenses. The lexicon employed by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education. The story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little, boring, flat chested Asian girl is the ultimate Geisha, they actually say in the movie \"She is destined to become a legend\" i say hardy the case! The movie is just plain boring, it is beautiful to look at, it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for cigarretes. Basically, if you don't believe the messenger you wont believe the message, and this girl didn't fill the shoe!

{"value":"Why do movie makers always go against the author's work? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. I can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a dreadful mess. Look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, the widows, Windy Poplars . . . and Anne's college years, for heaven's sake!!! Wouldn't it have been delightful to meet Priscilla and all the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. This movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! But L.M. Montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied.

{"value":"I bought this DVD without any previous reference but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover. I found the Brazilian title very weird, but I decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like \"Switch\". However the non-sense story is awful and hard to be described. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is submitted to a surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood telling that she is to be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claiming half the property of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Along the days, Myra and her alter-ego Myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle's academy with kinky sex. In a certain moment, the messy screenplay is so confused that I believe the whole story was only a mind trip of Myron induced by the accident. Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this flick.

{"value":"I have read the whole 'A wrinkle in time' book and then saw the movie. The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.<br /><br />A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin must team together to find Meg's father and get off the island Camazotz. <br /><br />The beginning of the film is really a stinker. The acting is awful, the direction is laughable, and so far the situations aren't necessary. I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book, and a terrible film. The acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting. Yes, I got to admit there was cool effects. But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible. If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie.

{"value":"The First Power (1990) was a terrible film that came out during the late 80's/ early 90's era of cheaply made horror films. I found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts. This movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain't even funny. The swift justice system in this film makes Texas look weak by comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is in way over his head with this role (he plays a hard-boiled cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a psychic. Don't waste your time with this one because it's bad. What a minute, I take it back. This movie makes a great party film. Check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun, she has the nicest legs I've ever seen on a Nun that wasn't in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation flick. Yeow!<br /><br />This marked an end of an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished and he couldn't draw flies to a dung heap.

{"value":"In spite of the great future-design touches, the clever Asimov premise, and Will Smith's dependable cool performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations. The clichés come thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant, to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off). This movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere; what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good in closeup, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad Disney -the CGI is overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty

{"value":"OK, I have been a huge fan of the Black for a long time and was DISGUSTED after seeing this film. Let's name the problems...First this film has much of the same crew that the first two had. It has also been called the PREQUEL to the original Black Stallion. Why is it that they can't get Shetan's dam's name correct or her color?? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn the Sagr was the Black's CHESTNUT mother and in this film she is a gray mare name Jenny?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it's set in Africa in 1946 and 1947...I could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940's as well when the ship wrecks. Time line doesn't sound quite right to me. Also, as a goof, there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be Shetan's father...upon further notice it appears to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way.

{"value":"The Flock is not really a movie. It's a wannabe movie, with wannabe actors. Not including Richard Gere, he gave an excellent performance, but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character, and the rest of the cast is just acting... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you're acting. What the hell was Claire Dains doing in this one?! She's the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the movie she looked extremely out of place, out of everything!! The only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions, like \" do you really think so?? \" , and making silly faces. I was embarrassed by her acting, seriously, and I used to like her... She's the romantic movie type, I don't know who picked her among all the actresses out there.... LOL, and seeing Avril Lavigne?! this really made me laugh.. Anyway.. If you want to get the feeling of throwing up, this movie will do the job for you!!!

{"value":"I was going to say this was the worst gay-themed film I've ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre I've ever seen.<br /><br />You know you're in trouble when a movie starts with a \"personal note\" from the Director, asking for the audience's \"understanding\" for the \"many challenges\" facing a first-time Director. The audio track is so bad in many scenes it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor script, generally bad acting all add up to make this \"film\" unwatchable. I did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts, and immediately gave away the DVD I foolishly purchased. I'm sure there are many challenges facing a first-time Director. But, don't try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product. I see from IMDb details that this was not only the first Directing attempt of Richard Natale, but also the only.

{"value":"I've noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how \"wholesome\" and \"entertaining\" it is. These people need to get out of the house more often. I don't know why they're shilling for this vapid, insipid, brainless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever, and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public, a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day). A good supporting cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) tries hard to make some sense out of this, but to no avail. I noticed that two directors shared credit, although \"credit\" isn't the word I would use (neither is \"director\"). As for \"wholesome entertainment,\" there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this.
