{"value":"Now I myself am a lover of the B movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end. First of all the movie is starring Lizzy McGuire's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog. Now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three-legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please I ask you? And heres another point for pondering, why do they show the Dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water? I believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall, that was a heart breaker. But redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death. But the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil E.V.I.L Corporation. And let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off #1 as the male lead and half way decent chick (who doesn't know how to act) as the female lead to that I say WOW! The only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with. All in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all CGI monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs (otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military DUH!). By far the best scene was when Lizzy McGuire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. I believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch Dinocroc. And as for the director I believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then I can go on

{"value":"Me neither, but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful, which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time. There's nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie, and My Name is Modesty: Whatever the subtitle is takes mediocrity to a new level. It's full of B-actors but isn't any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously. It sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing-up drama, flashback style. The beautiful Alexandra Staden, smothered beyond recognition under makeup, more resembles a cast member from Top Model than Modesty Blaise. I'm not one of those die-hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious \"graphic novels\" to be pitch-perfect - in fact I've never even read Modesty Blaise - all I wanted was a decent movie to watch. But this wasn't it. The film feels half-finished, with a weak and very unexciting conclusion to a rather weak plot. It also takes its audience for idiots, explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago (I guess they think we all have Alzheimers).<br /><br />Now I love a good B-movie - what's better than just turning your brain off and swallowing the cinematic equivalent of a Calzone? - and \"Modesty\" is directed by none other than Scott Spiegel, who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money! I loved From Dusk Till Dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad B-movie should bring to the table - nudity, gore, guns, you name it. \"Modesty\" is just dull. The flashback concerning Modesty's life isn't interesting. The acting isn't bad enough to be laughed at. In fact, I kinda liked Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's (hey buddy, pseudonyms are your friends!) performance as the baddie.<br /><br />So overall it's just lame. Weak. Uninspired. Call it what you will. Don't watch anything because Tarantino presents it, people. This is just a very forgettable, half-hearted thriller, and it never tries to be more than that. Allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun (seriously, even I'm cringing): My Name Is Modesty: A Modesty Waste of Time -

{"value":"Oh it really really is. I've seen films that I disliked more, due to whatever reason, but never have I seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making. It even fails to fail at film making, in a Way the Hercules in New York could be said to do. It's not the film I like the least, but it is the very worst film I've ever seen.<br /><br />The acting is the first thing that strikes you. I've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography. In fact I've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this. It really is awful.<br /><br />Technically, it's terrible. The camera-work is amateurish. The editing is nonsensical. I presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car (and there's a lot of them) has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods (and there's a lot of them too) is actually dubbed from a studio, again lending more to the bad porn vibe.<br /><br />The plot is nonsensical, as many have pointed out. I'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by Nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos.<br /><br />Speaking of vampire mythos, the writer had evidently read Carmilla, or at very least seen The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about this, swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a Gothic novel I'm very fond of; or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material. At very least 'the General' is an insult to Peter Cushing though.<br /><br />It gets two stars however, merely because I can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has, or at least purports to have, both vampires and zombies in it. Incidentally I watched Lifeforce (another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as this, and despite being a rather flawed film itself, really comes out a masterpiece compared to this.<br /><br />So in the end, this is not a film so bad it's good, or so bad it's in any way enjoyable, even drunk. It's just a mess, and worth no-one's time watching.","finished_norm":["oh","it","realli","realli","be","i","have","see","film","that","i","dislik","much","due","to","whatev","reason","but","never","have","i","see","a","film","that","just","fail","in","everi","singl","aspect","of","film","make","it","even","fail","to","fail","at","film","make","in","a","wai","the","hercul","in","new","york","can","be","sai","to","do","it","not","the","film","i","like","the","littl","but","it","be","the","veri","wrong","film","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","the","act","be","the","thing","that","strike","you","i","have","never","see","a","wrong","act","film","outsid","of","pornographi","in","fact","i","have","plenti","of","pornograph","film","that","be","act","a","damn","site","well","than","thi","it","realli","be","awfulbr","br","technic","it","terribl","the","camerawork","be","amateurish","the","edit","be","nonsens","i","presum","thei","can","not","afford","proper","sound","equip","and","thi","mean","that","everi","scene","in","a","car","and","there","a","lot","of","them","have","them","drive","at","about","three","mile","per","hour","and","everi","scene","set","outsid","by","the","same","patch","of","wood","and","there","a","lot","of","them","too","be","actual","dub","from","a","studio","again","lend","much","to","the","bad","porn","vibebr","br","the","plot","be","nonsens","a","mani","have","point","out","i","will","defend","vampir","walk","in","daylight","by","the","fact","that","despit","it","be","popular","by","nosferatu","thi","be","never","origin","a","intrins","part","of","the","vampir","mythosbr","br","speak","of","vampir","mytho","the","writer","have","evid","read","carmilla","or","at","veri","littl","see","the","vampir","lover","i","be","not","sure","how","i","feel","about","thi","swai","from","impress","that","a","movi","thi","dire","have","at","littl","some","aspir","to","a","gothic","novel","i","be","veri","fond","of","or","annoi","by","it","at","well","sledgehamm","refer","and","at","wrong","total","desecr","of","sourc","materi","at","veri","littl","the","gener","be","a","insult","to","peter","cush","thoughbr","br","it","get","two","star","howev","mere","becaus","i","ca","not","bring","myself","to","vote","on","star","for","a","film","that","have","or","at","littl","purport","to","have","both","vampir","and","zombi","in","it","incident","i","watch","lifeforc","anoth","film","that","tenuous","have","vampir","and","zombi","in","it","on","the","same","dai","a","thi","and","despit","be","a","rather","flaw","film","itself","realli","come","out","a","masterpiec","compar","to","thisbr","br","so","in","the","end","thi","be","not","a","film","so","bad","it","good","or","so","bad","it","in","ani","wai","enjoy","even","drink","it","just","a","mess","and","worth","noon","time","watch"],"filtered":["oh","realli","realli","see","film","dislik","much","due","whatev","reason","never","see","film","fail","everi","singl","aspect","film","make","even","fail","fail","film","make","wai","hercul","new","york","sai","film","like","littl","veri","wrong","film","ever","seenbr","br","act","thing","strike","never","see","wrong","act","film","outsid","pornographi","fact","plenti","pornograph","film","act","damn","site","well","thi","realli","awfulbr","br","technic","terribl","camerawork","amateurish","edit","nonsens","presum","thei","afford","proper","sound","equip","thi","mean","everi","scene","car","lot","drive","three","mile","per","hour","everi","scene","set","outsid","patch","wood","lot","actual","dub","studio","lend","much","bad","porn","vibebr","br","plot","nonsens","mani","point","defend","vampir","walk","daylight","fact","despit","popular","nosferatu","thi","never","origin","intrins","part","vampir","mythosbr","br","speak","vampir","mytho","writer","evid","read","carmilla","veri","littl","see","vampir","lover","sure","feel","thi","swai","impress","movi","thi","dire","littl","aspir","gothic","novel","veri","fond","annoi","well","sledgehamm","refer","wrong","total","desecr","sourc","materi","veri","littl","gener","insult","peter","cush","thoughbr","br","get","two","star","howev","mere","becaus","ca","bring","vote","star","film","littl","purport","vampir","zombi","incident","watch","lifeforc","anoth","film","tenuous","vampir","zombi","dai","thi","despit","rather","flaw","film","realli","come","masterpiec","compar","thisbr","br","end","thi","film","bad","good","bad","ani","wai","enjoy","even","drink","mess","worth","noon","time","watch"],"filtered2":["oh","realli","realli","see","dislik","due","whatev","reason","never","see","fail","everi","singl","aspect","make","even","fail","fail","make","wai","hercul","new","york","like","littl","veri","wrong","ever","seenbr","act","thing","strike","never","see","wrong","act","outsid","pornographi","fact","plenti","pornograph","act","damn","site","well","realli","awfulbr","technic","terribl","camerawork","amateurish","edit","nonsens","presum","afford","proper","sound","equip","mean","everi","scene","car","lot","drive","three","mile","pe

{"value":"This one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short.<br /><br />The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I guess the only way they could have been eliminated by Demolition was a double-DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have had to put in overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champ, was wasted here. And this was the third ppv in a row where Perfect jobbed. Remember, before that he never lost a match.<br /><br />The second match was very good, possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent, while the Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights, pinning the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel (remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a foreshadowing of Bret Hart's singles career, as he came back from two-on-one and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase put on a wrestling clinic, making us forget that the point of the match was DiBiase's boring feud with Dusty Rhodes.<br /><br />Even though the Visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive (and only the second since '87 to have four survivors), this match was not a squash. This was the longest match of the night, and Jake did a repeat of his '88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated. I think he could have actually pulled off an upset. These days, the match would have ended the other way around.<br /><br />One of the shortest SS matches ever was also one of its most surprising. Possibly the most underrated wrestler ever, Tito Santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night, putting on war paint and pinning Boris Zukhov, Tanaka, and even the Warlord in the final survival match. It was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly, then go right back to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well, getting rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers, but that just wasn't a surprise. Tito was.<br /><br />I think the only point of the survival match was to have Hogan and the Warrior win together at the end.<br /><br />This show was boring and the matches were too short. The Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this one.","finished_norm":["thi","on","be","mar","by","potenti","great","match","be","cut","veri","shortbr","br","the","open","match","be","a","wast","of","the","legion","of","doom","but","i","guess","the","onli","wai","thei","can","have","be","elimin","by","demolit","be","a","doubledq","otherwis","mr","perfect","would","have","have","to","put","in","overtim","kerri","von","erich","the","ic","champ","be","wast","here","and","thi","be","the","ppv","in","a","row","where","perfect","job","rememb","befor","that","he","never","lose","a","matchbr","br","the","match","be","veri","good","possibli","the","well","of","the","night","ted","dibias","and","the","undertak","be","excel","while","the","jim","neidhart","have","on","of","hi","wwf","highlight","pin","the","honki","tonk","man","koko","b","ware","continu","hi","tradit","of","be","the","to","put","over","a","new","heel","rememb","the","big","bossman","and","yokozuna","thi","be","a","foreshadow","of","bret","hart","singl","career","a","he","come","back","from","twoonon","and","almost","surviv","the","match","he","and","dibias","put","on","a","wrestl","clinic","make","u","forget","that","the","point","of","the","match","be","dibias","bore","feud","with","dusti","rhodesbr","br","even","though","the","visionari","be","the","team","to","have","all","of","it","member","surviv","and","onli","the","sinc","to","have","four","survivor","thi","match","be","not","a","squash","thi","be","the","long","match","of","the","night","and","jake","do","a","repeat","of","hi","perform","when","he","be","leav","alon","against","four","man","and","domin","i","think","he","can","have","actual","pull","off","a","upset","thi","dai","the","match","would","have","end","the","other","wai","aroundbr","br","on","of","the","short","match","ever","be","conjur","on","of","it","much","surpris","possibli","the","much","underr","wrestler","ever","tito","santana","be","the","inspir","wrestler","of","the","night","putt","on","war","paint","and","pin","bori","zukhov","tanaka","and","even","the","warlord","in","the","final","surviv","match","it","be","so","strang","to","see","him","put","over","so","overwhelmingli","then","go","right","back","to","hi","mediocr","career","sgt","slaughter","conjur","do","good","get","rid","of","volkoff","and","the","bushwhack","but","that","just","be","not","a","surpris","tito","wasbr","br","i","think","the","onli","point","of","the","surviv","match","be","to","have","hogan","and","the","warrior","win","togeth","at","the","endbr","br","thi","show","be","bore","and","the","match","be","too","short","the","undertak","debut","be","cool","but","tito","santana","be","the","reason","i","will","rememb","thi","on"],"filtered":["thi","mar","potenti","great","match","cut","veri","shortbr","br","open","match","wast","legion","doom","guess","onli","wai","thei","elimin","demolit","doubledq","otherwis","mr","perfect","put","overtim","kerri","von","erich","ic","champ","wast","thi","ppv","row","perfect","job","rememb","befor","never","lose","matchbr","br","match","veri","good","possibli","well","night","ted","dibias","undertak","excel","jim","neidhart","hi","wwf","highlight","pin","honki","tonk","man","koko","b","ware","continu","hi","tradit","put","new","heel","rememb","big","bossman","yokozuna","thi","foreshadow","bret","hart","singl","career","come","back","twoonon","almost","surviv","match","dibias","put","wrestl","clinic","make","u","forget","point","match","dibias","bore","feud","dusti","rhodesbr","br","even","though","visionari","team","member","surviv","onli","sinc","four","survivor","thi","match","squash","thi","long","match","night","jake","repeat","hi","perform","leav","alon","four","man","domin","think","actual","pull","upset","thi","dai","match","end","wai","aroundbr","br","short","match","ever","conjur","much","surpris","possibli","much","underr","wrestler","ever","tito","santana","inspir","wrestler","night","putt","war","paint","pin","bori","zukhov","tanaka","even","warlord","final","surviv","match","strang","see","put","overwhelmingli","go","right","back","hi","mediocr","career","sgt","slaughter","conjur","good","get","rid","volkoff","bushwhack","surpris","tito","wasbr","br","think","onli","point","surviv","match","hogan","warrior","win","togeth","endbr","br","thi","show","bore","match","short","undertak","debut","cool","tito","santana","reason","rememb","thi"],"filtered2":["mar","potenti","great","match","cut","veri","shortbr","open","match","wast","legion","doom","guess","onli","wai","elimin","demolit","doubledq","otherwis","mr","perfect","put","overtim","kerri","von","erich","ic","champ","wast","ppv","row","perfect","job","rememb","befor","never","lose","matchbr","match","veri","good","possibli","well","night","ted","dibias","undertak","excel","jim","neidhart","wwf","highlight","pin","honki","tonk","man","koko","b","ware","continu","tradit","put","new","heel","rememb","big","bossman","yokozuna","foreshadow","bret","hart","singl","career","come","back","twoonon","almost","sur

{"value":"Violence whether real or not always has an impact. In this film the violence is about as crass as you could ask for. In the Great Ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of. But what was the point? The violence looks like a mix of Noë's 'Irreversible, and ' Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange'...both of which are remarkable films. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to screen violence at all and I've seen some nasty stuff in my film-going years, but this film as a whole is totally juvenile. The story is never developed enough to offer any reason for the extreme violence, the rizla paper thin reason we are give for Robert's demise is his introduction to drugs. Danny Dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for Robert's drug fuelled demise, however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes. Lesley Manville is Robert's unable to cope mum, I am not sure what either of these actors is doing in a film of this low caliber. The acting is wooden, the scene in the kitchen with the TV-cook and his wife for instance is as painful to watch if not more so than the shocking finale- who wrote those dialogues?! Some of the comments the boys make...'looks like she's enjoying it' are so trite as to tempt one to laugh if it were not for Clay's ardent desire to bombard us with harrowing images of mutilated female genitals. Why we need to be shown such detail possibly down to the director's adolescent obsession with sadistic pornographic imagery...one can only wonder at this young man's psychology.<br /><br />The 'political meaning' of the film was repeatedly brought to our attention due to the amount of scenes; in the bar, outside the TV-cook's house, war in Iraq reports, was perhaps too obvious in my opinion. Yes, war is violent, social determinism causes frustration, we're all prone to horrifingly violent acts whether you're in politics or on the street popping E. Juxtaposing all these things as part of the same underlying issue is evading the actual issue which is the meaning of violence in man. This issue is one that we still haven't managed to grasp and certainly not in this film.<br /><br />My opinion: derivative, badly-made and

{"value":"When Marlene Dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like The Garden Of Allah. How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.<br /><br />The Garden Of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with Mary Anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. It then got two silent screen adaptions. The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French Tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world. He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. She's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.<br /><br />The woman is of course Marlene and the runaway monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what was in David O. Selznick's mind in filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. But you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see Marlene as a modern day Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.<br /><br />As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink it's economics if Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man Charles Waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.<br /><br />Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. Most especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.","finished_norm":["when","marlen","dietrich","be","label","box","offic","poison","in","on","of","a","hand","of","actress","so","name","by","the","trade","paper","it","be","film","like","the","garden","of","allah","how","a","film","can","be","so","breathtakingli","beauti","to","behold","and","be","so","insipidli","dull","be","beyond","me","conjur","how","marlen","if","she","be","try","to","expand","her","rang","and","not","plai","a","sexpot","get","stick","with","such","a","old","fashion","stori","be","beyond","mebr","br","the","garden","of","allah","on","of","the","veri","film","in","modern","technicolor","be","a","novel","set","at","the","turn","of","the","last","centuri","by","robert","hitchen","who","then","collabor","on","a","plai","adapt","with","mari","anderson","that","run","for","perform","in","it","then","get","two","silent","screen","adapt","the","stori","be","about","a","monk","who","run","awai","from","the","monasteri","out","in","french","tunisia","to","see","some","of","what","he","miss","in","the","world","he","run","into","a","similarli","shelter","woman","who","be","unmarri","and","spend","her","prime","year","care","for","a","sick","parent","she","travel","now","in","the","desert","and","the","two","meet","on","a","trainbr","br","the","woman","be","of","cours","marlen","and","the","runawai","monk","be","charl","boyer","i","be","not","sure","what","be","in","david","o","selznick","mind","in","film","thi","stori","someon","like","ingrid","bergman","mai","have","make","it","palat","for","the","audienc","but","you","can","bet","that","the","moviego","public","of","when","thei","plunk","their","monei","down","for","a","ticket","thei","expect","to","see","marlen","a","a","modern","dai","salom","rather","than","a","saint","with","that","titl","the","public","still","rememb","rudolph","valentino","and","you","can","bet","that","it","be","some","desert","romanc","and","seduct","that","thei","be","expectingbr","br","a","for","the","monk","you","have","to","rememb","that","thei","be","self","support","in","their","monasteri","and","thi","particular","on","bottl","a","special","wine","of","which","boyer","happen","to","be","the","on","with","the","secret","the","monasteri","will","have","to","rethink","it","econom","if","boyer","leav","the","monk","be","a","sincer","piou","group","but","from","the","head","man","charl","waldron","on","down","thei","have","a","right","to","be","a","littl","concern","with","some","self","interestbr","br","anywai","a","whole","lot","of","religi","platitud","get","sai","here","by","a","pair","of","lead","that","realli","be","not","suit","for","the","part","much","especi","marlen","dietrich","i","would","watch","thi","film","with","a","ey","for","the","special","color","desert","cinematographi","and","forget","the","plot"],"filtered":["marlen","dietrich","label","box","offic","poison","hand","actress","name","trade","paper","film","like","garden","allah","film","breathtakingli","beauti","behold","insipidli","dull","beyond","conjur","marlen","try","expand","rang","plai","sexpot","get","stick","old","fashion","stori","beyond","mebr","br","garden","allah","veri","film","modern","technicolor","novel","set","turn","last","centuri","robert","hitchen","collabor","plai","adapt","mari","anderson","run","perform","get","two","silent","screen","adapt","stori","monk","run","awai","monasteri","french","tunisia","see","miss","world","run","similarli","shelter","woman","unmarri","spend","prime","year","care","sick","parent","travel","desert","two","meet","trainbr","br","woman","cours","marlen","runawai","monk","charl","boyer","sure","david","o","selznick","mind","film","thi","stori","someon","like","ingrid","bergman","mai","make","palat","audienc","bet","moviego","public","thei","plunk","monei","ticket","thei","expect","see","marlen","modern","dai","salom","rather","saint","titl","public","still","rememb","rudolph","valentino","bet","desert","romanc","seduct","thei","expectingbr","br","monk","rememb","thei","self","support","monasteri","thi","particular","bottl","special","wine","boyer","happen","secret","monasteri","rethink","econom","boyer","leav","monk","sincer","piou","group","head","man","charl","waldron","thei","right","littl","concern","self","interestbr","br","anywai","whole","lot","religi","platitud","get","sai","pair","lead","realli","suit","part","much","especi","marlen","dietrich","watch","thi","film","ey","special","color","desert","cinematographi","forget","plot"],"filtered2":["marlen","dietrich","label","box","offic","poison","hand","actress","name","trade","paper","like","garden","allah","breathtakingli","beauti","behold","insipidli","dull","beyond","conjur","marlen","try","expand","rang","plai","sexpot","get","stick","old","fashion","stori","beyond","mebr","garden","allah","veri","modern","technicolor","novel","set","turn","last","centuri","robert","hitchen","collabor","plai","adapt","mari","anderson","run","perform","get","two","silent","screen","adapt","stori","m

{"value":"Okay.. this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I had heard lots of good things about it and I was sorely disappointed. I could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren't a whole lot different from one another, that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting, etc, etc. (well, that's my presumption, anyway =^_^=)<br /><br />At any rate.. the movie kind of bored me. I've watched a lot of really long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on.. basically because I just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters. I just kept thinking.. who cares??? I also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained. I understand that this was the 1800s and all, but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events.<br /><br />The \"romance\" in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than \"I'm a guy and you're a girl\", which I don't consider much of a romance, and yet I felt I was being steered to the belief that these people were in love. Oh well.. I guess it's the whole \"all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to\" type thing, or whatever. I was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends (who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl) but that was just sort of dropped. Maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle. I don't know.<br /><br />Oh well.. Daniel Holt was about the only character I really truly liked. And Sue Lee was all right. I didn't exactly dislike Jake, but he seemed a bit too... spineless, I guess. Jack Bull I did not care for at all. And I'm pretty sure you're *supposed* to hate just about everyone else, with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right. It was pretty graphic and had that whole \"the horrors of war\" thing down, but I've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme, done better. (I enjoyed The Patriot a lot, for instance, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative) But, as I've already stated, I'm a cynic. What can I say?

{"value":"Here we are: two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth... one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life, another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race.<br /><br />So what could we call this killing machine? It's almost like he's some kind of destroyer, or eradicator... sort of like an exterminator or something. What's the word I'm looking for... something that -terminates- things? Hmmmm....<br /><br />Anyway, the protector (who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favour of local clothing) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future-born hero-to-be. The evil uhhhh... \"exterminator\" kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes, then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people's eyes and repeating her name threateningly.<br /><br />Then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable \"exterminator\" pursues the couple across the countryside. At some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Perhaps, in an exciting finale, he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of... acid. Then the truck will crash. They will be saved... but no! He will then re-emerge, as strong as ever. He will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant, where in a terrifying finish, he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery, and destroyed once and for all.<br /><br />But maybe I'm extrapolating too much... after all, I did stop watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnates Sean Young by kissing her at a bar, then tells her the child will be born in 3 days. <br /><br />The costumes and effects are great in this movie... I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation too! Sean Young does another great turn as an unemotive Replicant, and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend. Not sure where he fits into the plot though... maybe he's an import from a different James Cameron movie?","finished_norm":["here","we","be","two","travel","from","a","distant","futurist","world","arriv","on","earth","on","be","on","a","desper","mission","to","preserv","a","life","anoth","be","a","inhuman","kill","machin","determin","to","elimin","the","woman","who","will","give","birth","to","the","saviour","of","a","entir","racebr","br","so","what","can","we","call","thi","kill","machin","it","almost","like","he","some","kind","of","destroy","or","erad","sort","of","like","a","extermin","or","someth","what","the","word","i","be","look","for","someth","that","termin","thing","hmmmmbr","br","anywai","the","protector","who","swiftli","doff","the","white","tunic","he","steal","from","luke","skywalk","in","favour","of","local","cloth","find","the","young","woman","and","impregn","her","with","a","futureborn","herotob","the","evil","uhhhh","extermin","kill","some","redneck","and","steal","their","gun","and","cloth","then","attempt","to","locat","the","woman","by","visit","her","workplac","and","ask","around","by","look","menacingli","into","peopl","ey","and","repeat","her","name","threateninglybr","br","then","begin","a","desper","race","for","surviv","a","the","seemingli","deathless","and","unstopp","extermin","pursu","the","coupl","across","the","countrysid","at","some","point","he","mai","acquir","boot","and","a","motorcycl","but","i","be","not","surebr","br","perhap","in","a","excit","final","he","will","attempt","to","crush","them","under","the","wheel","of","a","enorm","tanker","truck","full","of","acid","then","the","truck","will","crash","thei","will","be","save","but","no","he","will","then","reemerg","a","strong","a","ever","he","will","kill","the","protector","and","pursu","the","girl","into","a","meat","pack","plant","where","in","a","terrifi","finish","he","be","push","into","a","larg","piec","of","industri","chop","machineri","and","destroi","onc","and","for","allbr","br","but","mayb","i","be","extrapol","too","much","after","all","i","do","stop","watch","thi","movi","after","mr","protector","magic","impregn","sean","young","by","kiss","her","at","a","bar","then","tell","her","the","child","will","be","bear","in","dai","br","br","the","costum","and","effect","be","great","in","thi","movi","i","love","them","the","time","i","see","them","on","star","trek","next","gener","too","sean","young","doe","anoth","great","turn","a","a","unemot","replic","and","career","sweathog","stephen","baldwin","be","conjur","on","board","a","young","fat","cop","boyfriend","not","sure","where","he","fit","into","the","plot","though","mayb","he","a","import","from","a","differ","jame","cameron","movi"],"filtered":["two","travel","distant","futurist","world","arriv","earth","desper","mission","preserv","life","anoth","inhuman","kill","machin","determin","elimin","woman","give","birth","saviour","entir","racebr","br","call","thi","kill","machin","almost","like","kind","destroy","erad","sort","like","extermin","someth","word","look","someth","termin","thing","hmmmmbr","br","anywai","protector","swiftli","doff","white","tunic","steal","luke","skywalk","favour","local","cloth","find","young","woman","impregn","futureborn","herotob","evil","uhhhh","extermin","kill","redneck","steal","gun","cloth","attempt","locat","woman","visit","workplac","ask","around","look","menacingli","peopl","ey","repeat","name","threateninglybr","br","begin","desper","race","surviv","seemingli","deathless","unstopp","extermin","pursu","coupl","across","countrysid","point","mai","acquir","boot","motorcycl","surebr","br","perhap","excit","final","attempt","crush","wheel","enorm","tanker","truck","full","acid","truck","crash","thei","save","reemerg","strong","ever","kill","protector","pursu","girl","meat","pack","plant","terrifi","finish","push","larg","piec","industri","chop","machineri","destroi","onc","allbr","br","mayb","extrapol","much","stop","watch","thi","movi","mr","protector","magic","impregn","sean","young","kiss","bar","tell","child","bear","dai","br","br","costum","effect","great","thi","movi","love","time","see","star","trek","next","gener","sean","young","doe","anoth","great","turn","unemot","replic","career","sweathog","stephen","baldwin","conjur","board","young","fat","cop","boyfriend","sure","fit","plot","though","mayb","import","differ","jame","cameron","movi"],"filtered2":["two","travel","distant","futurist","world","arriv","earth","desper","mission","preserv","life","anoth","inhuman","kill","machin","determin","elimin","woman","give","birth","saviour","entir","racebr","call","kill","machin","almost","like","kind","destroy","erad","sort","like","extermin","someth","word","look","someth","termin","thing","hmmmmbr","anywai","protector","swiftli","doff","white","tunic","steal","luke","skywalk","favour","local","cloth","find","young","woman","impregn","futureborn","herotob","evil","uhhhh","extermin","kill","redneck","steal","gun","cloth","attempt","locat","woman","visit","workplac","ask","around","look","menacingli","peopl","ey","repea

{"value":"Really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements.<br /><br />A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims \"Saul\" or Paul of Tarus (the writer of The Book of Hebrews He asserts) has no idea Jesus is or was a human being, this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting, or he is ignorant of what \"The Bible\" says.<br /><br />first we can examine his misleading claim about Hebrews 8.4; which he shows a quote \"If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest\", hence right here He sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise.. why? He does what most so called Bible believing people he accuses of doing, the same.. That is TAKING things out of context.<br /><br />verse one of Hebrews 8 is; 1..\"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens\" The context above is CLEARLY speaking of a Jesus who was on earth and ASCENDED into heaven after his alleged resurrection.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture. Here he offers a foundation, that \"Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in \"heaven\"<br /><br />follow?<br /><br />lets see if the filmmaker is being honest; Hebrews 7; 14. \"For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.\"<br /><br />heh, didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of Hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a \"Human Jesus\"? it's likely anyways Paul didn't write Hebrews, but I will not go into that here, but The film maker asserts Paul did, and that is the premise of the point given here.<br /><br />It is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on. Once he engages in these tactics, in my strong opinion, he loses credibility as the religion he picks out, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, and a bias of the film maker, nothing more, nothing

{"value":"Madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic, non-offensive, \"family-friendly\" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing. If, like me, you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., prepare to be disappointed.<br /><br />Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book. I needn't repeat what they've said. What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the \"glory years\" (which many would argue were already past in 1971).<br /><br />Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast, though it was clear that the restored versions (hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind-numbing roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, wound up to RPM's never imagined by their designers, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You didn't hear it, you FELT it. Real hydro buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There's none of that in Madison. Instead, every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a \"heroic\" musical score.<br /><br />And then there are the close-up shots of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero. Or, in one particularly ridiculous shot, taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a \"Rocky\" salute from a bridge pier. In reality, some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above 150 mph.<br /><br />As one reviewer so aptly put it, \"The sport deserves better than this.\"<br /><br />Finally, since another user brought up anachronisms, I'll add one: the establishing shot of Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco Field.

About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud, \"This movie is boring.\" About half way through I was saying to myself, \"Where have I seen this before?\" At the three quarters mark I had figured it out.<br /><br />In spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier (1969), and better, \"That Cold Day in the Park.\" Although the details obviously differ and Altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing \"new\" to be seen in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before: a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's \"Bad Lieutenant\" 1992); a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (David Cronenberg's \"M. Butterfly\" 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" 1986); and so on. Hence, I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be \"shocking,\" \"shattering,\" etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. However, I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. See enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. And while it is true that I saw the expurgated 'R-rated' version, I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of \"The Piano Teacher.\"<br /><br />Technically, the film is not without merit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. This is the first of Haneke's films that I've seen, and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara: an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be.

4/10.","finished_norm":["i","rent","the","video","of","the","piano","teacher","know","noth","about","it","other","than","what","be","write","on","the","video","box","i","do","thi","with","some","trepid","becaus","film","that","win","award","at","cann","be","usual","veri","good","or","veri","bad","unfortun","thi","on","fall","in","the","latter","categori","about","on","quarter","of","the","wai","into","it","i","find","myself","sai","out","loud","thi","movi","be","bore","about","half","wai","through","i","be","sai","to","myself","where","have","i","see","thi","befor","at","the","three","quarter","mark","i","have","figur","it","outbr","br","in","spite","of","it","literari","origin","thi","film","be","essenti","a","remak","of","robert","altman","much","earli","and","well","that","cold","dai","in","the","park","although","the","detail","obvious","differ","and","altman","work","be","much","plotdriven","and","littl","of","a","charact","studi","the","two","film","be","themat","ident","there","be","noth","new","to","be","see","in","thi","product","everi","aspect","of","it","have","be","do","befor","a","charact","spiral","out","of","control","with","increasingli","selfdestruct","behavior","abel","ferrara","bad","lieuten","a","pervers","and","doom","love","culmin","in","a","operat","near","death","scene","david","cronenberg","be","butterfli","uncommonli","brutal","sex","scene","david","lynch","blue","velvet","and","so","on","henc","i","be","bemus","by","the","fact","that","so","mani","find","the","film","to","be","shock","shatter","etc","thi","highli","deriv","film","seem","to","have","be","make","for","the","sole","purpos","of","make","viewer","feel","uncomfort","and","clearli","succ","with","some","howev","i","larg","attribut","such","a","reaction","to","a","lack","of","filmview","experi","see","enough","movi","and","you","realli","will","eventu","have","see","it","all","and","while","it","be","true","that","i","see","the","expurg","rrate","version","i","doubt","that","the","addit","scene","would","chang","my","overal","opinion","of","the","piano","teacherbr","br","technic","the","film","be","not","without","merit","there","be","some","veri","good","camera","work","and","the","light","be","excel","isabel","huppert","credit","perform","conjur","help","save","it","from","be","a","wast","of","time","thi","be","the","of","hanek","film","that","i","have","see","and","if","i","be","to","see","much","i","expect","i","would","have","the","same","opinion","of","him","that","i","have","of","ferrara","a","interest","director","but","not","nearli","the","geniu","other","make","him","out","to","be","rate"],"filtered":["rent","video","piano","teacher","know","noth","write","video","box","thi","trepid","becaus","film","win","award","cann","usual","veri","good","veri","bad","unfortun","thi","fall","latter","categori","quarter","wai","find","sai","loud","thi","movi","bore","half","wai","sai","see","thi","befor","three","quarter","mark","figur","outbr","br","spite","literari","origin","thi","film","essenti","remak","robert","altman","much","earli","well","cold","dai","park","although","detail","obvious","differ","altman","work","much","plotdriven","littl","charact","studi","two","film","themat","ident","noth","new","see","thi","product","everi","aspect","befor","charact","spiral","control","increasingli","selfdestruct","behavior","abel","ferrara","bad","lieuten","pervers","doom","love","culmin","operat","near","death","scene","david","cronenberg","butterfli","uncommonli","brutal","sex","scene","david","lynch","blue","velvet","henc","bemus","fact","mani","find","film","shock","shatter","etc","thi","highli","deriv","film","seem","make","sole","purpos","make","viewer","feel","uncomfort","clearli","succ","howev","larg","attribut","reaction","lack","filmview","experi","see","enough","movi","realli","eventu","see","true","see","expurg","rrate","version","doubt","addit","scene","chang","overal","opinion","piano","teacherbr","br","technic","film","without","merit","veri","good","camera","work","light","excel","isabel","huppert","credit","perform","conjur","help","save","wast","time","thi","hanek","film","see","see","much","expect","opinion","ferrara","interest","director","nearli","geniu","make","rate"],"filtered2":["rent","video","piano","teacher","know","noth","write","video","box","trepid","becaus","win","award","cann","usual","veri","good","veri","bad","unfortun","fall","latter","categori","quarter","wai","find","loud","bore","half","wai","see","befor","three","quarter","mark","figur","outbr","spite","literari","origin","essenti","remak","robert","altman","earli","well","cold","dai","park","although","detail","obvious","differ","altman","work","plotdriven","littl","charact","studi","two","themat","ident","noth","new","see","product","everi","aspect","befor","charact","spiral","control","increasingli","selfdestruct","behavior","abel","ferrara","bad","lieuten","pervers","doom","love","culmin","operat","near","death","scene","david","cronen

I have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premise.<br /><br />We have a character who is unlikable. He's full of flaws, not enlightened, and a complete jerk on a good day. Yet the reason why anybody should care just isn't there. While creating an American sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential, it just isn't met here within this show. Most of the supporting characters aren't fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags. As in any sitcom, they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to, and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see Bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there because....why? There is no reason. Any normal people would have simply left the abuse. Keeping them there without any real reason--even the really unbelievable one given by Joanna Cassidy in the very special 2-part abortion episode that has major problems of its own--is where the show just falls apart. To simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation. If anything, this isn't even dramedy. This is a badly plotted, conceived, and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved. Someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea, but the execution is so haphazard that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the Jerry Springer show where someone is abused by this tyrant that we're supposed to root for because we are told to. A show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily, but somehow aren't able to. And that's a fatal error that really killed the program.<br /><br />Chalk it up to a show in its infancy. Regardless, the show is worth a watch. But it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars, and made the whole enterprise not what it could have

{"value":"I've been working my way through a collection of Lugosi films recently, and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of Lugosi and Boris Karloff in \"The Black Cat\" I was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in \"The Raven.\" Alas, it just didn't work for me, and by the end of the film I was quite disappointed.<br /><br />For the first three quarters of this movie or so I thought the story lacked any real suspense. Lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad Dr. Vollins, some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman (Irene Ware) he treats after a car accident but who can't have her - partly because she's already engaged, and partly because her father (Samuel S. Hinds) disapproves. To deal with that situation, he enlists the aid of Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff) - a horribly ugly man who wants Vollins to make him look more acceptable. Aside from Lugosi's performance, though, I found little to hold my interest. Then, suddenly, in the last fifteen or twenty minutes, the movie shifts around completely. Suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful, but I thought Lugosi's performance fell apart, largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane - and there's a difference. He plays the \"mad\" role very well - controlled and in control but evil. \"Insane\" is a more out of control evil, and I didn't think Lugosi pulled that off well. At one point, he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake. In the meantime, Karloff was a huge disappointment. He never grabbed me at all. As an aside, it must have grated on Lugosi that - in movies in which they co-star - Karloff gets the top billing, even though in \"The Raven\" it's clearly Lugosi who is the lead actor. This surely gives a hint as to how Universal ranked their two great horror stars - inexplicably, I would add, because I've always thought of Lugosi as the better actor of the two.<br /><br />In any event, there's no real connection here to Edgar Allen Poe's story \"The Raven\" - except that Vollins is a Poe fanatic, who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from Poe's stories. Overall, a disappointment.

{"value":"An unoriginal, overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci-fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something, and in of all places (surprise, surprise) Antarctica!<br /><br />The film features James Spader and an almost nameless supporting cast (with the exception of Carl Lewis, who's actually not that bad for a non-actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances that do little to invigorate the script's unimaginative dialogue. To make things worse the film's pace is slow, there's almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting. Its little wonder that this thing went straight to DVD. What is a wonder is why Spader - an excellent actor at times, who won the Cannes Best Actor award for `Sex, Lies and Videotape', and did a splendid job in the innovative sci-fi flick `Stargate' - chose to sign onto this lackluster project. Or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.<br /><br />The most remarkable thing about `Alien Hunter' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci-fi films, and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived. There are huge borrowed bits from `The Thing' (both Howard Hawks' original and John Carpenter's excellent 1982 remake), `Contact' and `Outbreak'; a few hints of `Alien', CE3K', `The Andromeda Strain', `Kubrick's `2001' (i.e. the `alien black box') and `Mission To Mars' (i.e. the mystery message); and even a little dash of `Sneakers' and `A Remarkable Mind' (although not sci-fi films, they share a `cryptology' connection). Hell, there's even cornfields and Antarctica, just like the recent `X Files Movie'. And the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from `The Abyss'.<br /><br />Its all been done before and done a whole lot better, although I will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end. I could say a little bit more about the plot, but there's absolutely no need. You already know over half this movie without ever seeing it.

{"value":"I wasn't really fond of the first \"Cube\" movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much. Didn't really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well I thought wrong.<br /><br />\"Cube Zero\" starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never-ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the Cube. The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine. Several questions are created from it, concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation. All of which are left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie's first half moved relatively well.<br /><br />With the story moving on, one of the two \"watchers\" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped. Here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese.<br /><br />Sent by the people who run the Cube program we are introduced to the character \"Jax\". Along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure. To start of \"Jax\" looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever \"popular\" glass eye, that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half's relatively nice pace. Whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. With some incredibly corny lines, perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn't care. The acting itself degrades to a further low when the former \"watcher\" meets the group in the Cube. The entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it.<br /><br />Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters, dialog and acting \"Cube Zero\" is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","realli","fond","of","the","cube","movi","it","be","a","good","idea","but","the","annoi","act","and","charact","alwai","keep","me","from","like","it","too","much","do","not","realli","feel","the","ne","to","see","it","sequel","but","when","i","hear","thei","be","make","a","movi","that","would","act","a","much","of","a","prequel","to","the","origin","i","be","intrigu","think","that","mayb","thei","would","fix","some","of","the","origin","problem","and","provid","u","with","a","memor","cast","of","charact","good","i","think","wrongbr","br","cube","zero","start","good","enough","by","introduc","u","with","the","two","charact","in","charg","of","watch","and","maintain","the","neverend","maze","of","trap","that","plagu","the","peopl","in","the","cube","the","filmmak","succ","in","provid","a","sens","of","mysteri","with","the","establish","of","the","two","man","daili","routin","sever","question","be","creat","from","it","concern","the","reason","why","peopl","be","send","there","and","conjur","the","true","natur","of","the","on","who","run","the","entir","oper","all","of","which","be","leav","entir","to","the","viewer","the","act","be","a","bite","weak","but","all","in","all","the","movi","half","move","rel","wellbr","br","with","the","stori","move","on","on","of","the","two","watcher","begin","to","develop","seriou","doubt","about","what","he","be","do","and","late","decid","to","go","and","help","a","group","of","the","peopl","trap","here","be","where","everyth","rapidli","start","to","dissolv","into","dull","cheesebr","br","send","by","the","peopl","who","run","the","cube","program","we","be","introduc","to","the","charact","jax","along","with","hi","two","underl","plai","a","major","reason","a","to","why","thi","movi","be","failur","to","start","of","jax","look","and","talk","much","like","a","rate","villain","take","directli","from","a","jame","bond","movi","complet","with","the","ever","popular","glass","ey","that","alon","ruin","ani","atmospher","creat","by","the","half","rel","nice","pace","what","much","be","that","it","begin","to","feel","much","like","a","comedi","rather","than","a","seriou","movi","with","some","incredibli","corni","line","perhap","the","screenwrit","get","bore","and","do","not","care","the","act","itself","degrad","to","a","far","low","when","the","former","watcher","meet","the","group","in","the","cube","the","entir","interact","be","pain","to","watch","a","be","everyth","els","follow","itbr","br","again","fail","to","impress","on","anyth","but","weak","charact","dialog","and","act","cube","zero","be","a","wast","of","time","for","that","search","for","a","good","horror","movi"],"filtered":["realli","fond","cube","movi","good","idea","annoi","act","charact","alwai","keep","like","much","realli","feel","ne","see","sequel","hear","thei","make","movi","act","much","prequel","origin","intrigu","think","mayb","thei","fix","origin","problem","provid","u","memor","cast","charact","good","think","wrongbr","br","cube","zero","start","good","enough","introduc","u","two","charact","charg","watch","maintain","neverend","maze","trap","plagu","peopl","cube","filmmak","succ","provid","sens","mysteri","establish","two","man","daili","routin","sever","question","creat","concern","reason","peopl","send","conjur","true","natur","run","entir","oper","leav","entir","viewer","act","bite","weak","movi","half","move","rel","wellbr","br","stori","move","two","watcher","begin","develop","seriou","doubt","late","decid","go","help","group","peopl","trap","everyth","rapidli","start","dissolv","dull","cheesebr","br","send","peopl","run","cube","program","introduc","charact","jax","along","hi","two","underl","plai","major","reason","thi","movi","failur","start","jax","look","talk","much","like","rate","villain","take","directli","jame","bond","movi","complet","ever","popular","glass","ey","alon","ruin","ani","atmospher","creat","half","rel","nice","pace","much","begin","feel","much","like","comedi","rather","seriou","movi","incredibli","corni","line","perhap","screenwrit","get","bore","care","act","degrad","far","low","former","watcher","meet","group","cube","entir","interact","pain","watch","everyth","els","follow","itbr","br","fail","impress","anyth","weak","charact","dialog","act","cube","zero","wast","time","search","good","horror","movi"],"filtered2":["realli","fond","cube","good","idea","annoi","act","charact","alwai","keep","like","realli","feel","ne","see","sequel","hear","make","act","prequel","origin","intrigu","think","mayb","fix","origin","problem","provid","u","memor","cast","charact","good","think","wrongbr","cube","zero","start","good","enough","introduc","u","two","charact","charg","watch","maintain","neverend","maze","trap","plagu","peopl","cube","filmmak","succ","provid","sens","mysteri","establish","two","man","daili","routin","sever","question","creat","concern","reason","peopl","send","conjur","true","natur","run","entir","oper","leav","entir","viewer"

But with \"Les amours d'Astrée et de Céladon\", it's as if Rohmer himself wanted, for what may be his last movie, to perpetuate this tradition of great directors, who made a last senile movie, by adapting Urfé's \"L'astrée\", with ridiculous aesthetic codes, witch just look like a parody of Rosselini's last movies (the ones he made for TV from Descartes or Marx's lives).<br /><br />In his version of \"Perceval\", Rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re-transcription of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things. The director apparently changed his mind when the XVII century is involved, and films actors, dressed like 1600's peasants reciting their antic text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes. But the all thing looks even more ridiculous than Luchini and its fake trees. It's not that the story itself is stupid, but the way Rohmer mixes naturalism with artifices seems so childish and amateurism that it rapidly becomes involuntarily funny (and I'm not even talking about the irritating pronunciation of the actors, the annoying and sad humorist tries by Rodolphe Pauly, the ridiculous soft-erotic tone, the poor musical tentatives, or the strange fascination for trasvestisment!).<br /><br />The radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke, which mixes a soft-erotic movie made for TV with theological scholastic discussions (sic !). At the beginning of the movie, Rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now disfigured by modernity, and that's why he had to film \"L'Astrée\" in other parts of the country. However, I'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting, if Rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative codes and artistically decisions. This film may interest a few historians, but most of the cinephiles may laugh at this last and sad Rohmer's

{"value":"When robot hordes start attacking major cities, who will stop the madman behind the attacks? Sky Captain!!! Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan, the ace of the skyways, tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex-girlfriend Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and former flight partner, Captain Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie).<br /><br />Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming. The film's running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie. The visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that. However, there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals. The film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary. I blame director and writer Kerry Conran. He focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story. The movie is like a girl with no personality, after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring. Sky Captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality. It's simply just another case of style over substance.<br /><br />The acting is surprisingly average and that's not really their fault since they had very little to work with. The main reason I watched this movie is because of Angelina Jolie. However, the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes. Her performance is surprisingly bland as well. Jude Law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him. Gwyneth Paltrow was just average, nothing special at all. Ling Bai's performance was the only one I really liked. She gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film.<br /><br />The movie is not a complete bust though. There were some \"wow\" and exciting scenes. There just weren't enough of them. The film just doesn't have that hook to really make it memorable. It was actually quite bland and it wasn't very engaging at all. It's too bad the film wasn't very good since it had such a promising premise. In the end, Sky Captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching.

{"value":"It's interesting that all who (so far) seemed to like this film had no expectations--I guess that's the trick. In contrast with them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close to the faces the camera always was, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them, they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. The actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. <br /><br />If the close camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the film killed it. The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. So now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur, as well. \"Ooh ooh, we're going to light the set with a flashlight! That will make it all seem intimate!\" No, that made it all seem invisible.<br /><br />On top of the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated. (Perhaps this is a new kind of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it.)<br /><br />The fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film, but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where I saw it. In fact, two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's \"total darkness\" technique). But when the film shuddered on, instead, there were moans coming from the audience. And once the movie finally DID end, it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points. An earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yeah, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning.<br /><br />I recommend that audiences miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer

{"value":"The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of. The Godfather Part II shows that young man's acceptance of his new role, his desensitization of character, as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime. The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history.<br /><br />Then, along came The Godfather Part III. Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family. He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors, but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others. Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone. Michael's plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies. Michael's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in: protecting his family.<br /><br />The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows: having his own brother killed. Before Part III was made, the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him: family loyalty. Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance. This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.<br /><br />The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made. The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed.","finished_norm":["the","godfath","part","i","be","a","stun","look","insid","the","fiction","corleon","famili","and","how","a","innoc","young","man","be","all","but","forc","into","circumst","he","never","want","to","have","a","part","of","the","godfath","part","ii","show","that","young","man","accept","of","hi","new","role","hi","desensit","of","charact","a","good","a","hi","complet","loss","of","all","innoc","a","he","dive","deep","and","deep","into","a","life","of","crime","the","two","part","of","thi","saga","of","thi","transform","of","michael","corleon","make","for","on","of","the","great","tragedi","in","cinemat","historybr","br","then","along","come","the","godfath","part","iii","michael","corleon","be","now","the","ag","don","of","the","corleon","famili","he","show","remors","for","hi","previou","action","not","through","subtl","behavior","but","by","try","to","us","hi","power","for","good","and","admit","all","hi","wrongdo","and","regret","to","other","veri","clich","and","uncharacterist","of","the","complex","charact","that","be","michael","corleon","michael","plan","to","us","hi","power","for","good","be","derail","by","a","ambiti","young","discipl","and","hi","enemi","michael","daughter","be","eventu","a","casualti","of","the","ongo","mob","war","and","her","death","predict","lead","to","michael","realiz","that","hi","entir","life","a","don","have","be","worthless","for","he","have","fail","in","the","on","thing","that","be","the","reason","for","putt","himself","into","the","posit","he","be","in","protect","hi","familybr","br","the","godfath","part","ii","end","with","michael","corleon","reach","the","low","of","the","low","have","hi","own","brother","kill","befor","part","iii","be","make","the","godfath","saga","be","a","emotion","rivet","tale","of","a","innoc","young","man","journei","into","dark","with","the","unbeliev","tragic","end","of","michael","forget","hi","root","and","abandon","the","on","thing","that","have","alwai","matter","much","to","him","and","that","around","him","famili","loyalti","part","iii","paint","the","pictur","of","michael","a","a","man","who","be","and","alwai","have","be","just","a","victim","of","circumst","thi","greatli","corrupt","the","mean","of","the","two","filmsbr","br","the","godfath","part","iii","be","a","horribl","mess","of","a","film","that","never","should","have","be","make","the","onli","solut","to","the","problem","that","be","thi","final","instal","of","the","godfath","movi","be","to","pretend","that","it","doe","not","exist","and","that","the","saga","actual","end","with","michael","shockingli","horribl","act","of","have","a","member","of","hi","own","famili","kill"],"filtered":["godfath","part","stun","look","insid","fiction","corleon","famili","innoc","young","man","forc","circumst","never","want","part","godfath","part","ii","show","young","man","accept","hi","new","role","hi","desensit","charact","good","hi","complet","loss","innoc","dive","deep","deep","life","crime","two","part","thi","saga","thi","transform","michael","corleon","make","great","tragedi","cinemat","historybr","br","along","come","godfath","part","iii","michael","corleon","ag","corleon","famili","show","remors","hi","previou","action","subtl","behavior","try","us","hi","power","good","admit","hi","wrongdo","regret","veri","clich","uncharacterist","complex","charact","michael","corleon","michael","plan","us","hi","power","good","derail","ambiti","young","discipl","hi","enemi","michael","daughter","eventu","casualti","ongo","mob","war","death","predict","lead","michael","realiz","hi","entir","life","worthless","fail","thing","reason","putt","posit","protect","hi","familybr","br","godfath","part","ii","end","michael","corleon","reach","low","low","hi","brother","kill","befor","part","iii","make","godfath","saga","emotion","rivet","tale","innoc","young","man","journei","dark","unbeliev","tragic","end","michael","forget","hi","root","abandon","thing","alwai","matter","much","around","famili","loyalti","part","iii","paint","pictur","michael","man","alwai","victim","circumst","thi","greatli","corrupt","mean","two","filmsbr","br","godfath","part","iii","horribl","mess","film","never","make","onli","solut","problem","thi","final","instal","godfath","movi","pretend","doe","exist","saga","actual","end","michael","shockingli","horribl","act","member","hi","famili","kill"],"filtered2":["godfath","part","stun","look","insid","fiction","corleon","famili","innoc","young","man","forc","circumst","never","want","part","godfath","part","ii","show","young","man","accept","new","role","desensit","charact","good","complet","loss","innoc","dive","deep","deep","life","crime","two","part","saga","transform","michael","corleon","make","great","tragedi","cinemat","historybr","along","come","godfath","part","iii","michael","corleon","ag","corleon","famili","show","remors","previou","action","subtl","behavior","try","us","power","good","admit","wrongdo","regret","veri","clich","uncharacterist","c

{"value":"What's to like about this movie???<br /><br />It is in colour! <br /><br />It has some impressive underwater photography! <br /><br />It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /><br />So 3 out of 10! <br /><br />Sometimes the music is speeded up! Especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in! <br /><br />Sometimes it is slowed! As if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy! <br /><br />As another one bites the dust! As if in a \"spagetti Western\" this has much similarity to! <br /><br />It's not that the Italians can't produce quality productions! There was a series of TV movies with a heading like \"Octopus\" numbered about 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts! And they were excellent! But alas, you won't find it here!!!<br /><br />I assumed it was made about 1960s! Sadly it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /><br />Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters! <br /><br />Amidst it all, either in bar-room brawl or in observing the latest sea-side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark, the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern, as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development! <br /><br />At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly, for his ex-wife! <br /><br />But of course, even if the music fails to awaken our realisation, we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices, as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge! <br /><br />And near the end, someone thought of a twist! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable! But stay tuned, folks, for you may find another twist! If you are watching closely!

{"value":"Wow. Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately, but this one especially is begging for a beatdown. Let's start at the beginning. First, writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role, complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence. Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite. Montford's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable.<br /><br />When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night, Della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year. She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield. The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall. When she finally gets to her car, the thugs confront her about the note, a cop is killed, and she runs, and they catch up to her, and she gets away, and they chase her some more, and on and on. Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving. The thugs are not scary or menacing at all, and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways.<br /><br />This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine. Why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me. And once, just once, in a film like this, does the leader of the pack have to die last? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming \"Della!!!\" And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.<br /><br />The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della, exhausted and hurt, cries out to the heavens, \"Where are you, God?\" Where, indeed, was god when this movie was being made? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting, and it's not as bad as 'BTK Killer,' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film.

{"value":"This is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back, and then some, like the time you spent accidentally picking it out, the time you spent getting to the video store, etc.<br /><br />First off, the look: It's grainy, it's low budget. Now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so that's kind of distracting.<br /><br />Then, the story. 3 gals go on a gal's weekend away from guys. Of course, as EVERYONE does when going on a camping trip, they stop on the way to get earrings. When they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay, they get pulled over by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season, and then drives them where they're going (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 \"cute guys\" wander into their vicinity, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately smitten, but apparently Bambi is smitten by anything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh**-faced and stoned with her gal-pals.<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot, there's a mean old hermit that lives up that way, that's perhaps someone to not tangle with, and the area & cabin in which they're staying have a sort of \"reputation\".<br /><br />So of course, sooner or later (unfortunately, MUCH later) some of our weekend wood-visitors begin to die, and find various booby traps (although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that) and of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset. No cell phone reception of course (who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore?). Mr. Ranger Sir keeps popping up at odd times & his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get help.<br /><br />There's a fantastic twist to this that you just won't want to miss too, if you're still awake. Pray that you wake up to a blank screen.<br /><br />The acting in this is terrible, the production values are terrible, and the whole undertaking is just lame & I find it amazing this was even released. Avoid at all costs, 1 out of 10.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","that","film","that","make","you","want","the","time","you","spend","watch","it","back","and","then","some","like","the","time","you","spend","accident","pick","it","out","the","time","you","spend","get","to","the","video","store","etcbr","br","off","the","look","it","graini","it","low","budget","now","that","in","itself","doe","not","make","for","a","bad","film","but","the","wai","it","be","film","make","the","action","look","unnatur","so","that","kind","of","distractingbr","br","then","the","stori","gal","go","on","a","gal","weekend","awai","from","gui","of","cours","a","everyon","doe","when","go","on","a","camp","trip","thei","stop","on","the","wai","to","get","ear","when","thei","arriv","at","the","area","in","which","thei","re","go","to","stai","thei","get","pull","over","by","mr","ranger","sir","who","scold","them","for","throw","a","light","cigarett","out","of","the","car","at","fire","season","and","then","drive","them","where","thei","re","go","a","remot","cabin","of","cours","cute","gui","wander","into","their","vicin","and","bambi","ye","bambi","and","aubri","be","immedi","smite","but","appar","bambi","be","smite","by","anyth","with","two","leg","madi","be","rather","disappoint","by","thi","develop","becaus","she","be","look","forward","to","a","weekend","of","forget","about","her","ex","by","get","shface","and","stone","with","her","galpalsbr","br","oh","and","i","almost","forget","there","a","mean","old","hermit","that","live","up","that","wai","that","perhap","someon","to","not","tangl","with","and","the","area","cabin","in","which","thei","re","stai","have","a","sort","of","reputationbr","br","so","of","cours","soon","or","late","unfortun","much","late","some","of","our","weekend","woodvisitor","begin","to","die","and","find","variou","boobi","trap","although","a","coupl","of","them","actual","hit","a","littl","low","than","that","and","of","cours","the","remain","camper","be","understand","upset","no","cell","phone","recept","of","cours","who","would","miss","out","on","a","chanc","to","check","their","cell","phone","for","recept","in","a","movi","anymor","mr","ranger","sir","keep","pop","up","at","odd","time","hi","behavior","seem","a","bite","odd","but","he","have","sai","he","will","get","helpbr","br","there","a","fantast","twist","to","thi","that","you","just","wo","not","want","to","miss","too","if","you","re","still","awak","prai","that","you","wake","up","to","a","blank","screenbr","br","the","act","in","thi","be","terribl","the","product","valu","be","terribl","and","the","whole","undertak","be","just","lame","i","find","it","amaz","thi","be","even","releas","avoid","at","all","cost","out","of"],"filtered":["thi","film","make","want","time","spend","watch","back","like","time","spend","accident","pick","time","spend","get","video","store","etcbr","br","look","graini","low","budget","doe","make","bad","film","wai","film","make","action","look","unnatur","kind","distractingbr","br","stori","gal","go","gal","weekend","awai","gui","cours","everyon","doe","go","camp","trip","thei","stop","wai","get","ear","thei","arriv","area","thei","re","go","stai","thei","get","pull","mr","ranger","sir","scold","throw","light","cigarett","car","fire","season","drive","thei","re","go","remot","cabin","cours","cute","gui","wander","vicin","bambi","ye","bambi","aubri","immedi","smite","appar","bambi","smite","anyth","two","leg","madi","rather","disappoint","thi","develop","becaus","look","forward","weekend","forget","ex","get","shface","stone","galpalsbr","br","oh","almost","forget","mean","old","hermit","live","wai","perhap","someon","tangl","area","cabin","thei","re","stai","sort","reputationbr","br","cours","soon","late","unfortun","much","late","weekend","woodvisitor","begin","die","find","variou","boobi","trap","although","coupl","actual","hit","littl","low","cours","remain","camper","understand","upset","cell","phone","recept","cours","miss","chanc","check","cell","phone","recept","movi","anymor","mr","ranger","sir","keep","pop","odd","time","hi","behavior","seem","bite","odd","sai","get","helpbr","br","fantast","twist","thi","wo","want","miss","re","still","awak","prai","wake","blank","screenbr","br","act","thi","terribl","product","valu","terribl","whole","undertak","lame","find","amaz","thi","even","releas","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["make","want","time","spend","watch","back","like","time","spend","accident","pick","time","spend","get","video","store","etcbr","look","graini","low","budget","doe","make","bad","wai","make","action","look","unnatur","kind","distractingbr","stori","gal","go","gal","weekend","awai","gui","cours","everyon","doe","go","camp","trip","stop","wai","get","ear","arriv","area","re","go","stai","get","pull","mr","ranger","sir","scold","throw","light","cigarett","car","fire","season","drive","re","go","remot","cabin","cours","cute","gui","wander","vicin","bambi","ye","bambi","aubri","immedi","smite","appar","bambi","smite","anyth","

{"value":"As you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that I don't like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people are going to say, \" How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever watched it?\", I did watch this show a couple times because I am studying film and animation and this just doesn't hold a candle to my standards.<br /><br />I want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things I have ever seen. Like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation. I thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.<br /><br />So that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show. It tries way too hard to be like Dexter's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female. There is a talking dog(why?), and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat. I have others but I don't think I can write them here ( I don't mean cursing but I mean I don't know if there is a limit for words.). Everything else though is spot on, even a DeeDee character Johnny himself. It just tries so hard to be Dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.<br /><br />Lastly I want to talk about the jokes. Remember in Dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling? Yes, yelling can be good for a joke or two but Dexter's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke. Johnny Test just forgets all that and just yells 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears. That isn't comedy, thats stupid comedy (I know what some people are thinking. Isn't three stooges stupid comedy? Watch that and Johnny Test back to back and you laugh more at the first option.). Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which, like Chowder, makes me mad. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: To much bizarre doesn't equal comedy, it makes you just think \"what am I watching?\".<br /><br />So it strikes out on all accounts. Don't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway, shape, or form.","finished_norm":["a","you","can","guess","by","my","rate","and","my","titl","of","thi","review","that","i","do","not","like","johnni","test","now","i","think","i","know","what","peopl","be","go","to","sai","how","do","you","know","how","bad","it","be","have","you","ever","watch","it","i","do","watch","thi","show","a","coupl","time","becaus","i","be","studi","film","and","anim","and","thi","just","doe","not","hold","a","candl","to","my","standardsbr","br","i","want","to","talk","about","the","anim","becaus","it","be","on","of","the","much","confus","thing","i","have","ever","see","like","the","two","season","or","onli","season","have","hand","draw","anim","i","think","it","be","a","nice","show","to","look","at","when","it","be","hand","draw","but","then","it","switch","to","flash","anim","and","the","qualiti","go","down","by","a","huge","amountbr","br","so","that","be","on","strike","in","my","ey","but","let","look","at","the","stori","of","the","show","it","try","wai","too","hard","to","be","like","dexter","lab","but","there","be","differ","becaus","instead","of","on","red","head","scientist","there","be","two","and","thei","be","both","femal","there","be","a","talk","dogwhi","and","the","parent","attitud","be","switch","somewhat","i","have","other","but","i","do","not","think","i","can","write","them","here","i","do","not","mean","curs","but","i","mean","i","do","not","know","if","there","be","a","limit","for","word","everyth","els","though","be","spot","on","even","a","deede","charact","johnni","himself","it","just","try","so","hard","to","be","dexter","but","it","just","seem","to","me","like","a","heartless","knockoffbr","br","lastli","i","want","to","talk","about","the","joke","rememb","in","dexter","lab","some","of","the","joke","involv","yell","ye","yell","can","be","good","for","a","joke","or","two","but","dexter","lab","conjur","have","sly","remark","that","make","me","have","to","go","back","and","check","to","get","the","joke","johnni","test","just","forget","all","that","and","just","yell","of","the","time","and","stop","the","music","whenev","a","stupid","joke","or","on","liner","appear","that","be","not","comedi","that","stupid","comedi","i","know","what","some","peopl","be","think","be","not","three","stoog","stupid","comedi","watch","that","and","johnni","test","back","to","back","and","you","laugh","much","at","the","option","sometim","the","joke","be","base","on","bizarr","situat","which","like","chowder","make","me","mad","i","have","a","rule","for","cartoon","and","comedi","all","togeth","to","much","bizarr","doe","not","equal","comedi","it","make","you","just","think","what","be","i","watchingbr","br","so","it","strike","out","on","all","account","do","not","watch","thi","show","if","you","have","ani","respect","for","comedi","in","anywai","shape","or","form"],"filtered":["guess","rate","titl","thi","review","like","johnni","test","think","know","peopl","go","sai","know","bad","ever","watch","watch","thi","show","coupl","time","becaus","studi","film","anim","thi","doe","hold","candl","standardsbr","br","want","talk","anim","becaus","much","confus","thing","ever","see","like","two","season","onli","season","hand","draw","anim","think","nice","show","look","hand","draw","switch","flash","anim","qualiti","go","huge","amountbr","br","strike","ey","let","look","stori","show","try","wai","hard","like","dexter","lab","differ","becaus","instead","red","head","scientist","two","thei","femal","talk","dogwhi","parent","attitud","switch","somewhat","think","write","mean","curs","mean","know","limit","word","everyth","els","though","spot","even","deede","charact","johnni","try","hard","dexter","seem","like","heartless","knockoffbr","br","lastli","want","talk","joke","rememb","dexter","lab","joke","involv","yell","ye","yell","good","joke","two","dexter","lab","conjur","sly","remark","make","go","back","check","get","joke","johnni","test","forget","yell","time","stop","music","whenev","stupid","joke","liner","appear","comedi","stupid","comedi","know","peopl","think","three","stoog","stupid","comedi","watch","johnni","test","back","back","laugh","much","option","sometim","joke","base","bizarr","situat","like","chowder","make","mad","rule","cartoon","comedi","togeth","much","bizarr","doe","equal","comedi","make","think","watchingbr","br","strike","account","watch","thi","show","ani","respect","comedi","anywai","shape","form"],"filtered2":["guess","rate","titl","review","like","johnni","test","think","know","peopl","go","know","bad","ever","watch","watch","show","coupl","time","becaus","studi","anim","doe","hold","candl","standardsbr","want","talk","anim","becaus","confus","thing","ever","see","like","two","season","onli","season","hand","draw","anim","think","nice","show","look","hand","draw","switch","flash","anim","qualiti","go","huge","amountbr","strike","ey","let","look","stori","show","try","wai","hard","like","dexter","lab","differ","becaus","instead","red","head","scientist","two","femal","

{"value":"Film critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see \"The Cat in the Hat\" wasn't made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the \"calamity\" known as \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\". Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. So when the critics unleashed their fury against \"The Cat in the Hat\", another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role, I thought that it must be the same old song. How wrong I was.<br /><br />For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear. The opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. Then the cat showed up. There are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers. Where \"The Grinch\" was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey, \"The Cat\" was destroyed by Myers. He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. Every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from \"Wayne's World\" to \"Austin Powers\". So he tries to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL, not funny, just painful. Not that the writers helped him out any. After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had. Period. So much talent and work went into something so vile. I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies. If you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague. With movies like \"Elf\" and \"Brother Bear\" currently in theaters, you have far better

{"value":"In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. However, I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan. He organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from. Anyway, De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. It's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. Brilliant! To his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. They want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. By a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. He uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. I reckon this film was a missed opportunity. To address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. How come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. De Sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. Surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.<br /><br

{"value":"Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days. I can be wrong. This is like watching one of his home movies. He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry. This is hardly a \"movie\"! Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is \"no-budget\" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie). So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters. There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line \"Take my wife, please\" and the audience is on the floor? I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here. Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in \"Billy Madison,\" the midget in \"Happy Gilmore's\" Happy Place) but the comedy works. This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in \"Mixed Nuts.\" Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (\"Titanic\") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the \"Rocky\" movies) has a significant role. <br /><br />This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so. <br /><br />My score: 3 (out of

{"value":"A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10 year old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3 year old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful house in Maine--seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! The neighbor across the way (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home...and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets. But a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life...but the dead come back in a nasty mood.<br /><br />\"\"DEFINITE SPOILERS** The novel by Stephen King was good--it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened. This movie jettisons ALL the character development and just plays up the gore and violence. Animals are killed ON camera (I know it's faked but it's still repulsive); a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral (in a totally sick scene); he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom (I DO wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family for no reason...The movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face. It just goes out of its way to shock you. **END SPOILERS**<br /><br />Acting is no help. Midkiff is just dreadful as the father--he's handsome and buff but totally blank. Crosby isn't much better. The two kids are just annoying. Only Gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting. <br /><br />This picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This movie was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what I saw. A sick repulsive horror film.

{"value":"I originally gave this episode a rating of two- I now wish I'd thought more about it. I also wish they had negative rating options.<br /><br />Watching it, I was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish. I adore Ron Pearlman, and John Carpenter... so what went wrong?? Last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue. I think that this season Mr Carpenter managed to make something so grey-area that you can't immediately see if he is pro-choice or anti-abortion. It was only after I sat and thought about it that I realized he is very much anti-abortion- you get this most clearly in the end when the 'Mother' shoots the baby and kills it, to the dismay of the 'Father', who walks off in grief, leaving the mother unharmed. But you also see it in the way the Ron P. character is treated- I hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police. Instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him (only to pay for it in the end) I don't mind someone having a strong view on something, even if it isn't something I agree in, but I do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view, rather than trying to look like they're sitting somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />But, political issues aside, this episode was beyond poor. The music was retro-70's and just plain didn't work. The acting (other than Ron P.) was poor. The effects were dreadful- it might have been better just to -not- show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had.<br /><br />All this being said, I'm glad they have the Masters of Horror- I don't mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones. Its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store- every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while. I do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from Masters- some of these people just plain don't deserve the title. (Let me stress tho- even tho I hated this episode, John Carpenter TOTALLY deserves the title. He is a master thru and thru)","finished_norm":["i","origin","give","thi","episod","a","rate","of","two","i","now","wish","i","have","think","much","about","it","i","conjur","wish","thei","have","neg","rate","optionsbr","br","watch","it","i","be","amaz","at","how","poor","the","whole","thing","be","from","start","to","finish","i","ador","ron","pearlman","and","john","carpent","so","what","go","wrong","last","season","episod","be","pull","due","to","the","wai","it","handl","the","abort","issu","i","think","that","thi","season","mr","carpent","manag","to","make","someth","so","greyarea","that","you","ca","not","immedi","see","if","he","be","prochoic","or","antiabort","it","be","onli","after","i","sit","and","think","about","it","that","i","realiz","he","be","veri","much","antiabort","you","get","thi","much","clearli","in","the","end","when","the","mother","shoot","the","babi","and","kill","it","to","the","dismai","of","the","father","who","walk","off","in","grief","leav","the","mother","unharm","but","you","conjur","see","it","in","the","wai","the","ron","p","charact","be","treat","i","hardli","think","that","if","someon","have","prove","themselv","enough","of","a","threat","in","the","past","so","a","to","have","a","restrain","order","against","him","that","thei","would","not","immedi","be","ring","the","polic","instead","we","have","the","guard","almost","sympathet","deal","with","him","onli","to","pai","for","it","in","the","end","i","do","not","mind","someon","have","a","strong","view","on","someth","even","if","it","be","not","someth","i","agre","in","but","i","do","think","it","a","bite","lame","not","to","stand","by","that","view","rather","than","try","to","look","like","thei","re","sit","somewher","in","the","middlebr","br","but","polit","issu","asid","thi","episod","be","beyond","poor","the","music","be","retro","and","just","plain","do","not","work","the","act","other","than","ron","p","be","poor","the","effect","be","dread","it","mai","have","be","well","just","to","not","show","the","monster","at","all","rather","than","show","the","lame","excus","for","a","monster","thei","hadbr","br","all","thi","be","sai","i","be","glad","thei","have","the","master","of","horror","i","do","not","mind","sit","through","some","realli","poor","episod","to","find","the","good","on","it","a","bite","like","rent","horror","movi","from","the","video","store","everi","now","and","again","you","get","a","good","on","and","it","make","it","all","worth","while","i","do","agre","with","the","poster","that","sai","mayb","the","name","ne","to","chang","from","master","some","of","thi","peopl","just","plain","do","not","deserv","the","titl","let","me","stress","tho","even","tho","i","hate","thi","episod","john","carpent","total","deserv","the","titl","he","be","a","master","thru","and","thru"],"filtered":["origin","give","thi","episod","rate","two","wish","think","much","conjur","wish","thei","neg","rate","optionsbr","br","watch","amaz","poor","whole","thing","start","finish","ador","ron","pearlman","john","carpent","go","wrong","last","season","episod","pull","due","wai","handl","abort","issu","think","thi","season","mr","carpent","manag","make","someth","greyarea","ca","immedi","see","prochoic","antiabort","onli","sit","think","realiz","veri","much","antiabort","get","thi","much","clearli","end","mother","shoot","babi","kill","dismai","father","walk","grief","leav","mother","unharm","conjur","see","wai","ron","p","charact","treat","hardli","think","someon","prove","themselv","enough","threat","past","restrain","order","thei","immedi","ring","polic","instead","guard","almost","sympathet","deal","onli","pai","end","mind","someon","strong","view","someth","even","someth","agre","think","bite","lame","stand","view","rather","try","look","like","thei","re","sit","somewher","middlebr","br","polit","issu","asid","thi","episod","beyond","poor","music","retro","plain","work","act","ron","p","poor","effect","dread","mai","well","show","monster","rather","show","lame","excus","monster","thei","hadbr","br","thi","sai","glad","thei","master","horror","mind","sit","realli","poor","episod","find","good","bite","like","rent","horror","movi","video","store","everi","get","good","make","worth","agre","poster","sai","mayb","name","ne","chang","master","thi","peopl","plain","deserv","titl","let","stress","tho","even","tho","hate","thi","episod","john","carpent","total","deserv","titl","master","thru","thru"],"filtered2":["origin","give","rate","two","wish","think","conjur","wish","neg","rate","optionsbr","watch","amaz","poor","whole","thing","start","finish","ador","ron","pearlman","john","carpent","go","wrong","last","season","pull","due","wai","handl","abort","issu","think","season","mr","carpent","manag","make","someth","greyarea","ca","immedi","see","prochoic","antiabort","onli","sit","think","realiz","veri","antiabort","get","clearli","end","mother","shoot","babi","kill","dismai","father","walk","grief","leav","mother","unharm","conjur","see","wai","ron","p","c

{"value":"DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on Sky Movies in Britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . Actually seeing as I`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . My theory was proved right for the most part <br /><br />!!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!!<br /><br />What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved . For example early in the film the bad guys are flying Dracula`s coffin from London to America ( In a twin engine turbo prop plane ! ) and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where Dracula comes to life . A fight breaks out , there`s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don`t hear a sound until the script demands it . It also appears in this segment`s climax that Dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . Sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there`s numerous scenes of characters being at the New Orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they`re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced <br /><br />There`s something else that yanked my chain - Product placement . There`s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record label/retailer chain is in full view . I won`t dare publicise the company brand ( Except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in Britain ) but I was under the impression this type of advertising was against British broadcasting guidlines and I`m surprised the BBC showed this movie if that`s the case <br /><br />There are some positives in DRACULA 2000 like the visuals for example . This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it`s something we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - A very good looking movie that`s very

{"value":"Boy what a dud this mess was.But it only lasts an hour and I only paid a buck for it so I'll live....unlike the entire cast of this 1933 clunker who are all dust by now.<br /><br />So anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood.The local yokels start talking about vampires ,of course,and a little more loudly after each body is found.The town sheriff or constable or whatever he is,played by awesome actor Melvyn Douglas,tries to tell them otherwise.When he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck,instead of two holes close together, the locals simply then say it's a giant vampire bat.The constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings.<br /><br />But Melvyn doesn't seem too bothered either way.He spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie,played by Faye Wray.Also in this mix is the town simpleton,played by Dwight Frye,who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did.He further freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood.Lionel Atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes.And boy does he ever stink as an actor.Atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get.And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing....lots of big names to be such a pile of guano.<br /><br />Other than the terrible mis-title this movie has,the alternate name,\"The Blood Sucker\" is much better,this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly.<br /><br />For me the high point of the movie is watching Frye,he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie didn't offer much.And then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you'll really be let down.<br /><br />Bela Lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch.Think of this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was.<br /><br />If you can't make a good 1930's horror film at least put Lugosi in it.","finished_norm":["boi","what","a","dud","thi","mess","wasbut","it","onli","last","a","hour","and","i","onli","pai","a","buck","for","it","so","i","will","liveunlik","the","entir","cast","of","thi","clunker","who","be","all","dust","by","nowbr","br","so","anywai","a","small","villag","start","have","bodi","turn","up","that","have","be","drain","of","all","their","bloodth","local","yokel","start","talk","about","vampir","of","courseand","a","littl","much","loudli","after","each","bodi","be","foundth","town","sheriff","or","constabl","or","whatev","he","isplai","by","awesom","actor","melvyn","douglastri","to","tell","them","otherwisewhen","he","mention","the","fact","that","the","dead","have","on","larg","hole","on","each","side","of","the","neckinstead","of","two","hole","close","togeth","the","local","simpli","then","sai","it","a","giant","vampir","batth","constabl","insist","that","vampir","do","not","exist","and","it","must","be","a","human","culprit","do","the","killingsbr","br","but","melvyn","doe","not","seem","too","bother","either","wayh","spend","much","of","hi","time","try","to","get","into","the","pantaloon","of","hi","sweetieplai","by","faye","wrayalso","in","thi","mix","be","the","town","simpletonplai","by","dwight","fryewho","alwai","seem","to","have","plai","the","same","role","in","everi","movi","he","didh","far","freak","out","the","townspeopl","by","catch","bat","and","drink","hi","own","bloodlionel","atwil","plai","the","town","doctor","who","seemingli","be","try","to","help","the","constabl","solv","the","crimesand","boi","doe","he","ever","stink","a","a","actoratwil","be","a","close","to","cardboard","in","thi","role","a","he","can","getand","lionel","barrymor","be","conjur","in","thi","thinglot","of","big","name","to","be","such","a","pile","of","guanobr","br","other","than","the","terribl","mistitl","thi","movi","hasth","altern","nameth","blood","sucker","be","much","betterthi","movi","be","conjur","dull","and","plod","and","just","sillybr","br","for","me","the","high","point","of","the","movi","be","watch","fryeh","nail","the","freaki","town","weirdo","but","other","than","him","thi","movi","do","not","offer","muchand","then","when","you","find","out","the","reason","for","the","strang","death","and","see","the","special","effect","thing","that","requir","all","thi","blood","you","will","realli","be","let","downbr","br","bela","lugosi","do","a","lot","of","aw","pictur","but","at","littl","he","be","fun","and","interest","to","watchthink","of","thi","movi","a","a","realli","bad","lugosi","clunker","without","lugosi","and","you","will","get","a","feel","for","how","miser","bad","thi","mess","wasbr","br","if","you","ca","not","make","a","good","horror","film","at","littl","put","lugosi","in","it"],"filtered":["boi","dud","thi","mess","wasbut","onli","last","hour","onli","pai","buck","liveunlik","entir","cast","thi","clunker","dust","nowbr","br","anywai","small","villag","start","bodi","turn","drain","bloodth","local","yokel","start","talk","vampir","courseand","littl","much","loudli","bodi","foundth","town","sheriff","constabl","whatev","isplai","awesom","actor","melvyn","douglastri","tell","otherwisewhen","mention","fact","dead","larg","hole","side","neckinstead","two","hole","close","togeth","local","simpli","sai","giant","vampir","batth","constabl","insist","vampir","exist","must","human","culprit","killingsbr","br","melvyn","doe","seem","bother","either","wayh","spend","much","hi","time","try","get","pantaloon","hi","sweetieplai","faye","wrayalso","thi","mix","town","simpletonplai","dwight","fryewho","alwai","seem","plai","role","everi","movi","didh","far","freak","townspeopl","catch","bat","drink","hi","bloodlionel","atwil","plai","town","doctor","seemingli","try","help","constabl","solv","crimesand","boi","doe","ever","stink","actoratwil","close","cardboard","thi","role","getand","lionel","barrymor","conjur","thi","thinglot","big","name","pile","guanobr","br","terribl","mistitl","thi","movi","hasth","altern","nameth","blood","sucker","much","betterthi","movi","conjur","dull","plod","sillybr","br","high","point","movi","watch","fryeh","nail","freaki","town","weirdo","thi","movi","offer","muchand","find","reason","strang","death","see","special","effect","thing","requir","thi","blood","realli","let","downbr","br","bela","lugosi","lot","aw","pictur","littl","fun","interest","watchthink","thi","movi","realli","bad","lugosi","clunker","without","lugosi","get","feel","miser","bad","thi","mess","wasbr","br","ca","make","good","horror","film","littl","put","lugosi"],"filtered2":["boi","dud","mess","wasbut","onli","last","hour","onli","pai","buck","liveunlik","entir","cast","clunker","dust","nowbr","anywai","small","villag","start","bodi","turn","drain","bloodth","local","yokel","start","talk","vampir","courseand","littl","loudli","bodi","foundth","town","sheriff","constabl","whatev","isplai","awesom","actor","melvyn","douglastri","tell","otherwisewhen","mention","fact","dead","larg","h

{"value":"Note to self- just because a film is foreign, obscure, and stars Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't mean it's any good. Such is the case with 'Blue Juice,' a 1995 Brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem (to a dumb American, anyway) an even more unlikely place to find surfers: Cornwall, England. You might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing, quirky little comedy. If only. The film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable. The easiest way to describe it is as a sort of '90's British version of 'Grease' without the dancing, but even that makes it sound better than it is. No, the best way to take it is as a little slice-of-life set in a small town. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Chloe, a young woman living with a surfing instructor, JC (Sean Pertwee; you remember him). Pertwee is actually the film's star, and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees, the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this. In this case, it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist, a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer, and a fat nerdy guy who, in a needlessly extended scene, gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him. I can't honestly say everything that goes on in 'Blue Juice' is predictable, since it's set in a place and reflects customs and manners I'm not very familiar with, but there's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters. The comedy, though, IS very predictable and tired. One can sense the set-ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue (in American form, of course) before the actors do. The relationship between JC and Chloe is every bit as hackneyed. She wants him to grow up; he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being. He's afraid of losing face with his gang; she thinks he prefers them to her. You get the idea. As I struggled to stay focused on 'Blue Juice,' toward the end I felt, as the saying goes, that this was an hour and half of my life I'd never get

{"value":"This movie doesn't have an awful lot to do with it's predecessor \"Robot Jox\". This must be also the reason why its most common name is \"Robot Wars\" and not the alternate name \"Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars\".<br /><br />\"Robot Jox\" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn't very original or cleverly written. A shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really, for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Just like \"Robot Jox\" this is a B-movie but with as a big difference that it's just not a very good one. Perhaps this also has to with the fact that \"Robot Jox\" got made during the '80's, when B-movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it, even though the movie got released in 1990. This really can't be said about this movie. It's just lame, badly made, poor looking and not exciting enough. It also has an ending which leaves you thinking 'This is it? That's all?'.<br /><br />What the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot-line really. Perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story, some action, or likable main characters.<br /><br />Seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie. All of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves as if he's God's gift to woman and Mr. Perfect who can compete with anyone. Weren't they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie?<br /><br />For such a futuristic movie, with a concept of having large battle droids in it, this movie surely is lacking with its action. Had they put some more and bigger action into the movie, the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch. Instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable.<br /><br />You can better watch a \"Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers\" episode, for some more action and
