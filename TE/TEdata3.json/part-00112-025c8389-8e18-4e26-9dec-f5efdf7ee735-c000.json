{"value":"Peeew this stinks! As everyone knows it's based upon some Geico insurance commercials; what no one knows is WHY?! Those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best; hardly fodder for a series. (The talking Geico gecko -- that's another story. Now that would make for an intriguing series!) And why on earth did ABC -- as reported in the press -- actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from Geico for this? After all, the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to TV; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. And that's how a concept like this works best -- as an occasional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series called \"It's About Time\" also used the cavemen in the modern world concept. It lasted one season.) <br /><br />One of the show's directors, who was also responsible for the Geico commercials, was recently quoted as saying: \"We were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell.\" Wrong.<br /><br />In the annals of bad TV, this is destined to take its place alongside 1972's \"Me and the Chimp\" as one of the all-time worst. The lead actor in the embarrassing Chimp fiasco actually went into shame-by-association hiding after it was abruptly canceled. No doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit.","finished_norm":["peeew","thi","stink","a","everyon","know","it","base","upon","some","geico","insur","commerci","what","no","on","know","be","why","that","commerci","be","amus","on","view","at","well","hardli","fodder","for","a","seri","the","talk","geico","gecko","that","anoth","stori","now","that","would","make","for","a","intrigu","seri","and","why","on","earth","do","abc","a","report","in","the","press","actual","agre","to","bui","the","caveman","charact","right","from","geico","for","thi","after","all","the","idea","of","caveman","struggl","in","the","modern","world","be","hardli","uniqu","to","tv","phil","hartman","have","a","recur","saturdai","night","live","role","a","the","unfreez","caveman","lawyer","over","a","decad","ago","and","that","how","a","concept","like","thi","work","well","a","a","occasion","instal","but","a","regular","seri","fuhgeddaboudit","a","seri","call","it","about","time","conjur","us","the","caveman","in","the","modern","world","concept","it","last","on","season","br","br","on","of","the","show","director","who","be","conjur","respons","for","the","geico","commerci","be","recent","quot","a","sai","we","be","so","excit","when","we","be","shoot","our","commerci","becaus","we","feel","like","we","have","someth","that","be","veri","uniqu","and","we","have","big","stori","to","tell","wrongbr","br","in","the","annal","of","bad","tv","thi","be","destin","to","take","it","place","alongsid","me","and","the","chimp","a","on","of","the","alltim","wrong","the","lead","actor","in","the","embarrass","chimp","fiasco","actual","go","into","shamebyassoci","hide","after","it","be","abruptli","cancel","no","doubt","our","caveman","friend","will","follow","suit"],"filtered":["peeew","thi","stink","everyon","know","base","upon","geico","insur","commerci","know","commerci","amus","view","well","hardli","fodder","seri","talk","geico","gecko","anoth","stori","make","intrigu","seri","earth","abc","report","press","actual","agre","bui","caveman","charact","right","geico","thi","idea","caveman","struggl","modern","world","hardli","uniqu","tv","phil","hartman","recur","saturdai","night","live","role","unfreez","caveman","lawyer","decad","ago","concept","like","thi","work","well","occasion","instal","regular","seri","fuhgeddaboudit","seri","call","time","conjur","us","caveman","modern","world","concept","last","season","br","br","show","director","conjur","respons","geico","commerci","recent","quot","sai","excit","shoot","commerci","becaus","feel","like","someth","veri","uniqu","big","stori","tell","wrongbr","br","annal","bad","tv","thi","destin","take","place","alongsid","chimp","alltim","wrong","lead","actor","embarrass","chimp","fiasco","actual","go","shamebyassoci","hide","abruptli","cancel","doubt","caveman","friend","follow","suit"],"filtered2":["peeew","stink","everyon","know","base","upon","geico","insur","commerci","know","commerci","amus","view","well","hardli","fodder","talk","geico","gecko","anoth","stori","make","intrigu","earth","abc","report","press","actual","agre","bui","caveman","charact","right","geico","idea","caveman","struggl","modern","world","hardli","uniqu","tv","phil","hartman","recur","saturdai","night","live","role","unfreez","caveman","lawyer","decad","ago","concept","like","work","well","occasion","instal","regular","fuhgeddaboudit","call","time","conjur","us","caveman","modern","world","concept","last","season","show","director","conjur","respons","geico","commerci","recent","quot","excit","shoot","commerci","becaus","feel","like","someth","veri","uniqu","big","stori","tell","wrongbr","annal","bad","tv","destin","take","place","alongsid","chimp","alltim","wrong","lead","actor","embarrass","chimp","fiasco","actual","go","shamebyassoci","hide","abruptli","cancel","doubt","caveman","friend","follow","suit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,8,9,10,15,17,20,22,25,26,28,31,39,41,43,48,52,53,56,58,73,82,90,116,117,121,123,128,142,144,157,161,164,165,172,186,210,246,260,312,334,347,522,524,556,562,567,610,622,630,665,707,708,725,729,817,842,884,915,990,1017,1099,1126,1196,1300,1409,1605,1759,1796,1964,1970,2163,2598,2999,3366,3782,3804,3852,3942,3951,4050,4107,4151,4406,4455,6417,7026],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,8,9,10,15,17,20,22,25,26,28,31,39,41,43,48,52,53,56,58,73,82,90,116,117,121,123,128,142,144,157,161,164,165,172,186,210,246,260,312,334,347,522,524,556,562,567,610,622,630,665,707,708,725,729,817,842,884,915,990,1017,1099,1126,1196,1300,1409,1605,1759,1796,1964,1970,2163,2598,2999,3366,3782,3804,3852,3942,3951,4050,4107,4151,4406,4455,6417,7026],"values":[0.6199767

{"value":"In fact, these young people were so distasteful that I couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I considered her the most annoying of the bunch.<br /><br />But I knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background. It had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />Even the prosthetics looked fake and the \"blood\" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch, although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing. I'm sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch. It sure didn't appeal to me. Blah...<br /><br />And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. She still looks hot, though. I'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays.<br /><br />However, it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli's meandering HORROR (2002) in that it has a somewhat coherent plot, so I'll give it that much. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film.<br /><br />Lion's Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up.<br /><br />2 out of

{"value":"This movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress. His head is chopped off and buried separately of his body...sounds like \"The Thing that wouldn't die\" doesn't it? Well it does play out a little like that, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly. I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking \"When is it going to end\"? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery. The only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track. Still I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. And don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town, there isn't...only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","start","out","with","a","execut","of","a","practition","of","witchcraft","and","hi","mistress","hi","head","be","chop","off","and","buri","separ","of","hi","bodysound","like","the","thing","that","would","not","die","doe","not","it","good","it","doe","plai","out","a","littl","like","that","but","onc","the","bodi","be","reunit","with","the","head","all","the","interest","and","gruesom","death","be","do","and","the","movi","move","veri","slowli","i","mean","the","movi","be","onli","minut","long","and","i","keep","think","when","be","it","go","to","end","the","charact","in","the","movi","be","idiot","for","the","much","part","and","thei","pretti","much","deserv","to","die","for","be","realli","stupid","the","villain","be","conjur","veri","bad","a","he","be","slow","move","and","realli","you","wonder","how","he","manag","to","do","anyth","consid","he","be","afraid","of","jeweleri","the","onli","thing","to","keep","you","watch","after","the","head","be","reattach","be","the","fact","that","there","be","so","mani","boob","be","flash","that","you","realli","begin","to","lose","track","still","i","want","to","see","a","horror","movi","not","a","soft","core","porn","flick","and","a","a","horror","movi","it","be","wai","to","slow","move","with","wai","to","mani","slow","stretch","to","be","even","somewhat","enjoy","and","do","not","read","the","back","of","the","box","a","it","make","it","out","like","there","be","flesh","eat","zombi","attack","the","town","there","isntonli","a","small","scene","where","three","or","four","zombi","attack","a","hous","and","be","so","easili","repel","thei","be","not","a","factor","in","the","movi","at","all","and","their","scene","be","rather","pointless","so","for","the","much","part","i","sai","you","should","avoid","thi","movi","unless","you","come","across","it","for","realli","cheap"],"filtered":["thi","movi","start","execut","practition","witchcraft","hi","mistress","hi","head","chop","buri","separ","hi","bodysound","like","thing","die","doe","good","doe","plai","littl","like","onc","bodi","reunit","head","interest","gruesom","death","movi","move","veri","slowli","mean","movi","onli","minut","long","keep","think","go","end","charact","movi","idiot","much","part","thei","pretti","much","deserv","die","realli","stupid","villain","conjur","veri","bad","slow","move","realli","wonder","manag","anyth","consid","afraid","jeweleri","onli","thing","keep","watch","head","reattach","fact","mani","boob","flash","realli","begin","lose","track","still","want","see","horror","movi","soft","core","porn","flick","horror","movi","wai","slow","move","wai","mani","slow","stretch","even","somewhat","enjoy","read","back","box","make","like","flesh","eat","zombi","attack","town","isntonli","small","scene","three","four","zombi","attack","hous","easili","repel","thei","factor","movi","scene","rather","pointless","much","part","sai","avoid","thi","movi","unless","come","across","realli","cheap"],"filtered2":["start","execut","practition","witchcraft","mistress","head","chop","buri","separ","bodysound","like","thing","die","doe","good","doe","plai","littl","like","onc","bodi","reunit","head","interest","gruesom","death","move","veri","slowli","mean","onli","minut","long","keep","think","go","end","charact","idiot","part","pretti","deserv","die","realli","stupid","villain","conjur","veri","bad","slow","move","realli","wonder","manag","anyth","consid","afraid","jeweleri","onli","thing","keep","watch","head","reattach","fact","mani","boob","flash","realli","begin","lose","track","still","want","see","horror","soft","core","porn","flick","horror","wai","slow","move","wai","mani","slow","stretch","even","somewhat","enjoy","read","back","box","make","like","flesh","eat","zombi","attack","town","isntonli","small","scene","three","four","zombi","attack","hous","easili","repel","factor","scene","rather","pointless","part","avoid","unless","come","across","realli","cheap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,18,19,24,29,33,34,37,39,40,50,59,60,61,63,64,71,78,83,88,97,99,104,134,136,145,147,160,175,208,213,221,224,236,245,257,268,275,293,317,335,345,351,363,376,390,423,450,460,495,503,520,531,583,596,599,606,654,662,705,737,867,971,1220,1244,1344,1375,1452,1572,1767,1789,1856,1990,2103,2208,3566,3960,4666,4999,5177],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,18,19,24,29,33,34,37,39,40,50,59,60,61,63,64,71,78,83,88,97,99,104,134,136,145,147,160,175,208,213,221,224,236,245,257,268,275,293,317,335,345,351,363,376,390,423,450

{"value":"When the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster. But honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser. The movie has a Tag-line - \"Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara\" which means Love's Sweet but Sacrifice is Immortal. In the movie the hero of the movie (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi) even though the two loved each other! His justification is the meaning of the tag-line. This movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this \"Loser-like Sacrificial\" attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is, when they could have moved on with their lives. Ganesh's acting in the movie is Amateurish, Crass and Childishly stupid. He actually looks funny in a song, (Onde Ondu Sari... )when he's supposed to look all stylish and cool. His looks don't help the leading role either. His hair style is badly done in most part of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent. <br /><br />The good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie. Also the lyrics by Jayant Kaikini are very well penned. The Director Yograj Bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner. <br /><br />Anyway all-in-all except for the songs, the movie is a very ordinary

{"value":"a romance without feeling, a drama of issues without point (or drama).... This film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account, as if it isn't trying. Or as if the director/editor/scriptwriter team isn't really trying. The actors are able--they need better support.<br /><br />One element that doesn't fail is the score by George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. What a shame it's attached to this film. In a good film actors' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact. This editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly grating in this respect: an insult to the talents of the lead actors.<br /><br />There is another element in the film that works: location photography. Notably one moment in Grand Central Station. I'd guessed in advance what was going to happen; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking.<br /><br />Some commentators on this board have pointed out that US assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the MacCarthy scare. The moment the film seems to start looking seriously at American society, it switches into conventional romance; before any human feelings can move us, it's away on a (predictable) 'thriller'

{"value":"This is a pretty bad movie. But not so bad as it's reputation suggests. The production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene. And it does have an 80's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun. Watch out, too, for Jimmy Nail's brief appearance - his attempt at an American accent is so astoundingly rubbish it's fantastic. Fantastic too are Sybil Danning's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12\" remix of Sybil Danning's boobs. Has to be seen to be believed. As a horror movie it isn't scary, the effects are silly and Christopher Lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance. I guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit. The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that I have forgotten almost everything about them and I just watched this movie earlier tonight. The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, bizarrely, they sometimes look more like badly burned apes. The eastern European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel, while being pretty terrible, does at least give the film some added cheese.<br /><br />Overall? Good for a laugh. Not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be?

{"value":"This movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding, especially), and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen.<br /><br />The dialog was particularly distracting, and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. Toward the end I was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian, and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me.<br /><br />Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son, born and raised in New York in the 1920's, suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent. I'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England.<br /><br />I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention, but a considerably lower grade for execution.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","doe","have","some","great","noirishneorealist","visual","and","it","tell","a","stori","that","be","refreshingli","free","of","hollywood","sugarco","which","be","onli","possibl","becaus","it","be","essenti","a","independ","foreign","film","but","some","of","the","scene","go","on","for","much","too","long","the","wed","especi","and","i","find","the","exagger","act","and","unrealist","dialog","to","be","much","fit","for","the","stage","than","for","the","silver","screenbr","br","the","dialog","be","particularli","distract","and","it","seem","to","get","wrong","a","the","movi","go","on","much","of","the","charact","be","either","italianamerican","or","italian","immigr","live","in","new","york","in","the","twenti","and","thirti","but","their","dialog","sound","like","thei","be","practic","line","for","a","shakespear","plai","while","thei","mix","cement","and","lai","brick","toward","the","end","i","be","laugh","and","not","becaus","the","filmmak","want","me","to","i","guess","the","stilt","poetri","can","be","defend","by","sai","that","the","charact","would","have","be","speak","italian","and","the","dialog","be","a","liter","translat","of","how","thei","would","realli","talk","but","it","absolut","do","not","work","for","mebr","br","anoth","line","of","dialog","make","me","laugh","for","a","differ","reason","the","main","charact","son","bear","and","rais","in","new","york","in","the","suddenli","pick","up","a","love","lilt","british","accent","i","be","onli","guess","thi","have","someth","to","do","with","the","fact","that","the","movi","be","make","in","englandbr","br","i","give","thi","movi","a","a","for","effort","and","intent","but","a","consider","low","grade","for","execut"],"filtered":["thi","movi","doe","great","noirishneorealist","visual","tell","stori","refreshingli","free","hollywood","sugarco","onli","possibl","becaus","essenti","independ","foreign","film","scene","go","much","long","wed","especi","find","exagger","act","unrealist","dialog","much","fit","stage","silver","screenbr","br","dialog","particularli","distract","seem","get","wrong","movi","go","much","charact","either","italianamerican","italian","immigr","live","new","york","twenti","thirti","dialog","sound","like","thei","practic","line","shakespear","plai","thei","mix","cement","lai","brick","toward","end","laugh","becaus","filmmak","want","guess","stilt","poetri","defend","sai","charact","speak","italian","dialog","liter","translat","thei","realli","talk","absolut","work","mebr","br","anoth","line","dialog","make","laugh","differ","reason","main","charact","son","bear","rais","new","york","suddenli","pick","love","lilt","british","accent","onli","guess","thi","someth","fact","movi","make","englandbr","br","give","thi","movi","effort","intent","consider","low","grade","execut"],"filtered2":["doe","great","noirishneorealist","visual","tell","stori","refreshingli","free","hollywood","sugarco","onli","possibl","becaus","essenti","independ","foreign","scene","go","long","wed","especi","find","exagger","act","unrealist","dialog","fit","stage","silver","screenbr","dialog","particularli","distract","seem","get","wrong","go","charact","either","italianamerican","italian","immigr","live","new","york","twenti","thirti","dialog","sound","like","practic","line","shakespear","plai","mix","cement","lai","brick","toward","end","laugh","becaus","filmmak","want","guess","stilt","poetri","defend","charact","speak","italian","dialog","liter","translat","realli","talk","absolut","work","mebr","anoth","line","dialog","make","laugh","differ","reason","main","charact","son","bear","rais","new","york","suddenli","pick","love","lilt","british","accent","onli","guess","someth","fact","make","englandbr","give","effort","intent","consider","low","grade","execut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,10,11,13,17,18,19,21,22,24,25,30,35,37,38,40,48,51,53,54,73,87,90,95,97,99,107,116,133,178,179,186,204,207,217,222,243,267,300,323,344,401,402,432,434,446,497,525,559,563,635,662,669,676,686,696,782,785,811,827,897,917,938,1030,1044,1197,1211,1264,1356,1432,1497,1574,1696,1708,1770,1845,1981,2046,2067,2105,2160,2700,3867,3907,3993,4705,5754],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,10,11,13,17,18,19,21,22,24,25,30,35,37,38,40,48,51,53,54,73,87,90,95,97,99,107,116,133,178,179,186,204,207,217,222,243,267,300,323,344,401,402,432,434,446,497,525,559,563,635,662,669,676,686,696,782,785,811,827,897,917,938,1030,1044,1197,1211,1264,1356,1432,1497,1574,1696,1708,1770,1845,1981,2046,2067,2105,2160,2700,3867,3907,3993,4705,5754],"values":[1.239

{"value":"I give this a generous four out of ten stars, or dots or markers, or something.<br /><br />There were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear!!) moved along agreeably enough.<br /><br />Otherwise, the usual trafficking in stereotypes, blazing speed, rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack, and \"soundtrack\" is generous. <br /><br />Anyway, the two really really funny scenes involved Amy P. She's just really hilarious in an animal kind of way. She's a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on SNL and Lucille Ball.<br /><br />I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just flat out admitted they did this for the money, because if by doing it, it gave birth to the Sarah Palin parodies, then I guess we can say, yeah, it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role, who's really there to help you be more human.<br /><br />Blah. 4 outta 10 like I said is generous.<br /><br />But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mom from \"Two and a Half Men\" is in this movie, and she's had some kind of plastic surgery, so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old, so every scene she's in, I'm like trying to rearrange her face, or put it together in my mind, or just answer the question, \"No. Wait.

{"value":"The movie began well enough. It had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite, getting superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, the ability to speak to dogs, superspeed, heat vision, and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly), and fighting crime. From there on it's all downhill.<br /><br />Meteor Man gets a costume from his mom, fights with the resident gangs, and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing, overlong, and stupefying ending.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so remarkably bad if it weren't like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dance.<br /><br />Despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points. It states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they'll come back to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs & communities need to see their real enemies (the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them. The only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, & George H.W.

{"value":"Some nice scenery, but the story itself--in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, in the course of doing Egyptologist things in the most un-Egyptologistic of ways (e.g., flash photography in the tombs, the handling of old parchment, etc.), uncovers a black market turf war and somehow (in the span of two days, no less!) becomes that war's jumpsuit-wearing epicenter--is more puzzling than any riddle the Sphinx ever posed. Down is simply awful as the visiting British scholar (that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers, certainly; but that she's annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely), and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem as downright confused by the proceedings as I was. In short, not what you'd expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and co.<br /><br />Worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which Down rails against all male scholars, blaming them for her failure as an academic, while bathed under the softest light Hollywood could muster. To top it off, she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find.

{"value":"Why does this movie fall WELL below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humourless script. A slim/average looking Travolta (looking rather dapper in black I must say, even with a HUGE mullet) and Gross both act very well as two young-ish 'slick-dressed' but nevertheless dimwitted New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. Other than that, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. It is SO dull that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax on any level. Kelly Preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be Travolta is one of the film's few pleasures. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch as struggling KGB honcho \"Bob Smith\". Personally, I think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (which is in the former Soviet Union?)--you'll understand if you see the movie... Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release. I guess Paramount stalled on releasing the movie until January 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. It was reported they deemed it \"unreleasable\". Nevertheless, this $6,000,000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing $163,000 in revenue as it was released only BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight-to-video. This is testament to the overall BAD quality of this movie.","finished_norm":["why","doe","thi","movi","fall","good","below","standard","ultim","the","answer","lie","in","the","poor","humourless","script","a","slimaverag","look","travolta","look","rather","dapper","in","black","i","must","sai","even","with","a","huge","mullet","and","gross","both","act","veri","good","a","two","youngish","slickdress","but","nevertheless","dimwit","new","yorker","eager","to","open","their","own","nightclub","other","than","that","the","rest","of","the","film","be","just","bore","to","watch","it","be","so","dull","that","it","realli","not","worth","know","what","happen","in","the","film","climax","on","ani","level","kelli","preston","obvious","exud","sex","appeal","and","the","sexual","charg","danc","with","her","husbandtob","travolta","be","on","of","the","film","few","pleasur","charl","martin","smith","be","quit","fun","to","watch","a","struggl","kgb","honcho","bob","smith","person","i","think","the","movi","would","have","be","well","if","the","plot","be","alter","a","littl","so","that","the","set","do","not","chang","from","ny","to","indian","spring","nebraska","which","be","in","the","former","soviet","unionyoul","understand","if","you","see","the","movi","appar","thi","movi","be","film","in","readi","for","a","releas","i","guess","paramount","stall","on","releas","the","movi","until","januari","becaus","of","the","unbeliev","plot","it","be","report","thei","deem","it","unreleas","nevertheless","thi","film","garner","a","littl","over","a","embarrass","in","revenu","a","it","be","releas","onli","briefli","in","place","like","texa","and","colorado","befor","head","straighttovideo","thi","be","testam","to","the","overal","bad","qualiti","of","thi","movi"],"filtered":["doe","thi","movi","fall","good","standard","ultim","answer","lie","poor","humourless","script","slimaverag","look","travolta","look","rather","dapper","black","must","sai","even","huge","mullet","gross","act","veri","good","two","youngish","slickdress","nevertheless","dimwit","new","yorker","eager","open","nightclub","rest","film","bore","watch","dull","realli","worth","know","happen","film","climax","ani","level","kelli","preston","obvious","exud","sex","appeal","sexual","charg","danc","husbandtob","travolta","film","pleasur","charl","martin","smith","quit","fun","watch","struggl","kgb","honcho","bob","smith","person","think","movi","well","plot","alter","littl","set","chang","ny","indian","spring","nebraska","former","soviet","unionyoul","understand","see","movi","appar","thi","movi","film","readi","releas","guess","paramount","stall","releas","movi","januari","becaus","unbeliev","plot","report","thei","deem","unreleas","nevertheless","thi","film","garner","littl","embarrass","revenu","releas","onli","briefli","place","like","texa","colorado","befor","head","straighttovideo","thi","testam","overal","bad","qualiti","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["doe","fall","good","standard","ultim","answer","lie","poor","humourless","script","slimaverag","look","travolta","look","rather","dapper","black","must","even","huge","mullet","gross","act","veri","good","two","youngish","slickdress","nevertheless","dimwit","new","yorker","eager","open","nightclub","rest","bore","watch","dull","realli","worth","know","happen","climax","ani","level","kelli","preston","obvious","exud","sex","appeal","sexual","charg","danc","husbandtob","travolta","pleasur","charl","martin","smith","quit","fun","watch","struggl","kgb","honcho","bob","smith","person","think","well","plot","alter","littl","set","chang","ny","indian","spring","nebraska","former","soviet","unionyoul","understand","see","appar","readi","releas","guess","paramount","stall","releas","januari","becaus","unbeliev","plot","report","deem","unreleas","nevertheless","garner","littl","embarrass","revenu","releas","onli","briefli","place","like","texa","colorado","befor","head","straighttovideo","testam","overal","bad","qualiti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,26,27,32,47,77,79,87,94,108,109,120,141,146,153,160,164,169,208,212,219,226,229,242,243,254,259,278,308,319,327,341,367,412,444,445,492,519,556,571,616,650,690,735,800,842,990,1025,1039,1136,1224,1233,1334,1522,1528,1638,1656,1687,1950,2155,2464,2513,2728,2776,3163,3558,3594,3654,4582,4626,5043,5129,5198,5860,6056,6391,6488,6987,7192,8024,8143],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,26,27,32,47,77,79,87,94,108,109,120,141,146,153,160,164,169,208,212,219,226,229,242,243,254,259,278,308,319,327,341,367,412,444,445,492,519,556,571,616,650,690,735

{"value":"Not very impressed. Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry. The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television. Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time. <br /><br />Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late '40s. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop.<br /><br />I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial.<br /><br />If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.","finished_norm":["not","veri","impress","it","difficult","to","offer","ani","spoiler","to","thi","film","becaus","there","be","almost","no","develop","in","the","plot","everyth","becom","clear","in","the","ten","minut","and","from","there","on","it","like","watch","paint","spindri","the","act","seem","veri","poor","a","good","and","remind","me","of","the","old","black","and","white","maoist","era","film","show","occasion","on","daytim","chines","televis","although","thi","be","difficult","to","tell","with","the","femal","role","yuwen","a","the","stori","seem","to","onli","requir","her","walk","round","like","a","wooden","mannequin","it","remind","me","of","fade","star","gong","li","who","somehow","get","a","reput","a","a","good","actress","in","the","west","for","have","a","scowl","on","her","face","all","the","time","br","br","tian","zhuangzhuang","film","the","blue","kite","be","a","far","well","film","but","do","not","be","fool","by","the","fact","that","springtim","in","a","small","town","be","set","in","the","late","unlik","the","blue","kite","the","fact","that","thi","film","be","set","in","a","time","of","upheav","be","irrelev","to","the","plot","itself","the","ruin","of","the","town","seem","to","be","noth","much","than","a","scenic","backdropbr","br","i","wonder","whether","tian","zhuangzhuang","be","simpli","try","to","ride","on","the","popular","of","chines","film","in","the","west","and","appeal","to","a","foreign","audienc","who","ca","not","tell","the","differ","between","a","film","that","be","beauti","profound","or","hypnot","and","on","that","be","simpli","tediou","and","insubstantialbr","br","if","ani","film","fit","the","descript","of","overr","thi","be","it","i","see","no","reason","here","to","stop","worri","about","the","state","of","the","chines","film","industri"],"filtered":["veri","impress","difficult","offer","ani","spoiler","thi","film","becaus","almost","develop","plot","everyth","becom","clear","ten","minut","like","watch","paint","spindri","act","seem","veri","poor","good","remind","old","black","white","maoist","era","film","show","occasion","daytim","chines","televis","although","thi","difficult","tell","femal","role","yuwen","stori","seem","onli","requir","walk","round","like","wooden","mannequin","remind","fade","star","gong","li","somehow","get","reput","good","actress","west","scowl","face","time","br","br","tian","zhuangzhuang","film","blue","kite","far","well","film","fool","fact","springtim","small","town","set","late","unlik","blue","kite","fact","thi","film","set","time","upheav","irrelev","plot","ruin","town","seem","noth","much","scenic","backdropbr","br","wonder","whether","tian","zhuangzhuang","simpli","try","ride","popular","chines","film","west","appeal","foreign","audienc","ca","tell","differ","film","beauti","profound","hypnot","simpli","tediou","insubstantialbr","br","ani","film","fit","descript","overr","thi","see","reason","stop","worri","state","chines","film","industri"],"filtered2":["veri","impress","difficult","offer","ani","spoiler","becaus","almost","develop","plot","everyth","becom","clear","ten","minut","like","watch","paint","spindri","act","seem","veri","poor","good","remind","old","black","white","maoist","era","show","occasion","daytim","chines","televis","although","difficult","tell","femal","role","yuwen","stori","seem","onli","requir","walk","round","like","wooden","mannequin","remind","fade","star","gong","li","somehow","get","reput","good","actress","west","scowl","face","time","tian","zhuangzhuang","blue","kite","far","well","fool","fact","springtim","small","town","set","late","unlik","blue","kite","fact","set","time","upheav","irrelev","plot","ruin","town","seem","noth","scenic","backdropbr","wonder","whether","tian","zhuangzhuang","simpli","try","ride","popular","chines","west","appeal","foreign","audienc","ca","tell","differ","beauti","profound","hypnot","simpli","tediou","insubstantialbr","ani","fit","descript","overr","see","reason","stop","worri","state","chines","industri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,11,15,17,20,21,22,27,28,32,35,36,49,59,67,81,90,95,97,100,101,109,115,128,131,146,150,168,175,193,201,204,229,237,251,294,315,320,325,355,359,363,418,422,450,490,498,507,545,549,590,597,615,644,663,676,690,710,803,868,891,951,989,1002,1040,1057,1083,1090,1099,1204,1240,1404,1447,1480,1672,1770,1831,2070,2112,2164,2856,3097,3381,3954,5676,6350,7723,8621],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,11,15,17,20,21,22,27,28,32,35,36,49,59,67,81,90,95,97,100,101,109,115,128,131,146,150,168,175,193,201,204,22

{"value":"I dislike this movie a lot. If you've read the Puzo's books, or at least have watched very closely the two first movies (specially the first one), you're going to agree with me.<br /><br />Compared with the Corleone's saga presented by Puzo's novel, the script of this film is, sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships among them are distorted. The story ends up reaching nowhere, although it appears to go to some direction during the movie.<br /><br />It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone's saga in the 90's, and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before. But, in the other hand, I don't know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies, in contexts when they didn't fit. Why this? It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film's qualities.<br /><br />What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this. A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies. So does Al Pacino, for being the actor he is. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written this. How come? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. The Puzo's novel \"The Last Don\" is a 90's story about the mob, and it is great. We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III.","finished_norm":["i","dislik","thi","movi","a","lot","if","you","have","read","the","puzo","book","or","at","littl","have","watch","veri","close","the","two","movi","special","the","on","you","re","go","to","agre","with","mebr","br","compar","with","the","corleon","saga","present","by","puzo","novel","the","script","of","thi","film","be","sometim","even","ridicul","the","charact","and","the","relationship","among","them","be","distort","the","stori","end","up","reach","nowher","although","it","appear","to","go","to","some","direct","dure","the","moviebr","br","it","be","understand","that","differ","time","should","be","expect","for","the","corleon","saga","in","the","and","that","we","would","not","gonna","find","thing","the","wai","thei","be","befor","but","in","the","other","hand","i","do","not","know","why","thei","have","to","copi","some","dialogu","from","the","other","movi","in","context","when","thei","do","not","fit","why","thi","it","sound","like","that","poorli","make","sequel","that","just","try","to","copi","the","origin","film","qualitiesbr","br","what","will","never","be","understand","be","the","fact","that","mario","puzo","coppola","and","al","pacino","join","togeth","to","make","thi","a","man","who","direct","piec","like","apocalyps","now","and","godfath","have","to","be","forgiv","for","almost","anyth","he","doe","in","cinema","until","he","die","so","doe","al","pacino","for","be","the","actor","he","be","but","mario","puzo","should","not","have","write","thi","how","come","he","damag","all","hi","previou","work","what","a","shame","my","friend","the","puzo","novel","the","last","don","be","a","stori","about","the","mob","and","it","be","great","we","can","never","tell","the","same","about","the","plot","for","the","godfath","iii"],"filtered":["dislik","thi","movi","lot","read","puzo","book","littl","watch","veri","close","two","movi","special","re","go","agre","mebr","br","compar","corleon","saga","present","puzo","novel","script","thi","film","sometim","even","ridicul","charact","relationship","among","distort","stori","end","reach","nowher","although","appear","go","direct","dure","moviebr","br","understand","differ","time","expect","corleon","saga","gonna","find","thing","wai","thei","befor","hand","know","thei","copi","dialogu","movi","context","thei","fit","thi","sound","like","poorli","make","sequel","try","copi","origin","film","qualitiesbr","br","never","understand","fact","mario","puzo","coppola","al","pacino","join","togeth","make","thi","man","direct","piec","like","apocalyps","godfath","forgiv","almost","anyth","doe","cinema","die","doe","al","pacino","actor","mario","puzo","write","thi","come","damag","hi","previou","work","shame","friend","puzo","novel","last","stori","mob","great","never","tell","plot","godfath","iii"],"filtered2":["dislik","lot","read","puzo","book","littl","watch","veri","close","two","special","re","go","agre","mebr","compar","corleon","saga","present","puzo","novel","script","sometim","even","ridicul","charact","relationship","among","distort","stori","end","reach","nowher","although","appear","go","direct","dure","moviebr","understand","differ","time","expect","corleon","saga","gonna","find","thing","wai","befor","hand","know","copi","dialogu","context","fit","sound","like","poorli","make","sequel","try","copi","origin","qualitiesbr","never","understand","fact","mario","puzo","coppola","al","pacino","join","togeth","make","man","direct","piec","like","apocalyps","godfath","forgiv","almost","anyth","doe","cinema","die","doe","al","pacino","actor","mario","puzo","write","come","damag","previou","work","shame","friend","puzo","novel","last","stori","mob","great","never","tell","plot","godfath","iii"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,6,7,8,10,14,15,17,18,24,26,29,32,33,34,36,38,41,42,45,47,48,51,65,68,69,72,77,79,90,97,102,104,130,131,144,145,151,161,170,178,203,204,212,218,235,237,239,248,270,274,293,295,387,398,409,411,465,474,482,500,574,577,622,676,747,784,799,826,934,1311,1317,1319,1351,1470,1515,1696,1779,2298,2570,2589,2662,3439,3975,4192,4570,5416,5446],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,6,7,8,10,14,15,17,18,24,26,29,32,33,34,36,38,41,42,45,47,48,51,65,68,69,72,77,79,90,97,102,104,130,131,144,145,151,161,170,178,203,204,212,218,235,237,239,248,270,274,293,295,387,398,409,411,465,474,482,500,574,577,622,676,747,784,799,826,934,1311,1317,1319,1351,1470,1515,1696,1779,2298,2570,2589,2662,3439,3975,4192,4570,5416,5446],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.12388

{"value":"Not that he'd care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I was, there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this. The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues. Still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him, even though he's done nothing nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as shallow as his. It all makes for a predictable film conclusion, although I can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life. The shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching. Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all.

{"value":"First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films.<br /><br />With that being said, I struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. Taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie R2 suddenly being a badass, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the \"NOOOOOO!\" Frankenstein scene). When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a \"dark\" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.<br /><br />I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?","finished_norm":["let","me","prefac","thi","post","by","sai","that","i","be","a","fan","of","the","origin","star","war","moviesi","do","not","read","the","book","plai","the","game","wear","the","underwear","or","eat","the","cereal","if","there","be","on","i","be","simpli","a","fan","of","the","filmsbr","br","with","that","be","sai","i","struggl","to","see","how","peopl","be","give","thi","movi","such","high","prais","take","thi","movi","by","itself","and","not","compar","it","to","it","terribl","predecessor","ep","i","do","not","understand","how","you","can","sai","thi","be","a","amaz","movi","for","all","of","the","terribl","shortcom","in","the","script","cheesi","dialogu","contriv","scene","ie","r","suddenli","be","a","badass","and","long","cgi","intens","chase","scene","that","have","littl","human","touch","horribl","act","and","note","plot","holeshow","be","thi","good","there","be","no","real","intern","dilemma","within","anakin","it","just","seem","like","a","switch","be","flip","and","he","be","evil","all","of","a","sudden","i","be","not","interest","in","the","movi","until","the","last","minut","or","so","which","by","the","wai","be","ruin","by","the","noooooo","frankenstein","scene","when","you","bombard","the","screen","with","intens","amaz","cgi","effect","and","fill","in","the","gap","with","absolut","atroci","onelin","when","much","can","have","and","should","have","be","sai","thi","be","not","a","great","movi","for","a","film","with","such","a","dark","tone","there","be","too","much","leviti","in","the","speech","of","all","charactersbr","br","i","close","with","a","question","from","the","begin","to","the","end","of","the","film","be","there","realli","a","sens","of","urgenc","and","import","for","what","be","actual","about","to","take","place"],"filtered":["let","prefac","thi","post","sai","fan","origin","star","war","moviesi","read","book","plai","game","wear","underwear","eat","cereal","simpli","fan","filmsbr","br","sai","struggl","see","peopl","give","thi","movi","high","prais","take","thi","movi","compar","terribl","predecessor","ep","understand","sai","thi","amaz","movi","terribl","shortcom","script","cheesi","dialogu","contriv","scene","ie","r","suddenli","badass","long","cgi","intens","chase","scene","littl","human","touch","horribl","act","note","plot","holeshow","thi","good","real","intern","dilemma","within","anakin","seem","like","switch","flip","evil","sudden","interest","movi","last","minut","wai","ruin","noooooo","frankenstein","scene","bombard","screen","intens","amaz","cgi","effect","fill","gap","absolut","atroci","onelin","much","sai","thi","great","movi","film","dark","tone","much","leviti","speech","charactersbr","br","close","question","begin","end","film","realli","sens","urgenc","import","actual","take","place"],"filtered2":["let","prefac","post","fan","origin","star","war","moviesi","read","book","plai","game","wear","underwear","eat","cereal","simpli","fan","filmsbr","struggl","see","peopl","give","high","prais","take","compar","terribl","predecessor","ep","understand","amaz","terribl","shortcom","script","cheesi","dialogu","contriv","scene","ie","r","suddenli","badass","long","cgi","intens","chase","scene","littl","human","touch","horribl","act","note","plot","holeshow","good","real","intern","dilemma","within","anakin","seem","like","switch","flip","evil","sudden","interest","last","minut","wai","ruin","noooooo","frankenstein","scene","bombard","screen","intens","amaz","cgi","effect","fill","gap","absolut","atroci","onelin","great","dark","tone","leviti","speech","charactersbr","close","question","begin","end","realli","sens","urgenc","import","actual","take","place"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,13,14,19,21,23,24,30,31,32,33,35,40,51,52,59,60,69,77,80,99,100,106,124,140,144,145,147,151,164,166,173,192,201,211,212,222,230,248,292,295,314,321,368,374,378,482,514,530,543,553,560,599,600,672,685,710,745,785,842,967,1012,1180,1219,1223,1350,1381,1416,1579,1602,1603,1653,1784,2142,2878,3052,3080,3101,3229,3230,4258,4295,4899,5951,7161,7257,7998],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,13,14,19,21,23,24,30,31,32,33,35,40,51,52,59,60,69,77,80,99,100,106,124,140,144,145,147,151,164,166,173,192,201,211,212,222,230,248,292,295,314,321,368,374,378,482,514,530,543,553,560,599,600,672,685,710,745,785,842,967,1012,1180,1219,1223,1350,1381,1416,1579,1602,1603,1653,1784,2142,2878,3052,3080,3101,3229,3230,4258,4295,4899,5951,7161,7257,7998],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,3.9371420340352055,1.162015545335049,1

{"value":"I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago, and said to myself, \"Seems funny, plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!\" I proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it. I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted. Wooden performances abound. All the \"hilarious\" and \"outstanding\" performances promised never seemed to arrive. After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back. I literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered \"comedy\" I didn't want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I just became angry. I began to yell at the movie, and I'm not one to talk to movies period. Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even. The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding. The fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.","finished_norm":["i","foolishli","read","the","back","of","the","dvd","cover","of","thi","movi","in","well","bui","about","a","year","ago","and","sai","to","myself","seem","funni","plu","it","have","michael","clark","duncan","how","can","i","lose","i","proce","to","pai","plu","tax","for","it","i","take","it","over","to","a","friend","hous","and","we","both","stand","aghast","at","how","poorli","it","be","write","and","act","wooden","perform","abound","all","the","hilari","and","outstand","perform","promis","never","seem","to","arriv","after","minut","i","hang","my","head","in","shame","know","that","i","can","never","get","that","minut","or","back","i","liter","almost","cry","a","good","becaus","if","that","be","what","can","be","consid","comedi","i","do","not","want","to","believ","in","movi","anymor","my","friend","and","i","constantli","inform","a","friend","of","our","of","the","horror","of","thi","movi","to","the","point","that","he","ne","to","see","it","just","to","understand","how","bad","it","be","over","the","holidai","season","thi","year","i","watch","it","with","him","becaus","he","do","not","want","to","watch","it","alon","thi","be","my","next","horribl","mistak","becaus","a","i","watch","i","just","becom","angri","i","begin","to","yell","at","the","movi","and","i","be","not","on","to","talk","to","movi","period","everyon","i","know","that","have","even","glimps","thi","movi","have","agre","it","the","wrong","thei","have","ever","see","my","sens","of","humor","be","sick","and","twist","and","often","offend","my","friend","but","that","can","not","save","thi","movi","even","the","fact","that","thi","movi","be","not","on","the","bottom","list","on","imdb","be","astound","the","fact","that","it","rate","at","the","time","of","thi","write","be","be","a","crime","against","human"],"filtered":["foolishli","read","back","dvd","cover","thi","movi","well","bui","year","ago","sai","seem","funni","plu","michael","clark","duncan","lose","proce","pai","plu","tax","take","friend","hous","stand","aghast","poorli","write","act","wooden","perform","abound","hilari","outstand","perform","promis","never","seem","arriv","minut","hang","head","shame","know","never","get","minut","back","liter","almost","cry","good","becaus","consid","comedi","want","believ","movi","anymor","friend","constantli","inform","friend","horror","thi","movi","point","ne","see","understand","bad","holidai","season","thi","year","watch","becaus","want","watch","alon","thi","next","horribl","mistak","becaus","watch","becom","angri","begin","yell","movi","talk","movi","period","everyon","know","even","glimps","thi","movi","agre","wrong","thei","ever","see","sens","humor","sick","twist","often","offend","friend","save","thi","movi","even","fact","thi","movi","bottom","list","imdb","astound","fact","rate","time","thi","write","crime","human"],"filtered2":["foolishli","read","back","dvd","cover","well","bui","year","ago","seem","funni","plu","michael","clark","duncan","lose","proce","pai","plu","tax","take","friend","hous","stand","aghast","poorli","write","act","wooden","perform","abound","hilari","outstand","perform","promis","never","seem","arriv","minut","hang","head","shame","know","never","get","minut","back","liter","almost","cry","good","becaus","consid","comedi","want","believ","anymor","friend","constantli","inform","friend","horror","point","ne","see","understand","bad","holidai","season","year","watch","becaus","want","watch","alon","next","horribl","mistak","becaus","watch","becom","angri","begin","yell","talk","period","everyon","know","even","glimps","agre","wrong","ever","see","sens","humor","sick","twist","often","offend","friend","save","even","fact","bottom","list","imdb","astound","fact","rate","time","write","crime","human"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,20,21,22,25,26,31,35,37,42,44,57,59,62,63,65,66,83,91,97,105,110,115,127,131,145,147,161,173,186,189,202,208,212,213,221,230,246,247,292,297,317,322,347,369,377,398,400,435,457,466,491,574,591,592,601,610,622,632,683,743,749,753,778,817,848,856,860,891,897,1043,1101,1156,1161,1352,1630,1663,1773,1878,2031,2403,2422,4333,4600,5150,5744,6854],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,8,9,20,21,22,25,26,31,35,37,42,44,57,59,62,63,65,66,83,91,97,105,110,115,127,131,145,147,161,173,186,189,202,208,212,213,221,230,246,247,292,297,317,322,347,369,377,398,400,435,457,466,491,574,591,592,601,610,622,632,683,743,749,753,778,817,848,856,860,891,897,1043,1101,1156,1161,1352,1630,1663,1773,1878,2031,2403,2422,4333,4600,5150,5744,6854],"values":[1.311400410938

{"value":"Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, then started making dreadful Hal Needham car chase flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling Last Action Hero. And here, loquacious Eddie Murphy erases memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this \"family\" adventure flick, which is an unbelievably tedious, childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see Charlotte Lewis's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film.<br /><br />The story is pure humdrum. It concerns social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the Chosen One. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, classy actor Charles Dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is easily the worst. I've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a non formulaic kind of film, and while both points are loosely true there's no forgiving the fact that the film - however atypical and non formulaic it might be - is an absolute load of garbage.<br /><br

{"value":"was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie? the character, leon, is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore. some movies can get away with the sexual jokes, and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on. some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie. scary movie was stupid, and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes. the only role, besides leon, that had some humor that followed was will ferrell. the character really was dumb and that was all, the dumb humor was all that had me watching. the movie was ok, and nothing else. i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. the skits last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit, then what is the world coming to? molly shannon had superstar, cheri o'terri had scary movie, but she wasnt a leading role, and will had elf. but that was good, but he did some dumb movie, but i cant remember, and mike myers with wayne's world. how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals? seen only one guy break through, but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick. but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue, funny or not. this movie is not good, but had some positive humor. what a waste of film and people's money.

{"value":"I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with extremely low-budget movies, and I have enjoyed movies with worse production values than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing. check out 'wiseguys vs. zombies,' if you're interested). Indeed, I prefer lower budget zombie films, because I am suspicious that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are 'about.'<br /><br />But ZB3 was just so bad. It was retarded. I don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism. I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it really only took ~80 minutes, because partway through I put it into 1.4X fast forward.<br /><br />Okay, here's some criticism.<br /><br />1. The pacing was TERRIBLE. Everyone talked in monologues. Even when someone just had a single line, the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of F-bombs into every sentence made the line FEEL like a monologue. At first I was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to ZB1's 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer 'events' in ZB3. It's all talking.<br /><br />2. The gore effects got stupider. Just glop rubbed around on people's tummies.<br /><br />3. Despite the epic exposition, there really wasn't a plot. And the exposition is indeed epic! I won't spoil it, if you're going to watch it.

{"value":"A battleship is sinking... Its survivors, hanging onto a nearby liferaft, sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks.<br /><br />Even though Noel Coward's name is the only one that you notice during the credits, everything that's cinematic in it is because of Lean. And on technical terms, its very good. David Lean just KNEW films from the get-go. There are many moments where Coward's studied dialogue takes a second seat and Lean's visual sense takes centre stage. Try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end, and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing, the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed.<br /><br />Noel Coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen. He's totally wooden, not displaying emotion, character or humanity. You can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying, he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line.<br /><br />7/10.<br /><br />Its episodic, a bit repetitive, and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story that they advance, just give general insights into the characters. Still, its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for Lean. Its not a very deep or penetrating film, and its definitely a propaganda film, but its also a showcase for Lean's editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put

{"value":"I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there's too much dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, \"That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,\" possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this.<br /><br />Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it.","finished_norm":["i","be","realli","shock","that","a","great","director","like","chuck","jone","start","out","make","some","of","the","much","incredibli","bore","cartoon","i","have","ever","see","i","do","not","laugh","onc","throughout","thi","short","and","it","a","bug","bunni","cartoon","for","christ","sake","bug","bunni","cartoon","be","alwai","funni","not","bore","ala","thi","short","turn","out","to","be","good","night","elmer","anoth","incredibli","bore","jone","short","with","the","addit","of","bug","bunnybr","br","the","warn","sign","of","a","dull","cartoon","be","alwai","no","gag","payoff","good","night","elmer","be","bore","becaus","it","drag","on","the","same","two","gag","forev","with","predict","payoff","thi","cartoon","on","the","other","hand","be","afflict","with","the","warn","sign","of","a","dull","cartoon","there","too","much","dialogu","the","cartoon","at","littl","have","much","than","two","gag","up","it","sleev","but","much","of","them","seem","long","than","thei","be","thank","to","the","immens","pad","of","the","dialogu","at","on","point","elmer","finish","eat","dinner","and","comment","that","be","weawwi","awfuwwi","good","weg","of","wamb","possibli","the","much","redund","dialogu","i","have","ever","hear","in","a","cartoon","charact","read","text","out","loud","in","the","laterera","woodi","woodpeck","cartoon","doe","not","count","in","my","book","even","though","thi","cartoon","be","onli","minut","long","it","feel","like","thank","to","redund","dialogu","like","thisbr","br","elmer","pet","rabbit","be","not","a","fun","cartoon","for","me","but","if","you","have","sell","your","soul","to","chuck","jone","and","be","unabl","to","acknowledg","that","he","direct","a","few","clunker","dure","hi","career","you","mai","enjoi","it"],"filtered":["realli","shock","great","director","like","chuck","jone","start","make","much","incredibli","bore","cartoon","ever","see","laugh","onc","throughout","thi","short","bug","bunni","cartoon","christ","sake","bug","bunni","cartoon","alwai","funni","bore","ala","thi","short","turn","good","night","elmer","anoth","incredibli","bore","jone","short","addit","bug","bunnybr","br","warn","sign","dull","cartoon","alwai","gag","payoff","good","night","elmer","bore","becaus","drag","two","gag","forev","predict","payoff","thi","cartoon","hand","afflict","warn","sign","dull","cartoon","much","dialogu","cartoon","littl","much","two","gag","sleev","much","seem","long","thei","thank","immens","pad","dialogu","point","elmer","finish","eat","dinner","comment","weawwi","awfuwwi","good","weg","wamb","possibli","much","redund","dialogu","ever","hear","cartoon","charact","read","text","loud","laterera","woodi","woodpeck","cartoon","doe","count","book","even","though","thi","cartoon","onli","minut","long","feel","like","thank","redund","dialogu","like","thisbr","br","elmer","pet","rabbit","fun","cartoon","sell","soul","chuck","jone","unabl","acknowledg","direct","clunker","dure","hi","career","mai","enjoi"],"filtered2":["realli","shock","great","director","like","chuck","jone","start","make","incredibli","bore","cartoon","ever","see","laugh","onc","throughout","short","bug","bunni","cartoon","christ","sake","bug","bunni","cartoon","alwai","funni","bore","ala","short","turn","good","night","elmer","anoth","incredibli","bore","jone","short","addit","bug","bunnybr","warn","sign","dull","cartoon","alwai","gag","payoff","good","night","elmer","bore","becaus","drag","two","gag","forev","predict","payoff","cartoon","hand","afflict","warn","sign","dull","cartoon","dialogu","cartoon","littl","two","gag","sleev","seem","long","thank","immens","pad","dialogu","point","elmer","finish","eat","dinner","comment","weawwi","awfuwwi","good","weg","wamb","possibli","redund","dialogu","ever","hear","cartoon","charact","read","text","loud","laterera","woodi","woodpeck","cartoon","doe","count","book","even","though","cartoon","onli","minut","long","feel","like","thank","redund","dialogu","like","thisbr","elmer","pet","rabbit","fun","cartoon","sell","soul","chuck","jone","unabl","acknowledg","direct","clunker","dure","career","mai","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,10,11,13,14,18,22,35,43,44,46,47,51,58,59,62,66,71,73,86,96,99,102,108,133,145,151,197,200,210,216,235,236,239,248,259,272,280,337,367,438,508,511,527,558,573,599,651,653,687,764,861,876,885,957,998,1006,1185,1195,1267,1270,1324,1502,1559,1761,1931,1973,2039,2161,2323,2424,2534,3096,3299,3352,3510,3620,3850,4882,5292,7474],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,11.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,10,11,13,14,18,22,35,43,44,46,47,51,58,59,62,66,71,73,86,96,99,102,108,133,145,15

{"value":"From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'Cruel Intentions', and how flat it landed. You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont... Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film... Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie... How original is that for a prequel. Then it turns into a low budget 'Wild Things' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my \"twists\". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he is a bad actor, he's good.. He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash. As a whole, this \"movie\" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode. The score has been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker'... Yes, they used the score from JAWBREAKER... Couldn't they at least leave that one alone?! You'll want to pass this one. If you want more Cruel Intentions, watch Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons.","finished_norm":["from","the","veri","open","scene","you","will","notic","just","how","hard","thei","try","to","mimic","the","veri","smart","and","power","cruel","intent","and","how","flat","it","land","you","will","conjur","notic","what","a","terribl","choic","thei","make","by","cast","robin","dunn","a","valmont","then","in","the","scene","you","meet","the","two","well","thing","in","thi","movi","ami","adam","and","mimi","roger","a","kathryn","and","her","mother","that","be","if","you","can","get","past","the","fact","that","kathryn","be","not","blond","in","the","film","then","the","movi","go","on","you","see","the","cheap","romant","stori","from","mile","ago","and","you","notic","sebastian","have","alreadi","meet","a","anett","in","the","past","here","call","daniel","and","a","cecil","here","call","cheri","how","origin","be","that","for","a","prequel","then","it","turn","into","a","low","budget","wild","thing","typ","of","film","with","lot","and","lot","of","ohmi","twist","a","i","mention","robin","dunn","be","a","veri","bad","choic","not","that","he","be","a","bad","actor","he","good","he","just","doe","not","have","the","charisma","ryan","do","ami","adam","who","be","in","my","opinion","on","of","the","much","talent","young","actress","of","our","time","onc","again","deliv","but","with","all","the","talent","in","the","world","there","be","no","wai","on","can","save","thi","trash","a","a","whole","thi","movi","feel","like","a","beverli","hill","episod","the","score","have","be","steal","from","cruel","intent","and","jawbreak","ye","thei","us","the","score","from","jawbreak","can","not","thei","at","littl","leav","that","on","alon","you","will","want","to","pass","thi","on","if","you","want","much","cruel","intent","watch","stephen","frear","danger","liaison"],"filtered":["veri","open","scene","notic","hard","thei","try","mimic","veri","smart","power","cruel","intent","flat","land","conjur","notic","terribl","choic","thei","make","cast","robin","dunn","valmont","scene","meet","two","well","thing","thi","movi","ami","adam","mimi","roger","kathryn","mother","get","past","fact","kathryn","blond","film","movi","go","see","cheap","romant","stori","mile","ago","notic","sebastian","alreadi","meet","anett","past","call","daniel","cecil","call","cheri","origin","prequel","turn","low","budget","wild","thing","typ","film","lot","lot","ohmi","twist","mention","robin","dunn","veri","bad","choic","bad","actor","good","doe","charisma","ryan","ami","adam","opinion","much","talent","young","actress","time","onc","deliv","talent","world","wai","save","thi","trash","whole","thi","movi","feel","like","beverli","hill","episod","score","steal","cruel","intent","jawbreak","ye","thei","us","score","jawbreak","thei","littl","leav","alon","want","pass","thi","want","much","cruel","intent","watch","stephen","frear","danger","liaison"],"filtered2":["veri","open","scene","notic","hard","try","mimic","veri","smart","power","cruel","intent","flat","land","conjur","notic","terribl","choic","make","cast","robin","dunn","valmont","scene","meet","two","well","thing","ami","adam","mimi","roger","kathryn","mother","get","past","fact","kathryn","blond","go","see","cheap","romant","stori","mile","ago","notic","sebastian","alreadi","meet","anett","past","call","daniel","cecil","call","cheri","origin","prequel","turn","low","budget","wild","thing","typ","lot","lot","ohmi","twist","mention","robin","dunn","veri","bad","choic","bad","actor","good","doe","charisma","ryan","ami","adam","opinion","talent","young","actress","time","onc","deliv","talent","world","wai","save","trash","whole","feel","like","beverli","hill","score","steal","cruel","intent","jawbreak","ye","us","score","jawbreak","littl","leav","alon","want","pass","want","cruel","intent","watch","stephen","frear","danger","liaison"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,14,15,17,18,19,20,29,33,36,37,39,41,43,47,56,69,72,74,92,96,97,111,135,142,165,166,171,189,209,217,236,242,256,276,285,330,350,351,355,365,384,397,435,440,457,487,517,518,538,578,593,610,671,688,809,811,864,870,978,985,1018,1107,1119,1206,1248,1347,1479,1627,1873,1984,2229,2450,2522,2623,3738,3788,4900,5389,5578,8301],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,14,15,17,18,19,20,29,33,36,37,39,41,43,47,56,69,72,74,92,96,97,111,135,142,165,166,171,189,209,217,236,242,256,276,285,330,350,351,355,365,384,397,435,440,457,487,517,518,538,578,593,610,671,688,809,811,864,870,978,985,1018,1107,1119,1206,1248,1347,1479,1627,1873,1984,2229,2450,2522,2623,3738,3788,4900,5389,5578,8301],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0

{"value":"The Dukes of Hazzard is quite an achievement  a $53m film that's worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25-year old TV show. The plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a bland thug, Michael Weston's Enos tiresome, a seemingly ideally-cast Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and Burt Reynolds, stuck in some purgatory where he's doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player, is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. You know a film is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences But worse than the script or the casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: seemingly born with no conception of comic timing, unable to do much more than basic two-shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film, he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise. There are a couple of neat post-modern moments revolving around the Confederate Flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in every episode, but no film that makes you pine for the days when Hal Needham was

{"value":"Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story about an ex-drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it.<br /><br />This film was....<br /><br />I saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad..But after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great( Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift)...I gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes...<br /><br />The script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare...It was weak, with weaker dialogue. It seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie. So Brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girl....and she say's 'Yes!' And if you need to act bad just throw racism around...As we learn from the 'Italian mobsters'...<br /><br />The acting was terrible to say the least...I found 'Hollywood Nicky', hilarious.<br /><br />I absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies. Lets face it the only reason P Diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangsters...The actress who plays Leticia was weak but beautiful. The sex scene was weak but we got to see her..which was okay...<br /><br />But overall I expected it shed light on how Carito ended up in prison and the love of his life...And the assassin towards the

{"value":"Well I too had heard read all the breathless reviews and comments about how this movie might deserve the Best Picture Oscar so I went to see it today. What a major disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews you will learn from members of the U.S. military who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are. They mirrored my own thoughts; as the movie played I - a complete civilian - kept thinking to myself, \"say WHAT? there's no way that would happen like that..\" 2) There's very little that actually happens in terms of plot. A new bomb disposal guy shows up to replace one who was killed (a death that isn't really clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S IT! 3) This movie is nowhere near as suspenseful as claimed. If you want suspense try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see a war movie that's emotionally powerful, try renting Go Tell The Spartans, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONALLY in a serendipitous supermarket encounter that it was a film he was immensely proud of and one he viewed as some of his finest work, and which he was still upset had been largely ignored in the wake of the over-hyped Apocalypse Now), or an old WWII black and white classic Sink The Bismark, which, especially for an English film, is unbelievably heart-wrenching.

{"value":"Whatever happened to British TV drama? From John Major through Tony Blair, the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women-focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals.<br /><br />(Or perhaps TVNZ doesn't buy the good stuff? Please let that be what it is...)<br /><br />The writer's long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clichés. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong on meaningful looks, each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve. Baleful looks, however, are a poor substitute for depth of character, if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with. <br /><br />Of course this is theoretically a thriller, about a murder investigation; but that's not as important as the central character's failing marriage and its attendant problems. Is Cusack's character's husband a complete bastard? Will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up? Making these the central issues isn't a sign of insight -- it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job.<br /><br />Lynda La Plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics ; evidently Paula Milne isn't up to the

{"value":"I had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations; basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever. But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. After watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better. <br /><br />The Protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring police officer. Who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders. Raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree. Finally Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives.<br /><br />THese two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters. The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly, which the movie could have survived without. <br /><br />To even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience.Certainly i am never going to the movies looking like Gautham's name on the production list.","finished_norm":["i","have","a","lot","of","hope","for","thi","movi","and","so","watch","it","with","a","lot","of","expect","basic","becaus","of","kamal","hassan","he","be","a","amaz","actor","who","have","mark","hi","foot","step","in","the","sand","of","time","forev","but","thi","movi","prove","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","after","watch","thi","the","movi","the","brutal","and","violenc","in","tenebra","and","clockwork","orang","look","far","well","br","br","the","protagonist","raghavan","be","a","veri","dare","polic","offic","who","be","assign","to","a","investig","brutal","serial","murder","raghavan","effici","find","the","connect","thread","in","thi","case","and","be","close","to","solv","the","murder","and","put","the","psycho","killer","two","psycholog","disturb","but","brilliant","medic","student","behind","bar","but","thei","escap","and","again","get","into","a","kill","spree","final","raghavan","kill","them","both","after","spare","mani","innoc","livesbr","br","thi","two","psychokil","be","the","on","who","be","go","to","keep","the","audienc","from","go","to","the","theater","the","murder","and","sexual","harass","and","rape","be","show","veri","explicitli","which","the","movi","can","have","surviv","without","br","br","to","even","imagin","that","teenag","and","kid","be","go","to","be","watch","thi","movi","in","the","theater","and","kind","of","pictur","it","be","bind","to","paint","in","their","mind","be","certainli","not","pretti","the","director","gautham","should","realiz","that","he","conjur","have","some","oblig","to","the","societi","and","hi","audiencecertainli","i","be","never","go","to","the","movi","look","like","gautham","name","on","the","product","list"],"filtered":["lot","hope","thi","movi","watch","lot","expect","basic","becaus","kamal","hassan","amaz","actor","mark","hi","foot","step","sand","time","forev","thi","movi","prove","wrong","movi","ever","see","watch","thi","movi","brutal","violenc","tenebra","clockwork","orang","look","far","well","br","br","protagonist","raghavan","veri","dare","polic","offic","assign","investig","brutal","serial","murder","raghavan","effici","find","connect","thread","thi","case","close","solv","murder","put","psycho","killer","two","psycholog","disturb","brilliant","medic","student","behind","bar","thei","escap","get","kill","spree","final","raghavan","kill","spare","mani","innoc","livesbr","br","thi","two","psychokil","go","keep","audienc","go","theater","murder","sexual","harass","rape","show","veri","explicitli","movi","surviv","without","br","br","even","imagin","teenag","kid","go","watch","thi","movi","theater","kind","pictur","bind","paint","mind","certainli","pretti","director","gautham","realiz","conjur","oblig","societi","hi","audiencecertainli","never","go","movi","look","like","gautham","name","product","list"],"filtered2":["lot","hope","watch","lot","expect","basic","becaus","kamal","hassan","amaz","actor","mark","foot","step","sand","time","forev","prove","wrong","ever","see","watch","brutal","violenc","tenebra","clockwork","orang","look","far","well","protagonist","raghavan","veri","dare","polic","offic","assign","investig","brutal","serial","murder","raghavan","effici","find","connect","thread","case","close","solv","murder","put","psycho","killer","two","psycholog","disturb","brilliant","medic","student","behind","bar","escap","get","kill","spree","final","raghavan","kill","spare","mani","innoc","livesbr","two","psychokil","go","keep","audienc","go","theater","murder","sexual","harass","rape","show","veri","explicitli","surviv","without","even","imagin","teenag","kid","go","watch","theater","kind","pictur","bind","paint","mind","certainli","pretti","director","gautham","realiz","conjur","oblig","societi","audiencecertainli","never","go","look","like","gautham","name","product","list"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,15,16,20,22,25,28,38,39,41,42,44,47,50,58,72,76,78,101,114,122,125,130,134,143,156,159,168,181,190,238,252,273,286,288,295,311,340,389,393,405,424,453,471,519,540,587,601,626,638,685,693,717,746,767,839,868,886,912,981,1049,1060,1070,1113,1134,1153,1191,1281,1324,1725,1741,1798,1810,1851,2107,2401,2841,2970,3245,3350,3375,3857,4812,5200,5406,5556],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,15,16,20,22,25,28,38,39,41,42,44,47,50,58,72,76,78,101,114,122,125,130,134,143,156,159,168,181,190,238,252,273,286,288,295,311,340,389,393,405,424,453,471,519,540,587,601,626,638,685,693,717,746,767,839,868,886,912,981,1049,1060,1070,1113,1134,1153,1191,1281,1324,1725,1741,1798,

{"value":"After mob boss Vic Moretti (late great Anthony Franciosa) kills his lady whom has been cheating on him with Derek, their new chauffeur/ Vietnam vet, and blames it on the poor guy, Derek finds himself in jail where he has to contend with a corrupt warden, Vic's prisoner brother who runs the jail, and, oh yeah illegal experiments conducted by a shady CIA agent (great genre-mainstay and first time director John Saxon) to turn various prisoners into super-human invincible zombies. Of course things get out of hand and it's up to Derek, and the rest of the unchanged prisoners, to save the day after the infected ones take the jail over.<br /><br />John Saxon is a great talented actor & as a director Saxon is a... great talented actor. To say this movie (John's sole directorial outing to date) lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement. However, the film isn't totally without merit. The dialog, while idiotic, is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes. Sadly, this isn't really enough for the movie to coast by on that alone and it takes forever for the film to even start coming into it's own (which is fairly late in the movie). As such, the most I can recommend this film is to say that if you're a fan of Saxon (which I indeed am), it's worth one watch, just go in with low expectations and you should be fine.<br /><br />Eye

{"value":"You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all crap (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director Sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast, dreadful visual effects (some crap CGI and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark shoddy gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once was enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?","finished_norm":["you","have","get","to","admir","director","todd","sheet","for","hi","dedic","drive","and","enthusiasm","when","it","come","to","moviemak","between","and","he","make","a","whop","film","unfortun","if","hi","zombi","bloodbath","trilogi","be","anyth","to","go","by","thei","re","probabl","all","crap","and","a","quick","look","at","their","imdb","rate","seem","to","verifi","my","hunchbr","br","part","see","a","group","of","obnoxi","student","find","detent","a","littl","much","event","than","usual","after","thei","be","attack","by","hord","of","the","live","dead","who","have","escap","from","a","topsecret","armi","base","locat","directli","beneath","their","school","work","from","a","dread","script","by","brian","eklund","which","reli","heavili","on","liber","us","of","the","fbomb","director","sheet","deliv","yet","anoth","embarrassingli","amateurish","effort","featur","some","mindnumbingli","aw","perform","from","hi","talentfre","cast","dread","visual","effect","some","crap","cgi","and","what","look","like","the","front","of","a","giant","cardboard","spaceshuttl","and","hi","trademark","shoddi","gore","hand","of","offal","pull","from","beneath","hi","victim","clothingbr","br","final","after","what","seem","like","a","etern","watch","irrit","charact","run","for","their","live","and","unconvinc","undead","peopl","fondl","anim","innard","zombi","armageddon","finish","with","a","timetravelparadox","twist","end","which","forc","viewer","to","rewatch","sever","tortur","minut","from","the","begin","of","the","film","honestli","onc","be","enough","mr","sheetswhat","have","we","do","to","deserv","have","to","watch","it","again"],"filtered":["get","admir","director","todd","sheet","hi","dedic","drive","enthusiasm","come","moviemak","make","whop","film","unfortun","hi","zombi","bloodbath","trilogi","anyth","go","thei","re","probabl","crap","quick","look","imdb","rate","seem","verifi","hunchbr","br","part","see","group","obnoxi","student","find","detent","littl","much","event","usual","thei","attack","hord","live","dead","escap","topsecret","armi","base","locat","directli","beneath","school","work","dread","script","brian","eklund","reli","heavili","liber","us","fbomb","director","sheet","deliv","yet","anoth","embarrassingli","amateurish","effort","featur","mindnumbingli","aw","perform","hi","talentfre","cast","dread","visual","effect","crap","cgi","look","like","front","giant","cardboard","spaceshuttl","hi","trademark","shoddi","gore","hand","offal","pull","beneath","hi","victim","clothingbr","br","final","seem","like","etern","watch","irrit","charact","run","live","unconvinc","undead","peopl","fondl","anim","innard","zombi","armageddon","finish","timetravelparadox","twist","end","forc","viewer","rewatch","sever","tortur","minut","begin","film","honestli","onc","enough","mr","sheetswhat","deserv","watch"],"filtered2":["get","admir","director","todd","sheet","dedic","drive","enthusiasm","come","moviemak","make","whop","unfortun","zombi","bloodbath","trilogi","anyth","go","re","probabl","crap","quick","look","imdb","rate","seem","verifi","hunchbr","part","see","group","obnoxi","student","find","detent","littl","event","usual","attack","hord","live","dead","escap","topsecret","armi","base","locat","directli","beneath","school","work","dread","script","brian","eklund","reli","heavili","liber","us","fbomb","director","sheet","deliv","yet","anoth","embarrassingli","amateurish","effort","featur","mindnumbingli","aw","perform","talentfre","cast","dread","visual","effect","crap","cgi","look","like","front","giant","cardboard","spaceshuttl","trademark","shoddi","gore","hand","offal","pull","beneath","victim","clothingbr","final","seem","like","etern","watch","irrit","charact","run","live","unconvinc","undead","peopl","fondl","anim","innard","zombi","armageddon","finish","timetravelparadox","twist","end","forc","viewer","rewatch","sever","tortur","minut","begin","honestli","onc","enough","mr","sheetswhat","deserv","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,10,14,16,23,24,34,35,38,48,56,58,59,61,68,73,77,92,93,104,105,106,116,137,138,147,148,156,194,202,227,228,235,236,265,268,277,279,296,305,313,316,334,338,357,358,401,410,423,435,461,470,495,517,535,544,573,591,626,635,638,757,773,775,802,907,958,982,995,1012,1173,1188,1273,1399,1426,1518,1692,1816,1887,1987,2098,2561,2575,2650,2870,3312,3417,3424,4014,4207,4427,4480,4587,5439,5887,6000,6279,7505,7544,8107,8151],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,10,14,16,23,24,34,35,38,48,56,58,59,61

{"value":"This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. There are two routes to take in horror films: either you don't really explain what's going on (or who the killer is, like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained (Halloween could potentially be an example of this).<br /><br />Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character is fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.<br /><br />In the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film.<br /><br />This film will go down as another example of a film (as most are) that could be so much better even though it would never be great. The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting: the characters, story, direction, and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.<br /><br />Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless, silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it...","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","a","perfect","exampl","of","the","recent","crop","of","horror","film","that","simpli","be","not","fulli","realiz","there","be","two","rout","to","take","in","horror","film","either","you","do","not","realli","explain","what","go","on","or","who","the","killer","be","like","in","texa","chainsaw","massacr","or","give","the","charact","a","lot","of","back","stori","and","character","so","that","everyth","be","explain","halloween","can","potenti","be","a","exampl","of","thisbr","br","unfortun","creep","fail","in","thi","area","i","see","absolut","no","reason","to","give","a","small","shred","of","the","back","stori","for","craig","without","fulli","captur","the","essenc","of","hi","charact","or","hi","motiv","no","charact","be","fulli","realiz","although","the","circular","natur","of","kate","charact","in","the","film","be","the","much","accomplish","part","of","the","storybr","br","in","the","end","thi","stori","be","mostli","unmotiv","and","none","of","the","perform","give","it","the","necessari","life","to","make","it","enthral","or","interest","enough","to","overcom","the","lack","of","context","and","empti","filmmak","that","drag","down","the","filmbr","br","thi","film","will","go","down","a","anoth","exampl","of","a","film","a","much","be","that","can","be","so","much","well","even","though","it","would","never","be","great","the","onli","thing","that","be","us","properli","in","the","film","be","the","set","the","charact","stori","direct","and","overal","write","would","have","benefit","from","a","seriou","face","liftbr","br","creep","doe","serv","a","purpos","a","a","mindless","silli","horror","movi","with","no","intellectu","or","emot","invest","but","sadli","that","about","it"],"filtered":["thi","film","perfect","exampl","recent","crop","horror","film","simpli","fulli","realiz","two","rout","take","horror","film","either","realli","explain","go","killer","like","texa","chainsaw","massacr","give","charact","lot","back","stori","character","everyth","explain","halloween","potenti","exampl","thisbr","br","unfortun","creep","fail","thi","area","see","absolut","reason","give","small","shred","back","stori","craig","without","fulli","captur","essenc","hi","charact","hi","motiv","charact","fulli","realiz","although","circular","natur","kate","charact","film","much","accomplish","part","storybr","br","end","thi","stori","mostli","unmotiv","none","perform","give","necessari","life","make","enthral","interest","enough","overcom","lack","context","empti","filmmak","drag","filmbr","br","thi","film","go","anoth","exampl","film","much","much","well","even","though","never","great","onli","thing","us","properli","film","set","charact","stori","direct","overal","write","benefit","seriou","face","liftbr","br","creep","doe","serv","purpos","mindless","silli","horror","movi","intellectu","emot","invest","sadli"],"filtered2":["perfect","exampl","recent","crop","horror","simpli","fulli","realiz","two","rout","take","horror","either","realli","explain","go","killer","like","texa","chainsaw","massacr","give","charact","lot","back","stori","character","everyth","explain","halloween","potenti","exampl","thisbr","unfortun","creep","fail","area","see","absolut","reason","give","small","shred","back","stori","craig","without","fulli","captur","essenc","charact","motiv","charact","fulli","realiz","although","circular","natur","kate","charact","accomplish","part","storybr","end","stori","mostli","unmotiv","none","perform","give","necessari","life","make","enthral","interest","enough","overcom","lack","context","empti","filmmak","drag","filmbr","go","anoth","exampl","well","even","though","never","great","onli","thing","us","properli","set","charact","stori","direct","overal","write","benefit","seriou","face","liftbr","creep","doe","serv","purpos","mindless","silli","horror","intellectu","emot","invest","sadli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,10,11,13,17,18,20,24,29,30,31,42,47,51,56,60,61,63,65,72,73,75,83,86,93,95,102,105,109,125,183,193,201,207,215,222,227,237,251,252,307,323,363,370,385,395,405,412,456,493,506,510,547,562,566,677,706,764,794,815,902,925,1144,1157,1267,1367,1470,1594,1704,1769,1819,1930,1950,2000,2012,2037,2079,2156,2158,2200,2442,2604,2976,3271,4079,4135,4156,5074,7098,8356],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,10,11,13,17,18,20,24,29,30,31,42,47,51,56,60,61,63,65,72,73,75,83,86,93,95,102,105,109,125,183,193,201,207,215,222,227,237,251,252,307,323,363,370,385,395,405,412,456,493,506,510,547,562,566,677,706,764,794,815,902,925,1144,1157,1267,1367,

{"value":"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short.<br /><br />\"The Grinch\" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. I used to like him very much in his \"Waynes World\" and \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and \"the Cat In The Hat\" has just finished me off. <br /><br />This film was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was \"Mom\". They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for Myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the Cat.<br /><br />I mean - did Myers even glance at a script? Was one written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the Cat just seemed to be winging it!<br /><br />On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!!

{"value":"I suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language, and corny one-liners. Minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when employed properly. However, this film is not one of those cases.<br /><br />Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary, sparse scenery. I'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight, because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. The acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end). The scenery is drab, and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. I would call this anticlimatic, but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the \"erotic\" scenes... it would be untrue. I'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three amusing moments, this film is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and dreary
