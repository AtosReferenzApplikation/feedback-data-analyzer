{"value":"Saw a screener of this before last year's Award season, didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended, but whatever, maybe for exposure, at the least, but the movie was a convoluted mess. Sure, some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. There was not one person that I could connect with, and I think that is where it failed for me. Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea...let's see if that already hasn't been mined to the point of futility. The whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional, I can tell, and so can everyone else, no one is laughing with you though). Anyways, I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least, I wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed. But it's tripe either way. Boring tripe at that.","finished_norm":["see","a","screener","of","thi","befor","last","year","award","season","do","not","realli","know","why","thei","give","them","out","after","the","vote","have","end","but","whatev","mayb","for","exposur","at","the","littl","but","the","movi","be","a","convolut","mess","sure","some","part","be","funni","in","a","black","humor","kind","of","wai","but","none","of","the","charact","feel","veri","real","to","me","at","all","there","be","not","on","person","that","i","can","connect","with","and","i","think","that","be","where","it","fail","for","me","sure","the","plot","be","somewhat","interest","and","veri","subvers","toward","scientologi","wow","what","a","grand","idealet","see","if","that","alreadi","have","not","be","mine","to","the","point","of","futil","the","whole","ordeal","feel","fake","from","the","light","the","cast","the","screenplai","to","the","horribl","visual","effectswhich","be","suppos","to","be","intent","i","can","tell","and","so","can","everyon","els","no","on","be","laugh","with","you","though","anywai","i","hope","it","make","it","out","for","sale","on","dvd","at","littl","i","would","not","want","a","project","that","a","lot","of","peopl","obvious","put","a","lot","of","effort","into","get","complet","unnot","but","it","tripe","either","wai","bore","tripe","at","that"],"filtered":["see","screener","thi","befor","last","year","award","season","realli","know","thei","give","vote","end","whatev","mayb","exposur","littl","movi","convolut","mess","sure","part","funni","black","humor","kind","wai","none","charact","feel","veri","real","person","connect","think","fail","sure","plot","somewhat","interest","veri","subvers","toward","scientologi","wow","grand","idealet","see","alreadi","mine","point","futil","whole","ordeal","feel","fake","light","cast","screenplai","horribl","visual","effectswhich","suppos","intent","tell","everyon","els","laugh","though","anywai","hope","make","sale","dvd","littl","want","project","lot","peopl","obvious","put","lot","effort","get","complet","unnot","tripe","either","wai","bore","tripe"],"filtered2":["see","screener","befor","last","year","award","season","realli","know","give","vote","end","whatev","mayb","exposur","littl","convolut","mess","sure","part","funni","black","humor","kind","wai","none","charact","feel","veri","real","person","connect","think","fail","sure","plot","somewhat","interest","veri","subvers","toward","scientologi","wow","grand","idealet","see","alreadi","mine","point","futil","whole","ordeal","feel","fake","light","cast","screenplai","horribl","visual","effectswhich","suppos","intent","tell","everyon","els","laugh","though","anywai","hope","make","sale","dvd","littl","want","project","lot","peopl","obvious","put","lot","effort","get","complet","unnot","tripe","either","wai","bore","tripe"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,10,12,13,14,15,23,24,26,30,32,33,37,43,57,60,61,62,66,72,79,80,86,90,92,103,108,111,119,122,133,144,149,153,159,163,181,196,207,215,229,230,246,247,330,341,353,369,370,386,401,407,557,563,596,635,639,659,703,767,811,817,1003,1004,1189,1580,1744,2318,2766,3084,3997,4765,5296,7231],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,10,12,13,14,15,23,24,26,30,32,33,37,43,57,60,61,62,66,72,79,80,86,90,92,103,108,111,119,122,133,144,149,153,159,163,181,196,207,215,229,230,246,247,330,341,353,369,370,386,401,407,557,563,596,635,639,659,703,767,811,817,1003,1004,1189,1580,1744,2318,2766,3084,3997,4765,5296,7231],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,2.803707089537043,1.4876543214774305,3.321622407243643,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,1.929723173391612,3.841892750832105,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,2.0489535369135887,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,4.3306817978619945,2.2489347673732487,2.3212364753796515,2.2931108769894046,2.3253197803590226,2.3409902041158843,2.300267965194495,2.4000574358028657,2.4442286541160034,2.478925055209576,2.5531798379045583,2.605934685587711,2.8432628718938773,2.7121382192999195,2.673149229007135,2.7303758068497004,2.9292757465539174,2.933776879434709,3.0266839340212486,3.121829110937649,2.9958122703541616,3.0433232530252132,3.0879275592619675,3.120015873813468,3.4471119148061256,3.459754308221302,3.485528930909917,3.587125145032839,3.616452760127359,3.6405503117064195,3.6746621462132825,3.79165684915245,3.8425769395797067,4.197121

{"value":"It has a great name, but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone.<br /><br />And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) calls him an actor, but i don't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting!!....period. The little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing.<br /><br />For some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it, but they didn't!! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad, i don't buy it.<br /><br />But hopefully this is as bad as it gets. To make people accept those DVD's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it, that might work out.<br /><br

{"value":"Might contain possible spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stunk. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young.

{"value":"Guy Richie's third proper film (not counting the God-awful \"Swept Away\" is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling, gangsters and chess. Fans of Richie's previous efforts will probably hate Revolver as much as I did, with its twists and turns. Richie stalwart Jason Statham plays Jake, a newly-released ex-con, out to wreak revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha (a superbly OTT Ray Liotta) but instead gets embroiled with a couple of other cons, (one of which is Andre 3000 from rap outfit Outkast) who throw him and us the audience, a number of red herrings throughout the film, all of which becomes extremely tedious. The high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot, slow-mo shootout set to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. All in all, Revolver is a flawed work, not truly awful but far from Richie's best. That would still be Lock, Stock.

{"value":"Okay, I struggled to set aside the fact that in selling EVP as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get-go. I reasoned that hell, I don't believe in vampires but I still liked Dracula so I could live with this.<br /><br />However, even with that accepted the movie is just not very good. It's competently made and acted, but it doesn't really capture you at all. There are several \"jump\" moments, and I just looked at them and thought \"yeah, I didn't expect that\" without actually jumping in the slightest.<br /><br />Also the resolution doesn't make sense. If the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be, then why the hell does it need to use a proxy? Plus, the end caption was absurd. They obviously put it there as part of the \"give the movie credibility by claiming it's all real\" thing, but for that to work it really needs to be at the start. But they can't put it at the start because then they give the plot away... sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb.","finished_norm":["okai","i","struggl","to","set","asid","the","fact","that","in","sell","evp","a","real","the","movi","be","basic","lie","to","me","from","the","getgo","i","reason","that","hell","i","do","not","believ","in","vampir","but","i","still","like","dracula","so","i","can","live","with","thisbr","br","howev","even","with","that","accept","the","movi","be","just","not","veri","good","it","compet","make","and","act","but","it","doe","not","realli","captur","you","at","all","there","be","sever","jump","moment","and","i","just","look","at","them","and","think","ye","i","do","not","expect","that","without","actual","jump","in","the","slightestbr","br","conjur","the","resolut","doe","not","make","sens","if","the","forc","behind","thi","be","capabl","of","do","the","thing","it","seem","to","be","then","why","the","hell","doe","it","ne","to","us","a","proxi","plu","the","end","caption","be","absurd","thei","obvious","put","it","there","a","part","of","the","give","the","movi","credibl","by","claim","it","all","real","thing","but","for","that","to","work","it","realli","ne","to","be","at","the","start","but","thei","ca","not","put","it","at","the","start","becaus","then","thei","give","the","plot","awai","stick","it","in","at","the","end","just","make","it","stick","out","like","a","sore","thumb"],"filtered":["okai","struggl","set","asid","fact","sell","evp","real","movi","basic","lie","getgo","reason","hell","believ","vampir","still","like","dracula","live","thisbr","br","howev","even","accept","movi","veri","good","compet","make","act","doe","realli","captur","sever","jump","moment","look","think","ye","expect","without","actual","jump","slightestbr","br","conjur","resolut","doe","make","sens","forc","behind","thi","capabl","thing","seem","hell","doe","ne","us","proxi","plu","end","caption","absurd","thei","obvious","put","part","give","movi","credibl","claim","real","thing","work","realli","ne","start","thei","ca","put","start","becaus","thei","give","plot","awai","stick","end","make","stick","like","sore","thumb"],"filtered2":["okai","struggl","set","asid","fact","sell","evp","real","basic","lie","getgo","reason","hell","believ","vampir","still","like","dracula","live","thisbr","howev","even","accept","veri","good","compet","make","act","doe","realli","captur","sever","jump","moment","look","think","ye","expect","without","actual","jump","slightestbr","conjur","resolut","doe","make","sens","forc","behind","capabl","thing","seem","hell","doe","ne","us","proxi","plu","end","caption","absurd","obvious","put","part","give","credibl","claim","real","thing","work","realli","ne","start","ca","put","start","becaus","give","plot","awai","stick","end","make","stick","like","sore","thumb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,12,13,15,16,18,21,22,24,29,30,32,35,39,48,52,56,61,64,71,80,81,91,95,97,109,110,113,116,125,130,155,159,173,188,191,209,286,316,338,341,393,394,416,485,650,674,741,749,751,842,861,925,928,936,1207,1267,1361,1536,2145,2349,2362,2573,7278,7922],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,12,13,15,16,18,21,22,24,29,30,32,35,39,48,52,56,61,64,71,80,81,91,95,97,109,110,113,116,125,130,155,159,173,188,191,209,286,316,338,341,393,394,416,485,650,674,741,749,751,842,861,925,928,936,1207,1267,1361,1536,2145,2349,2362,2573,7278,7922],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,3.6459479802144523,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,2.6390769554676132,2.6728839783437044,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,3.8429853485101932,3.9903607800925114,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.125691139326857,4.2580959472608155,2.1521782565202803,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,2.3074766467914385,4.60053593038899,2.4368824319140248,2.5378812223426954,2.5460113484259455,2.6026896854443837,2.780700890737216,2.878207028279898,2.9720957437368454,2.933776879434709,3.120015873813468,6.193476377888245,6.280289282488163,4.160564361526816,3.6621227969605474,7.281100623412839,3.7165362186843414,3.7165362186843414,3.8023521382691974,3.8883864756110005,3.892300374932137,3.969732115064953,4.017463517886143,3.965503778955432,4.297765483040301,4.3215761317340196,4.396611317676934,4.5432147918688095,5.626901430320244,5.185068678041204,5.143104478942172,5.185068678041204,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.4456667624742866E-4,1.4443856840699138E-4,1.4447423140529275E-4,1.

{"value":"With the releasing of \"Farligt förflutet\" Swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day an old friend of Stefan´s arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan is to do a small courier job. He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the Sweden-Germany customs. Unfortunately things in Germany don´t work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern. Unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs. The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund.

{"value":"Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever. And as for the feminist polemic, it's laughable. I saw this garbage when it was first released and though I found it tedious beyond belief I'm glad I did go to see it. That's because I now have an immediate answer to the question 'what's the worst film you've ever seen?' Plus, I have the comfort of knowing that every film I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson. But I have to admit I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world (as is revealed in the closing credits).<br /><br />I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film. All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes, a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady, and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public.

{"value":"I realise that the US Army was demoralised by 1971, but this film was unbelievable. It was supposed to be a training camp not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The writer must be a real Army hater. The psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell, and the useless Black top sergeant should have been sacked as well. These men were going overseas, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from, and an investigation would have ensued. The scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one. Farrell, the alleged barrack room lawyer, would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order ( to torture POWs in contravention to the Geneva Convention ), actual assault on an enlisted man, sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer. Intead he just walks away. After this, discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable.

{"value":"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist it just doesn't work. I had a really hard time accepting this.Not that I don't think Tom can't act he can I've been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole fails for me.The additions Jude Law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones. There are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really did enjoy the score, But Tom

{"value":"I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I'm also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter. However, after watching it, I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The movie's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. The director lingered on certain scenes for much too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was barely any dialogue. Dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. At the end of the movie, you didn't feel any compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in everything. The script was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which captures your attention, maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by. This movie felt as though it would never end.

{"value":"The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time I've ever endured. For roughly 75 minutes, you are subjected to the WORST acting (and I don't mean that in a good way either, like as in KILLER NERD which had great horrible acting) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely NOTHING to do with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title. That said, there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that. You spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything. Speaking of the kids, the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery. Did I mention it was shot on video as well? If you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life, then by all means watch it.

{"value":"Awful. This thriller should have buried. What a piece of crap. Terrible writing, characters are less than believable. Horrible Schlock!! Stick some B- stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit, but it fails miserably. If I didn't have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review, it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'.<br /><br />Horrible ending, retarded. Who writes this crap. The ending of this film is so contrived, weak it's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie. It's a good thing that these actors are on the way out, because this would be a career killer. Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it. At least no one important, like future investors.

{"value":"People like me will tear this movie apart. It's just not realistic. The Plot is sooooooo predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens convientantly Of course, they find the treasure and become filthy rich, and trick the bad guy. We've seen it a million times before. The writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid. They must be right because The majority of people actually liked this film. I mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds. The secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway? You'd think with all the work that's gone on in New York underground That room would have been discovered before. and all that was constructed during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail?? how cute, and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler novels was weak.

{"value":"I'm not a big fan of the Stooges' slapstick, but I find their history interesting. I've recently tried to check out stuff from each Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy; this is the only one I've seen so far.<br /><br />Some say the quality problems with Joe-era shorts are really not Joe's fault, and I suspect that's the case. Joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this. The thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment: the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy-team/Stooges ethos. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived, by those in charge, as not really fitting in -- though there were no real off-camera conflicts between him & the others -- and this was their way of working around that.<br /><br />And what's with the titles of this and some of the other late Stooges shorts?

{"value":"A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does that whet your appetite? Well, then, belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history. For good measure, it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack Anne Rice. The directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog. Most of acting is amateurish. The production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that have barely been seen at all (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It also is, despite itself, a sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is on-hand as well. So, is the late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company.

{"value":"This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions all around, but which is confused and disjointed in execution.<br /><br />Garcia stars as John Berlin, an L.A. forensic detective who has moved to a small California town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there. He soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in. The known victim is theorized to be blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind.<br /><br />Despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where I found myself wondering, 'how the hell did we wind up here?' or 'how did we find this out?' I found it confusing and disjointed, despite the good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part toward the end as an F.B.I. investigator out to get Berlin.<br /><br />Not recommended.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","thriller","with","a","good","concept","good","act","good","photographi","and","good","intent","all","around","but","which","be","confus","and","disjoint","in","executionbr","br","garcia","star","a","john","berlin","a","la","forens","detect","who","have","move","to","a","small","california","town","at","the","behest","of","a","friend","of","hi","on","the","forc","there","he","soon","becom","involv","in","the","investig","of","a","unsolv","murder","which","lead","to","hi","theoriz","about","the","exist","of","a","serial","killer","whom","no","on","els","believ","in","the","know","victim","be","theoriz","to","be","blind","which","lead","to","a","romanc","with","a","blind","girl","believ","to","be","a","wit","at","a","nearbi","school","for","the","blindbr","br","despit","a","basic","intrigu","stori","there","be","too","mani","quantum","leap","and","plot","hole","in","thi","movi","where","i","find","myself","wonder","how","the","hell","do","we","wind","up","here","or","how","do","we","find","thi","out","i","find","it","confus","and","disjoint","despit","the","good","act","etc","john","malkovich","have","a","small","part","toward","the","end","a","a","fbi","investig","out","to","get","berlinbr","br","not","recommend"],"filtered":["thi","thriller","good","concept","good","act","good","photographi","good","intent","around","confus","disjoint","executionbr","br","garcia","star","john","berlin","la","forens","detect","move","small","california","town","behest","friend","hi","forc","soon","becom","involv","investig","unsolv","murder","lead","hi","theoriz","exist","serial","killer","els","believ","know","victim","theoriz","blind","lead","romanc","blind","girl","believ","wit","nearbi","school","blindbr","br","despit","basic","intrigu","stori","mani","quantum","leap","plot","hole","thi","movi","find","wonder","hell","wind","find","thi","find","confus","disjoint","despit","good","act","etc","john","malkovich","small","part","toward","end","fbi","investig","get","berlinbr","br","recommend"],"filtered2":["thriller","good","concept","good","act","good","photographi","good","intent","around","confus","disjoint","executionbr","garcia","star","john","berlin","la","forens","detect","move","small","california","town","behest","friend","forc","soon","becom","involv","investig","unsolv","murder","lead","theoriz","exist","serial","killer","els","believ","know","victim","theoriz","blind","lead","romanc","blind","girl","believ","wit","nearbi","school","blindbr","despit","basic","intrigu","stori","mani","quantum","leap","plot","hole","find","wonder","hell","wind","find","find","confus","disjoint","despit","good","act","etc","john","malkovich","small","part","toward","end","fbi","investig","get","berlinbr","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,17,21,24,26,32,38,50,61,84,91,98,100,115,157,161,175,196,241,252,273,275,286,291,296,298,338,363,391,394,427,429,449,450,528,535,563,714,725,766,810,811,851,892,1009,1017,1062,1113,1134,1372,1493,2247,2429,2546,2769,3028,3269,4426,7164],"values":[5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,17,21,24,26,32,38,50,61,84,91,98,100,115,157,161,175,196,241,252,273,275,286,291,296,298,338,363,391,394,427,429,449,450,528,535,563,714,725,766,810,811,851,892,1009,1017,1062,1113,1134,1372,1493,2247,2429,2546,2769,3028,3269,4426,7164],"values":[3.3930723249613526,0.7966340470719924,1.2770536940105968,2.324031090670098,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,4.557934924044366,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,2.2212694515902225,4.021185338082285,2.0881990796736947,2.1405462403177813,2.201553588425805,4.672030138951541,2.4323182980210873,2.3791142619576227,2.478925055209576,2.6627744961815836,3.0433232530252132,2.9674191958529437,2.7832848715031413,2.780700890737216,6.033663275156474,2.9504565686333644,2.7819920465008363,2.9720957437368454,6.069937971110711,6.218409915418504,3.0967381889441223,6.466109492095746,3.2872346624216657,3.2597778161886266,3.469984576472117,3.4198487640477615,3.4986697244709752,3.459754308221302,3.7297814454343623,3.7034641371169887,3.9825254665248626,3.8425769395797067,3.8425769395797067,3.857614816944247,3.9825254665248626,4.096025840389245,4.0536665665501035,4.327618446189983,8.537555892334098,4.403125998698128,4.403125998698128,9.210500365576523,10.128232135247083,5.501738287366237,5.214056214914456,5.426230734858092,5.408212229355414,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5958924807382347E-4,1.594478279730199E-4,1.5948719687345193E-4,1.594551348453434E-4,1.5947022538244336E-4,1.5944694882579906E-4,1.5949653904053564E-4,1.594232257203717E-4,1.5944786167068834E-4,1.596126337578946E-4,1.6087912

{"value":"This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus. This adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /><br />The spirit of Tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list (killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in Latin) by possessing the body of a college guy. He uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this, which the college boy willingly puts on his head, and then at several points in the movie, takes off and puts back on.<br /><br />Maria performs oral sex on a poor man's Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason, and has apparently been sitting next to CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Utter misfortune.<br /><br />This movie is empty and will hurt you.

{"value":"I'm not going to criticize the movie. There isn't that much to talk about. It has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time. Clyde Beatty isn't exactly a matinée idol. He's a little slight and not particularly good looking. But that's OK. He's the man in that lion cage. We know that when he can't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend, he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day. Someone said earlier that it is a history lesson. The scenes at the circus are of another day, especially the kids who hang around. I didn't realize that even back in the thirties, they sailed on three masted schooners. It looked like something out of 1860. I guess that's the stock footage they had. No wonder the thing got wrecked. They're always talking about fixing her up. There's even a dirigible. It tells us a little about male female relationships at the time, a kind of giggly silliness.

{"value":"Well...tremors I, the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one, i mean, ass blasters??? Now, only God himself is capable of answering the question \"why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie?\" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie, for it lives up to more than that. As i attempted to sit though it, i noticed that my eyes started to bleed, and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie (with the exact same occurrences) any better? honestly, i would never suggest

{"value":"I think I've seen all of the Grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor, except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERISH<br /><br />It's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do. He's a lawyer for Christ's sake. Why when his children go missing does he not call the Police. Oh yes it's because all the Police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked.<br /><br />When he's arrested for murder they just let him go free, he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing. <br /><br />Why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home.<br /><br />The Police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient, they don't bother to interview his daughter.<br /><br />As for the ridiculous ending.<br /><br />In summary, silly, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time.<br /><br />0/10 

{"value":"Råzone is an awful movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in \"krummernes Jul\", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!<br /><br />Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like \"Film folket\"!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the

{"value":"Probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever, badly acted and badly written.<br /><br />THE PLOT Five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm, but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one, the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or could it be one of the five characters.<br /><br />ACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from Daphne Zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest well quite dull although Laura Lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.<br /><br />THE KILLS Can't really see why they banned this, the kills look fake mostly, one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake, but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.<br /><br />OVERALL Not really

{"value":"We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It is basically a Broadway play put on film. The music is plain terrible. There isn't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie? You won't because there aren't any. Some of the musical numbers go on so long that I got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when I got back! If they were good songs well -- but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible character development. The lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone but die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most over rated movie I've seen in my entire life. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover -- who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough.

{"value":"Judging by some of the comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one, but essentially an action movie.<br /><br />Whatever it is that I watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins.<br /><br />Now subtract the first (they never appear in the movie). Then simply let one of the assassins, the princess, become a rogue on a revenge trip. Add in a rebel love-interest with a guilty conscience. And you've got the ingredients.<br /><br />But they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you're left with is a feeling of emptiness.

{"value":"This movie has successfully proved what we all already know, that professional basket-ball players suck at everything besides playing basket-ball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is. First of all, is it just me, or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can-opener. Secondly, why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even though he has magical powers, he sucks horribly at making music? Third, I have read the Bible. In no way shape or form did it say that Jesus made genies. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any acne-addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that. Fifth, why did the ending suck so badly? And what the hell is a djin?

{"value":"This mini series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as was `Queen', tried to use similar formulas, that is, constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years. Whereas in `Queen' the result was masterful, here in Mama Flora the inspiration was lacking. Firstly perhaps in the book itself, and most certainly in this TV production. Too much is put in with too much haste over the years, such that the unfolding saga is shallow, superficial, not nearly so authentic as in `Queen'. Full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasian-forsythian unpalatable mix in the last third of its three hours or so duration. I had hoped for more; but evidently Haley was less inspired with this tale than his near-biographical `Queen', and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman.

{"value":"A good cast (with one major exception) pushes its way through Epstein's smart light satire. Mansfield was never better, or funnier, than she is here paired with Walston, who's a veteran who's determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his buddies -- including suave con-artist Grant -- head to San Francisco on leave and start the city's swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours. The only thing about this movie that's not delightful is Suzy Parker's one-note performance as Grant's love interest, which takes up too much of the film's time and slows down the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the gimmick is that she's set on making love to every serviceman (to do her duty for the war effort, of course) but he's a married man who, nonetheless, loves his wife.

{"value":"When I started watching this movie I saw the dude from Buffy, Xander, and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies. Now a weird movie I can stand, given that it's a good dose of weird like for example David Lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc. And you sort of have to be in the mood for one. This one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no sense. I mean come on people Nazi's who conspire with America to make an unholy trinity of evil powers? I was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense, but seriously I don't condone drugs like I don't condone this movie. It should be burned, shredded and forgotten just so good ol' Xander might get another acting job. It wasn't his acting though, that was alright, but the script just didn't make any sense.

{"value":"The head of a common New York family, Jane Gail (as Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) at \"Smyrner's Candy Store\". After Ms. Grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves, Ms. Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman.<br /><br />\"Traffic in Souls\" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it isn't remarkably well done, and it doesn't show anything very unique in having a young woman's \"virtue\" threatened by sex traders. Perhaps, it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length (claimed to have been ten reels, originally). The New York City location scenes are the main attraction, after all these years. The panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move. <br /><br />**** Traffic in Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt

{"value":"I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this

{"value":"Naturally I didn't watch 'GI Jane' out of choice. I was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex-girlfriends house.<br /><br />GI Jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course it isn't. The result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints, restricting the amount of humour (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes, and soon becomes too serious. The film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable.<br /><br />'GI Jane' fails where other action films succeed, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and various others are larger than life, yet never proclaim to be otherwise. They are escapism, and therefore entertaining. 'GI Jane' tries to be real and fails.<br /><br />This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very non-credible storyline, unremarkable acting, and the only reason I give it 2/10
