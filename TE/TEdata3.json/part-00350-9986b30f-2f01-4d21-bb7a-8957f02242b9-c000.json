{"value":"This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","some","beauti","set","and","albert","finnei","doe","a","great","job","a","the","ruthless","father","the","movi","fail","becaus","jennif","jason","leigh","be","too","jumpi","a","the","daughter","and","be","no","match","whatev","for","olivia","de","havilland","far","much","nuanc","matur","render","in","the","heiress","the","film","feministlean","conclus","conjur","go","against","the","auster","conclus","of","the","novel","washington","squar","whose","author","henri","jame","savag","parodi","femin","in","some","of","hi","other","novel","a","a","fan","of","old","hollywood","and","great","literatur","i","find","thi","movi","veri","disappoint"],"filtered":["thi","movi","beauti","set","albert","finnei","doe","great","job","ruthless","father","movi","fail","becaus","jennif","jason","leigh","jumpi","daughter","match","whatev","olivia","de","havilland","far","much","nuanc","matur","render","heiress","film","feministlean","conclus","conjur","go","auster","conclus","novel","washington","squar","whose","author","henri","jame","savag","parodi","femin","hi","novel","fan","old","hollywood","great","literatur","find","thi","movi","veri","disappoint"],"filtered2":["beauti","set","albert","finnei","doe","great","job","ruthless","father","fail","becaus","jennif","jason","leigh","jumpi","daughter","match","whatev","olivia","de","havilland","far","nuanc","matur","render","heiress","feministlean","conclus","conjur","go","auster","conclus","novel","washington","squar","whose","author","henri","jame","savag","parodi","femin","novel","fan","old","hollywood","great","literatur","find","veri","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,15,18,22,38,39,51,67,101,109,140,187,215,289,300,325,342,426,474,556,598,620,750,919,957,1112,1294,1339,1578,1612,2025,2308,2382,2446,2475,2933,3363,3662,4140,4369,5029,6311,7055,7371,7555],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,15,18,22,38,39,51,67,101,109,140,187,215,289,300,325,342,426,474,556,598,620,750,919,957,1112,1294,1339,1578,1612,2025,2308,2382,2446,2475,2933,3363,3662,4140,4369,5029,6311,7055,7371,7555],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,3.4279798616619646,1.9570915389266579,2.098582041218749,2.125691139326857,2.317169775997098,2.4732161909892554,2.605934685587711,2.8282659991423613,2.932274249550174,2.973659465713028,3.112795625839981,3.3909310864081816,7.293333077447711,3.4471119148061256,3.5642670069567886,3.7568101178222815,4.030886538218284,4.235066888824737,7.939464230129906,4.2574141875167335,4.605250182788262,4.506310234933358,4.848596441419991,5.02684467282631,5.039114765418124,5.339219357868463,5.5623629091826725,5.185068678041204,5.170884043049248,5.463272006538442,5.967828017290836,5.672363804397,5.878215858601149,5.9370563586240825,6.543192162194399,6.489124940924123,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.07574883438870596,6.543668066605998E-5,6.594538846114768E-5,6.556435530407941E-5,6.556542950222385E-5,6.547378213425607E-5,6.566851033604919E-5,6.544610312049982E-5,6.559324981824898E-5,7.277213007892204E-5,0.2583326120619977,6.534045868079142E-5,6.656000593992612E-5,6.750949905029053E-5,6.538810426163634E-5,6.520739975376771E-5,6.683391677286108E-5,6.567466297978097E-5,0.07462926729164032,6.552517133559147E-5,6.6159165799549E-5,0.041214288909068385,6.58145846076736E-5,0.07231705747154968,6.639112974689947E-5,6.604392282885662E-5,6.88202838795693E-5,6.535988380005293E-5,0.15026693548919337,6.552722565589643E-5,6.691999149712296E-5,6.567085769387451E-5,7.049210264299755E-5,6.585558012574279E-5,6.543102509425812E-5,6.573303240764395E-5,6.536546157200431E-5,6.540408775054996E-5,6.520707214651912E-5,6.522398986941445E-5,6.537080114374318E-5,6.606032457908225E-5,6.572464430925784E-5,6.546478743826219E-5,6.62602532496588E-5,6.548991318141167E-5,0.20771351049397335,6.667077221220729E-5,6.524020159655848E-5,6.538438643179902E-5,6.536170866321656E-5,6.720123284242054E-5,6.538535922681934E-5,6.521819946955375E-5,6.593406254316617E-5,6.540220075960757E-5,7.03328790291736E-5,6.53483008479854E-5,6.523944713105412E-5,6.555094634332755E-5,6.620115663944164E-5,6.554660977536697E-5,6.5227377687484E-5,6.537924964637974E-5,6.520786083759943E-5,0.06954387543135206,6.57695959488023E-5,6.56294970799151E-5,6.557210111856228E-5,6.581112185041658E-5,6.520548195141974E-5,0.04554804756810386,6.663703405393587E-5,6.532233379697472E-5,6.693902752335498E-5,6.549503941112459E-5,6.60076364308119E-5,6.560422679469806E-5,6.51850381123754E-5,6.526583944406205E-5]}}

{"value":"The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable. Basic elements such as character development were glossed over, at best. Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters just \"showing up\" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it wasn't \"bad\". I rated it a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.","finished_norm":["the","writer","come","up","with","a","pretti","decent","idea","for","a","stori","but","mani","flaw","in","the","execut","of","the","plot","take","so","much","awai","from","the","film","a","to","nearli","render","it","unwatch","basic","elem","such","a","charact","develop","be","gloss","over","at","well","inconsist","conjur","rear","their","ugli","head","a","massiv","mansion","in","the","middl","of","the","rural","irish","countrysid","charact","just","show","up","in","the","garden","dure","a","stormi","night","at","veri","conveni","time","i","mai","add","all","in","all","it","be","not","bad","i","rate","it","a","base","mostli","on","the","stori","and","talent","of","alison","elliott"],"filtered":["writer","come","pretti","decent","idea","stori","mani","flaw","execut","plot","take","much","awai","film","nearli","render","unwatch","basic","elem","charact","develop","gloss","well","inconsist","conjur","rear","ugli","head","massiv","mansion","middl","rural","irish","countrysid","charact","show","garden","dure","stormi","night","veri","conveni","time","mai","add","bad","rate","base","mostli","stori","talent","alison","elliott"],"filtered2":["writer","come","pretti","decent","idea","stori","mani","flaw","execut","plot","take","awai","nearli","render","unwatch","basic","elem","charact","develop","gloss","well","inconsist","conjur","rear","ugli","head","massiv","mansion","middl","rural","irish","countrysid","charact","show","garden","dure","stormi","night","veri","conveni","time","mai","add","bad","rate","base","mostli","stori","talent","alison","elliott"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,9,10,15,17,20,28,31,32,34,39,46,50,78,123,155,202,208,210,239,276,286,287,299,309,320,334,479,510,554,611,662,895,921,1701,1836,2115,2138,2181,2345,2446,2520,4012,4388,5493,6439,6618],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,9,10,15,17,20,28,31,32,34,39,46,50,78,123,155,202,208,210,239,276,286,287,299,309,320,334,479,510,554,611,662,895,921,1701,1836,2115,2138,2181,2345,2446,2520,4012,4388,5493,6439,6618],"values":[0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,2.0064197866819473,2.2619070973220485,2.3074766467914385,2.597304642813496,2.6289494000279396,2.687151791517189,2.6593400337329487,2.7884729505849193,2.780700890737216,2.841890188081905,2.7949961309240425,2.848772527704847,2.938298364153555,2.942840385588056,3.360519385990158,3.374440724508766,3.439602492783994,3.520060914452293,3.616452760127359,3.9954846111673676,3.9911462095687695,4.706176101378222,4.77960356993304,5.116075806554253,5.014723312293965,5.00274712124725,5.214056214914456,5.185068678041204,5.426230734858092,5.850044981634453,5.999576715605417,6.255510089742618,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.968321179138741E-5,7.914588926586387E-5,7.97611730854109E-5,7.930031217759916E-5,7.930161142393201E-5,7.919076361865132E-5,7.9426288045306E-5,7.915728575676343E-5,7.93352601913978E-5,8.801814044114164E-5,0.6593897940283264,7.902950844529824E-5,8.050455502992774E-5,8.165297019718086E-5,7.908713593842864E-5,7.8868573217581E-5,8.083585112000333E-5,7.943372968896108E-5,7.91872868520395E-5,7.925291903357998E-5,8.001973750800145E-5,7.951242841457493E-5,7.960296537687141E-5,0.1280542476589378,8.030029869637169E-5,7.988035074045383E-5,8.323836893522047E-5,7.905300319354034E-5,7.905511804650822E-5,7.92554037410211E-5,8.093995879364568E-5,7.942912718263111E-5,8.526043945249098E-5,7.965254959631033E-5,7.91390488324096E-5,7.950432771176928E-5,7.905974952780914E-5,7.910646802298373E-5,7.886817697549237E-5,7.888863901924635E-5,7.906620775810551E-5,7.990018871349755E-5,7.949418227805747E-5,7.917988450305643E-5,8.014200312494782E-5,7.921027417540518E-5,0.1728830883515304,8.063852721542255E-5,7.89082471587224E-5,7.908263921051368E-5,7.905521037178355E-5,8.128012116351738E-5,7.908381580942078E-5,7.888163551079337E-5,7.974747434884183E-5,7.910418570097942E-5,8.506785794652292E-5,0.033607251530842965,7.890733463011223E-5,7.928409399366875E-5,8.007052557259299E-5,7.927884889987567E-5,7.88927365967985E-5,7.907642625096503E-5,7.886913090005384E-5,8.069399911771748E-5,7.954855143996317E-5,7.937910137846319E-5,7.930968076673135E-5,7.959877716011547E-5,7.886625362907618E-5,7.93113434570364E-5,8.059772079750213E-5,7.900758633627754E-5,8.096298293253668E-5,7.921647436779087E-5,7.983646221780457E-5,7.934853688198891E-5,7.884152673576952E-5,7.893925622304044E-5]}}
{"value":"ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />Bland, soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of America's first female TV news anchor. With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster, but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort. A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all as superficial as old fluff, and just as engaging.","finished_norm":["almost","golden","the","jessica","savitch","storybr","br","aspect","ratio","br","br","sound","format","stereobr","br","bland","soapopera","dramatis","of","the","rise","and","fall","of","america","femal","tv","new","anchor","with","a","tight","script","and","direct","and","a","well","cast","thi","mai","have","pass","muster","but","the","flimsi","stori","realli","be","not","worth","the","effort","a","good","documentari","on","the","subject","mai","have","be","the","well","wai","to","go","typic","strong","product","valu","in","the","tv","movi","conveyorbelt","manner","but","it","all","a","superfici","a","old","fluff","and","just","a","engag"],"filtered":["almost","golden","jessica","savitch","storybr","br","aspect","ratio","br","br","sound","format","stereobr","br","bland","soapopera","dramatis","rise","fall","america","femal","tv","new","anchor","tight","script","direct","well","cast","thi","mai","pass","muster","flimsi","stori","realli","worth","effort","good","documentari","subject","mai","well","wai","go","typic","strong","product","valu","tv","movi","conveyorbelt","manner","superfici","old","fluff","engag"],"filtered2":["almost","golden","jessica","savitch","storybr","aspect","ratio","sound","format","stereobr","bland","soapopera","dramatis","rise","fall","america","femal","tv","new","anchor","tight","script","direct","well","cast","mai","pass","muster","flimsi","stori","realli","worth","effort","good","documentari","subject","mai","well","wai","go","typic","strong","product","valu","tv","conveyorbelt","manner","superfici","old","fluff","engag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,13,17,20,33,46,67,77,87,92,102,131,170,172,178,190,219,401,422,451,487,550,613,624,631,645,809,922,943,1028,1046,1930,2024,2266,2280,2444,2593,2883,3908,5867,6004,6087,8138],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,13,17,20,33,46,67,77,87,92,102,131,170,172,178,190,219,401,422,451,487,550,613,624,631,645,809,922,943,1028,1046,1930,2024,2266,2280,2444,2593,2883,3908,5867,6004,6087,8138],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.4018535447685214,3.311542587503466,1.9570915389266579,1.9463902258768238,2.115024371522662,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.2512118082053005,2.4071371113909277,5.000281788719697,2.532833256045391,2.558331832813986,2.5792094178355414,3.0879275592619675,3.2090054908152035,3.216957819005698,3.3220965805878846,3.4751392270607813,3.5364100524538222,3.9241755834625858,3.607563812710113,3.558633189238533,3.90413483257914,4.030886538218284,3.9911462095687695,4.086456389373095,4.067587905068712,4.848596441419991,5.322690055917252,5.089758498236879,5.129498826886393,5.116075806554253,5.214056214914456,5.408212229355414,5.850044981634453,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.785929260429767E-5,7.733426919225017E-5,7.793546939319363E-5,7.74851574207654E-5,7.748642692783119E-5,7.737811638773287E-5,7.760824974754742E-5,7.734540482169662E-5,7.751930548748003E-5,0.135638885840236,0.28142355930807206,7.722055228553624E-5,7.866183560049984E-5,0.177600836891186,7.72768607067058E-5,7.706330080553841E-5,0.04979427312686416,7.761552105473713E-5,7.737471920302031E-5,7.74388490882488E-5,7.818811537197577E-5,7.769241839568763E-5,7.778088300047041E-5,7.786468317806853E-5,7.846225461872095E-5,0.1561394409559142,8.13330735186593E-5,7.72435092476983E-5,7.724557569246551E-5,7.744127692165742E-5,7.90872731334281E-5,7.761102389807135E-5,0.08718776674957811,7.782933225550241E-5,7.732758533378258E-5,7.768450311496707E-5,7.72501011608759E-5,7.729575028700994E-5,7.706291363328434E-5,7.70829073084401E-5,7.725641156467422E-5,7.807130300507296E-5,7.7674589906473E-5,7.736748629106213E-5,7.83075823742622E-5,0.10653692615722815,7.996870431886825E-5,7.879274121231913E-5,7.710206662487036E-5,7.72724669072263E-5,7.72456659044495E-5,7.941964931271854E-5,7.727361657422048E-5,7.707606410770008E-5,7.792208421562784E-5,7.729352020651048E-5,8.312068620450665E-5,7.722982030253615E-5,7.710117498370189E-5,7.746931046505465E-5,7.8237740916591E-5,7.746418542951465E-5,7.708691109396065E-5,7.726639616001918E-5,7.706384572286613E-5,7.884694338332858E-5,7.772771457841205E-5,7.756214316602114E-5,7.749431156636438E-5,7.777679065044385E-5,7.706103431155483E-5,7.749593619830454E-5,7.875286883818195E-5,7.719913196546663E-5,7.91097702583127E-5,7.740323862735308E-5,7.800903518524916E-5,7.753227827954387E-5,7.70368734076721E-5,7.713236590319821E-5]}}

{"value":"This movie really has no beginning or end. And it's really VERY unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they're put up in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum), and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are. One thing that I found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins DOESN'T end up with the guy. I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit.

{"value":"I had always been a big Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie,I had to see it.I was bitterly disappointed.This is a Wonder Woman movie in name only.She doesn't wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's James Bond.There's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.It's just one long bad dream.I don't even think Cathy is all that attractive anyway.I wouldn't waste your time on this.","finished_norm":["i","have","alwai","be","a","big","lynda","carterwond","woman","fan","so","when","the","scifi","channel","run","thi","moviei","have","to","see","iti","be","bitterli","disappointedthi","be","a","wonder","woman","movi","in","name","onlysh","doe","not","wear","the","right","costum","she","must","have","refus","to","or","have","order","major","chang","and","the","plot","run","like","a","poor","man","jame","bondther","none","of","the","thing","that","make","the","comic","book","heroin","a","success","ie","the","superhuman","strength","or","determin","willit","just","on","long","bad","dreami","do","not","even","think","cathi","be","all","that","attract","anywayi","would","not","wast","your","time","on","thi"],"filtered":["alwai","big","lynda","carterwond","woman","fan","scifi","channel","run","thi","moviei","see","iti","bitterli","disappointedthi","wonder","woman","movi","name","onlysh","doe","wear","right","costum","must","refus","order","major","chang","plot","run","like","poor","man","jame","bondther","none","thing","make","comic","book","heroin","success","ie","superhuman","strength","determin","willit","long","bad","dreami","even","think","cathi","attract","anywayi","wast","time","thi"],"filtered2":["alwai","big","lynda","carterwond","woman","fan","scifi","channel","run","moviei","see","iti","bitterli","disappointedthi","wonder","woman","name","onlysh","doe","wear","right","costum","must","refus","order","major","chang","plot","run","like","poor","man","jame","bondther","none","thing","make","comic","book","heroin","success","ie","superhuman","strength","determin","willit","long","bad","dreami","even","think","cathi","attract","anywayi","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,9,12,18,29,32,45,70,82,89,99,121,137,140,141,143,146,151,175,197,278,370,404,439,480,514,532,620,648,728,776,781,1308,1416,1544,2102,2221,5329,5721,6781,7027,7231],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,9,12,18,29,32,45,70,82,89,99,121,137,140,141,143,146,151,175,197,278,370,404,439,480,514,532,620,648,728,776,781,1308,1416,1544,2102,2221,5329,5721,6781,7027,7231],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.8162961064622165,4.189351572503368,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.056430207256609,2.2190595059394194,4.587807168251287,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.326138445979858,2.8002454868101863,2.3791142619576227,2.558331832813986,2.8336934208777267,2.9958122703541616,3.1419947805322432,3.2872346624216657,3.43462735814388,3.405285399859865,3.4446025032006995,3.7568101178222815,3.6105180246075443,3.7740817043309423,3.770603439954617,3.9363956947973615,4.506310234933358,4.484804029712395,4.581533656170946,4.933754249760298,5.02684467282631,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.544628204913533E-5,8.487009779356795E-5,8.552988187610373E-5,0.08797165194143226,8.503708252147306E-5,8.491821767376413E-5,8.51707763512693E-5,8.48823185330924E-5,8.507316492842995E-5,9.438403252700067E-5,0.788814527203661,8.474529975649591E-5,8.632702875150473E-5,8.75585027858034E-5,8.480709514502389E-5,8.457272492485924E-5,8.66822857563113E-5,8.517875621011744E-5,8.491448945079404E-5,8.498486846500961E-5,8.58071469120361E-5,8.526314680324905E-5,8.5360231830852E-5,8.545219790672181E-5,8.61079996248545E-5,8.565767902807362E-5,8.925856512874121E-5,8.477049375708695E-5,8.477276156631706E-5,8.498753287835402E-5,8.679392299388666E-5,8.517382082855886E-5,9.142688143850888E-5,8.541340221773921E-5,8.486276262731232E-5,8.525446021894646E-5,8.477772801845482E-5,8.482782541821889E-5,8.457230002465122E-5,8.459424198108844E-5,8.478465333879566E-5,8.567895177802772E-5,8.524358101903772E-5,8.490655172859618E-5,8.593825536205517E-5,8.493913932711931E-5,8.776124513564812E-5,8.647069044499292E-5,8.46152682748141E-5,8.480227319228023E-5,8.477286056899703E-5,8.715868753016883E-5,8.480353488843699E-5,8.458673194547174E-5,8.55151923815128E-5,8.48253780277922E-5,9.122037151871671E-5,8.47554708943026E-5,8.461428974777873E-5,8.501829814703082E-5,8.586160821190411E-5,8.50126737030163E-5,8.459863591500963E-5,8.479561088183843E-5,8.457332294159068E-5,8.653017434006613E-5,8.530188241827262E-5,8.512017691942705E-5,0.11662162045527563,8.535574070226713E-5,8.457023757264081E-5,8.504751842166904E-5,8.64269327121323E-5,8.472179213590203E-5,8.681861234841179E-5,8.494578794701596E-5,8.561061627795724E-5,8.508740185266309E-5,8.454372231237229E-5,8.464852006269052E-5]}}
{"value":"I went to see this one with much expectation. Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic to character's behaviors. Today's kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them 'daydream' about the events. That's precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers?)

{"value":"The Pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partly with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what David Schwimmer even sees in her.<br /><br />However The Pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it. Watch The Pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest. Trust me you aren't missing much.","finished_norm":["the","pallbear","be","a","disappoint","and","at","time","extrem","bore","with","a","love","stori","that","just","doe","not","work","partli","with","the","cast","of","gwyneth","paltrow","juli","gwyneth","paltrow","walk","through","the","entir","film","with","a","confus","look","on","her","face","and","it","hard","to","tell","what","david","schwimmer","even","see","in","herbr","br","howev","the","pallbear","at","time","be","funni","particularli","the","church","scene","and","the","group","scene","with","hi","friend","be","a","laugh","but","that","basic","it","watch","the","pallbear","for","that","scene","onli","and","fast","forward","the","rest","trust","me","you","be","not","miss","much"],"filtered":["pallbear","disappoint","time","extrem","bore","love","stori","doe","work","partli","cast","gwyneth","paltrow","juli","gwyneth","paltrow","walk","entir","film","confus","look","face","hard","tell","david","schwimmer","even","see","herbr","br","howev","pallbear","time","funni","particularli","church","scene","group","scene","hi","friend","laugh","basic","watch","pallbear","scene","onli","fast","forward","rest","trust","miss","much"],"filtered2":["pallbear","disappoint","time","extrem","bore","love","stori","doe","work","partli","cast","gwyneth","paltrow","juli","gwyneth","paltrow","walk","entir","confus","look","face","hard","tell","david","schwimmer","even","see","herbr","howev","pallbear","time","funni","particularli","church","scene","group","scene","friend","laugh","basic","watch","pallbear","scene","onli","fast","forward","rest","trust","miss"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,11,16,17,18,19,48,54,62,90,92,108,113,133,161,171,187,198,226,251,255,286,294,329,410,427,497,542,675,699,1130,1290,2400,2745,3075,3345,5720],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,11,16,17,18,19,48,54,62,90,92,108,113,133,161,171,187,198,226,251,255,286,294,329,410,427,497,542,675,699,1130,1290,2400,2745,3075,3345,5720],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,3.9371420340352055,1.6955116224012472,1.8113893252729412,2.0226120445069267,2.0477128419653545,2.0489535369135887,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,2.3212364753796515,2.4323182980210873,2.373087554090762,2.4732161909892554,2.5439726117360975,2.5940874818617203,2.6942272927333892,2.6754694156628323,2.780700890737216,2.886778509330039,2.951986790814132,3.2070272508030975,3.233054746047873,3.342254038012865,3.4471119148061256,3.749984152751882,3.5813614403160887,4.416284083275639,4.3336974922663645,5.290429193699031,5.290429193699031,5.583416318380505,11.756431717202299,12.978249881848246]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.3682342088752002,9.674695297574416E-5,9.749906828215625E-5,9.69357176269296E-5,9.693730580952549E-5,9.680180682777886E-5,9.708970896447299E-5,9.676088390480914E-5,9.697843764535299E-5,1.0759228272319583E-4,0.6241545886985294,9.660469050476834E-5,9.840776914705648E-5,9.981157759767162E-5,9.667513363731396E-5,9.640796527933308E-5,9.881274137675655E-5,9.70988055373391E-5,9.679755687141321E-5,9.687778483574707E-5,9.781513422399612E-5,9.719500588301514E-5,9.730567714232013E-5,9.741051309572248E-5,9.815808873938344E-5,9.764474956889328E-5,1.0174954934300996E-4,9.66334101934905E-5,9.663599536351679E-5,9.688082211129218E-5,9.894000130522177E-5,9.709317949071045E-5,1.0422130325294278E-4,9.736628827690832E-5,9.673859131476753E-5,9.718510368442115E-5,9.664165682879041E-5,9.669876493759654E-5,9.640748091792061E-5,9.64324934663071E-5,9.664955128936929E-5,9.766899926098719E-5,9.717270203213903E-5,9.678850833186659E-5,9.796459019704767E-5,9.68256562902627E-5,1.0004269203133621E-4,9.857153508424349E-5,9.645646221269971E-5,9.666963689290727E-5,9.663610822078775E-5,9.935581156532948E-5,9.667107515281179E-5,9.642393246447554E-5,9.748232311655173E-5,9.669597505549814E-5,1.0398589400964901E-4,9.661628500762241E-5,9.645534674904954E-5,9.691589272013252E-5,9.787721692396124E-5,9.690948118256236E-5,9.643750229426305E-5,9.666204224824702E-5,9.6408646983468E-5,9.8639343249299E-5,9.723916222102582E-5,9.703202856842882E-5,9.69471696740369E-5,9.730055751812614E-5,9.640512984312686E-5,9.694920212603468E-5,9.852165382531426E-5,9.657789319071668E-5,9.89681457269126E-5,9.683323532850135E-5,9.759110078338707E-5,9.699466690719092E-5,9.637490399556652E-5,9.649436730815353E-5]}}

The only good point is Gary busey's parts but this does not lift the film very much. it lives up to its B film ranking and passes the test with flying colours. A waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches. i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift.

{"value":"Personally I would advise people to stay clear of this movie. It's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan audio commentary.<br /><br />But in any case, since when has there ever been a Ninja film worth watching. I cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to.<br /><br />Overall, when it comes to Movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any films that contains the word 'Ninja'.","finished_norm":["person","i","would","advis","peopl","to","stai","clear","of","thi","movi","it","on","the","whole","a","bear","to","watch","and","the","fight","be","poorli","choreograph","slow","and","not","veri","convinc","if","you","bui","the","hong","kong","legend","dvd","releas","of","thi","movi","then","the","onli","thing","worth","listen","to","be","the","bei","logan","audio","commentarybr","br","but","in","ani","case","sinc","when","have","there","ever","be","a","ninja","film","worth","watch","i","cannot","think","of","on","and","frankli","do","not","wish","tobr","br","overal","when","it","come","to","movi","i","have","on","golden","rule","avoid","ani","film","that","contain","the","word","ninja"],"filtered":["person","advis","peopl","stai","clear","thi","movi","whole","bear","watch","fight","poorli","choreograph","slow","veri","convinc","bui","hong","kong","legend","dvd","releas","thi","movi","onli","thing","worth","listen","bei","logan","audio","commentarybr","br","ani","case","sinc","ever","ninja","film","worth","watch","think","frankli","wish","tobr","br","overal","come","movi","golden","rule","avoid","ani","film","contain","word","ninja"],"filtered2":["person","advis","peopl","stai","clear","whole","bear","watch","fight","poorli","choreograph","slow","veri","convinc","bui","hong","kong","legend","dvd","releas","onli","thing","worth","listen","bei","logan","audio","commentarybr","ani","case","sinc","ever","ninja","worth","watch","think","frankli","wish","tobr","overal","come","golden","rule","avoid","ani","contain","word","ninja"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,11,12,15,23,27,29,34,44,111,153,162,219,232,247,258,288,327,335,347,365,390,398,399,412,478,525,590,711,845,1289,1332,1377,1834,2043,2260,2266,3040,3193,3369,3863,4210],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,11,12,15,23,27,29,34,44,111,153,162,219,232,247,258,288,327,335,347,365,390,398,399,412,478,525,590,711,845,1289,1332,1377,1834,2043,2260,2266,3040,3193,3369,3863,4210],"values":[1.9218995441445863,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,2.600540117735859,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.604729392502474,2.1183455303375887,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,5.158418835671083,2.8377834061292515,2.7303758068497004,2.7061321952397077,2.8015621426949333,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.0151989841543516,3.008694896185175,3.132778125427319,3.143848349181566,3.129115117668582,3.107414446935464,3.3243163373261977,3.4149707055943286,3.4986697244709752,3.6375061693251913,3.831445099210862,4.443131333311827,4.383707912841026,4.558366596889411,5.259176650194926,4.900964426937307,11.124725818365345,5.089758498236879,5.463272006538442,5.501738287366237,5.850044981634453,5.7446844659766265,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.339376209693405E-5,8.283141846324437E-5,8.347535375796782E-5,8.299303227466155E-5,8.299439202205566E-5,8.287838244745736E-5,8.312487436919211E-5,0.12161913192344367,8.302960768726057E-5,9.211681732131762E-5,0.3936641742777982,8.27096182214531E-5,8.425335223009886E-5,8.545524481315823E-5,8.276992921224174E-5,8.254118883976096E-5,8.460007554481338E-5,8.313266254246764E-5,8.287474378077747E-5,8.294343220849319E-5,8.374595856241144E-5,8.321502597453354E-5,8.33097789058599E-5,8.339953584868001E-5,8.403958444006599E-5,8.360008107239812E-5,8.71144696638707E-5,8.273420703258885E-5,8.273642036638035E-5,8.294603261950282E-5,8.470903112495395E-5,8.312784571456497E-5,0.2538412113100172,8.336167207766723E-5,8.282425949628883E-5,8.32065480521782E-5,8.274126751851044E-5,8.279016151995099E-5,8.25407741461545E-5,8.256218903105276E-5,8.274802648453093E-5,8.36208428259382E-5,8.319593018341623E-5,8.286699673198043E-5,8.387391763362652E-5,8.289880153815076E-5,8.565311705387435E-5,8.439356300114571E-5,8.258271024853218E-5,8.276522308846077E-5,8.273651699089979E-5,8.506503358908248E-5,8.276645447719545E-5,8.255485939530338E-5,8.346101712227271E-5,8.278777291871395E-5,8.902915116248974E-5,8.271954503659549E-5,8.258175522686435E-5,8.297605887032792E-5,8.379911163795511E-5,8.297056953205802E-5,8.25664774175256E-5,8.275872081453292E-5,8.254177249142885E-5,8.445161802326454E-5,8.325283111463428E-5,8.307549039507297E-5,8.300283712408605E-5,8.330539565945324E-5,8.253876123666133E-5,8.300457723968408E-5,0.22453206351068822,8.268667528148827E-5,8.473312741221442E-5,8.290529045039642E-5,8.355414882476004E-5,8.30435026238689E-5,8.251288290405583E-5,8.261516328944821E-5]}}
{"value":"Bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story. I felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original English movie. This movie is very indianised, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you'll love this movie, On the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the ending.But on the whole it's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions.

If falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a Fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea, then AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.","finished_norm":["the","dubbingtransl","in","thi","movi","be","downright","hilari","and","provid","the","onli","entertain","in","thi","otherwis","dull","and","deriv","zombi","flick","i","have","not","laugh","so","hard","in","my","life","a","i","just","do","watch","zombi","and","i","have","see","some","realli","bad","dub","in","my","life","believ","me","serious","the","filmmak","can","reedit","thi","movi","and","releas","it","a","a","comedi","and","make","million","of","dollar","it","just","that","funnybr","br","but","if","fall","off","your","couch","laugh","at","the","dub","in","a","fulci","zombi","movi","be","not","your","cup","of","tea","then","avoid","thi","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["dubbingtransl","thi","movi","downright","hilari","provid","onli","entertain","thi","otherwis","dull","deriv","zombi","flick","laugh","hard","life","watch","zombi","see","realli","bad","dub","life","believ","serious","filmmak","reedit","thi","movi","releas","comedi","make","million","dollar","funnybr","br","fall","couch","laugh","dub","fulci","zombi","movi","cup","tea","avoid","thi","cost"],"filtered2":["dubbingtransl","downright","hilari","provid","onli","entertain","otherwis","dull","deriv","zombi","flick","laugh","hard","life","watch","zombi","see","realli","bad","dub","life","believ","serious","filmmak","reedit","releas","comedi","make","million","dollar","funnybr","fall","couch","laugh","dub","fulci","zombi","cup","tea","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,9,11,13,75,91,127,133,170,171,195,257,268,323,327,335,367,371,627,632,694,807,837,949,1039,1556,2069,2375,2413,2721,3101,3575,5942],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,9,11,13,75,91,127,133,170,171,195,257,268,323,327,335,367,371,627,632,694,807,837,949,1039,1556,2069,2375,2413,2721,3101,3575,5942],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,3.948450049740535,2.0105926690411424,2.4359679371086367,4.642472950759303,2.4071371113909277,2.373087554090762,2.51289241584188,2.7602659523229094,11.023986438639847,3.0433232530252132,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.0791938792932125,3.0466846007279185,3.477726550625732,3.541919708264792,3.6715125373103863,3.900174431363043,3.7881170224473255,8.17291277874619,4.145296889396028,4.550761997504193,5.770002273960917,5.129498826886393,5.129498826886393,5.322690055917252,5.501738287366237,5.649374286172302,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.524240894939249E-5,9.460016711998918E-5,9.533559321343858E-5,9.478474314020724E-5,9.478629608150789E-5,9.465380378150716E-5,9.49353174561786E-5,9.461378892591845E-5,9.482651521424078E-5,1.0520484225469385E-4,0.45606153175163305,9.44610614105557E-5,9.622413027881977E-5,9.759678864115538E-5,9.452994143112796E-5,9.42687014588417E-5,9.662011629626248E-5,9.494421217882242E-5,9.464964813039799E-5,9.47280958602772E-5,9.564464574687067E-5,9.503827786769467E-5,0.14284848771428496,9.524900304001909E-5,9.597999020447161E-5,9.547804187613737E-5,9.949175737499022E-5,9.448914381800302E-5,9.449167162388216E-5,9.473106573958938E-5,9.674455236510184E-5,9.493871097248025E-5,0.2997947282194235,9.520575955666391E-5,9.459199100176054E-5,9.502859539591614E-5,9.449720746294019E-5,9.45530483599483E-5,9.426822784526362E-5,9.429268537270691E-5,9.45049267478077E-5,9.55017534748403E-5,0.09404976940349566,9.464080037522871E-5,9.579078533672733E-5,9.467712403157497E-5,9.782277471488727E-5,9.638426229900171E-5,9.431612225980936E-5,9.452456665783026E-5,9.449178197688414E-5,9.715113592030959E-5,9.452597300317907E-5,9.42843143369371E-5,9.531921961803411E-5,9.45503203844965E-5,1.0167847822453461E-4,9.447239863487061E-5,9.431503154796286E-5,9.476535814214314E-5,9.570535085035267E-5,9.475908887466776E-5,9.42975830562735E-5,9.45171405360561E-5,9.426936803616642E-5,9.645056582122177E-5,9.508145438981484E-5,9.487891697081454E-5,9.479594106982564E-5,9.514148734369534E-5,9.426592894011406E-5,9.479792842232347E-5,9.633548789024028E-5,9.443485872086182E-5,9.677207227052061E-5,9.468453489322935E-5,9.54255835410832E-5,9.484238435362843E-5,9.423637379504125E-5,9.435318625256919E-5]}}
{"value":"The best that I can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times, and that it was an adequate time killer. Unfortunately, this film is also so annoying that I wanted to slap these characters around. This is the kind of film that is so sweet, it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is SO nauseating. When the two leads aren't together on-screen, this really isn't bad at all, but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another.","finished_norm":["the","well","that","i","can","sai","about","thi","film","be","that","it","be","mildli","amus","at","time","and","that","it","be","a","adequ","time","killer","unfortun","thi","film","be","conjur","so","annoi","that","i","want","to","slap","thi","charact","around","thi","be","the","kind","of","film","that","be","so","sweet","it","hurt","your","tooth","the","intent","be","good","i","suppos","but","thing","get","awfulli","tiresom","when","the","dialogu","be","so","nauseat","when","the","two","lead","be","not","togeth","onscreen","thi","realli","be","not","bad","at","all","but","be","afraid","dure","that","frequent","moment","when","the","love","coupl","start","talk","to","on","anoth"],"filtered":["well","sai","thi","film","mildli","amus","time","adequ","time","killer","unfortun","thi","film","conjur","annoi","want","slap","thi","charact","around","thi","kind","film","sweet","hurt","tooth","intent","good","suppos","thing","get","awfulli","tiresom","dialogu","nauseat","two","lead","togeth","onscreen","thi","realli","bad","afraid","dure","frequent","moment","love","coupl","start","talk","anoth"],"filtered2":["well","mildli","amus","time","adequ","time","killer","unfortun","conjur","annoi","want","slap","charact","around","kind","sweet","hurt","tooth","intent","good","suppos","thing","get","awfulli","tiresom","dialogu","nauseat","two","lead","togeth","onscreen","realli","bad","afraid","dure","frequent","moment","love","coupl","start","talk","anoth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,10,13,20,29,37,39,47,54,71,73,98,122,149,157,186,188,227,239,248,252,253,270,271,708,811,863,1212,1244,1388,1491,1560,1762,2388,2410,2778,3208,3560],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,10,13,20,29,37,39,47,54,71,73,98,122,149,157,186,188,227,239,248,252,253,270,271,708,811,863,1212,1244,1388,1491,1560,1762,2388,2410,2778,3208,3560],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,2.0881990796736947,2.2489347673732487,2.3253197803590226,2.3360150694757706,2.571852579609833,2.5378812223426954,2.6005321873043625,2.6593400337329487,2.689504733779216,3.0433232530252132,2.7073305177318163,2.731603554088023,2.757740698455715,3.6683728173057184,3.8425769395797067,3.944626193933877,4.550761997504193,4.339813719283801,4.443131333311827,4.558366596889411,4.573751515728891,4.74221603786142,5.089758498236879,5.089758498236879,5.290429193699031,5.521540914662417,5.649374286172302]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0374113210211472E-4,1.0304158139565332E-4,1.0384263143579265E-4,1.0324262760508403E-4,1.0324431911929912E-4,1.0310000419332753E-4,1.0340663805144591E-4,1.0305641871008043E-4,1.0328812710786116E-4,0.28373467142912145,0.4580391313943186,1.028900629288518E-4,1.0481045493053767E-4,1.063055991007549E-4,1.029650892894007E-4,1.0268053820785778E-4,1.0524177579063836E-4,1.034163264728853E-4,1.0309547772286711E-4,1.0318092554383557E-4,1.0417926151530173E-4,1.0351878588317549E-4,1.0363665772536873E-4,1.0374831460027214E-4,1.0454452961445468E-4,1.0399779115610859E-4,1.0836966072954671E-4,1.029206512011653E-4,1.0292340456961249E-4,1.0318416043305613E-4,1.0537731560738734E-4,1.034103343798654E-4,0.25024164218919936,1.0370121239056544E-4,1.0303267570153453E-4,1.0350823941973623E-4,1.0292943438571384E-4,1.0299025810843485E-4,1.0268002233253175E-4,1.0270666226754991E-4,1.0293784248206513E-4,1.0402361860126173E-4,1.0349503088113357E-4,1.0308584045992986E-4,1.0433844151362292E-4,1.0312540536880834E-4,1.0655175048842839E-4,1.0498487593944244E-4,1.0273219048788555E-4,1.0295923491136841E-4,1.0292352476969439E-4,1.0582017965058648E-4,1.0296076674850084E-4,1.0269754426290045E-4,1.0382479678269452E-4,1.0298728670877331E-4,1.1075150825971127E-4,1.029024118026182E-4,1.0273100244903814E-4,1.0322151283418365E-4,1.0424538349005087E-4,1.0321468414397599E-4,1.0271199698391715E-4,1.0295114613780127E-4,1.026812642655779E-4,1.0505709589411747E-4,1.0356581515652533E-4,1.0334520480687221E-4,1.0325482475453276E-4,1.0363120500404911E-4,1.0267751829021025E-4,1.0325698944356452E-4,1.0493174926574385E-4,1.0286152210630279E-4,1.0540729118418113E-4,1.0313347752055626E-4,1.0394065182997496E-4,1.03305412291045E-4,1.0264532586413538E-4,1.0277256179528469E-4]}}

{"value":"The fight scenes play like slow-motion Jackie Chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic (worst pun by far: \"Guess what? This time I heard you coming\").

{"value":"This is the version that even the author hated, because it's so schmaltzy. They gave it a 'happy ending' and changed a lot of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharine. The 'stage manager' is quite good, I believe he originated the role, but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40's that is really just posing. The one great feature- the music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth seeking out in a record shop. Overall I think the 1989 Spalding Grey/ Eric Stoltz/ Penelope Miller version is far superior.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","version","that","even","the","author","hate","becaus","it","so","schmaltzi","thei","give","it","a","happi","end","and","chang","a","lot","of","the","dialogu","and","it","just","a","big","pile","of","saccharin","the","stage","manag","be","quit","good","i","believ","he","origin","the","role","but","everyon","els","fall","into","that","act","styl","of","the","that","be","realli","just","pose","the","on","great","featur","the","music","thi","have","on","of","the","well","score","ever","record","and","it","worth","seek","out","in","a","record","shop","overal","i","think","the","spald","grei","eric","stoltz","penelop","miller","version","be","far","superior"],"filtered":["thi","version","even","author","hate","becaus","schmaltzi","thei","give","happi","end","chang","lot","dialogu","big","pile","saccharin","stage","manag","quit","good","believ","origin","role","everyon","els","fall","act","styl","realli","pose","great","featur","music","thi","well","score","ever","record","worth","seek","record","shop","overal","think","spald","grei","eric","stoltz","penelop","miller","version","far","superior"],"filtered2":["version","even","author","hate","becaus","schmaltzi","give","happi","end","chang","lot","dialogu","big","pile","saccharin","stage","manag","quit","good","believ","origin","role","everyon","els","fall","act","styl","realli","pose","great","featur","music","well","score","ever","record","worth","seek","record","shop","overal","think","spald","grei","eric","stoltz","penelop","miller","version","far","superior"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,12,13,20,21,22,24,30,44,51,69,72,82,91,101,118,120,128,170,196,219,220,246,248,278,305,339,345,380,412,518,605,669,1020,1112,1131,1238,1431,1642,1938,1990,2687,2934,4868],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,12,13,20,21,22,24,30,44,51,69,72,82,91,101,118,120,128,170,196,219,220,246,248,278,305,339,345,380,412,518,605,669,1020,1112,1131,1238,1431,1642,1938,1990,2687,2934,4868],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,2.0105926690411424,2.098582041218749,2.354379525480895,2.2044500422972613,2.3409902041158843,2.4071371113909277,2.478925055209576,2.5792094178355414,5.667386841755453,2.673149229007135,2.689504733779216,2.8336934208777267,2.8612813773965557,3.003844442051426,3.0022328381570844,3.102062070196872,3.107414446935464,3.4101163271295305,3.5474598886404074,3.7099788181381825,8.201690253650389,4.2574141875167335,4.197121957260614,4.291900363587903,4.520909034354511,4.6295428753573065,4.848596441419991,5.089758498236879,5.5623629091826725,5.695894301807195,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.078517558262684E-5,9.017298991983171E-5,9.087399893208093E-5,9.034892799813824E-5,9.035040826360195E-5,9.02241164483109E-5,9.049245561219677E-5,0.040039007914897645,9.038874518795334E-5,0.27316327847866395,0.5460143235229149,9.004039419493596E-5,9.172095350181641E-5,9.302937305791788E-5,9.010605071109054E-5,8.985703646402534E-5,9.209840783669052E-5,9.050093407222193E-5,9.02201552768142E-5,9.029493174466822E-5,9.116858816834013E-5,9.059059759685103E-5,0.07305633057462423,9.079146107752294E-5,9.148823889746164E-5,9.10097811639383E-5,9.483565947089801E-5,9.0067162378553E-5,9.00695718860729E-5,9.029776263710141E-5,9.221702044301798E-5,9.049569031590373E-5,9.713945750845023E-5,9.075024133862184E-5,9.01651964343754E-5,9.058136825342949E-5,9.007484865433637E-5,9.012807626266226E-5,8.985658501500889E-5,8.987989795876733E-5,9.008220668569866E-5,9.103238308754918E-5,9.056980929439431E-5,9.021172158624069E-5,9.130788859628038E-5,9.024634533794515E-5,9.324478324765679E-5,9.187359153070481E-5,8.99022380269594E-5,9.010092747089816E-5,9.006967707468344E-5,9.260457636328201E-5,9.010226800092915E-5,8.987191867768286E-5,9.085839160179487E-5,9.012547595327164E-5,9.69200443417339E-5,9.005120085041015E-5,8.990119835915189E-5,9.033045019531562E-5,9.122645234396491E-5,9.03244743222271E-5,8.988456643647014E-5,9.009384888293926E-5,8.985767184631073E-5,9.193679212561724E-5,9.06317535082246E-5,9.043869460359563E-5,9.035960187774483E-5,9.068897699006326E-5,8.98543936959321E-5,9.036149622446969E-5,0.06091524191125044,9.001541776047953E-5,9.224325244904368E-5,9.025340937994003E-5,9.095977781762232E-5,9.040387167017428E-5,8.982622169708828E-5,8.9937567468199E-5]}}

{"value":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I think) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, his tough-but-fair coach, his girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has continual nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there is zero character development, there is nobody to care about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as the coach, are terrible. It is hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such an awful movie. Make sure to avoid this turkey.","finished_norm":["thi","have","get","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","it","be","i","think","a","stori","of","a","rebelli","colleg","basketbal","player","hi","toughbutfair","coach","hi","girlfriend","and","a","fellow","student","plai","by","michael","margotta","who","have","continu","nervou","breakdown","the","stori","go","nowher","there","be","zero","charact","develop","there","be","nobodi","to","care","about","and","the","perform","with","the","except","of","bruce","dern","a","the","coach","be","terribl","it","be","hard","to","believ","how","a","talent","like","jack","nicholson","can","direct","such","a","aw","movi","make","sure","to","avoid","thi","turkei"],"filtered":["thi","get","wrong","movi","ever","see","think","stori","rebelli","colleg","basketbal","player","hi","toughbutfair","coach","hi","girlfriend","fellow","student","plai","michael","margotta","continu","nervou","breakdown","stori","go","nowher","zero","charact","develop","nobodi","care","perform","except","bruce","dern","coach","terribl","hard","believ","talent","like","jack","nicholson","direct","aw","movi","make","sure","avoid","thi","turkei"],"filtered2":["get","wrong","ever","see","think","stori","rebelli","colleg","basketbal","player","toughbutfair","coach","girlfriend","fellow","student","plai","michael","margotta","continu","nervou","breakdown","stori","go","nowher","zero","charact","develop","nobodi","care","perform","except","bruce","dern","coach","terribl","hard","believ","talent","like","jack","nicholson","direct","aw","make","sure","avoid","turkei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,10,12,17,25,40,44,91,102,105,119,138,166,171,205,233,276,320,335,433,466,626,730,777,799,814,866,964,999,1335,1517,1521,2941,3087,3219,3576,5013,5422,7916],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,10,12,17,25,40,44,91,102,105,119,138,166,171,205,233,276,320,335,433,466,626,730,777,799,814,866,964,999,1335,1517,1521,2941,3087,3219,3576,5013,5422,7916],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,1.2796387880827016,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,2.0105926690411424,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1653408989309972,2.2907365189289424,2.4423870329693536,2.373087554090762,2.571852579609833,2.6102777977348763,2.7884729505849193,2.938298364153555,2.908534262247101,3.164467636384302,3.4446025032006995,3.6528204042982337,3.767137231978131,4.086456389373095,3.7636829971100436,3.9363956947973615,3.8962296530720266,4.062925891962901,4.1302590120314875,4.933754249760298,4.550761997504193,4.581533656170946,11.39178860361439,5.7446844659766265,5.695894301807195,5.7446844659766265,6.255510089742618,6.2980697041614135,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.621769017640366E-5,8.563630413549362E-5,8.630204474172247E-5,8.580339060779832E-5,8.580479639974961E-5,8.568485844145739E-5,8.593969721602198E-5,8.564863520372477E-5,8.584120455829346E-5,9.52361305707028E-5,0.35993563434611864,8.551037942306773E-5,8.710638825065233E-5,0.23272234179053508,8.557273269970732E-5,8.533624658768302E-5,8.746485251192698E-5,8.594774911695108E-5,8.56810965601299E-5,8.575211095533868E-5,8.658181292345588E-5,8.603290158746165E-5,8.613086309766315E-5,8.622365944228964E-5,8.688538173137185E-5,8.643099564502369E-5,9.006439050718221E-5,8.553580087482863E-5,8.55380891578164E-5,8.575479942297849E-5,8.757749760929808E-5,8.594276917882019E-5,0.17158590349340438,8.618451350623875E-5,8.56289027474349E-5,8.602413658076818E-5,8.554310044703134E-5,8.559365012558866E-5,8.533581785148044E-5,8.535795789966745E-5,8.555008828909068E-5,8.645246044513855E-5,8.601315916355814E-5,8.56730871762603E-5,8.671410501916991E-5,8.570596897527696E-5,8.855355272508657E-5,8.725134692038425E-5,8.537917401854965E-5,8.556786721442548E-5,8.553818905429152E-5,8.794555523594157E-5,8.556914030116175E-5,8.535038006352892E-5,8.628722263053031E-5,8.559118064014718E-5,9.204390806441325E-5,8.552064238579856E-5,8.53781866573826E-5,8.57858424401743E-5,8.663676589936094E-5,8.578016721873893E-5,8.536239150197744E-5,8.556114475671573E-5,8.533685000330317E-5,8.731136783543073E-5,8.607198690720644E-5,8.588864097304622E-5,8.581352747473719E-5,0.13609816919509568,8.533373677967517E-5,8.581532651514176E-5,0.0931885543298446,8.548665957592467E-5,8.760240985905377E-5,8.571267761884346E-5,8.638350801289887E-5,8.585557001332744E-5,8.530698213991842E-5,8.541272600321402E-5]}}

{"value":"I really can't believe this movie is not in the IMDB worst 250, it is absolutely terrible. When I originally saw it I remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it. We were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible. By the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was. Don't be like them, just pass this by. I'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie.","finished_norm":["i","realli","ca","not","believ","thi","movi","be","not","in","the","imdb","wrong","it","be","absolut","terribl","when","i","origin","see","it","i","rememb","talk","about","it","in","a","colleg","class","and","two","other","peopl","have","conjur","see","it","we","be","all","tell","other","class","member","not","to","see","it","becaus","it","be","so","horribl","by","the","time","we","be","do","some","other","want","to","see","it","just","becaus","thei","can","not","believ","anyth","be","a","bad","a","we","be","sai","it","be","do","not","be","like","them","just","pass","thi","by","i","be","sure","everyon","involv","with","thi","movi","would","conjur","prefer","you","never","see","them","in","thi","movi"],"filtered":["realli","ca","believ","thi","movi","imdb","wrong","absolut","terribl","origin","see","rememb","talk","colleg","class","two","peopl","conjur","see","tell","class","member","see","becaus","horribl","time","want","see","becaus","thei","believ","anyth","bad","sai","like","pass","thi","sure","everyon","involv","thi","movi","conjur","prefer","never","see","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["realli","ca","believ","imdb","wrong","absolut","terribl","origin","see","rememb","talk","colleg","class","two","peopl","conjur","see","tell","class","member","see","becaus","horribl","time","want","see","becaus","believ","anyth","bad","like","pass","sure","everyon","involv","conjur","prefer","never","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,9,13,22,23,25,37,39,42,47,69,81,90,91,104,119,166,186,222,230,241,246,290,487,592,618,628,814,1268],"values":[1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,9,13,22,23,25,37,39,42,47,69,81,90,91,104,119,166,186,222,230,241,246,290,487,592,618,628,814,1268],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.2785010273469735,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,2.127032521151058,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,4.021185338082285,2.0728240170322856,2.1653408989309972,2.4423870329693536,2.571852579609833,2.5771019354959765,2.7121382192999195,2.6627744961815836,2.673149229007135,2.8612813773965557,3.3220965805878846,3.509308122676031,3.5642670069567886,7.215127625420226,3.9363956947973615,4.30366520516749]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5457327523824604E-4,1.5353095150703273E-4,1.5472450825569233E-4,1.5383050839865554E-4,1.5383302873834184E-4,1.5361800090587865E-4,1.5407488236444654E-4,1.5355305896084848E-4,1.5389830221412162E-4,1.7074176532926488E-4,0.9877669568619154,1.533051904689757E-4,1.5616655582548374E-4,1.5839430605975302E-4,1.534169790146013E-4,1.5299300067779867E-4,1.5680921970116532E-4,1.5408931801791812E-4,1.5361125650903087E-4,1.5373857292906053E-4,1.5522608379163512E-4,1.5424198154015485E-4,1.5441760943563838E-4,1.5458397709046308E-4,1.5577032969759405E-4,1.5495569472597954E-4,1.6146979173348408E-4,1.5335076669645238E-4,1.533548691885902E-4,1.5374339288245532E-4,1.570111727064541E-4,1.5408038985774818E-4,1.6539224609729092E-4,1.5451379525730017E-4,1.535176821096364E-4,1.5422626741247035E-4,1.533638535557837E-4,1.5345448030953758E-4,1.5299223202859327E-4,1.530319252720007E-4,1.533763815373586E-4,1.5499417736741078E-4,1.5420658681875065E-4,1.5359689708122862E-4,1.5546326043694786E-4,1.5365584840965475E-4,1.5876106922713083E-4,1.564264414279488E-4,1.5306996207137163E-4,1.5340825604842E-4,1.5335504828554018E-4,1.5767103581239324E-4,1.534105384708102E-4,1.530183395339839E-4,1.5469793479648425E-4,1.5345005295301642E-4,1.6501866735393243E-4,1.5332359017047206E-4,1.5306819190507375E-4,1.53799047595907E-4,1.5532460488924696E-4,1.5378887291408506E-4,1.5303987394736833E-4,1.533962038546797E-4,1.5299408249672177E-4,1.56534048456188E-4,1.5431205469885727E-4,1.5398334742907567E-4,1.5384868203239808E-4,1.5440948493404238E-4,1.5298850102995147E-4,1.5385190739794724E-4,1.5634728320218337E-4,1.532626649216831E-4,1.570558360235809E-4,1.5366787583704651E-4,1.5487055768721378E-4,1.5392405696851535E-4,1.5294053462901267E-4,1.5313011492573025E-4]}}

He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.<br /><br />The star I'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.<br /><br />Don't watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.","finished_norm":["i","realli","do","not","understand","all","thi","posit","user","review","thi","movi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","and","i","be","not","try","to","be","pessimisticbr","br","eva","mendez","be","hot","but","terribl","in","thi","film","but","i","do","not","think","it","be","her","own","fault","but","the","director","he","have","somehow","manag","to","make","everyth","look","artifici","their","act","the","idea","the","makeup","everythingbr","br","the","star","i","be","give","be","onli","for","the","idea","behind","the","movi","which","be","veri","bad","executedbr","br","do","not","watch","thi","bullshit","go","watch","a","fellini","woodi","allen","or","some","david","lynch"],"filtered":["realli","understand","thi","posit","user","review","thi","movi","wrong","movi","ever","see","try","pessimisticbr","br","eva","mendez","hot","terribl","thi","film","think","fault","director","somehow","manag","make","everyth","look","artifici","act","idea","makeup","everythingbr","br","star","give","onli","idea","behind","movi","veri","bad","executedbr","br","watch","thi","bullshit","go","watch","fellini","woodi","allen","david","lynch"],"filtered2":["realli","understand","posit","user","review","wrong","ever","see","try","pessimisticbr","eva","mendez","hot","terribl","think","fault","director","somehow","manag","make","everyth","look","artifici","act","idea","makeup","everythingbr","star","give","onli","idea","behind","veri","bad","executedbr","watch","bullshit","go","watch","fellini","woodi","allen","david","lynch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,7,9,11,12,13,15,16,21,25,30,36,44,58,100,123,166,176,193,212,345,393,509,549,666,675,960,1298,1345,1760,1807,2332,2629,2932,4778,6050,6392],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,7,9,11,12,13,15,16,21,25,30,36,44,58,100,123,166,176,193,212,345,393,509,549,666,675,960,1298,1345,1760,1807,2332,2629,2932,4778,6050,6392],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,2.1405462403177813,4.523814194644097,2.4423870329693536,2.5040471493269134,2.517840471459249,2.5983793339432615,3.0022328381570844,3.120015873813468,3.360519385990158,3.4471119148061256,3.6621227969605474,3.749984152751882,4.058285512406398,4.3521595551061,4.760735085628657,5.156897801074508,5.143104478942172,5.143104478942172,5.259176650194926,5.770002273960917,6.543192162194399,6.437831646536572,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0589525935457657E-4,1.0518118286445797E-4,1.059988662658021E-4,1.0538640368727456E-4,1.0538813032484713E-4,1.052408187792255E-4,1.0555381971987825E-4,1.0519632826751602E-4,1.0543284796207141E-4,0.17678972416554936,0.16661558351107555,1.0502651820046375E-4,1.0698678608033233E-4,0.13847502484177782,1.051031024419094E-4,1.0481264281447877E-4,1.0742706307962749E-4,1.0556370931603235E-4,1.0523619831910857E-4,1.0532342041683765E-4,0.3949042475652856,1.056682962393302E-4,1.0578861562515846E-4,1.0590259099333723E-4,1.0671533897208373E-4,1.0615724779192684E-4,1.1061989681997011E-4,1.0505774162134041E-4,1.0506055216196113E-4,1.0532672247674439E-4,1.0756541730573499E-4,1.0555759280051376E-4,1.1330713390599765E-4,1.0585451073228748E-4,1.0517209224852452E-4,1.0565753078440849E-4,1.0506670718386012E-4,1.0512879387755565E-4,1.0481211622728681E-4,1.0483930932582714E-4,1.0507528986968353E-4,1.061836115296993E-4,1.056440479778044E-4,1.0522636094373459E-4,1.0650497156577867E-4,1.0526674739607156E-4,1.087642386777679E-4,1.0716482884505439E-4,1.0486536762554419E-4,1.05097126500954E-4,1.050606748579313E-4,1.0801747717594374E-4,1.0509869014583758E-4,1.0483000199085222E-4,1.0598066128599269E-4,1.0512576077842296E-4,1.1305120209724009E-4,1.0503912349176654E-4,1.0486415491772695E-4,1.0536485047983021E-4,0.11527302836879409,1.0535787999564578E-4,1.0484475481463032E-4,1.0508886976847581E-4,1.0481338394838604E-4,1.072385484071598E-4,1.0571630204953996E-4,1.0549111084794573E-4,1.0539885410378811E-4,1.0578304968109531E-4,1.0480956018991092E-4,1.0540106374139082E-4,1.0711059902534874E-4,1.0499738474351394E-4,1.0759601530880822E-4,1.0527498716158767E-4,1.0609892199927683E-4,1.0545049206252757E-4,1.0477669930590692E-4,1.0490657722082127E-4]}}
