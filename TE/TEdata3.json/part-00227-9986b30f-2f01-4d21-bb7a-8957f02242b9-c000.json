{"value":"TV does influence society...just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted. Besides, real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems.<br /><br />Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living? NBC just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they're just around Gump's level. I know a person who makes $100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $2200 a month in rent. <br /><br />I'd like to see a show called Phriends, where it's six ugly nobodies in dead-end jobs, living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week...and then the landlord jacks up the rent. Now THAT I would watch.","finished_norm":["tv","doe","influenc","societyjust","look","at","the","surg","in","popular","of","cappucino","shop","after","thi","shallow","littl","piec","of","work","debut","besid","real","peopl","who","look","a","good","a","thi","peopl","do","do","not","have","ani","problemsbr","br","besid","doe","anyon","realli","believ","that","thi","peopl","can","afford","to","live","in","a","nice","manhattan","loft","consid","what","thei","do","for","a","live","nbc","just","love","to","insult","the","viewer","intellig","even","if","thei","re","just","around","gump","level","i","know","a","person","who","make","a","year","a","a","web","design","and","live","in","a","tini","onebedroom","apart","in","manhattan","that","cost","a","month","in","rend","br","br","i","have","like","to","see","a","show","call","phriend","where","it","six","ugli","nobodi","in","deadend","job","live","in","a","crummi","neighborhood","where","siren","constantli","wail","and","someon","get","mug","everi","weekand","then","the","landlord","jack","up","the","rend","now","that","i","would","watch"],"filtered":["tv","doe","influenc","societyjust","look","surg","popular","cappucino","shop","thi","shallow","littl","piec","work","debut","besid","real","peopl","look","good","thi","peopl","ani","problemsbr","br","besid","doe","anyon","realli","believ","thi","peopl","afford","live","nice","manhattan","loft","consid","thei","live","nbc","love","insult","viewer","intellig","even","thei","re","around","gump","level","know","person","make","year","web","design","live","tini","onebedroom","apart","manhattan","cost","month","rend","br","br","like","see","show","call","phriend","six","ugli","nobodi","deadend","job","live","crummi","neighborhood","siren","constantli","wail","someon","get","mug","everi","weekand","landlord","jack","rend","watch"],"filtered2":["tv","doe","influenc","societyjust","look","surg","popular","cappucino","shop","shallow","littl","piec","work","debut","besid","real","peopl","look","good","peopl","ani","problemsbr","besid","doe","anyon","realli","believ","peopl","afford","live","nice","manhattan","loft","consid","live","nbc","love","insult","viewer","intellig","even","re","around","gump","level","know","person","make","year","web","design","live","tini","onebedroom","apart","manhattan","cost","month","rend","like","see","show","call","phriend","six","ugli","nobodi","deadend","job","live","crummi","neighborhood","siren","constantli","wail","someon","get","mug","everi","weekand","landlord","jack","rend","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,13,14,16,18,23,26,27,28,48,54,57,68,80,85,91,98,116,139,142,153,158,172,218,262,279,289,317,445,531,572,603,681,709,777,837,866,895,951,972,1150,1157,1231,1348,1431,1777,1889,2255,2546,2670,3657,3953,4193,4547,5055,5875,7588,8014,8024,8600],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,13,14,16,18,23,26,27,28,48,54,57,68,80,85,91,98,116,139,142,153,158,172,218,262,279,289,317,445,531,572,603,681,709,777,837,866,895,951,972,1150,1157,1231,1348,1431,1777,1889,2255,2546,2670,3657,3953,4193,4547,5055,5875,7588,8014,8024,8600],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,2.430631986809635,4.094543182127343,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.6955116224012472,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.011190219103739,2.0105926690411424,2.0881990796736947,8.986651598715726,2.2939035841256437,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.5001408943598484,2.5940874818617203,2.726701583487816,2.7910771187233068,2.8282659991423613,2.8529247828056143,3.241201430615691,6.849501469295936,3.4933926673701317,3.530930586689197,3.706716172503366,3.6497387377608255,4.086456389373095,3.7881170224473255,3.8962296530720266,3.9954846111673676,4.004218291136122,7.982292419137539,4.246178114249808,4.224077767249142,4.327618446189983,4.470719289830655,4.520909034354511,4.798834931860927,4.838444069955973,5.051537285416681,5.3064295350454715,5.274680836730892,5.822646007446338,11.935656034581672,5.907203395474402,6.255510089742618,6.489124940924123,6.342521466732247,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.121202932032746E-5,5.086669463422539E-5,5.126213468111329E-5,0.050548516134365465,5.096677654038259E-5,5.0895535171887166E-5,5.1046905624612776E-5,5.0874019105879775E-5,5.09884024466094E-5,0.042081489828813164,0.371517128212644,5.079189722256063E-5,5.1739902796666506E-5,0.10991449125231444,5.082893414415934E-5,5.068

{"value":"This is a complete Hoax...<br /><br />The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India. The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The film-makers in their (about the film) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India. The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song. They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively. They are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue.

{"value":"The first question that springs to mind after watching this rubbish is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the Omen name on this movie? It is a shambolic , embarrassing, pathetic atempt to carry on the Omen franchise. When the film starts the backing music sounds like it has been lifted straight from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from then on the film gets worse! I dont know who wrote the script but i bet they got a E - for it when they took it back to show their teacher! It is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and so un true to the original Omen it beggers belief. The acting is laughable , especially from the leading lady Faye Grant. she keeps pulling silly faces or is she finding it difficult not to laugh? It's hard to tell.

{"value":"I can't believe I watched this expecting more. It starts out OK. This movie pushes the limits of reality way to far!! At least the first one was somewhat realistic. It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. It does have one good message in it though, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER!!! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality. That was very aggravating. Even the make-up on the actors was completely bad. Some of the acting is pretty good. Some of the acting is really bad though. The script was OK at some points and completely messed up at other parts. This movie plays on convenience about every five minutes. Like I said, I can't believe I watched it expecting more.

{"value":"Of the ten actors who portrayed Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most personable, but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famed detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares blankly in space, obviously hypnotized, and says something like \"I must ride and be killed,\" I felt it was dumb that no one picked up on it after he does get killed. The police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After hated horse owner Gene Lockhart gets shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same thing, saying she's going out to be killed, and then fatally jumps off a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally yells \"I got it,\" as though it were a revelation. The guilty party, however, was cleverly concealed and there was considerable suspense generated when that party starts to hypnotize Lowe to get him to jump off a

{"value":"First a technical review. The script is so slow, it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The \"acting\" is pathetic, they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board. As for the whole \"point\" of the story, namely \"war is bad\" (oh, there's a shock!) is really non-existent. Without out the \"lets shock 'em and get great publicity\" scene nobody would be talking about this film. It is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on. Believe me I've seen some bad \"emperor's new clothes\" films but the one thing I can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this!

{"value":"This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic, Romance on the High Seas.<br /><br />The story line is more or less same but is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip. While Rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour. They ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in Bombay.<br /><br />On the trip, Govinda mistakes another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing Rani.<br /><br />Lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings. They are pitted against each other for the warring couple.<br /><br />It is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling.

{"value":"Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious, without any of the redeeming qualities. It doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING! This is the equivalent of a porn film, where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that this is worse, because you don't get your money's worth. Mind-numbingly boring, impossible race sequences, and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars, which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie. Sure, she's hot, but who's that desperate for an on screen female? I feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets, and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes.

{"value":"THE. WORST. FILM. EVER. MADE.<br /><br />After watching this supposedly gay made film, I suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo-nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever, all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture. I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so I had someone to scoff at when I paused the movie out of shock, disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity.<br /><br />On top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot, its just a poorly made film. A dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better.<br /><br />Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here, I suspect the writer must have a half a dozen IMDb accounts.

{"value":"Worst movie on earth. I don't even know where to begin but I hope I can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. The movie must have had a record breaking low budget which I'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover. This movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies. I would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment I put us through.

{"value":"Come on, what is the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyways? I always felt that the show, which was originally brought over from Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! There is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever.<br /><br />The bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc, all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the \"duhs\", of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAK!<br /><br />Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney bought the

{"value":"Where to start? This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked. Most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects, with muddled talking in the background. I had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on....and what was I supposed to hear exactly? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can't believe people actually put up some green for this film. It makes me think I could take a crap in a box, send it to producers, and then have them finance a movie for me.<br /><br />Dolph, was a usual, Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was a stinker.

{"value":"Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable story line for the first half<br /><br />hour or so. I was really wanting to know what was going to<br /><br />happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and how their<br /><br />seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined. But when<br /><br />the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players, they<br /><br />mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill<br /><br />for the last two hours. I kept thinking it would get better, but it only<br /><br />got worse. Don't believe the reviews. This is a waste of time. <br /><br />Think about it -- Tom Cruise made ugly -- why? The gorgeous<br /><br />hunky bartender wearing braces -- why?

{"value":"Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. I thought I'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire. Hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut...then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! \"Witchery\" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent people...until the finale. I have to admit I loved the ending. It involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed.

{"value":"Despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch. The murder-mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving. Although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed. It's obviously a pre-code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there's even a song singing the praises of marijuana! The performances are all one-note although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical but when Victor McLaglen, as the police Lieutenent, lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues, you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast-forward to the next number.

{"value":"This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!<br /><br />The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office.

{"value":"This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious WW2 movie, and serves as a statement about racism. It is worth watching to understand the fact that Movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray. Meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie (WW2). Still, there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a Dam. The story centers on the Captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be from a Civil War movie and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about. The Black Lt. gives a German women a innocent peck on the cheek, and the white Capt becomes upset. I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the Genre were interesting to

{"value":"Tony Scott directs a thriller sports flick that should attract even the non-sports fan. And some say baseball is a dead sport...boring...too damn slow. Well perk up! On the outside he appears to be a disgruntled salesman(Robert De Niro) while on the inside he is a psychotic San Francisco Giants fan. Along comes a new slugger(Wesley Snipes)and designated savior from the doldrums. Our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst slump in his career and the Giants are feared to crumble along with him. De Niro is terror personified. Snipes seems very natural as the ballplayer. Other notables in the cast are: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You are a free agent...so enjoy.

{"value":"Totally forgettable. Specially because of the weak acting. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he's been around since the late 90's. I thought he was a newcomer, since his acting was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I've seen her do well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton would be able to, but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode. It seemed that altogether there simply wasn't a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton sensed that as well. She's a fantastic actress, but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie. It felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible.

{"value":"Watching it now it's still as skanky and sexist as I remember. comes from a time when girls were \"Dolly Birds\" and basically men's playthings. It's hard to take in that it is from the Hammer studios and the fact it's available on DVD when good films are not. Our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse! Trouble is you can't help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Try to hold your stomach contents when you see Olive in a fluffy? Blue \"saucy\" nightie or something similar like Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972. Warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus, which I've been informed is not a Routemaster but a Bristol.<br /><br />Look just don't bother

{"value":"This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it. It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!<br /><br />The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office.

{"value":"Do not waste your time or your money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. It was. I can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public. It was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. It went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick. And really not a good one. I went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him. Almost. All in all, an awful movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason. Don't waste your money.

{"value":"This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. In the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which muddles everything. Malcom MacDowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just don\"t know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub. There's no continuity. The editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad. Acting. Do they have to smoke to be bad.? The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, make up your mind. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing. Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake.

{"value":"What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm? Homeless people answer to no one. They have no mortgages, rent payments or idiot bosses. Homeless people don't have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But, give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and, suddenly, they have to worry about entering the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance on their car, and working for someone else. They get a chance to be a \"productive citizens.\" This film was about as exploitive as a film can be. It's a way for the rich and middle-class sheeple to say \"see what happens when you try to help the poor?\" and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance.<br /><br />Why not a film that asks, \"What

{"value":"This film has the kernel of a really good story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This film mucks up a good story with three endings (none satisfying), a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged \"romantic\" relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire. The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (watch for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film.

{"value":"Well what can I say, there are B-Grade Movies and there are B-Grade Movies and this definitely falls into the latter. However since it's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it's not a credible movie (take a look at the closing credits) it can be forgiven.<br /><br />The plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed. He accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes on the form of a snowman - if you can believe that. The snowman, Jack Frost, is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars. In doing so, Jack Frost ends up killing half the town.<br /><br />This movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the B-Grade movies of the 50's. This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh.

{"value":"CLASS OF '61 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />In 1861, class members from the West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the Civil War.<br /><br />Gregory Hoblit's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted, despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), toplined by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery, pitting him in direct conflict with his former Northern friends. The movie's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is efficient rather than inspired.","finished_norm":["class","of","br","br","aspect","ratio","br","br","sound","format","stereobr","br","in","class","member","from","the","west","point","academi","be","tear","apart","by","the","outbreak","of","the","civil","warbr","br","gregori","hoblit","okai","histor","drama","make","a","obviou","point","virtuou","man","be","render","blind","by","conflict","though","the","product","seem","a","littl","stilt","despit","authent","period","detail","and","a","cast","of","talent","newcom","clive","owen","christien","anholt","josh","luca","andr","braugher","laura","linnei","etc","toplin","by","dan","futterman","a","a","conscienti","southern","who","take","up","arm","in","defenc","of","slaveri","pit","him","in","direct","conflict","with","hi","former","northern","friend","the","movi","emphasi","on","such","a","misguid","though","sympathet","charact","be","particularli","brave","but","the","drama","be","otherwis","flat","and","superfici","and","hoblit","direct","be","effici","rather","than","inspir"],"filtered":["class","br","br","aspect","ratio","br","br","sound","format","stereobr","br","class","member","west","point","academi","tear","apart","outbreak","civil","warbr","br","gregori","hoblit","okai","histor","drama","make","obviou","point","virtuou","man","render","blind","conflict","though","product","seem","littl","stilt","despit","authent","period","detail","cast","talent","newcom","clive","owen","christien","anholt","josh","luca","andr","braugher","laura","linnei","etc","toplin","dan","futterman","conscienti","southern","take","arm","defenc","slaveri","pit","direct","conflict","hi","former","northern","friend","movi","emphasi","misguid","though","sympathet","charact","particularli","brave","drama","otherwis","flat","superfici","hoblit","direct","effici","rather","inspir"],"filtered2":["class","aspect","ratio","sound","format","stereobr","class","member","west","point","academi","tear","apart","outbreak","civil","warbr","gregori","hoblit","okai","histor","drama","make","obviou","point","virtuou","man","render","blind","conflict","though","product","seem","littl","stilt","despit","authent","period","detail","cast","talent","newcom","clive","owen","christien","anholt","josh","luca","andr","braugher","laura","linnei","etc","toplin","dan","futterman","conscienti","southern","take","arm","defenc","slaveri","pit","direct","conflict","former","northern","friend","emphasi","misguid","though","sympathet","charact","particularli","brave","drama","otherwis","flat","superfici","hoblit","direct","effici","rather","inspir"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,14,31,35,45,66,86,92,102,160,161,178,190,191,276,383,391,429,463,497,572,594,618,627,628,645,741,743,909,953,991,1040,1090,1120,1331,1493,1745,1868,2008,2110,2279,2280,2349,2389,2424,2444,2446,2690,3033,3079,3147,3175,3708,3855,3949,4166,4180,4733,5702,5867,6408,6854,7145,7153,7356],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,14,31,35,45,66,86,92,102,160,161,178,190,191,276,383,391,429,463,497,572,594,618,627,628,645,741,743,909,953,991,1040,1090,1120,1331,1493,1745,1868,2008,2110,2279,2280,2349,2389,2424,2444,2446,2690,3033,3079,3147,3175,3708,3855,3949,4166,4180,4733,5702,5867,6408,6854,7145,7153,7356],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.8162961064622165,3.859446346783224,4.062224798544638,2.0489535369135887,4.175107420354542,2.3722295531801256,2.4323182980210873,2.532833256045391,2.558331832813986,2.5460113484259455,2.7884729505849193,3.0433232530252132,3.109204957709252,3.2872346624216657,6.693578386356513,3.342254038012865,3.4933926673701317,3.490764544963862,3.5642670069567886,3.477726550625732,7.215127625420226,3.558633189238533,3.7165362186843414,3.7568101178222815,3.9612932464190886,4.1302590120314875,4.091229668125752,4.105687751300982,4.339813719283801,4.186539847930077,9.027165988524876,4.605250182788262,5.089758498236879,4.933754249760298,5.0768550934009715,5.051537285416681,5.02684467282631,5.129498826886393,5.102830579804232,5.170884043049248,5.604922523601468,5.116075806554253,5.185068678041204,5.243909178064138,5.501738287366237,5.9370563586240825,5.7446844659766265,5.541743621979936,5.695894301807195,6.255510089742618,6.1754673820690815,5.878215858601149,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.184576246237328E-5,4.156358670334883E-5,4.1886703957044795E-5,4.164468213534698E-5,4.164536443657709E-5,4.1587152539428734E-5,4.171083855798031E-5,4.1569571588249504E-5,4.1663035139086076E-5,4.6222863191339416E-5,0.2476944107342

{"value":"I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that it's based on). Very similar plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that one instead.<br /><br />This one moves very slowly, but being a late 60s French movie, that is to be expected of the style. Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school. The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first, particularly since the audio from each overlaps (ie, hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa). Also, the \"girls\" are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school.

{"value":"I viewed this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the DVD. I will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch, I feel she didn't live up to my expectations that I have so far found from her other films. I actually was equally pleased to see Arkin turn in a humorous performance. The other two actors I wasn't very familiar with so I can't compare their performance, however they were fairly enjoyable also. The acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some could say slightly compelling, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then I recommend this film, but otherwise leave it

{"value":"I think Micheal Ironsides acting career must be over, if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish.<br /><br />This movie could be far better, if it had a good budget, but it shows repeatedly through-out the movie. There is one scene at a outpost, which looks like, its outside the front of a railway station, and i bet it was.<br /><br />There is one scene which made give this movie a 3, and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake, surrounded by forests. This was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it.<br /><br />There is another scene, which looks like a engineering plant, which i bet it, and does not look like a space outpost as the
