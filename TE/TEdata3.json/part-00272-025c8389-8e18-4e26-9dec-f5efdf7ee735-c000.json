{"value":"Want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work? Just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman's club. That's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end. This is the worst slasher film I have ever seen, but every time I was ready to switch the channel, they'd add another scene with the workout girls and I'd stay put. As a slasher film, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls working out, it is a success.

{"value":"In the first one it was mainly giant rats, but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too. This one, however, is just giant rats period, well giant rats and one really growing little boy. This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats...you know how it is. This movie has some kills and its moments, but I find it to be on par with the original, I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies. Well, that is not true...I actually like \"Empire of the Ants\", maybe I just do not care for giant rodents. All in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre.

{"value":"I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very lacking. The original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance, even years before the modern detective shows of today. But it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and \"modern\" electronics equipment and, of course, the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale. The high-tech home is a Jetson's or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and fun to think of writers inventing those \"way-out gizmos\".<br /><br />If its sunny outside, go play, as there are much better Columbo episodes. Still, we should be thankful for Cable TV that these episodes are being broadcast.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","fan","of","columbo","especi","on","a","raini","saturdai","and","it","be","fun","to","see","oskar","werner","after","fahrenheit","but","thi","episod","be","veri","lack","the","origin","plot","and","plot","twist","be","obviou","and","can","be","guess","wai","in","advanc","even","year","befor","the","modern","detect","show","of","todai","but","it","be","amus","to","see","the","crazi","couch","pattern","and","modern","electron","equip","and","of","cours","the","mandatori","suburbanit","humor","poke","fun","at","modern","art","for","sale","the","hightech","home","be","a","jetson","or","disnei","version","of","tomorrowland","and","fun","to","think","of","writer","invent","that","wayout","gizmosbr","br","if","it","sunni","outsid","go","plai","a","there","be","much","well","columbo","episod","still","we","should","be","thank","for","cabl","tv","that","thi","episod","be","be","broadcast"],"filtered":["fan","columbo","especi","raini","saturdai","fun","see","oskar","werner","fahrenheit","thi","episod","veri","lack","origin","plot","plot","twist","obviou","guess","wai","advanc","even","year","befor","modern","detect","show","todai","amus","see","crazi","couch","pattern","modern","electron","equip","cours","mandatori","suburbanit","humor","poke","fun","modern","art","sale","hightech","home","jetson","disnei","version","tomorrowland","fun","think","writer","invent","wayout","gizmosbr","br","sunni","outsid","go","plai","much","well","columbo","episod","still","thank","cabl","tv","thi","episod","broadcast"],"filtered2":["fan","columbo","especi","raini","saturdai","fun","see","oskar","werner","fahrenheit","veri","lack","origin","plot","plot","twist","obviou","guess","wai","advanc","even","year","befor","modern","detect","show","todai","amus","see","crazi","couch","pattern","modern","electron","equip","cours","mandatori","suburbanit","humor","poke","fun","modern","art","sale","hightech","home","jetson","disnei","version","tomorrowland","fun","think","writer","invent","wayout","gizmosbr","sunni","outsid","go","plai","well","columbo","still","thank","cabl","tv","broadcast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,12,15,20,28,32,33,40,57,64,69,79,140,172,183,199,220,243,259,267,287,302,369,382,383,435,651,708,712,729,789,791,841,1062,1533,1636,1747,1796,2734,2815,2992,3046,3084,3508,3563,3600,4006,4335,6373,6580,7162],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,12,15,20,28,32,33,40,57,64,69,79,140,172,183,199,220,243,259,267,287,302,369,382,383,435,651,708,712,729,789,791,841,1062,1533,1636,1747,1796,2734,2815,2992,3046,3084,3508,3563,3600,4006,4335,6373,6580,7162],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,1.834162586674748,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,2.317169775997098,2.5001408943598484,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.8336934208777267,2.627841366673578,8.239365936672145,2.7085302779237206,2.841890188081905,2.902686292364678,3.121829110937649,3.235085203598255,3.0433232530252132,3.2829611516442836,3.5474598886404074,3.6683728173057184,3.7165362186843414,11.385627752270452,3.8059428063999263,3.8240921249056035,4.30366520516749,4.327618446189983,4.558366596889411,4.679973728984199,4.74221603786142,4.77960356993304,5.390512652256013,12.685042933464494,5.408212229355414,5.463272006538442,5.463272006538442,5.604922523601468,5.649374286172302,5.9370563586240825,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.725513718988353,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.01458071998759E-4,2.012795498163838E-4,2.013292472920814E-4,2.012887736734318E-4,2.0130782326822767E-4,2.012784400216686E-4,2.0134104041092676E-4,2.012484930726172E-4,2.01279592354759E-4,2.0148759300272513E-4,2.030863384081641E-4,2.012799248165961E-4,2.0147054962498705E-4,2.0149153938033772E-4,2.0140000703507238E-4,2.012895665207778E-4,2.013588179164922E-4,2.0145357806076908E-4,2.0129995823319895E-4,2.0129922226057935E-4,2.0148032151161294E-4,2.01319390387539E-4,2.0131969506698944E-4,2.0144866261914547E-4,2.0130003084716265E-4,2.0149394770156275E-4,2.0135040540050417E-4,2.0127909870714804E-4,2.013703500488543E-4,2.0143181118237793E-4,2.0132037789173166E-4,2.01428200702066E-4,2.0152709691999193E-4,2.0171414531445781E-4,2.013500574613429E-4,2.0128944443546478E-4,2.0136202064780005E-4,2.0130988725827588E-4,2.012487078680788E-4,2.012998958938777E-4,2.0150163278967906E-4,2.0139109646015089E-4,2.0142865972223013E-4,2.0125872399380572E-4,2.0129994707934173E-4,2.0128936874294823E-4,2.013575033692428E-4,2.0139241901200304E-4,2.013514670016223E-4,2.0131955243836495E-4,2.0128986651608992E-4

{"value":"I'll say this much--This director is all about RAW images...things most of us are not ready to confront head-on. Images of sex, suicide, murder, and people \"relieving themselves\" are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I don't think that I could ever see this movie again, I will say that the director does have a good eye. There were some really nice shots and \"picture moments\" in the film (the fans, the wire fish in their hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves \"what the heck did we just see?\").<br /><br />Note: If you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily...don't see this

{"value":"Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 \"Scaramouche\", the 1952 \"Prisoner of Zenda\" and the 1950 \"King Solomon's Mines\"; Patrick Swayze fails utterly. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" was very good in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version.","finished_norm":["swayz","doe","not","make","a","veri","convinc","alan","quatermain","compar","to","stewart","granger","which","grow","up","be","my","ultim","hero","in","film","like","the","scaramouch","the","prison","of","zenda","and","the","king","solomon","mine","patrick","swayz","fail","utterli","even","the","portray","of","a","old","alan","quatermain","by","sean","conneri","in","leagu","of","extraordinari","gentleman","be","veri","good","in","a","otherwis","big","flop","conjur","alison","doodi","lack","the","grace","of","deborah","kerr","in","the","role","of","the","lead","ladi","and","last","but","not","littl","the","impress","siriaqu","in","the","role","of","umbopa","make","it","veri","hard","for","anyon","to","fill","hi","shoe","for","someon","who","be","disappoint","by","richard","chamberlain","version","i","now","highli","recommend","it","if","you","ca","not","get","your","hand","on","the","granger","version"],"filtered":["swayz","doe","make","veri","convinc","alan","quatermain","compar","stewart","granger","grow","ultim","hero","film","like","scaramouch","prison","zenda","king","solomon","mine","patrick","swayz","fail","utterli","even","portray","old","alan","quatermain","sean","conneri","leagu","extraordinari","gentleman","veri","good","otherwis","big","flop","conjur","alison","doodi","lack","grace","deborah","kerr","role","lead","ladi","last","littl","impress","siriaqu","role","umbopa","make","veri","hard","anyon","fill","hi","shoe","someon","disappoint","richard","chamberlain","version","highli","recommend","ca","get","hand","granger","version"],"filtered2":["swayz","doe","make","veri","convinc","alan","quatermain","compar","stewart","granger","grow","ultim","hero","like","scaramouch","prison","zenda","king","solomon","mine","patrick","swayz","fail","utterli","even","portray","old","alan","quatermain","sean","conneri","leagu","extraordinari","gentleman","veri","good","otherwis","big","flop","conjur","alison","doodi","lack","grace","deborah","kerr","role","lead","ladi","last","littl","impress","siriaqu","role","umbopa","make","veri","hard","anyon","fill","shoe","someon","disappoint","richard","chamberlain","version","highli","recommend","ca","get","hand","granger","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,14,15,18,39,67,81,82,128,139,144,157,158,171,183,187,215,220,235,298,375,418,472,478,482,541,553,561,627,641,735,816,852,896,1149,1422,1459,1580,1604,1956,2473,2506,2550,2647,3623,4003,4676,4766,5530,6710,6939],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,14,15,18,39,67,81,82,128,139,144,157,158,171,183,187,215,220,235,298,375,418,472,478,482,541,553,561,627,641,735,816,852,896,1149,1422,1459,1580,1604,1956,2473,2506,2550,2647,3623,4003,4676,4766,5530,6710,6939],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,1.2153159934048174,1.5538940054862738,1.9570915389266579,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,4.681980408231769,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.3360150694757706,2.3106972614914807,2.373087554090762,2.4885128563647294,2.4732161909892554,2.605934685587711,5.667386841755453,2.6457189377809835,2.7819920465008363,3.2597778161886266,3.164467636384302,3.4222967456864013,3.3243163373261977,3.3154667220492153,3.8023521382691974,3.454678155189441,3.4725585804672896,3.477726550625732,3.7034641371169887,3.7132521434831514,3.7881170224473255,4.2078172463773615,3.8844878351953436,4.297765483040301,4.484804029712395,4.933754249760298,4.605250182788262,9.738431457245454,4.85885294158718,5.583416318380505,5.339219357868463,5.408212229355414,5.339219357868463,6.214688095222362,5.850044981634453,6.0662680901040895,6.725513718988353,6.2980697041614135,6.868614562629026,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623866E-4,1.9488834103030832E-4,1.949364604671857E-4,1.9489727200317479E-4,1.949157167181518E-4,1.9488726647479024E-4,1.9494787912034467E-4,1.9485827042812345E-4,1.9488838221796688E-4,1.9508977824281057E-4,1.9663775885027946E-4,1.9488870412317754E-4,1.95073276041688E-4,1.9509359931150184E-4,1.950049733833554E-4,1.9489803967532077E-4,1.9496509213860937E-4,1.9505684337379825E-4,1.9490810142076917E-4,1.9490738881741226E-4,1.950827376426057E-4,1.949269165479166E-4,1.949272115529119E-4,1.9505208401168558E-4,1.9490817172902917E-4,1.950959311615514E-4,1.949569467443739E-4,1.9488790424509756E-4,1.94976258092362E-4,1.9503576765685172E-4,1.9492787269599052E-4,1.9503227181974877E-4,1.9512802779626668E-4,1.953091368623546E-4,1.9495660985328892E-4,1.948979214665701E-4,1.9496819317392036E-4,1.949177151705369E-4,1.948584784032069E-4,1.9490804106090195E-4,1.9510337222585736E-4,1.9499634574500038E-4,1.9503271626469294

{"value":"i think that's this is awful produced and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro shouldn't work in production of movies, he should put accent on his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution, about it's ideals, and most important about life of Che Guevara and so on. Camera is awful, like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it, music is ...i don't know..is there some music in the movie???? i will not recommended this piece of sh.. to no one. It's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever.... I can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars.

{"value":"First, IFC runs Town and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that Town and Country was watchable. This isn't.<br /><br />I can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in Europe on somebody else's dime. Belushi is especially irritating. His scene with Candy (doing a Z-grade Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless Shepherd, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would crack like walnuts!<br /><br />The real \"Crime\" (besides this being green-lighted) is Shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for a half-million bucks!

{"value":"I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.), and I had high expectations for this one since I found it listed on many \"10 Best Kung Fu/Martial Arts Movies\" websites. (I'm now convinced that those 10 Best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all, there's barely any action in the film. Most of the movie consists of talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978, but it's routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they ship is terrible; the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16:9

they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck, hands etc. No story line, weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible script!<br /><br />\"you broke my tooth!\" from one vampire \"you broke my cigar\" was the response from the human who looked like uncle Jessie from Dukes crossed with Santa!","finished_norm":["a","myself","and","my","other","half","be","big","fan","of","trash","horror","we","can","not","resist","get","out","a","movi","that","contain","both","of","the","great","we","be","thrill","howev","for","a","movi","with","a","rip","off","cover","of","freddi","v","jason","thi","be","a","disgrac","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","but","worth","a","look","for","a","laugh","if","you","be","abl","to","sit","through","itbr","br","the","act","be","aw","the","effectswel","i","can","do","well","on","my","camcord","in","fact","it","so","bad","thei","onli","bother","to","put","make","up","on","the","zombi","face","and","leav","out","neck","hand","etc","no","stori","line","weird","flashback","that","make","no","sens","and","terribl","scriptbr","br","you","break","my","tooth","from","on","vampir","you","break","my","cigar","be","the","respons","from","the","human","who","look","like","uncl","jessi","from","duke","cross","with","santa"],"filtered":["half","big","fan","trash","horror","resist","get","movi","contain","great","thrill","howev","movi","rip","cover","freddi","v","jason","thi","disgrac","wrong","film","ever","see","worth","look","laugh","abl","sit","itbr","br","act","aw","effectswel","well","camcord","fact","bad","thei","onli","bother","put","make","zombi","face","leav","neck","hand","etc","stori","line","weird","flashback","make","sens","terribl","scriptbr","br","break","tooth","vampir","break","cigar","respons","human","look","like","uncl","jessi","duke","cross","santa"],"filtered2":["half","big","fan","trash","horror","resist","get","contain","great","thrill","howev","rip","cover","freddi","v","jason","disgrac","wrong","ever","see","worth","look","laugh","abl","sit","itbr","act","aw","effectswel","well","camcord","fact","bad","onli","bother","put","make","zombi","face","leav","neck","hand","etc","stori","line","weird","flashback","make","sens","terribl","scriptbr","break","tooth","vampir","break","cigar","respons","human","look","like","uncl","jessi","duke","cross","santa"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,9,11,16,17,20,21,25,44,51,74,82,83,97,107,113,133,138,140,159,166,173,206,219,235,244,251,268,292,360,429,430,454,485,491,496,625,671,711,825,915,1051,1131,1137,1212,1218,1254,1339,1417,1670,1764,2174,2315,2544,2888,3661,6380],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,9,11,16,17,20,21,25,44,51,74,82,83,97,107,113,133,138,140,159,166,173,206,219,235,244,251,268,292,360,429,430,454,485,491,496,625,671,711,825,915,1051,1131,1137,1212,1218,1254,1339,1417,1670,1764,2174,2315,2544,2888,3661,6380],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.9486336368009016,2.020196584395323,2.292318797740072,2.0545557924622586,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,2.300267965194495,2.4423870329693536,2.4368824319140248,2.597304642813496,2.5792094178355414,2.6457189377809835,2.634508058031767,2.6942272927333892,3.6746621462132825,2.9752256367457734,6.056670924119444,3.2872346624216657,3.1419947805322432,3.2556198060399626,4.160564361526816,3.369778711402955,3.293679367864308,3.6194333882654965,3.6466665387238555,3.6375061693251913,3.8767358583910254,3.9363956947973615,4.191816905030921,5.02684467282631,5.0768550934009715,4.550761997504193,4.297765483040301,4.3095999406873045,4.506310234933358,4.733083554298147,4.9227044135737135,5.3560264761848435,5.0768550934009715,5.129498826886393,5.156897801074508,5.3560264761848435,5.672363804397,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378605E-4,1.9184256248006728E-4,1.9188992989069254E-4,1.9185135387677726E-4,1.9186951033173344E-4,1.918415047180533E-4,1.919011700894161E-4,1.9181296183105995E-4,1.918426030240317E-4,1.9204085156612026E-4,1.9356463982783106E-4,1.9184291989840274E-4,1.9202460726677848E-4,1.920446129179039E-4,1.9195737206466505E-4,1.9185210955149258E-4,1.919181140970179E-4,1.920084314139815E-4,1.9186201404870182E-4,1.9186131258214255E-4,1.9203392099871144E-4,1.9188053512690623E-4,1.9188082552146725E-4,1.9200374643273206E-4,1.918620832581614E-4,1.9204690832504042E-4,1.919100960016599E-4,1.9184213252107827E-4,1.9192910554560383E-4,1.9198768507521259E-4,1.9188147633198623E-4,1.9198424387219194E-4,1.9207850334308107E-4,1.9225678197762122E-4,1.9190976437561866E-4,1.9185199319014681E-4,1.9192116666833775E-4,1.9187147755165293E-4,1.9181316655584097E-4,1.9186195463215827E-4,1.9205423309796675E-4,1.9194887926185584E-4,1.9198468137120558E-4,1.9182271307573E-4,1.9186200341779296E-4

{"value":"Warning: Avoid this super duper awful movie...if you watched it you will be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed.<br /><br />Pam and Denise are grandma age now what are they doing? Trying SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, just not working AT ALL. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie.<br /><br />Plus The script is absolutely atrocious, I can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas. With the development of movie industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century. I bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too.<br /><br />Stay away from it.

{"value":"The only thing I remember about this movie are two things: first, as a twelve year old, even I thought it stunk. Second, it was so bad that when Mad magazine did a parody of it, they quit after the first page, and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it.<br /><br />If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period, try Animal House. It's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art. Another good selection would be Caddyshack, the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines like greens keeper Carl Spackler's

{"value":"\"Pandemonium\" is a horror movie spoof that comes off more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy spoofs. \"Airplane\", \"The Naked Gun\" trilogy, \"Blazing Saddles\", \"High Anxiety\", and \"Spaceballs\" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. \"Pandemonium\" is not up there with those films. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn't all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this film has going for it. Geez, \"Scream\" had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film.

{"value":"Sean Bean is great, as are the photography, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the conclusion flat. The plot has been SUBSTANTIALLY altered from Cornwell's novel, and not to the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched. Sharpe was too narrowly drawn here, in contrast with his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is tripped by a \"real\" officer, and after a quick pause and piercing stare, pushes the surprised and cowed officer right back. It sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer.<br /><br />Rating: \"4\" of

{"value":"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from \"Hiroshima mon amour\" and it's all downhill from there. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' \"The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage\" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. For butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid. I want 2+ hours of my life refunded. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was \"controversial\" - that is true only for the film's narcotic

{"value":"I didn't know this was a silent movie with narration. I don't care for silent movies - the corny humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. I'm sure that attributes to the low score I assigned it. It was about chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story and had I had popcorn I may have thrown it at the screen. Maybe this appeals to the sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie. No one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story.

{"value":"I'm sure this was one of those \"WOAH!\" attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just silly. The film's message is cliché. The Circle-Vision is disorienting. And that awful song at the end is grating. And I really wish they'd install seats. After so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You get entertained while sitting down, right? WRONG! You're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull, lackluster film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact, skip Canada altogether unless you're eating there.

{"value":"I could not, for the life of me, follow, figure out or understand the story. As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography.

{"value":"There are some things I can never understand. Such as this movie. What if I were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing? How can anyone even believe that an utterly fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place, would influence the events in this movie? I know that its B-grade, low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through. It just does'nt make sense.

{"value":"Abysmal with a capital \"A\". This has got to be one of, if not THE, unfunniest show on TV right now. I'm about as anti-bush as it gets, but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me. What you think of Bush as a president has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show. The \"jokes\" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: \"Welcome to camp al-qa-eeda!\". There is NOTHING funny about that. Is it even supposed to be joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show, hyping it up, were funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. Hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season. It shouldn't even have had a first.","finished_norm":["abysm","with","a","capit","a","thi","have","get","to","be","on","of","if","not","the","unfunniest","show","on","tv","right","now","i","be","about","a","antibush","a","it","get","but","thi","show","doe","not","even","get","a","chuckl","out","of","me","what","you","think","of","bush","a","a","presid","have","absolut","noth","to","do","with","whether","or","not","you","will","like","thi","piec","of","crap","show","the","joke","be","not","funni","at","all","for","exampl","in","a","scene","when","lil","bush","have","hi","underwear","on","hi","head","welcom","to","camp","alqaeeda","there","be","noth","funni","about","that","be","it","even","suppos","to","be","joke","the","commerci","that","be","show","in","the","week","lead","up","to","the","show","hyp","it","up","be","funni","than","the","show","itself","and","that","just","sad","hopefulli","thi","doe","not","even","get","consid","for","a","season","it","should","not","even","have","have","a"],"filtered":["abysm","capit","thi","get","unfunniest","show","tv","right","antibush","get","thi","show","doe","even","get","chuckl","think","bush","presid","absolut","noth","whether","like","thi","piec","crap","show","joke","funni","exampl","scene","lil","bush","hi","underwear","hi","head","welcom","camp","alqaeeda","noth","funni","even","suppos","joke","commerci","show","week","lead","show","hyp","funni","show","sad","hopefulli","thi","doe","even","get","consid","season","even"],"filtered2":["abysm","capit","get","unfunniest","show","tv","right","antibush","get","show","doe","even","get","chuckl","think","bush","presid","absolut","noth","whether","like","piec","crap","show","joke","funni","exampl","scene","lil","bush","underwear","head","welcom","camp","alqaeeda","noth","funni","even","suppos","joke","commerci","show","week","lead","show","hyp","funni","show","sad","hopefulli","doe","even","get","consid","season","even"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,12,18,19,28,49,62,121,149,157,172,208,214,218,222,307,313,317,455,597,817,857,908,1126,1589,1698,1839,2011,2051,2102,2123,2146,4295,5920],"values":[1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,12,18,19,28,49,62,121,149,157,172,208,214,218,222,307,313,317,455,597,817,857,908,1126,1589,1698,1839,2011,2051,2102,2123,2146,4295,5920],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.1865361882879695,3.704068422904524,1.066728610262888,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,9.271376516111456,3.3840606616174704,6.06783613352078,2.2190595059394194,2.3253197803590226,2.3360150694757706,2.5001408943598484,2.6289494000279396,5.460751613699401,2.5940874818617203,2.5771019354959765,2.8767855639325206,2.907069060519773,2.8529247828056143,3.2787058260741455,3.4986697244709752,4.197121957260614,3.9612932464190886,4.081705786614497,4.240607069200353,4.662879295624898,4.890269137820559,4.760735085628657,4.8796870284900224,4.944927550358424,4.944927550358424,5.00274712124725,10.678438715736926,5.9370563586240825,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125572E-4,2.273779263270828E-4,2.274340676935461E-4,2.2738834617097765E-4,2.2740986578072443E-4,2.2737667263379293E-4,2.2744738993572337E-4,2.2734284269338746E-4,2.2737797438108308E-4,2.276129448788429E-4,2.294189873473663E-4,2.2737834995069841E-4,2.2759369161694305E-4,2.2761740295299337E-4,2.2751400231007027E-4,2.273892418207622E-4,2.2746747251417917E-4,2.2757451948007208E-4,2.2740098094688535E-4,2.2740014954633704E-4,2.276047305492108E-4,2.2742293271974025E-4,2.2742327690463982E-4,2.275689666908077E-4,2.2740106297614517E-4,2.2762012354277298E-4,2.2745796921172103E-4,2.2737741672596996E-4,2.2748049992975627E-4,2.2754993025739294E-4,2.2742404826603285E-4,2.2754585163377162E-4,2.2765757096628256E-4,2.2786887249242002E-4,2.274575761579555E-4,2.2738910390558234E-4,2.274710905191083E-4,2.2741219739254268E-4,2.2734308533973026E-4,2.274009105245021E-4,2.2762880514190016E-4,2.275039363691941E-4,2.2754637017156223E-4,2.2735440017971123E-4,2.2740096834679297E-4,2.2738901839859736E-4,2.2746598751966334E-4,2.2750543040620818E-4,2.2745916846251944E-4,2.2742311578245478E-4,2.2738958071416712E-4,2.2785546503755488E-4,2.2744679848279382E-4,2.2740091622677975E-4,2.2744558042094644E-4,2.2737764936397737E-4,0.9820287660606226,2.274131240744139E-4,2.273898999400345E-4,2.2737751957101657E-4,2.2755942704103598E-4,2.2746807898261525E-4,2.2737742452124313E-4,2.273543075503875E-4,2.2733144456336734E-4,2.275369881754614E-4,2.273885635769486E-4,2.274919259604513E-4,2.275586890735531E-4,2.2745545012449876E-4,2.274012174117602E-4,2.273546055967346E-4,2.2741276710551368E-4,2.2735448314072817E-4,2.2736641433631532E-4,2.273546120314366E-4,2.2750219694523888E-4,2.2743448501087038E-4,2.2737772801157858E-4,2.2739975380719926E-4]}}
{"value":"I thought this was a sequel of some sorts, and it is meant to be to the original from 1983. But a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it.<br /><br />I actually had very little expectations to this movie, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. No suspense - I actually feel clairvoyant, poor acting, and so filled with technical errors, so I as a computer geek just couldn't believe it. They have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worthy of a low budget TV movie.<br /><br />Do not see this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Instead get the original. The theme is still valid. Don't let to much power into a machine.

{"value":"The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but I've seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.<br /><br />Rating:

{"value":"This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else. There was no plot and no point. I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","so","bad","i","can","not","sit","through","it","without","do","someth","els","there","be","no","plot","and","no","point","i","be","thoroughli","bore","and","for","a","film","about","a","stand","up","comedian","i","can","not","recal","on","joke","or","funni","line","worthi","of","the","descript","politician","with","no","charisma","speak","technic","jargon","can","not","be","littl","entertainingbr","br","so","how","be","thi","make","be","there","no","qualiti","control","in","film","watch","the","girl","in","bikini","be","the","onli","distract","dure","thi","horribl","experiencebr","br","it","hard","to","imagin","that","adam","sandler","who","have","becom","popular","and","have","appear","in","fine","comedi","be","abl","to","surviv","after","thi","kind","of","exposur","he","be","not","funni","in","the","littl","in","thi","movi","so","it","prove","that","the","write","be","so","vital","in","effect","comedi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bad","sit","without","someth","els","plot","point","thoroughli","bore","film","stand","comedian","recal","joke","funni","line","worthi","descript","politician","charisma","speak","technic","jargon","littl","entertainingbr","br","thi","make","qualiti","control","film","watch","girl","bikini","onli","distract","dure","thi","horribl","experiencebr","br","hard","imagin","adam","sandler","becom","popular","appear","fine","comedi","abl","surviv","thi","kind","exposur","funni","littl","thi","movi","prove","write","vital","effect","comedi"],"filtered2":["bad","sit","without","someth","els","plot","point","thoroughli","bore","stand","comedian","recal","joke","funni","line","worthi","descript","politician","charisma","speak","technic","jargon","littl","entertainingbr","make","qualiti","control","watch","girl","bikini","onli","distract","dure","horribl","experiencebr","hard","imagin","adam","sandler","becom","popular","appear","fine","comedi","abl","surviv","kind","exposur","funni","littl","prove","write","vital","effect","comedi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,11,14,32,53,62,65,66,84,106,107,108,115,122,125,127,170,171,196,214,230,239,244,319,340,344,377,454,464,540,824,886,944,951,1248,1337,1356,1590,1633,1703,2070,2623,2708,3240,3748,3997,4367,5223,5596],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,11,14,32,53,62,65,66,84,106,107,108,115,122,125,127,170,171,196,214,230,239,244,319,340,344,377,454,464,540,824,886,944,951,1248,1337,1356,1590,1633,1703,2070,2623,2708,3240,3748,3997,4367,5223,5596],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.3711311285073675,1.7003182735607676,4.045224089013853,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,2.2212694515902225,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.201553588425805,2.2489347673732487,2.2242236634876535,4.871935874217273,2.4214486257841834,2.373087554090762,2.478925055209576,2.7303758068497004,2.7121382192999195,2.6593400337329487,2.634508058031767,2.9056060024680126,2.948928684455311,2.983093497946387,3.0602441305135506,3.2556198060399626,3.2872346624216657,3.432149042129413,3.9081109809587793,3.9782428047328615,3.969732115064953,4.004218291136122,4.637773374493822,4.396611317676934,4.396611317676934,4.573751515728891,4.828393734102471,4.6973654716960676,4.944927550358424,5.214056214914456,5.878215858601149,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,5.907203395474402,5.907203395474402,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164684E-4,2.232427581278424E-4,2.2329787848933386E-4,2.2325298847310028E-4,2.2327411672029343E-4,2.2324152723462244E-4,2.2331095844892423E-4,2.2320831253640872E-4,2.2324280530791715E-4,2.2347350255652834E-4,2.2524669975505145E-4,2.232431740473025E-4,2.2345459944065024E-4,2.234778795547065E-4,2.2337635938917758E-4,2.2325386783430938E-4,2.233306757991403E-4,2.2343577597443512E-4,2.2326539346890408E-4,2.232645771884739E-4,2.2346543761534045E-4,2.2328694601974787E-4,2.2328728394519E-4,2.234303241699847E-4,2.2326547400635334E-4,2.2348055066696417E-4,2.2332134532680135E-4,2.2324225779449952E-4,2.23343466293942E-4,2.2341163393927902E-4,2.232880412783563E-4,2.2340762949082046E-4,2.2351731705956917E-4,2.2372477578809895E-4,2.233209594212382E-4,2.2325373242729942E-4,2.2333422800586655E-4,2.232764059286682E-4,2.2320855076990697E-4,2.2326532432724496E-4,2.2348907433600607E-4,2.233664765107441E-4,2.2340813859831582E-4,2.2321965983456392E-4,2.2326538109796102E-4,2.2325364847537198E-4,2.23329217811213E-4,2.2336794337671985E-4,2.233225227676385E-4,2.232871257532249E-4,2.2325420056448967E-4,2.237116121655261E-4,2.2331037775234815E-4,2.2326532992581914E-4,2.233091818425658E-4,2.232424862016772E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760447E-4,2.232545

{"value":"This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false.

I can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where \"A Chorus Line\" is playing. Are we to think that these people are auditioning for \"A Chorus Line,\" which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning?

{"value":"This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper class English woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. There's a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. But naturally there's a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.<br /><br />The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that.","finished_norm":["thi","romant","adventur","must","have","seem","shockingli","subvers","in","it","dai","a","wealthi","upper","class","english","woman","scheme","plot","and","manipul","everyon","around","her","for","her","own","satisfact","she","us","her","privileg","posit","to","embark","on","secret","activ","of","a","decidedli","antisoci","kind","there","a","clever","sexrol","revers","a","her","activ","prove","her","much","dare","and","dash","than","much","of","the","male","charact","but","natur","there","a","tall","dark","and","handsom","strang","to","keep","up","the","love","interest","and","thi","wick","ladi","be","not","backward","in","come","forward","when","she","meet","the","right","manbr","br","the","wishywashi","weak","and","gullibl","of","everi","other","charact","make","the","plot","unconvinc","in","the","extrem","but","that","who","thirst","for","romanc","will","overlook","that"],"filtered":["thi","romant","adventur","must","seem","shockingli","subvers","dai","wealthi","upper","class","english","woman","scheme","plot","manipul","everyon","around","satisfact","us","privileg","posit","embark","secret","activ","decidedli","antisoci","kind","clever","sexrol","revers","activ","prove","much","dare","dash","much","male","charact","natur","tall","dark","handsom","strang","keep","love","interest","thi","wick","ladi","backward","come","forward","meet","right","manbr","br","wishywashi","weak","gullibl","everi","charact","make","plot","unconvinc","extrem","thirst","romanc","overlook"],"filtered2":["romant","adventur","must","seem","shockingli","subvers","dai","wealthi","upper","class","english","woman","scheme","plot","manipul","everyon","around","satisfact","us","privileg","posit","embark","secret","activ","decidedli","antisoci","kind","clever","sexrol","revers","activ","prove","dare","dash","male","charact","natur","tall","dark","handsom","strang","keep","love","interest","wick","ladi","backward","come","forward","meet","right","manbr","wishywashi","weak","gullibl","everi","charact","make","plot","unconvinc","extrem","thirst","romanc","overlook"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,32,34,35,54,56,60,70,85,98,121,122,132,134,141,246,329,350,368,379,417,456,472,509,540,588,628,649,699,798,864,892,955,1076,1399,1700,1741,1797,2435,2437,2521,2536,2726,2782,3225,3246,3483,3574,4127,4353,4907,5584,5615,6364,6796,7231,7828,8504],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,32,34,35,54,56,60,70,85,98,121,122,132,134,141,246,329,350,368,379,417,456,472,509,540,588,628,649,699,798,864,892,955,1076,1399,1700,1741,1797,2435,2437,2521,2536,2726,2782,3225,3246,3483,3574,4127,4353,4907,5584,5615,6364,6796,7231,7828,8504],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.247774048205673,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,2.094675786251684,2.011190219103739,2.0881990796736947,2.2190595059394194,2.2489347673732487,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.2657547357741192,2.673149229007135,2.951986790814132,3.0135689919434205,3.1346146732346205,3.1272886331425473,3.1932880749197934,3.3001658770939146,3.4222967456864013,3.360519385990158,3.432149042129413,3.6375061693251913,3.607563812710113,3.6375061693251913,3.5813614403160887,3.9282323841582003,3.9782428047328615,3.9825254665248626,4.017463517886143,4.202455303235976,4.436351646326448,9.466167108596293,4.751432692966343,4.8085911068062925,5.143104478942172,5.129498826886393,5.214056214914456,5.390512652256013,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,5.541743621979936,5.583416318380505,5.695894301807195,5.626901430320244,5.850044981634453,5.907203395474402,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.95061194616239E-4,1.9488834103030867E-4,1.9493646046718605E-4,1.9489727200317514E-4,1.9491571671815215E-4,1.948872664747906E-4,1.9494787912034502E-4,1.948582704281238E-4,1.9488838221796723E-4,1.9508977824281092E-4,1.966377588502798E-4,1.948887041231779E-4,1.9507327604168835E-4,1.950935993115022E-4,1.9500497338335575E-4,1.9489803967532112E-4,1.9496509213860972E-4,1.950568433737986E-4,1.9490810142076953E-4,1.9490738881741262E-4,1.9508273764260605E-4,1.9492691654791696E-4,1.9492721155291225E-4,1.9505208401168593E-4,1.9490817172902953E-4,1.9509593116155176E-4,1.9495694674437426E-4,1.948879042450979E-4,1.9497625809236234E-4,1.9503576765685207E-4,1.9492787269599087E-4,1.9503227181974912E-4,1.9512802779626703E-4,1.9530913686235496E-4,1.9495660985328927E-4,1.9489792146657045E-4,1.9496819317392071E-4,1.9491771517053726E-4,1.9485847840320725E-4,1.949080410609023E-4,1.951033722258577E-4,1.9499634574500073E-4,1.95032716264693

{"value":"It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour.<br /><br />It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.<br /><br />It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly.

{"value":"The film starts to slowly when we got to the cinema we thought it looked quite good but after about 5 mins we were all bored out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see, i don't like this film and wouldn't recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home. this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen we were all bored out of or minds and most of the people in the cinema actually RAN out of the doors at the end because it was so rubbish. i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that. if you go and see it make sure you something to keep you busy, better still Don't go and see it at all.","finished_norm":["the","film","start","to","slowli","when","we","get","to","the","cinema","we","think","it","look","quit","good","but","after","about","min","we","be","all","bore","out","of","our","mind","and","wonder","what","kind","of","film","we","have","come","to","see","i","do","not","like","thi","film","and","would","not","recommend","it","to","anyon","the","well","part","of","the","night","be","when","the","alarm","and","light","come","back","on","becaus","the","project","break","down","becaus","we","think","we","can","all","go","home","thi","have","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","we","be","all","bore","out","of","or","mind","and","much","of","the","peopl","in","the","cinema","actual","run","out","of","the","door","at","the","end","becaus","it","be","so","rubbish","i","be","surpris","that","no","on","walk","out","earli","than","that","if","you","go","and","see","it","make","sure","you","someth","to","keep","you","busi","well","still","do","not","go","and","see","it","at","all"],"filtered":["film","start","slowli","get","cinema","think","look","quit","good","min","bore","mind","wonder","kind","film","come","see","like","thi","film","recommend","anyon","well","part","night","alarm","light","come","back","becaus","project","break","becaus","think","go","home","thi","wrong","film","ever","see","bore","mind","much","peopl","cinema","actual","run","door","end","becaus","rubbish","surpris","walk","earli","go","see","make","sure","someth","keep","busi","well","still","go","see"],"filtered2":["start","slowli","get","cinema","think","look","quit","good","min","bore","mind","wonder","kind","come","see","like","recommend","anyon","well","part","night","alarm","light","come","back","becaus","project","break","becaus","think","go","home","wrong","ever","see","bore","mind","peopl","cinema","actual","run","door","end","becaus","rubbish","surpris","walk","earli","go","see","make","sure","someth","keep","busi","well","still","go","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,12,16,20,22,23,24,25,34,44,52,53,61,63,64,71,108,119,120,122,134,137,158,175,210,238,266,294,298,302,326,353,360,409,659,790,838,1098,1375,1826,3120],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,12,16,20,22,23,24,25,34,44,52,53,61,63,64,71,108,119,120,122,134,137,158,175,210,238,266,294,298,302,326,353,360,409,659,790,838,1098,1375,1826,3120],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,2.912480743411154,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,3.893772050208532,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,2.7965700178917925,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9214926742550966,4.277015007255866,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2489347673732487,2.2443961816702407,2.2939035841256437,2.3106972614914807,2.3791142619576227,2.687151791517189,5.194609285626992,2.747702973022204,2.886778509330039,2.7819920465008363,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,3.0266839340212486,3.028335462059722,6.441915648678089,3.6405503117064195,3.749984152751882,3.9363956947973615,4.186539847930077,4.416284083275639,4.900964426937307,5.626901430320244]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745131E-4,2.0463497070976393E-4,2.0468549666480013E-4,2.0464434833266984E-4,2.046637154928043E-4,2.046338424142702E-4,2.0469748638025654E-4,2.0460339623606895E-4,2.0463501395727305E-4,2.0484648206987063E-4,2.0647187928241815E-4,2.0463535196139893E-4,2.048291545713373E-4,2.0485049423537823E-4,2.0475743600462676E-4,2.0464515439713875E-4,2.0471556024485925E-4,2.048119000834879E-4,2.046557193440937E-4,2.046549711024785E-4,2.048390893597214E-4,2.046754754412125E-4,2.0467578519980681E-4,2.0480690269923505E-4,2.0465579316856494E-4,2.048529427044045E-4,2.047070074884348E-4,2.046345120803337E-4,2.0472728462307002E-4,2.0478977034141482E-4,2.0467647940754553E-4,2.0478609967276742E-4,2.0488664453525862E-4,2.0507681111083846E-4,2.0470665374897076E-4,2.0464503027660847E-4,2.047188163671428E-4,2.046658138904977E-4,2.0460361461226777E-4,2.0465565596554782E-4,2.0486075590640647E-4,2.047483768864017E-4,2.0478656634500473E-4,2.0461379771132885E-4,2.0465570800429667E-4,2.0464495332226355E-4,2.0471422378351423E-4,2.0474972148578984E-4,2.0470808678692246E-4,2.0467564019349883E-4,2.0464545939350806E-4,2.0506474470589783E-4,2.0469695408604984E-4,2.046556610974682E-4,2.0469585785804528E-4,2.0463472144925793E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788313998E-4,2.0464574668954016E-4,2.0463460463854036E-4,2.047983172310537E-4,2.0471610605268087E-4,2.0463451909590255E-4,2.046137143470408E-4,2.0459313817786386E-4,2.047781227615474E-4,2.0464454399310713E-4,2.04737567791249E-4,2.0479765307

{"value":"I had such high hopes for this film because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-DVD sequels. They deserve a razzie. Several, in fact. I thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better. What happened to the great music Disney used to have in their films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King...even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. They've made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres.<br /><br />I hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the Walt Disney

{"value":"A failure. The movie was just not good. It has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at. I mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies. The movie should have been aired as a Disney Channel original movie, that is FREE.<br /><br />The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun.<br /><br />4 out of 10. If I gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.","finished_norm":["a","failur","the","movi","be","just","not","good","it","have","humor","that","year","old","that","will","not","even","giggl","at","i","mean","sure","some","part","be","amus","but","much","of","it","be","not","lindsei","lohan","be","a","great","actress","and","a","bad","singer","and","she","should","be","work","on","well","movi","the","movi","should","have","be","air","a","a","disnei","channel","origin","movi","that","be","freebr","br","the","onli","thing","that","be","good","do","about","thi","movi","be","the","music","noth","like","a","remak","rock","soundtrack","to","brighten","up","your","dai","thi","song","be","so","good","especi","alyson","and","amanda","walk","on","sunshin","and","caleigh","peter","beach","boi","song","fun","fun","funbr","br","out","of","if","i","give","it","a","ten","of","that","would","be","the","music","and","will","be","the","movi","not","worth","your","monei","but","the","soundtrack","be"],"filtered":["failur","movi","good","humor","year","old","even","giggl","mean","sure","part","amus","much","lindsei","lohan","great","actress","bad","singer","work","well","movi","movi","air","disnei","channel","origin","movi","freebr","br","onli","thing","good","thi","movi","music","noth","like","remak","rock","soundtrack","brighten","dai","thi","song","good","especi","alyson","amanda","walk","sunshin","caleigh","peter","beach","boi","song","fun","fun","funbr","br","give","ten","music","movi","worth","monei","soundtrack"],"filtered2":["failur","good","humor","year","old","even","giggl","mean","sure","part","amus","lindsei","lohan","great","actress","bad","singer","work","well","air","disnei","channel","origin","freebr","onli","thing","good","music","noth","like","remak","rock","soundtrack","brighten","dai","song","good","especi","alyson","amanda","walk","sunshin","caleigh","peter","beach","boi","song","fun","fun","funbr","give","ten","music","worth","monei","soundtrack"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,9,11,20,29,30,48,49,51,57,61,67,69,88,118,119,126,132,219,259,267,282,294,328,355,369,483,545,582,679,708,728,760,796,841,1269,1453,1872,2891,3392,4113,4504,5971,6533],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,9,11,20,29,30,48,49,51,57,61,67,69,88,118,119,126,132,219,259,267,282,294,328,355,369,483,545,582,679,708,728,760,796,841,1269,1453,1872,2891,3392,4113,4504,5971,6533],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.0358433949768115,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.165345040023057,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.9570915389266579,2.127032521151058,2.0317223413467334,4.70875905096179,2.1653408989309972,2.2391270689902285,2.253494045787767,2.5792094178355414,5.492910624448097,2.7085302779237206,2.918851229218033,2.886778509330039,6.310084991849437,3.0316467233633775,3.121829110937649,3.613480989738201,3.442099372982581,3.7099788181381825,3.6715125373103863,3.6683728173057184,3.7740817043309423,3.850067611308864,7.700135222617728,4.30366520516749,4.327618446189983,4.74221603786142,4.911775343041523,5.426230734858092,5.672363804397,6.032366538428407,6.032366538428407,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651714E-4,2.3166917872259978E-4,2.3172637963242868E-4,2.316797952178618E-4,2.3170172096235685E-4,2.316679013686388E-4,2.3173995330228223E-4,2.3163343296338693E-4,2.316692276835124E-4,2.3190863272655845E-4,2.3374876022784933E-4,2.316696103411685E-4,2.318890161021828E-4,2.3191317493693835E-4,2.3180782283696835E-4,2.31680707771043E-4,2.317604148947184E-4,2.3186948213389043E-4,2.3169266844704972E-4,2.3169182135566609E-4,2.3190026336973314E-4,2.317150345107699E-4,2.3171538519139358E-4,2.3186382454808485E-4,2.3169275202442928E-4,2.3191594687179616E-4,2.317507322385732E-4,2.316686595038999E-4,2.3177368817377576E-4,2.3184442884434945E-4,2.3171617111051644E-4,2.3184027324578307E-4,2.3195410103209606E-4,2.3216939040434883E-4,2.317503317667925E-4,2.3168056725302104E-4,2.3176410118143974E-4,2.3170409657815983E-4,2.316336801891395E-4,2.3169259669560068E-4,2.3192479227141048E-4,2.3179756692385696E-4,2.3184080156982064E-4,2.316452085715472E-4,2.3169265560915863E-4,2.3168048013228197E-4,2.3175890187423554E-4,2.3179908915749514E-4,2.3175195412256187E-4,2.3171522102838582E-4,2.3168105306030682E-4,2.3215572991360753E-4,2.3173935068699475E-4,2.316926025054961E-4,2.3173810963694045E-4,2.3166889653243204E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908932E-4,2.3168137831085215E-4,2.316687642899179E-4,2.3185410485865142E-4,2.317610328088967E-4,2.316686674462915E-4,2.3164511419405113E-4,2.3162181971902594E-4,2.318312425094203E-4,2.3168001672688667E-4,2.3178532984537484E-4,2.318533529636744E-4,2.3174816560918513E-4,2.31692909374
