{"value":"When you have a disembodied skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, a scheming cad and a nutzo gardener, throw in a minister and his wife - what have you got?<br /><br />AIP's answer to insomnia.<br /><br />\"The Screaming Skull\" gets points for audacity, offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fright from watching the film. Pretty safe bet, when you're lulled into a stupor by people who think they're in a production of \"Suspense for Dummies\".<br /><br />But Peggy Webber was a cutie, anyway. She had a few good moments of acting here and there (especially when trying to communicate with the gardener) and no one else fills a nightgown like she. But that scared face she makes - scary in itself. Whoa.<br /><br />As a whole, though, there is little suspense here and everything is telegraphed like a punch thrown by a mime. You can't be scared by this film, it's impossible. It has its moments, but not enough of them.<br /><br />HOWEVER, thanks to a certain Mike Nelson and his two robot pals, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy THEY got hold of (\"The film jumped, and it was really scary!\").<br /><br />One star for \"The Screaming Skull\", eight and a half for the MST3K version.<br /><br />Talk about a \"Screaming\"

{"value":"I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.<br /><br />The film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. I was left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.<br /><br />Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","my","fair","share","of","badli","thoughtout","end","and","final","twist","to","film","but","i","do","not","recal","ani","film","that","commit","outright","suicid","like","thi","on","didbr","br","the","film","maker","be","clearli","hope","that","the","great","twist","would","surpris","u","all","and","it","do","but","perhap","not","in","the","wai","the","director","have","hope","i","be","leav","feel","surpris","that","conneri","harri","fishburn","and","capshaw","have","anyth","to","do","with","thi","turkei","individu","or","collectivelybr","br","the","film","up","until","the","final","thirti","minut","be","rather","engag","and","i","like","the","wai","the","stori","be","unfold","and","the","natur","of","the","film","overal","but","onc","the","twist","be","reveal","the","plot","hole","and","inconsist","be","remark","the","underli","motiv","for","reveng","be","illconceiv","and","the","wai","thing","so","neatli","work","out","for","bobbi","earl","be","ridicul","farfetch","what","wrong","be","that","onc","the","twist","be","reveal","the","remaind","of","the","film","becom","excruciatingli","predictablebr","br","harri","give","a","terrif","perform","and","conneri","be","like","morgan","freeman","in","that","he","never","give","a","bad","perform","even","if","the","movi","have","not","that","great","so","all","in","all","it","start","good","and","the","unfold","keep","the","viewer","interest","the","last","minut","be","on","of","the","much","memor","nose","dive","in","the","histori","of","cinema"],"filtered":["see","fair","share","badli","thoughtout","end","final","twist","film","recal","ani","film","commit","outright","suicid","like","thi","didbr","br","film","maker","clearli","hope","great","twist","surpris","u","perhap","wai","director","hope","leav","feel","surpris","conneri","harri","fishburn","capshaw","anyth","thi","turkei","individu","collectivelybr","br","film","final","thirti","minut","rather","engag","like","wai","stori","unfold","natur","film","overal","onc","twist","reveal","plot","hole","inconsist","remark","underli","motiv","reveng","illconceiv","wai","thing","neatli","work","bobbi","earl","ridicul","farfetch","wrong","onc","twist","reveal","remaind","film","becom","excruciatingli","predictablebr","br","harri","give","terrif","perform","conneri","like","morgan","freeman","never","give","bad","perform","even","movi","great","start","good","unfold","keep","viewer","interest","last","minut","much","memor","nose","dive","histori","cinema"],"filtered2":["see","fair","share","badli","thoughtout","end","final","twist","recal","ani","commit","outright","suicid","like","didbr","maker","clearli","hope","great","twist","surpris","u","perhap","wai","director","hope","leav","feel","surpris","conneri","harri","fishburn","capshaw","anyth","turkei","individu","collectivelybr","final","thirti","minut","rather","engag","like","wai","stori","unfold","natur","overal","onc","twist","reveal","plot","hole","inconsist","remark","underli","motiv","reveng","illconceiv","wai","thing","neatli","work","bobbi","earl","ridicul","farfetch","wrong","onc","twist","reveal","remaind","becom","excruciatingli","predictablebr","harri","give","terrif","perform","conneri","like","morgan","freeman","never","give","bad","perform","even","great","start","good","unfold","keep","viewer","interest","last","minut","memor","nose","dive","histori","cinema"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,9,17,24,25,27,29,30,32,33,42,43,48,51,58,59,60,71,74,104,105,112,115,134,144,156,160,181,236,274,279,318,326,409,412,435,448,456,494,499,763,810,833,871,877,902,943,969,1010,1074,1124,1228,1373,1520,1537,1703,1952,2042,2067,2157,2210,2359,2709,2770,3207,3623,4072,4200,4217,4713,4856,5152,5445,5747,6325,6534,7441,8552],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,9,17,24,25,27,29,30,32,33,42,43,48,51,58,59,60,71,74,104,105,112,115,134,144,156,160,181,236,274,279,318,326,409,412,435,448,456,494,499,763,810,833,871,877,902,943,969,1010,1074,1124,1228,1373,1520,1537,1703,1952,2042,2067,2157,2210,2359,2709,2770,3207,3623,4072,4200,4217,4713,4856,5152,5445,5747,6325,6534,7441,8552],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,1.3711311285073675,4.205560634305565,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,3.4279798616619646,1.865701314626681,3.7386508898401445,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,1.9486336368009016,2.0728240170322856,4.353122425996981,2.2466628996789315,2.20155358842580

{"value":"When I read MOST of the other comments, I felt they were way too glowing for this movie. I found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen, it's often best to just let things be. I completely agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series---millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the original.<br /><br />The plot is at times incomprehensible, it is terribly gory (though the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bloodier) and lacks the heart of the originals. I didn't mind the blood at all, but some may be turned off by it (particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads). In addition, time has not been good to Ichi--he seems a broken and sad man in this film (much, much more than usual)--and that's something fans of the series may not really want to see.<br /><br />This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi film, this one is very skipable.

{"value":"I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibit and, in retrospect, probably should have.<br /><br />Aside from the score being great (Bjork) and the photography rich and colorful, the content was mostly tedious and predictable. Gee, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to figure out what the pearl-divers were up to. The film was mostly a silly mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology being used in a mock-hunt/harvest. The film \"peaks\" with enough gratuitous shock-art to turn your stomach.<br /><br />What was the point of the movie? While others might argue that it is an anti-whaling piece, one could equally argue that it somehow also justifies whaling. Personally I think it was Barney's attempt at \"flashing\" the audience with his anal, fecal, self-mutilation, and cannibalistic fetishes.<br /><br />Bottom line: unless you really get off on Barney's sense of art, don't bother seeing this movie. The message is obscure, the pace slow, and the cultural references pretentious.

{"value":"Ironically, although he can do the \"splits\", Thomas is a complete stiff as an actor. <br /><br />This film is seared into my memory as one of the most side-splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies I have ever seen. As such, I'm actually rather fond of it. <br /><br />Still,the only reason this gets more than one star is that Thomas is great shape, and it's fun to see his tiny, muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the East European country side (including the infamous \"pommel horse\" shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers). But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote, and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits. <br /><br />Thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor. Everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera guys, etc. is at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think. <br /><br />I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran.

{"value":"Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding. There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel;you are given no impression of Jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him.<br /><br />Despite to poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall the production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful.

{"value":"A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I would like it. Based partially on that argument, I agreed to watch the film.<br /><br />'Flushed Away' has good intentions (At least on Aardman's part), but lacks the strength to pull it all together. Its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain, Rita (Played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the movie's main character instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita's cool, tough, and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.<br /><br />One of the things that bothered me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with. When Roddy gets hit in the crouch, the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately. \"My name's Shocky,\" says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocutes Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low.<br /><br />I won't waste time griping about Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward Pixar (One similar film's a coincidence, five's a rip off.), but I will say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do (and have done) so much better.

{"value":"Okay this is stupid,they say their not making another Nightmare film,that this is the \"last\" one...And what do they do?They go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was BAD,but why do they play us. Anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,Freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.The plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!Id say. I hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.Again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime. How can they have gone this far?Didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?Yet they make this?Its all bout the money,DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES.<br /><br />I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 out of 10.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE: Had potential with plot.<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM: Terrible acting/lack of deaths/Too funny to be classified

{"value":"Once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Reuniting with some former co-stars to clean up the town.<br /><br />Low key, often to the point of blandness, \"action\" comedy mostly just doesn't work. Part of the problem is the casting Chris Klien as a former action hero. he's not bad, but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy. As I said he's not bad, he's just just miscast for what his back story is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness. There is no life in the way things are set up. Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list. It makes for an un-engaging film. And yet the film occasionally springs to life, such as the in the final show down that ends the film. That sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.<br /><br />I can't really recommend the film.

{"value":"Once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Reuniting with some former co-stars to clean up the town.<br /><br />Low key, often to the point of blandness, \"action\" comedy mostly just doesn't work. Part of the problem is the casting Chris Klien as a former action hero. he's not bad, but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy. As I said he's not bad, he's just just miscast for what his back story is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness. There is no life in the way things are set up. Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list. It makes for an un-engaging film. And yet the film occasionally springs to life, such as the in the final show down that ends the film. That sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.<br /><br />I can't really recommend the film. Its worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.","finished_norm":["onc","big","action","star","who","fall","off","the","face","of","the","earth","end","up","in","a","small","town","with","a","problem","with","drug","dealer","and","a","dead","bodi","of","a","feder","agent","reunit","with","some","former","costar","to","clean","up","the","townbr","br","low","kei","often","to","the","point","of","bland","action","comedi","mostli","just","doe","not","work","part","of","the","problem","be","the","cast","chri","klien","a","a","former","action","hero","he","not","bad","but","he","realli","not","believ","a","some","on","who","be","take","to","be","a","tough","gui","a","i","sai","he","not","bad","he","just","just","miscast","for","what","hi","back","stori","be","the","real","problem","here","be","the","combin","of","the","script","which","realli","be","not","funni","and","seem","artifici","at","time","and","the","direct","which","be","pedestrian","to","the","port","of","dull","there","be","no","life","in","the","wai","thing","be","set","up","it","a","if","the","director","have","a","list","of","shot","and","go","by","that","list","it","make","for","a","unengag","film","and","yet","the","film","occasion","spring","to","life","such","a","the","in","the","final","show","down","that","end","the","film","that","sequenc","work","but","becaus","the","earli","part","of","the","film","flounder","it","drain","of","much","of","it","powerbr","br","i","ca","not","realli","recommend","the","film","it","worth","a","shoot","if","you","re","a","fan","of","the","actor","or","be","a","huge","fan","of","independ","cinema","in","all","it","form","but","otherwis","thi","be","just","a","disappoint"],"filtered":["onc","big","action","star","fall","face","earth","end","small","town","problem","drug","dealer","dead","bodi","feder","agent","reunit","former","costar","clean","townbr","br","low","kei","often","point","bland","action","comedi","mostli","doe","work","part","problem","cast","chri","klien","former","action","hero","bad","realli","believ","take","tough","gui","sai","bad","miscast","hi","back","stori","real","problem","combin","script","realli","funni","seem","artifici","time","direct","pedestrian","port","dull","life","wai","thing","set","director","list","shot","go","list","make","unengag","film","yet","film","occasion","spring","life","final","show","end","film","sequenc","work","becaus","earli","part","film","flounder","drain","much","powerbr","br","ca","realli","recommend","film","worth","shoot","re","fan","actor","huge","fan","independ","cinema","form","otherwis","thi","disappoint"],"filtered2":["onc","big","action","star","fall","face","earth","end","small","town","problem","drug","dealer","dead","bodi","feder","agent","reunit","former","costar","clean","townbr","low","kei","often","point","bland","action","comedi","mostli","doe","work","part","problem","cast","chri","klien","former","action","hero","bad","realli","believ","take","tough","gui","bad","miscast","back","stori","real","problem","combin","script","realli","funni","seem","artifici","time","direct","pedestrian","port","dull","life","wai","thing","set","director","list","shot","go","list","make","unengag","yet","occasion","spring","life","final","show","end","sequenc","work","becaus","earli","part","flounder","drain","powerbr","ca","realli","recommend","worth","shoot","re","fan","actor","huge","fan","independ","cinema","form","otherwis","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,9,13,17,18,22,24,28,29,31,33,35,41,48,55,58,61,62,63,66,68,75,77,80,81,82,91,92,100,102,109,117,127,129,140,156,167,169,187,194,217,219,228,236,251,266,298,349,363,367,375,376,400,409,441,444,450,510,522,601,627,689,697,968,1028,1039,1069,1099,1109,1140,1211,1236,1495,1541,2462,2631,2776,2874,3747,3780,3960,5669,5753,6403,7317],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,9,13,17,18,22,24,28,29,31,33,35,41,48,55,58,61,62,63,66,68,75,77,80,81,82,91,92,100,102,109,117,127,129,140,156,167,169,187,194,217,219,228,236,251,266,298,349,363,367,375,376,400,409,441,444,450,510,522,601,627,689,697,968,1028,1039,1069,1099,1109,1140,1211,1236,1495,1541,2462,2631,2776,2874,3747,3780,3960,5669,5753,6403,7317],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,3.3953824709201923,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,3.3910232448024944,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,3.7637034094785053,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,3.9484500497

{"value":"I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film. I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead (which, by the way, is great fun).<br /><br />The story has massive holes in it. The plot line is hugely over stated and dull, the acting is awful, especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at (looking daft and singing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet. Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something, which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that; though Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake, he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover

{"value":"This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn't it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You're supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

{"value":"i can't believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end. and it did. the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer - so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird. no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty. a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings. but no go. he preferred to say \"objection\" 2 or 3 times during the whole trial - that was it. the blonde lunatic was given a truth-drug to prove her innocent but not Brett. the lunatic almost had an altar of Brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession. but again no go. during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head. even real weirdos do not look that silly fake \"i am innocent\" like she did. and what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls

{"value":"No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie. It's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch. Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction. Students fist-fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue. The Watts riots with a cast of...ugh...10?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a Mary Hartman look-alike with the most annoying smile since 'Mr. Sardonicus'. Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift. Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service. Silly, giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of 'Shindig', sing horribly off key, and actually make it big in the music business. And who wrote this compelling dialog?: \"I'm going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair\"....\"I think I found someone to buy Stick's woody!\"....\"These people are 'animals'!\" \"These people are my 'family'! as the Shirelles sing \"Mama Said\".

{"value":"Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place, it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - Man To Man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the

{"value":"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch \"Regis and KAthie Lee\" or \"The View.\") My four year old found one scene funny, but told me the rest of it was \"too silly.\" This is a FOUR YEAR OLD, folks. Anyone over the age of, say, nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />To say this movie is bad is like saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this \"film\" truly is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse. Bronson \"Balki\" Pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are awful. I haven't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages, but I KNOW that they HAD to be way better than this. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with... this?<br /><br />Bottom line: derivative garbage. Avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky Bronson Pinchot fetish.

{"value":"\"The Man In The Attic\" is a movie set in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that really didn't need to be told.<br /><br />Looking at the box, the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic. They use terms such as \"illicit passion\", \"forbidden affair\", and \"unlimited pleasures\". They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun!<br /><br />The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other.<br /><br />The supposedly \"shocking\" part of the movie is this: Krista's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up having Edward live up in their attic. Wow! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward gets extremely jealous. So on and so on and so on.<br /><br />\"The Man In The Attic\" doesn't cover any new territory.

{"value":"This seemed to be a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable, but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message, which it seems is it seemed was what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied, if indeed that was the director's intention. This falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most.<br /><br />Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo-typing of the American characters - they all seem to be carved out of the same block. Seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based upon how common Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any

{"value":"To be brutally honest... I LOVED watching Severed. That's why I<br /><br />gave it a 1/10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative<br /><br />story/filming/acting/everything. This film was a RIOT to watch. If<br /><br />you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them, you will<br /><br />really get a kick out of Severed.<br /><br />The story really doesn't matter, it involves some guy who's bald<br /><br />and has a sword and goes around beheading random people. <br /><br />But he has a supernatural twist... nobody ever sees him do it. <br /><br />Even when, in one very memorable scene, he walks into a<br /><br />jampacked night club and whacks off some girl's noodle and<br /><br />nobody sees it. <br /><br />Severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video- it WAS<br /><br />filmed on someone's home camcorder. The filmmakers had<br /><br />knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition<br /><br />actually holds together in some scenes. But mostly you can't hear<br /><br />the actors... you can't understand what they're doing, and you laugh<br /><br />when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body.<br /><br />Go and rent this movie.

{"value":"the more i think about it, there was nothing redeeming about this<br /><br />movie. i saw it 9 months ago, so my memory might have made it<br /><br />worse than it was, but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of<br /><br />10. <br /><br />after seeing the movie, i met the director. he seemed so clueless<br /><br />as to what he was doing or what he had done, and as far as i<br /><br />could tell, he didn't care for the film either. even he agreed that he<br /><br />didn't really know what he was doing, and he was forced to do<br /><br />certain things because it was filmed digitally. <br /><br />i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it<br /><br />built for itself: \"9 people all have to be connected in some way. how<br /><br />can we get from point 'A' to point 'B'\" so in order get from the<br /><br />prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10<br /><br />minutes on each character's relationship to another person. it<br /><br />makes one feel choked by the 2 demensional, badly drawn<br /><br />characters.<br /><br />I just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie... Steve<br /><br />Bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing. that's it. as i<br /><br />say... 4 out of

{"value":"I'm not sure what HK movies the other reviewers have been watching, but Enter the Eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in HK action. Michael \"Fitz\" Wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in HK, because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with the leg fighting than her dad), but her acting skills are also sub-par. In fact, all the English dialog (90% of the movie--even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the English subs. Sure, there are some decent gunfights (but nothing we haven't already seen before) and good cinematography, but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action.<br /><br />That said, it's worth the price of admission to watch Shannon and Benny \"The Jet\" Urquidez go at it. Spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for.<br /><br />Finally, you might notice some scenes that seem \"familiar\" to you, notably a shootout at an outdoor market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues (think MI:2).

{"value":"'I'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and I'm starting to get confused about who I really am, sh*#t! I've got a headache and things are going wobbly, oh no here comes another near subliminal fast-cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic images...'<br /><br />I rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable. Why? Cypher is a cheap, derivative, dull movie, set in a poorly realised bland futureworld, with wooden leads, and a laughable ending.<br /><br />An eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events, before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of Bond with a Duran Duran video.<br /><br />It's painfully obvious they have eked out the production using Dr Who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good (if a little Babylon 5) CGI set pieces. This sub Fight Club, sub Philip K Dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allow.<br /><br />Cool blue moodiness served up with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb. This is not intelligent Sci-Fi, this is the plot of a computer

{"value":"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it's so...so...unreal. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals, not every French musical is gold. This film is not another \"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or \"Huit Femmes\" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity.","finished_norm":["if","i","have","not","read","hi","name","on","the","dvd","cover","i","never","would","have","suspect","that","thi","rather","gushi","and","old","fashion","music","be","make","by","a","man","so","close","associ","with","the","french","new","wave","in","fact","the","film","be","so","far","from","that","that","i","wonder","if","back","in","the","and","new","wave","auteur","would","have","absolut","hate","thi","typ","of","filmit","sosounr","and","it","seem","to","have","littl","to","do","with","so","mani","of","hi","previou","film","thi","be","not","necessarili","a","bad","thingjust","a","veri","surpris","thingbr","br","what","i","conjur","find","a","bite","surpris","be","the","amount","of","prais","some","of","the","review","give","thi","filmespeci","when","there","be","so","mani","well","french","music","out","there","the","song","in","thi","film","be","simpli","not","particularli","interest","and","the","charact","all","seem","so","bland","and","stereotyp","if","i","have","to","see","anoth","rich","person","who","fret","about","how","hard","it","be","to","be","rich","or","get","a","good","sale","price","on","a","design","outfit","i","be","go","to","pukebr","br","the","bottom","line","be","that","like","american","music","not","everi","french","music","be","gold","thi","film","be","not","anoth","le","paraplui","de","cherbourg","umbrella","of","cherbourg","or","huit","femm","eight","woman","and","despit","the","presenc","of","audrei","tautou","i","ca","not","see","much","reason","to","recommend","it","a","anyth","other","than","a","dull","odditi"],"filtered":["read","hi","name","dvd","cover","never","suspect","thi","rather","gushi","old","fashion","music","make","man","close","associ","french","new","wave","fact","film","far","wonder","back","new","wave","auteur","absolut","hate","thi","typ","filmit","sosounr","seem","littl","mani","hi","previou","film","thi","necessarili","bad","thingjust","veri","surpris","thingbr","br","conjur","find","bite","surpris","amount","prais","review","give","thi","filmespeci","mani","well","french","music","song","thi","film","simpli","particularli","interest","charact","seem","bland","stereotyp","see","anoth","rich","person","fret","hard","rich","get","good","sale","price","design","outfit","go","pukebr","br","bottom","line","like","american","music","everi","french","music","gold","thi","film","anoth","le","paraplui","de","cherbourg","umbrella","cherbourg","huit","femm","eight","woman","despit","presenc","audrei","tautou","ca","see","much","reason","recommend","anyth","dull","odditi"],"filtered2":["read","name","dvd","cover","never","suspect","rather","gushi","old","fashion","music","make","man","close","associ","french","new","wave","fact","far","wonder","back","new","wave","auteur","absolut","hate","typ","filmit","sosounr","seem","littl","mani","previou","necessarili","bad","thingjust","veri","surpris","thingbr","conjur","find","bite","surpris","amount","prais","review","give","filmespeci","mani","well","french","music","song","simpli","particularli","interest","charact","seem","bland","stereotyp","see","anoth","rich","person","fret","hard","rich","get","good","sale","price","design","outfit","go","pukebr","bottom","line","like","american","music","everi","french","music","gold","anoth","le","paraplui","de","cherbourg","umbrella","cherbourg","huit","femm","eight","woman","despit","presenc","audrei","tautou","ca","see","reason","recommend","anyth","dull","odditi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,10,14,15,20,30,35,38,39,42,45,50,60,63,67,70,73,81,85,87,95,97,101,104,107,118,143,145,153,154,160,171,175,176,201,222,223,247,295,298,326,328,339,367,384,391,491,497,604,681,750,771,784,860,899,937,977,1028,1037,1159,1648,1653,1742,1800,1804,1943,2207,2253,2286,3084,3544,4181,4499,4886,6297,6491],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,10,14,15,20,30,35,38,39,42,45,50,60,63,67,70,73,81,85,87,95,97,101,104,107,118,143,145,153,154,160,171,175,176,201,222,223,247,295,298,326,328,339,367,384,391,491,497,604,681,750,771,784,860,899,937,977,1028,1037,1159,1648,1653,1742,1800,1804,1943,2207,2253,2286,3084,3544,4181,4499,4886,6297,6491],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.8162961064622165,3.43598877114071,1.838176641236591,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,3.7901378413541957,1.949757232424728,2

{"value":"OK Hollywood is not liberal.<br /><br />Obviously I'm lieing because it is. Im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie. This movie was anti bush, anti middle east , anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad.<br /><br />Fist off i will give credit where credit is due. i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good.<br /><br />The plot was impossible for me to decode however. I have been tested and have an IQ of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what.<br /><br />The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized.<br /><br />Unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story, which it very well may be, i have no idea exactly what was going on.<br /><br />Which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique!

{"value":"My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, \"light\" moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character.

{"value":"Anyone who has said that it's better than Hostel is talking complete crap, believe me I'm not a fan of Hostel but this is just ridiculous. This is just another shot on camcorder, straight to DVD, low on ideas waste of your time, I can't believe how many of these films there are and I'm yet to see a decent one. In the 80's video nasties, gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people browsing in Blockbuster to rent a copy, until people stop doing this then I guess these films will keep appearing. This film is so low on ideas it's just amazing how it ever got made, the acting is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it beggars belief. This waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you're on a quest to compile a list of the worst movies of all time. My best/worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they don't back off, you can see that she isn't even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip.

{"value":"I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror.<br /><br />To my disappointment, this turned into more of a comedy than a horror. The acting, dialog, and flow of the movie was all very poorly done. Much of it didn't make sense. For example, there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard. I kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - emphasis on try.<br /><br />The blood and gore are also poorly done. I've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this. A guy with his head cut clean off... looked clean - missing signs bone, flesh, blood, and even the head. A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax.<br /><br />Revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist, but contradicted other parts in the story. What was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that? If there was going to be a twist, you should at least build up to it adding mystery and

{"value":"When I first picked this film up I was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed. Although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent. The visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece. However this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery, both visual and in the script, that you were practically hammered over the head with. Most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot. It seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece. The voice overs from Felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing (and even that wasn't properly addressed). I'm afraid the whole piece came across as, at best, a 'reasonable first attempt', by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all.","finished_norm":["when","i","pick","thi","film","up","i","be","intrigu","at","the","basic","idea","and","eager","to","see","what","would","happen","i","be","a","fan","of","anim","and","love","it","when","it","successfulli","merg","with","live","action","footag","howev","the","anim","in","thi","film","be","about","all","i","enjoi","although","it","must","be","sai","that","the","actor","perform","be","excel","the","visual","look","includ","the","anim","give","a","wonderfulli","unnerv","air","to","the","piec","howev","thi","be","qualiti","of","uneas","be","lose","amongst","the","overblown","imageri","both","visual","and","in","the","script","that","you","be","practic","hammer","over","the","head","with","much","annoi","about","thi","be","the","rel","lack","of","import","to","the","plot","it","seem","that","the","plot","be","shoe","horn","in","at","irregular","interv","give","a","stutter","effect","that","detract","massiv","from","the","flow","of","the","piec","the","voic","over","from","felisberto","especi","the","on","at","the","end","veri","much","feel","like","a","desper","attempt","to","fill","in","gape","hole","in","the","plot","which","have","be","ignor","in","favour","of","side","issu","such","a","the","whole","ant","thing","and","even","that","be","not","properli","address","i","be","afraid","the","whole","piec","come","across","a","at","well","a","reason","attempt","by","a","teenag","who","have","spend","far","too","much","time","read","dh","lawrenc","not","what","you","expect","from","season","film","maker","at","all"],"filtered":["pick","thi","film","intrigu","basic","idea","eager","see","happen","fan","anim","love","successfulli","merg","live","action","footag","howev","anim","thi","film","enjoi","although","must","sai","actor","perform","excel","visual","look","includ","anim","give","wonderfulli","unnerv","air","piec","howev","thi","qualiti","uneas","lose","amongst","overblown","imageri","visual","script","practic","hammer","head","much","annoi","thi","rel","lack","import","plot","seem","plot","shoe","horn","irregular","interv","give","stutter","effect","detract","massiv","flow","piec","voic","felisberto","especi","end","veri","much","feel","like","desper","attempt","fill","gape","hole","plot","ignor","favour","side","issu","whole","ant","thing","even","properli","address","afraid","whole","piec","come","across","well","reason","attempt","teenag","spend","far","much","time","read","dh","lawrenc","expect","season","film","maker"],"filtered2":["pick","intrigu","basic","idea","eager","see","happen","fan","anim","love","successfulli","merg","live","action","footag","howev","anim","enjoi","although","must","actor","perform","excel","visual","look","includ","anim","give","wonderfulli","unnerv","air","piec","howev","qualiti","uneas","lose","amongst","overblown","imageri","visual","script","practic","hammer","head","annoi","rel","lack","import","plot","seem","plot","shoe","horn","irregular","interv","give","stutter","effect","detract","massiv","flow","piec","voic","felisberto","especi","end","veri","feel","like","desper","attempt","fill","gape","hole","plot","ignor","favour","side","issu","whole","ant","thing","even","properli","address","afraid","whole","piec","come","across","well","reason","attempt","teenag","spend","far","time","read","dh","lawrenc","expect","season","maker"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,8,15,16,20,24,29,30,32,34,35,41,43,54,77,94,95,101,105,106,111,113,116,123,129,130,140,141,145,177,183,200,208,218,221,237,267,271,277,283,286,301,319,425,428,446,503,553,580,600,635,658,679,693,762,763,788,806,810,817,917,1017,1165,1244,1702,1899,2079,2195,2220,2290,2407,2519,2578,2647,2951,2968,3558,4112,4230,4358,4661,6335,6974,7265,8316],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,8,15,16,20,24,29,30,32,34,35,41,43,54,77,94,95,101,105,106,111,113,116,123,129,130,140,141,145,177,183,200,208,218,221,237,267,271,277,283,286,301,319,425,428,446,503,553,580,600,635,658,679,693,762,763,788,806,810,817,917,1017,1165,1244,1702,1899,2079,2195,2220,2290,2407,2519,2578,2647,2951,2968,3558,4112,4230,4358,4661,6335,6974,7265,8316],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,4.1133933855221025,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.9463902258768238,2.08112281984698,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.159084361316692,4.236691060675177,4.3043565130405606,2.2466628996789315,2.2619070973220485,2.41

{"value":"Basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child. At the adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and they decide to adopt him. If you think that this is stupid, hold it, because it's getting worse.<br /><br />Stuart arrives to his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Spare me!) The rest is pretty much the usual cliché, about family problems, jealousy from the elder \"brother\", and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a \"happy family\". Boring and worn out as this is, it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way.<br /><br />I don't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché, or he was just trying to fill in minutes, but he only upgraded the cliché from boring to abhorrent.<br /><br />Then why I gave a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the \"brother\". And because of some funny gigs, where Stuart makes good use of his small size.<br /><br />On the overall I believe that the film would work reasonably well if: a.

I found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around. The wind wasn't fierce enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty...etc. and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding. I stumbled over things like why did she light a fire, blow out the match, then throw the match into the fire?! Dumb stuff like that. It was clunky at best. Oh well.

{"value":"If you really, truly want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /><br />1) Look through the TV listings. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When 'Men in White' comes on, sit and watch.<br /><br />And that's it. After sitting through two hours of bad puns, dreadful (and not that funny) movie references, and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history, you will have wasted two hours of your life, and wonder exactly why.<br /><br />Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good.
