{"value":"Contains spoilers The movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences: Three guys go hunting in the forest. Two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation. The last guy can stand in the clear, shout and do anything without getting shot. He gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle. The villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains.<br /><br />That is the whole story, not summarized but in detail. Everything is drawn out with a guy standing ringing a door bell. We wait with him. Long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping. We can take a nap with them. The one drawn out shot of following a female jogger could have been redeeming, if we could see her butt or boobs bouncing.<br /><br />There dialog is less then Terminator and it is not because there is so much action. The characters just don't talk. And, then they don't even have something corny to say like 'I'll be back.' If my buddy shot this on the weekend, I'd cheer for him, because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls. To pay money to rent this as a DVD is totally inappropriate.<br /><br />The one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling, how they local police didn't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun. If they'd have filmed that, I'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie.","finished_norm":["contain","spoiler","the","movi","plot","can","be","summar","in","a","few","sentenc","three","gui","go","hunt","in","the","forest","two","of","them","along","other","peopl","get","shoot","in","the","head","without","explan","the","last","gui","can","stand","in","the","clear","shout","and","do","anyth","without","get","shoot","he","get","to","walk","through","a","old","factori","and","have","the","evil","peopl","walk","right","into","hi","scope","without","a","struggl","the","villain","be","conveni","dress","in","black","and","look","like","villainsbr","br","that","be","the","whole","stori","not","summar","but","in","detail","everyth","be","draw","out","with","a","gui","stand","ring","a","door","bell","we","wait","with","him","long","shoot","of","gui","be","bore","in","the","wood","and","sleep","we","can","take","a","nap","with","them","the","on","draw","out","shoot","of","follow","a","femal","jogger","can","have","be","redeem","if","we","can","see","her","butt","or","boob","bouncingbr","br","there","dialog","be","littl","then","termin","and","it","be","not","becaus","there","be","so","much","action","the","charact","just","do","not","talk","and","then","thei","do","not","even","have","someth","corni","to","sai","like","i","will","be","back","if","my","buddi","shoot","thi","on","the","weekend","i","have","cheer","for","him","becaus","it","be","quit","a","feat","to","figur","out","the","camera","control","to","pai","monei","to","rend","thi","a","a","dvd","be","total","inappropriatebr","br","the","on","thing","that","be","a","littl","funni","be","the","extra","with","the","director","tell","how","thei","local","polic","do","not","realiz","that","thei","be","shoot","and","treat","them","like","a","random","gui","walk","around","with","a","gun","if","thei","have","have","film","that","i","have","be","sure","it","would","be","much","fun","to","watch","then","the","movi"],"filtered":["contain","spoiler","movi","plot","summar","sentenc","three","gui","go","hunt","forest","two","along","peopl","get","shoot","head","without","explan","last","gui","stand","clear","shout","anyth","without","get","shoot","get","walk","old","factori","evil","peopl","walk","right","hi","scope","without","struggl","villain","conveni","dress","black","look","like","villainsbr","br","whole","stori","summar","detail","everyth","draw","gui","stand","ring","door","bell","wait","long","shoot","gui","bore","wood","sleep","take","nap","draw","shoot","follow","femal","jogger","redeem","see","butt","boob","bouncingbr","br","dialog","littl","termin","becaus","much","action","charact","talk","thei","even","someth","corni","sai","like","back","buddi","shoot","thi","weekend","cheer","becaus","quit","feat","figur","camera","control","pai","monei","rend","thi","dvd","total","inappropriatebr","br","thing","littl","funni","extra","director","tell","thei","local","polic","realiz","thei","shoot","treat","like","random","gui","walk","around","gun","thei","film","sure","much","fun","watch","movi"],"filtered2":["contain","spoiler","plot","summar","sentenc","three","gui","go","hunt","forest","two","along","peopl","get","shoot","head","without","explan","last","gui","stand","clear","shout","anyth","without","get","shoot","get","walk","old","factori","evil","peopl","walk","right","scope","without","struggl","villain","conveni","dress","black","look","like","villainsbr","whole","stori","summar","detail","everyth","draw","gui","stand","ring","door","bell","wait","long","shoot","gui","bore","wood","sleep","take","nap","draw","shoot","follow","femal","jogger","redeem","see","butt","boob","bouncingbr","dialog","littl","termin","becaus","action","charact","talk","even","someth","corni","like","back","buddi","shoot","weekend","cheer","becaus","quit","feat","figur","camera","control","pai","monei","rend","dvd","total","inappropriatebr","thing","littl","funni","extra","director","tell","local","polic","realiz","shoot","treat","like","random","gui","walk","around","gun","sure","fun","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,10,14,16,17,22,23,29,31,32,47,53,55,58,62,63,67,90,98,99,104,108,111,117,119,120,121,125,126,129,144,184,186,193,208,224,229,231,247,259,260,294,321,322,324,331,377,405,415,422,432,471,475,490,501,520,531,576,590,634,655,711,732,741,823,838,842,849,859,873,1000,1001,1084,1247,1302,1486,1565,1637,1927,1947,1969,2181,2185,2434,2636,2940,3543,3918,4049,5008,6307],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,10,14,16,17,22,23,29,31,32,47,53,55,58,62,63,67,90,98,99,104,108,111,117,119,120,121,125,126,129,144,18

{"value":"Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU(1998) returned with this film<br /><br />The film has Govinda in 8-9 roles, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later-on he also has disguises <br /><br />He in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife, whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with Rani<br /><br />He disguises as a Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily and in short time he does that?<br /><br />Then he disguises as a french singer and enters a TV to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian(yes inside the TV itself) <br /><br />The rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note There are some funny scenes like Govinda being bashed by an African and also many other portions <br /><br />Direction by Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay<br /><br />Amongst actors Govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors He as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6-7 roles don't actually fit in the film Rani looks fat, teams

{"value":"Why every horror director wants to imitate \"The Exorcist\" is a complete riddle to me, as William Friedkin's \"classic\" is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. And yet here's another clean rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... \"Exorcism\" is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story.

{"value":"\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless \"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\" At least that movie was just inept; the Lampoon film, on the other hand, is both inept and mean. Once upon a time, movies used to respect their audiences' intelligence. This one, however, holds a fetid, rotting carcass up to our faces -- and then tries to rub our noses in it.<br /><br />Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice flesh it is. But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There's none of that here.<br /><br />Perversely, the film makers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an eager-beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job. He is paired with a weary, cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. For just a moment, we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly. Surely, we think, the youngster's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better.<br /><br />Forlorn hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day -- and the youngster's spark is doused forever. \"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\" and heads right for the toilet, asking us to follow it down the drain.

{"value":"Eytan Fox, whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of Israeli politics, has made several quite interesting films in the past such as \"Walk on Water\" and the simply wonderful film, \"Yossi & Jagger\". In \"The Bubble\", however, he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme.<br /><br />Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the people at the screening I attended quietly got up and left. I also quietly left, fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation as racist bullying, and racist bullying (and terrorism) as outbursts of justified anger; which implies that Arabs are so wronged by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one-sided Israeli aggression against them, and that they, therefore, should not be held responsible for their actions.<br /><br />This film wasn't worth the money I paid for the ticket (indeed, I considered demanding my money back), and was basically an Israeli apeing of the Palestinian film \"Paradise Now\". If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then by all means watch this film, as it really justifies just such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, such a talented Israeli director, is a crying shame. Indeed, just how Israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah State when Israelis themselves make such anti-Israel propaganda, beggars belief.<br /><br />What a shameful, horrid little

{"value":"Revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. Moreso, \"the futility of revenge\" is one of my favorite themes in film. Having seen Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* The end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. However, the film doesn't even follow through with this. Instead, the drawn out scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of either regret or \"This didn't fix anything\" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background.<br /><br />My problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? Do we feel Dawson's moment of regretful clarity? Aside from this failing, the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance.

{"value":"This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps purposely, fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts, like: **The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. **The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period, but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah, and go on to die for those beliefs, if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /><br />What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view.

{"value":"I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.<br /><br />It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot.<br /><br />The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. <br /><br />It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress.

{"value":"One of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out. If I hadn't been with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would have left. It's a shame, too, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays I've ever seen. It starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere (I would say it goes nowhere fast, but it really goes nowhere slow...painfully slow). From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters, but that's all we get - hints. There is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie. Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained...I love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff. But these characters add up to nothing. For the entire duration of the film you don't care what happens to a single one of them. As a matter of fact, you almost start hoping they die, because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you'd think it in itself would be compelling, but it's not. Instead of quirky, noir-esquire characters acting in hard-boiled fashion, you simply recognize it immediately for what it is: a bunch of talented but miscast actors, brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. All this for two plodding, painfully slow hours.

{"value":"Seriously. I just wrapped up my first viewing of Demonicus and words have failed me.<br /><br />I remember a time when I would see Charles Band's name on a film and my heart would race. He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex, but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure.<br /><br />And now... this.<br /><br />A painfully-obvious Californian walking trail doubles for \"the Alps\" and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be \"an ancient cave\". I mean, they didn't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator, as the cover implies, we're treated to a dude wearing the latest in Wal-Mart Halloween apparel. There's a pretty cool looking corpse, who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers, but he doesn't even learn to stand until the final five minutes. Why couldn't he be the villain? Instead, we've got frat boy Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch.<br /><br />Charles Band... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe. I love movies that are so bad, they're good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad, its just bad. This one, however, is just unwatchable.

{"value":"If you ever hear these three words uttered to you...\"Joe Don Baker\", be afraid...<br /><br />Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas town named Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). He's an ugly, slimy, rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. Plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west. I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. A woman cop is assigned to show him around Malta (who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck. She must be insane!<br /><br />The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dancing is shown throughout the film and I began to bond with the sleazy women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to dumb his way out of something. The ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and I was happy it was finally over. You'll never forget that last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie.<br /><br />It's so hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond movies...very weird! Anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on MST3K sometime. Also, I've heard his other bad movie (among many), \"Mitchell\" MST3K version is being released on DVD by Rhino.

{"value":"the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater. i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004, and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival. it was an interesting premise, and seemed like it could go somewhere, but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything. first of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they weren't obvious rhymes, they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical, right? not in this case. luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they did sing it made me cringe. especially when they attempted to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good, but a lot of the dialog was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical. i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.","finished_norm":["the","singl","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","in","a","theater","i","see","thi","film","at","the","austin","film","festiv","in","and","it","blow","my","mind","that","thi","film","be","accept","to","a","festiv","it","be","a","interest","premis","and","seem","like","it","can","go","somewher","but","just","fall","apart","everi","time","it","try","to","do","anyth","of","all","if","you","re","go","to","do","a","music","find","someon","with","music","talent","the","music","consist","of","cheesi","piano","plai","that","sound","like","thei","be","plai","it","on","a","stereo","in","the","room","thei","be","film","the","lyric","be","terribli","write","and","when","thei","be","not","obviou","rhym","thei","be","groaninduc","rhym","that","show","how","far","thei","be","stretch","to","try","to","make","thi","movi","work","and","you","have","think","you","have","find","peopl","who","can","sing","when","make","a","music","right","not","in","thi","case","luckili","thei","be","half","talkinghalf","sing","in","rhym","much","of","the","time","but","when","thei","do","sing","it","make","me","cring","especi","when","thei","attempt","to","sing","in","harmoni","and","that","just","address","the","music","some","of","the","act","be","pretti","good","but","a","lot","of","the","dialog","be","terribl","a","good","a","much","of","the","scene","thei","obvious","do","not","have","enough","coverag","on","the","scene","or","thei","just","have","a","bad","editor","becaus","thei","consist","jump","the","line","and","us","terribl","choic","while","cut","the","film","at","littl","the","director","be","will","to","admit","that","no","on","want","the","script","until","thei","add","the","hook","of","make","it","a","music","i","hope","the","investor","make","sure","someon","can","write","music","befor","make","the","same","mistak","again"],"filtered":["singl","wrong","film","ever","see","theater","see","thi","film","austin","film","festiv","blow","mind","thi","film","accept","festiv","interest","premis","seem","like","go","somewher","fall","apart","everi","time","try","anyth","re","go","music","find","someon","music","talent","music","consist","cheesi","piano","plai","sound","like","thei","plai","stereo","room","thei","film","lyric","terribli","write","thei","obviou","rhym","thei","groaninduc","rhym","show","far","thei","stretch","try","make","thi","movi","work","think","find","peopl","sing","make","music","right","thi","case","luckili","thei","half","talkinghalf","sing","rhym","much","time","thei","sing","make","cring","especi","thei","attempt","sing","harmoni","address","music","act","pretti","good","lot","dialog","terribl","good","much","scene","thei","obvious","enough","coverag","scene","thei","bad","editor","becaus","thei","consist","jump","line","us","terribl","choic","cut","film","littl","director","admit","want","script","thei","add","hook","make","music","hope","investor","make","sure","someon","write","music","befor","make","mistak"],"filtered2":["singl","wrong","ever","see","theater","see","austin","festiv","blow","mind","accept","festiv","interest","premis","seem","like","go","somewher","fall","apart","everi","time","try","anyth","re","go","music","find","someon","music","talent","music","consist","cheesi","piano","plai","sound","like","plai","stereo","room","lyric","terribli","write","obviou","rhym","groaninduc","rhym","show","far","stretch","try","make","work","think","find","peopl","sing","make","music","right","case","luckili","half","talkinghalf","sing","rhym","time","sing","make","cring","especi","attempt","sing","harmoni","address","music","act","pretti","good","lot","dialog","terribl","good","scene","obvious","enough","coverag","scene","bad","editor","becaus","consist","jump","line","us","terribl","choic","cut","littl","director","admit","want","script","add","hook","make","music","hope","investor","make","sure","someon","write","music","befor","make","mistak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,9,12,14,19,21,22,23,25,28,35,36,37,38,40,44,48,56,58,60,65,68,72,77,78,79,85,93,101,104,107,118,119,121,139,166,170,177,178,181,206,238,267,276,288,299,303,341,383,424,432,443,484,513,543,572,593,659,674,691,742,754,804,808,828,1153,1217,1220,1827,1972,2229,2373,2938,2971,3388,3480,4551,6900,7406,7611,8100],"values":[6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,9,12,14,19,21,22,23,25,28,35,36,37,38,40,44,48,56,58,60,65,68,72,77,78,79,85,93,101,104,107,118,119,121,139,166,170,177,178,181,206,238,267,276,288,299,303,341,383,424,432,443,484,513,543,572,593,659,674,691,742,754,804,808,828,1153,1217,1220,1827,1972,2229,2373,2938,2971,

{"value":"This movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera, sound, film, sets, music, costumes ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I don't know if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script, but would say it was both. Considering the casting of him in this role, I found it difficult to root for him even to the very end. I wished he'd have died in battle or one of the sword/knife scuffles.<br /><br />Then, the tinder for the plot to kill the king was because the king didn't have dinner and sex with his Queen? Pretty lame. And to go to the extreme to kill her own son? And to then push up her lover as succeeding King? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the manner in which this was all presented was farcical.<br /><br />I don't recognize Gary Stretch from anything else, but he was dreadful. I read another user's comments about audio being dubbed, but don't think his was dubbed ... after all, he speaks English, right? It really was awful. The lines were read right off the coroner's table ... flat-line. It could be he just doesn't have the voice to carry tone fluctuations.<br /><br />Aside from this, I did watch it to the end, so the movie had at least an \"interest.\" It could have been more if the script/lines and casting had been given more work. The scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else. The cast and story were all secondary.

{"value":"In the first 20 minutes, every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director. There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically-tortured NTSB board member played by [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of a crash victim; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer.<br /><br />Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics. Most of this TV plane wasn't even burned.<br /><br />It reminded me of the scene in \"Air Force One\" where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it's made of inch-thick steel.<br /><br />The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who is more accepting than I, was commenting on technical flaws. What had me stunned was how this POS could ever get made. Are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them? Somebody read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million bucks making this real. I wish I was the guy's next appointment.

{"value":"As the 2000's came to a close, king Kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end.<br /><br />While Miss Winfrey was tearing up, i was laughing and screaming like a wild Indian from the old west.<br /><br />So what does Oprah do? she takes famous people, and puts them on her show. what kind of famous people? people who've suffered (just like her, except these people have lost more than their virginity) they've suffered melted faces (true story), missing limbs (True story, see end of paragraph), and spousal abuse (too many to count). and somehow they come on the show and tell their story, as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, i've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one, which was October 31st, 2003. don't tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the biggest thing probably on Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a child molester. sadly, Mr. Jackson has since passed away. but that one particular show told about Michael's personal life, something not many people knew about at the time.<br /><br />Oprah's Real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms. They seem to think she's like a personal Jesus sometimes. but all i see in Oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big, and she's just showing off how rich she is.<br /><br />I'm glad her shows going to end soon. we need better television

{"value":"Another great movie by Costa-Gavras. It's a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics. The facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the US was deeply involved in coups and support of Latin American dictatorships.<br /><br />Despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. For example he presents the US actions as brutal and inhumane, while representing Tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive.<br /><br />As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved. Europe is filled with poor East European prostitutes. I never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most East European countries. The US was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of Soviet Communism was defeated. It is unfortunate the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. Had Matamoros come to power in Uruguay, we would've had another Ukraine in Latin America.<br /><br />All in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass

{"value":"::POTENTIAL SPOILERS::<br /><br />Man, this movie was awful. A Catholic/superstitious/suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies.<br /><br />The doubting priest. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy. Conspiracy involving the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil.<br /><br />Pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick - the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one's sins while on the brink of death; And Excommunication, the act of cutting a person off from the Church. Basically, an Excommunicated person can't receive Absolution. Thus comes in the Sin Eater, and I'll leave it at that. Throw in all the dopy things I already listed and you have \"The Order\".<br /><br />I found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the Virgin Mary rather insulting to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (I paraphrase) \"I am the redeemer and damner of sins, I live on without love blah blah blah\" /cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla \"The Matrix\".<br /><br />I gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process.

{"value":"Spoilers.<br /><br />First off, nothing really happened in this movie, other than a woman bleeding inexplicably. Second, it wasn't scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me elaborate. The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead  I'm not sure which, so let's just go with Beavis. The movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched this at home). Then Beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary/shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume again. This occurs many times until, mercifully, the movie ends. I can picture Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, this one is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought  if you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a gratuitous beheading, a 19-year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range, a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience, some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh, or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil (a la TV's Lost in Space).

{"value":"After a long period in the space, looking for the remains of planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who got married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plots an evil plan, using crystals he stole from the Fortress of Solitude, to create a new land and submerge the USA.<br /><br />After so many delightful movies of Superman with the unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like \"Lois and Clark\" (and Teri Hatcher) or \"Smallville\", a great expectation was created for the return of Superman in this Bryan Singer's version. Unfortunately, the awful story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overrated in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully ridiculous. The twenty-two years old actress Kate Bosworth is wrongly miscast, playing the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five years old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in \"Smallville\". The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly caricature. Last but not the least and in spite of being a terrific Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, therefore older and older than the rest of the lead cast.

{"value":"Watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels.<br /><br />I guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute Christmas movie, but were extremely disappointed.<br /><br />the actor playing the soldier, seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever, his face looks the same, whether he's chopping down Christmas tree's, seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend, or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves, he's an awful actor, and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him.<br /><br />Then there's the cute blond girl, blessed with the ability to count dot's and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots.<br /><br />So it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend, it's as predictable as it get's, and really a waste of time, you gain nothing by watching this, other than some weird laughs, because it's all so corny.<br /><br />I love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine, and they all laugh, that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about, furthermore, if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like, i'd tell him a thing or to, but not our army veteran, no sir, he let's everyone boss him around.<br /><br />The movie is what First Blood would have been, if John Rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the

{"value":"My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the BBC's \"Planet Earth\" , which I am sure most of you have , then you are not gonna like this movie too much. And I own all the discs of \"Planet Earth\" I had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out.<br /><br />Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at home of \"Planet Earth\".<br /><br />The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from \"Planet Earth\".<br /><br />We were very very disappointed , as I think 90% of the footage is from \"Planet Earth\" . I am saying 90% , because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them.<br /><br />So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of \"Planet Earth\" , with a narration aimed at kids. Yes, the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says \"The polar cubs are not like human kids.

{"value":"15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially that of the youth. When I was a 3-year-old kid living in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there). When the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe to me when I watched it with my dad and 2 uncles. My grandparents even sent me a \"Balikbayan\" box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the Rangers). I even played the video games, and loved only one of them (\"MMPR: Fighting Edition\"), which was REALLY sad. Anyway, it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like \"Gundam\") Now that I'm 18, I'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now. To prove this, I took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set DVD collection with \"MMPR: The Movie\" and \"Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie\" and watched both of them. I was like, \"Ugh. How awful. Just another junk in the attic for me.\" For all of you people of my generation, this is NOT a show that you'd want to watch over and over again. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally is not a bad thing now, is it? Instead of \"Power Rangers\", I'd recommend something like \"Mobile Fighter G Gundam\" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), \"Ninja Senshi Tobikage\" (aka Ninja Robots), or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were

{"value":"The plot of 'House of Games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters, but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge. That's about the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets. It has to be the director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and pretty steady TV and film career, so she can't perform this badly all the time. She's supposed to go from uptight, cool, controlled professional to calculating, wicked fast lady having fun, as shown by the change from beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear) to floppy floral sundress. But everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped, precise way; I imagine Mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed. The effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. At times 'House of Games' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot. The clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help either. The ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic, two-dimensional performances.

{"value":"First off there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message. So my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian, though an amillenialist, I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he said as much. So even though I have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why I rate this movie so low.<br /><br />No, what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, awful script, mediocre acting, and pitiful FX. This movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s. No, this movie ranks down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel.<br /><br />The apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this, but they failed. The Left Behind Series, The Apocalypse series, and the Omega Code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated look problem, but their scripts are still poor, and their acting is wooden.<br /><br />There are great Christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I'm surprised the MST3K crew never lampooned this one.","finished_norm":["off","there","be","noth","wrong","with","studi","daniel","revel","matthew","isaiah","and","other","prophet","scriptur","there","be","conjur","noth","wrong","with","make","a","film","such","a","thi","to","attempt","to","present","the","gospel","messag","so","my","qualm","with","thi","movi","be","not","in","either","it","sincer","or","aspir","a","a","christian","though","a","amillenialist","i","believ","there","will","be","a","great","tribul","and","i","believ","christ","will","return","a","he","sai","a","much","so","even","though","i","have","disagr","with","thi","film","about","the","raptur","that","be","not","why","i","rate","thi","movi","so","lowbr","br","no","what","make","me","rate","thi","movi","so","low","be","not","it","sincer","or","it","messag","but","rather","it","lack","of","product","valu","aw","script","mediocr","act","and","piti","fx","thi","movi","rank","down","there","with","some","of","the","cheesi","scifi","fodder","of","the","no","thi","movi","rank","down","there","with","plan","from","outerspac","thi","movi","fail","to","ag","good","and","be","probabl","date","by","the","time","thei","make","a","sequelbr","br","the","apocalyps","genr","film","produc","can","have","learn","how","not","to","make","a","end","time","film","from","thi","but","thei","fail","the","leav","behind","seri","the","apocalyps","seri","and","the","omega","code","seri","all","fail","to","learn","from","thi","becaus","thei","address","the","fx","problem","and","the","date","look","problem","but","their","script","be","still","poor","and","their","act","be","woodenbr","br","there","be","great","christian","film","with","extrem","low","budget","but","thi","film","be","not","on","of","them","i","be","surpris","the","mstk","crow","never","lampoon","thi","on"],"filtered":["noth","wrong","studi","daniel","revel","matthew","isaiah","prophet","scriptur","conjur","noth","wrong","make","film","thi","attempt","present","gospel","messag","qualm","thi","movi","either","sincer","aspir","christian","though","amillenialist","believ","great","tribul","believ","christ","return","sai","much","even","though","disagr","thi","film","raptur","rate","thi","movi","lowbr","br","make","rate","thi","movi","low","sincer","messag","rather","lack","product","valu","aw","script","mediocr","act","piti","fx","thi","movi","rank","cheesi","scifi","fodder","thi","movi","rank","plan","outerspac","thi","movi","fail","ag","good","probabl","date","time","thei","make","sequelbr","br","apocalyps","genr","film","produc","learn","make","end","time","film","thi","thei","fail","leav","behind","seri","apocalyps","seri","omega","code","seri","fail","learn","thi","becaus","thei","address","fx","problem","date","look","problem","script","still","poor","act","woodenbr","br","great","christian","film","extrem","low","budget","thi","film","surpris","mstk","crow","never","lampoon","thi"],"filtered2":["noth","wrong","studi","daniel","revel","matthew","isaiah","prophet","scriptur","conjur","noth","wrong","make","attempt","present","gospel","messag","qualm","either","sincer","aspir","christian","though","amillenialist","believ","great","tribul","believ","christ","return","even","though","disagr","raptur","rate","lowbr","make","rate","low","sincer","messag","rather","lack","product","valu","aw","script","mediocr","act","piti","fx","rank","cheesi","scifi","fodder","rank","plan","outerspac","fail","ag","good","probabl","date","time","make","sequelbr","apocalyps","genr","produc","learn","make","end","time","fail","leav","behind","apocalyps","omega","code","fail","learn","becaus","address","fx","problem","date","look","problem","script","still","poor","act","woodenbr","great","christian","extrem","low","budget","surpris","mstk","crow","never","lampoon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,16,21,22,24,25,39,42,49,51,64,74,77,86,91,138,146,148,160,167,177,183,190,202,207,215,217,256,261,326,329,393,411,430,442,451,467,488,543,569,581,647,684,769,781,787,1171,1266,1547,1654,1823,1877,1931,2119,2149,2216,2229,2615,2749,2881,4446,4754,5289,5473,5554,5814,5967,6123,7564],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,16,21,22,24,25,39,42,49,51,64,74,77,86,91,138,146,148,160,167,177,183,190,202,207,215,217,256,261,326,329,393,411,430,442,451,467,488,543,569,581,647,684,769,781,787,1171,1266,1547,1654,1823,1877,1931,2119,2149,2216,2229,2615,2749,2881,4446,4754,5289,5473,5554,5814,5967,6123,7564],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.8837873718108231,1.1966138720291084,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,3.3840606616174704,3.4279798616619646,1.883

{"value":"By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br /> It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br /> This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this might be the very worst film that Heston ever made.

{"value":"Want to watch a scary horror film? Then steer clear of this one. There's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable.<br /><br />However, there is enough scotch. Single-malt, if you can manage it.<br /><br />If the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober, allow me to assist. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.<br /><br />I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the film, and the book was dreadful. At least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's (rhymes with 'gas').<br /><br />Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and Jonathan Demme found that he's really better suited to direct.<br /><br />Yes, there is an MST3K episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you.<br /><br />Please, just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts.

{"value":"This movie was God-awful, from conception to execution. The US needs to set up a \"Star Wars\" site in this remote country? This is their premise? The way to gain access, the US concludes, is to win an obstacle course like cross-country race, where the winner can ask anything of the leader. And who better to win this race known as the \"Game\" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And don't forget that his father was an operative. Lucky for our hero, there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots, like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square (for no reason) amidst crazy town. Perfect.<br /><br />But above and beyond the horrible, HORIBBLE premise, is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes, the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path, and the worst climax ever. After winning the race, our hero puts forth the wishes of the US government. And lo and behold, all the effort was worth it, because the US gets its \"Star Wars\" site! Huzzah! THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING?! Wow.<br /><br />But still, being such a bad movie, it can be great fun to watch. The cover alone, depicting ninjas with machine guns, was enough to get me to rent this film.<br /><br />But if I were ever to meet Kurt Thomas (the gymnast-star) in real life, I would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","godaw","from","concept","to","execut","the","u","ne","to","set","up","a","star","war","site","in","thi","remot","countri","thi","be","their","premis","the","wai","to","gain","access","the","u","conclud","be","to","win","a","obstacl","cours","like","crosscountri","race","where","the","winner","can","ask","anyth","of","the","leader","and","who","well","to","win","thi","race","know","a","the","game","than","a","gymnast","of","cours","a","gymnast","would","be","the","perfect","choic","for","thi","mission","and","do","not","forget","that","hi","father","be","a","oper","lucki","for","our","hero","there","happen","to","be","gymnast","equip","in","fortun","spot","like","the","stone","pommel","hors","in","the","middl","of","a","squar","for","no","reason","amidst","crazi","town","perfectbr","br","but","abov","and","beyond","the","horribl","horibbl","premis","be","the","awkward","fumbl","of","the","romant","scene","the","obvious","highli","depress","ninja","whose","onli","job","seem","to","be","hold","a","flag","to","point","out","the","race","path","and","the","wrong","climax","ever","after","win","the","race","our","hero","put","forth","the","wish","of","the","u","govern","and","lo","and","behold","all","the","effort","be","worth","it","becaus","the","u","get","it","star","war","site","huzzah","thi","be","your","triumphant","end","wowbr","br","but","still","be","such","a","bad","movi","it","can","be","great","fun","to","watch","the","cover","alon","depict","ninja","with","machin","gun","be","enough","to","get","me","to","rend","thi","filmbr","br","but","if","i","be","ever","to","meet","kurt","thoma","the","gymnaststar","in","real","life","i","would","probabl","kick","him","in","the","face","after","a","doubl","somersault","with","twist","in","the","layout","posit"],"filtered":["thi","movi","godaw","concept","execut","u","ne","set","star","war","site","thi","remot","countri","thi","premis","wai","gain","access","u","conclud","win","obstacl","cours","like","crosscountri","race","winner","ask","anyth","leader","well","win","thi","race","know","game","gymnast","cours","gymnast","perfect","choic","thi","mission","forget","hi","father","oper","lucki","hero","happen","gymnast","equip","fortun","spot","like","stone","pommel","hors","middl","squar","reason","amidst","crazi","town","perfectbr","br","abov","beyond","horribl","horibbl","premis","awkward","fumbl","romant","scene","obvious","highli","depress","ninja","whose","onli","job","seem","hold","flag","point","race","path","wrong","climax","ever","win","race","hero","put","forth","wish","u","govern","lo","behold","effort","worth","becaus","u","get","star","war","site","huzzah","thi","triumphant","end","wowbr","br","still","bad","movi","great","fun","watch","cover","alon","depict","ninja","machin","gun","enough","get","rend","thi","filmbr","br","ever","meet","kurt","thoma","gymnaststar","real","life","probabl","kick","face","doubl","somersault","twist","layout","posit"],"filtered2":["godaw","concept","execut","u","ne","set","star","war","site","remot","countri","premis","wai","gain","access","u","conclud","win","obstacl","cours","like","crosscountri","race","winner","ask","anyth","leader","well","win","race","know","game","gymnast","cours","gymnast","perfect","choic","mission","forget","father","oper","lucki","hero","happen","gymnast","equip","fortun","spot","like","stone","pommel","hors","middl","squar","reason","amidst","crazi","town","perfectbr","abov","beyond","horribl","horibbl","premis","awkward","fumbl","romant","scene","obvious","highli","depress","ninja","whose","onli","job","seem","hold","flag","point","race","path","wrong","climax","ever","win","race","hero","put","forth","wish","u","govern","lo","behold","effort","worth","becaus","u","get","star","war","site","huzzah","triumphant","end","wowbr","still","bad","great","fun","watch","cover","alon","depict","ninja","machin","gun","enough","get","rend","filmbr","ever","meet","kurt","thoma","gymnaststar","real","life","probabl","kick","face","doubl","somersault","twist","layout","posit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,9,11,19,20,22,24,25,26,33,35,44,51,64,66,75,80,93,94,95,100,104,109,110,112,148,159,199,219,230,251,259,289,306,314,341,342,350,373,374,375,399,401,414,435,450,457,484,489,491,501,502,509,531,554,566,598,608,662,677,704,712,726,808,864,869,883,896,1006,1011,1071,1075,1100,1104,1123,1126,1137,1307,1420,1464,1510,1516,1624,1633,1749,1945,2022,2064,2097,2260,2311,2339,2347,2475,2744,3019,3083,3494,4002,4053,4942,5126,5651,6235,6694],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0

{"value":"Black Candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us \"Vampyres\" and much later, \"Rest in Pieces\", among others..I'm only noting the ones I've seen. At any rate, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man keels over. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be devil worship. It's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times. To spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene (I HOPE it's simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. Ugh. At times this echoes \"Rosemary's Baby\", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon. However, the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film. The end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. It's not unwatchable, it's just not very good, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me. 3 out of

{"value":"Although I had some hopes for this film, particularly since I enjoy the acting of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I must say it was one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory (Loser and Dr T and the Women are also on that list).<br /><br />Yes, there were a couple of laugh out loud moments, although the movie could have been so much better. The premise was not bad- scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they're discovered by someone with a proposition for them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikable, that I didn't care about any of them. The blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it wasn't that funny to watch him- he wasn't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the movie was hard to follow-- it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which. Only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown, you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists-- showing their schemes would have made for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout. I could go on about the movie's shortcomings, but you get the idea. Not worth the $4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent!","finished_norm":["although","i","have","some","hope","for","thi","film","particularli","sinc","i","enjoi","the","act","of","jason","segel","freak","geek","undeclar","so","much","i","must","sai","it","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","in","recent","memori","loser","and","dr","t","and","the","woman","be","conjur","on","that","listbr","br","ye","there","be","a","coupl","of","laugh","out","loud","moment","although","the","movi","can","have","be","so","much","well","the","premis","be","not","bad","scam","artist","cheat","their","wai","through","colleg","meet","their","match","when","thei","re","discov","by","someon","with","a","proposit","for","them","the","problem","be","that","the","charact","be","all","so","unlik","that","i","do","not","care","about","ani","of","them","the","blackmail","plai","by","talent","jason","schwartzman","be","such","a","psychopath","that","it","be","not","that","funni","to","watch","him","he","be","not","derang","in","a","particularli","funni","or","charm","wai","he","be","just","a","crazi","loser","who","be","actual","rather","danger","and","not","fun","to","watch","the","edit","of","the","movi","be","hard","to","follow","it","keep","cut","between","fantasi","and","realiti","and","it","be","often","unclear","which","be","which","onli","two","or","three","of","the","gang","scam","be","realli","show","you","just","have","to","take","it","on","faith","that","thei","be","ind","scam","artist","show","their","scheme","would","have","make","for","a","well","movi","the","socal","love","stori","be","absurd","and","unbeliev","in","fact","it","be","silli","and","poorli","write","and","direct","throughout","i","can","go","on","about","the","movi","shortcom","but","you","get","the","idea","not","worth","the","rental","or","the","ga","it","take","to","drive","to","and","from","the","movi","store","to","rend"],"filtered":["although","hope","thi","film","particularli","sinc","enjoi","act","jason","segel","freak","geek","undeclar","much","must","sai","wrong","film","see","recent","memori","loser","dr","woman","conjur","listbr","br","ye","coupl","laugh","loud","moment","although","movi","much","well","premis","bad","scam","artist","cheat","wai","colleg","meet","match","thei","re","discov","someon","proposit","problem","charact","unlik","care","ani","blackmail","plai","talent","jason","schwartzman","psychopath","funni","watch","derang","particularli","funni","charm","wai","crazi","loser","actual","rather","danger","fun","watch","edit","movi","hard","follow","keep","cut","fantasi","realiti","often","unclear","onli","two","three","gang","scam","realli","show","take","faith","thei","ind","scam","artist","show","scheme","make","well","movi","socal","love","stori","absurd","unbeliev","fact","silli","poorli","write","direct","throughout","go","movi","shortcom","get","idea","worth","rental","ga","take","drive","movi","store","rend"],"filtered2":["although","hope","particularli","sinc","enjoi","act","jason","segel","freak","geek","undeclar","must","wrong","see","recent","memori","loser","dr","woman","conjur","listbr","ye","coupl","laugh","loud","moment","although","well","premis","bad","scam","artist","cheat","wai","colleg","meet","match","re","discov","someon","proposit","problem","charact","unlik","care","ani","blackmail","plai","talent","jason","schwartzman","psychopath","funni","watch","derang","particularli","funni","charm","wai","crazi","loser","actual","rather","danger","fun","watch","edit","hard","follow","keep","cut","fantasi","realiti","often","unclear","onli","two","three","gang","scam","realli","show","take","faith","ind","scam","artist","show","scheme","make","well","socal","love","stori","absurd","unbeliev","fact","silli","poorli","write","direct","throughout","go","shortcom","get","idea","worth","rental","ga","take","drive","store","rend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,7,9,10,11,13,17,20,21,25,27,28,31,33,39,40,47,52,54,62,65,68,70,97,102,123,133,134,139,141,160,162,167,171,181,188,200,205,209,219,224,237,253,259,260,276,303,348,350,385,398,400,438,461,484,497,531,562,571,615,656,712,724,739,782,793,797,814,829,919,928,956,978,996,997,1068,1072,1314,1339,1404,1504,1525,1785,1866,2433,3285,3596,3707,3715,4258,4589,4809,6882,7810,8280],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,7,9,10,11,13,17,20,21,25,27,28,31,33,39,40,47,52,54,62,65,68,70,97,102,123,133,134,139,141,160,162,167,171,181,188,200,205,209,219,224,237,253,259,260,276,303,348,350,385,398,400,438,461,484,497,531,562,571,615,656,712,724,739,782,793,797,814,829,919,928,956,978,996,99

{"value":"Only a handful of the segments are engaging here. A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes its point, twist by twist until the final shot overplays things. <br /><br />The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris. The others are so scatter-shot in theme, tone, volition & production that you may as well be watching \"The Years Best Commercials, 2006.\" It's really all over the place. It doesn't develop over it's running time, and nothing reigns the directors in. No construct successfully joins the pieces... tedium sets in. I'm at the one hour, twenty minute point and Elijah Wood is in some dumb, over-commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic. Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thanks J & E for ruining another movie) and then makes way too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you don't need make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director? Has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire film. Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.<br /><br />Making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless. The transitions get lost.

{"value":"I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I don't understand what they were thinking when they made this. It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending. It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos. It ends suddenly, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they got lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. All of a sudden I hear this music playing, then writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34. Wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail. How about showing how he got there. How about showing Dahmer's trial. How about showing some more detail. I can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. I actually found myself saying in disbelief, \"That's it, that's the end?\" I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made. To the filmmakers I'd like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.","finished_norm":["i","realli","feel","cheat","after","see","thi","pictur","it","feel","like","i","sit","watch","thi","movi","minut","for","noth","i","do","not","understand","what","thei","be","think","when","thei","make","thi","it","hardli","get","into","jeffrei","dahmer","murder","and","it","have","no","end","it","feel","almost","like","thei","be","leav","thi","movi","open","for","a","sequel","it","be","like","watch","a","televis","episod","of","the","soprano","it","end","suddenli","and","you","know","there","go","to","be","anoth","episod","next","week","it","conjur","feel","like","i","just","watch","part","to","a","two","part","movi","there","be","mani","possibl","for","what","go","wrong","here","thei","get","lazi","thei","run","out","of","monei","thei","do","not","know","the","rest","of","the","stori","thei","want","to","make","a","dahmer","after","see","thi","movi","thei","all","sound","veri","accur","i","be","watch","jeffrei","dahmer","walk","through","the","wood","all","of","a","sudden","i","hear","thi","music","plai","then","write","come","on","the","screen","and","sai","how","dahmer","serv","year","of","hi","sentenc","and","be","attack","by","a","fellow","inmat","and","kill","at","the","ag","of","wow","he","go","from","a","walk","in","the","wood","to","hi","death","in","jail","how","about","show","how","he","get","there","how","about","show","dahmer","trial","how","about","show","some","much","detail","i","ca","not","even","explain","what","happen","in","thi","movi","becaus","it","jump","all","over","the","place","i","actual","find","myself","sai","in","disbelief","that","it","that","the","end","i","want","to","conclud","thi","review","by","sai","there","be","still","a","good","dahmer","movi","yet","to","be","make","to","the","filmmak","i","have","like","to","sai","if","you","re","go","to","do","it","do","it","right"],"filtered":["realli","feel","cheat","see","thi","pictur","feel","like","sit","watch","thi","movi","minut","noth","understand","thei","think","thei","make","thi","hardli","get","jeffrei","dahmer","murder","end","feel","almost","like","thei","leav","thi","movi","open","sequel","like","watch","televis","episod","soprano","end","suddenli","know","go","anoth","episod","next","week","conjur","feel","like","watch","part","two","part","movi","mani","possibl","go","wrong","thei","get","lazi","thei","run","monei","thei","know","rest","stori","thei","want","make","dahmer","see","thi","movi","thei","sound","veri","accur","watch","jeffrei","dahmer","walk","wood","sudden","hear","thi","music","plai","write","come","screen","sai","dahmer","serv","year","hi","sentenc","attack","fellow","inmat","kill","ag","wow","go","walk","wood","hi","death","jail","show","get","show","dahmer","trial","show","much","detail","ca","even","explain","happen","thi","movi","becaus","jump","place","actual","find","sai","disbelief","end","want","conclud","thi","review","sai","still","good","dahmer","movi","yet","make","filmmak","like","sai","re","go","right"],"filtered2":["realli","feel","cheat","see","pictur","feel","like","sit","watch","minut","noth","understand","think","make","hardli","get","jeffrei","dahmer","murder","end","feel","almost","like","leav","open","sequel","like","watch","televis","soprano","end","suddenli","know","go","anoth","next","week","conjur","feel","like","watch","part","two","part","mani","possibl","go","wrong","get","lazi","run","monei","know","rest","stori","want","make","dahmer","see","sound","veri","accur","watch","jeffrei","dahmer","walk","wood","sudden","hear","music","plai","write","come","screen","dahmer","serv","year","sentenc","attack","fellow","inmat","kill","ag","wow","go","walk","wood","death","jail","show","get","show","dahmer","trial","show","detail","ca","even","explain","happen","becaus","jump","place","actual","find","disbelief","end","want","conclud","review","still","good","dahmer","yet","make","filmmak","like","re","go","right"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13,15,17,22,24,25,26,28,34,37,38,39,40,43,47,49,50,52,57,59,61,64,65,68,73,74,76,81,94,118,121,126,131,137,164,176,178,192,194,212,216,226,242,244,245,273,294,297,311,323,387,395,402,442,495,655,663,665,674,741,785,815,857,1003,1404,1517,1531,1602,1782,1786,1927,2021,2347,2573,3146,3270,4844,6335],"values":[3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13,15,17,22,24,25,26,28,34,37,38,39,40,43,47,49,50,52,57,59,61,64,65,68,73,74,76,81,94,118,121,126,131,137,164,176,178,192,194,212,216,226,242,244,245,273,294,297,311,323,387,395,402,442,495,655,663,665,674,741,785,815,857,1003,1404,1517,1531,1602,1782,1786,1927,2021,2347,2

{"value":"This movie is S-L-O-W. Spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to 'begin'.<br /><br />The setting was bleak, the script was bleak, the cinematography was bleak, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not that all low budget movies are bad, but this one had no redeeming features).<br /><br />The plot was more consumed with a vengeful, slightly deranged hunter than the actual Wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie. This in itself was disappointing as this 'Wendigo' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag. Everything about the movie was uninspiring.<br /><br />The parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son. Whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script I'm not sure, but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levels.<br /><br />There was no food for thought, nothing to pique an interest. With no real intrigue or chill factor, this movie creaked along so painfully, you just couldn't care less what happened by the end.<br /><br />Wendigo's ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of 'Mr Bean's Holiday': a movie which is artistic and nonsensical, trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful, but coming across as pretentious and boring.<br /><br />I would never want to watch this again. I only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen ... but it didn't.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","slow","spend","much","of","the","movi","actual","wait","for","it","to","beginbr","br","the","set","be","bleak","the","script","be","bleak","the","cinematographi","be","bleak","the","plot","be","bleak","the","budget","be","low","not","that","all","low","budget","movi","be","bad","but","thi","on","have","no","redeem","featuresbr","br","the","plot","be","much","consum","with","a","veng","slightli","derang","hunter","than","the","actual","wendigo","which","make","a","veri","brief","appear","toward","the","end","of","the","movi","thi","in","itself","be","disappoint","a","thi","wendigo","be","just","a","bizarr","mix","of","a","tree","and","a","stag","everyth","about","the","movi","be","uninspiringbr","br","the","parent","of","the","littl","boi","appear","to","be","rather","aloof","and","at","time","seem","complet","detach","from","their","son","whether","thi","be","down","to","bad","act","or","a","bad","script","i","be","not","sure","but","it","onli","heighten","my","disappoint","and","boredom","levelsbr","br","there","be","no","food","for","think","noth","to","piqu","a","interest","with","no","real","intrigu","or","chill","factor","thi","movi","creak","along","so","painfulli","you","just","can","not","care","littl","what","happen","by","the","endbr","br","wendigo","ambianc","remind","me","of","the","dull","movi","show","at","the","award","ceremoni","toward","the","end","of","mr","bean","holidai","a","movi","which","be","artist","and","nonsens","try","too","hard","to","to","be","deep","and","meaning","but","come","across","a","pretenti","and","boringbr","br","i","would","never","want","to","watch","thi","again","i","onli","watch","it","to","the","end","in","the","vain","hope","that","someth","interest","mai","happen","but","it","do","not"],"filtered":["thi","movi","slow","spend","much","movi","actual","wait","beginbr","br","set","bleak","script","bleak","cinematographi","bleak","plot","bleak","budget","low","low","budget","movi","bad","thi","redeem","featuresbr","br","plot","much","consum","veng","slightli","derang","hunter","actual","wendigo","make","veri","brief","appear","toward","end","movi","thi","disappoint","thi","wendigo","bizarr","mix","tree","stag","everyth","movi","uninspiringbr","br","parent","littl","boi","appear","rather","aloof","time","seem","complet","detach","son","whether","thi","bad","act","bad","script","sure","onli","heighten","disappoint","boredom","levelsbr","br","food","think","noth","piqu","interest","real","intrigu","chill","factor","thi","movi","creak","along","painfulli","care","littl","happen","endbr","br","wendigo","ambianc","remind","dull","movi","show","award","ceremoni","toward","end","mr","bean","holidai","movi","artist","nonsens","try","hard","deep","meaning","come","across","pretenti","boringbr","br","never","want","watch","thi","onli","watch","end","vain","hope","someth","interest","mai","happen"],"filtered2":["slow","spend","actual","wait","beginbr","set","bleak","script","bleak","cinematographi","bleak","plot","bleak","budget","low","low","budget","bad","redeem","featuresbr","plot","consum","veng","slightli","derang","hunter","actual","wendigo","make","veri","brief","appear","toward","end","disappoint","wendigo","bizarr","mix","tree","stag","everyth","uninspiringbr","parent","littl","boi","appear","rather","aloof","time","seem","complet","detach","son","whether","bad","act","bad","script","sure","onli","heighten","disappoint","boredom","levelsbr","food","think","noth","piqu","interest","real","intrigu","chill","factor","creak","along","painfulli","care","littl","happen","endbr","wendigo","ambianc","remind","dull","show","award","ceremoni","toward","end","mr","bean","holidai","artist","nonsens","try","hard","deep","meaning","come","across","pretenti","boringbr","never","want","watch","onli","watch","end","vain","hope","someth","interest","mai","happen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,21,24,28,32,34,35,36,37,42,46,49,52,53,60,77,80,94,103,109,119,160,169,171,181,187,193,205,217,256,282,283,324,331,357,367,390,434,503,563,597,629,634,644,670,724,783,825,834,905,965,1004,1017,1047,1186,1240,1260,1351,1390,1571,1766,2031,2239,2241,2524,3047,3529,3562,3707,3799,3878,4324,4923,5296,6001,6542,6601,8064,8482],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,21,24,28,32,34,35,36,37,42,46,49,52,53,60,77,80,94,103,109,119,160,169,171,181,187,193,205,217,256,282,283,324,331,357,367,390,434,503,563,597,629,634,644,670,724,783,825,834,905,965,1004,1017,1047,1186,1240,1260,1351,1390,1571,1766,2031,2239,2241,2524,3047,3529,3562,3707,3799,3878,4324
