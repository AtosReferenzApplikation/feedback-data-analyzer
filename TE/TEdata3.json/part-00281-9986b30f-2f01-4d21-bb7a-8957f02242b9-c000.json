{"value":"I picked up this movie for $5 dollars at a discount book store, Adam Sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. There was absolutely no story line at all, bad jokes, and the other comedian said \"The F-Word\" every other word he said,cursing usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top. And even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when Sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie, it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions. And last of all is when they would randomly put in Bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie. In my opinion, Don't buy this movie, its a waste of money","finished_norm":["i","pick","up","thi","movi","for","dollar","at","a","discount","book","store","adam","sandler","be","a","awesom","actor","and","i","figur","it","would","be","a","good","movi","good","it","be","not","there","be","absolut","no","stori","line","at","all","bad","joke","and","the","other","comedian","sai","the","fword","everi","other","word","he","saidcurs","usual","dose","not","bother","me","but","thi","be","over","the","top","and","even","wrong","than","the","lack","of","stori","line","be","the","part","when","sandler","would","just","begin","talk","into","the","camera","at","random","part","in","the","movi","it","remind","me","of","dora","the","explor","when","thei","turn","and","look","at","the","screen","and","ask","you","question","and","last","of","all","be","when","thei","would","randomli","put","in","bikini","shot","of","girl","at","random","time","in","the","movi","in","my","opinion","do","not","bui","thi","movi","it","a","wast","of","monei"],"filtered":["pick","thi","movi","dollar","discount","book","store","adam","sandler","awesom","actor","figur","good","movi","good","absolut","stori","line","bad","joke","comedian","sai","fword","everi","word","saidcurs","usual","dose","bother","thi","top","even","wrong","lack","stori","line","part","sandler","begin","talk","camera","random","part","movi","remind","dora","explor","thei","turn","look","screen","ask","question","last","thei","randomli","put","bikini","shot","girl","random","time","movi","opinion","bui","thi","movi","wast","monei"],"filtered2":["pick","dollar","discount","book","store","adam","sandler","awesom","actor","figur","good","good","absolut","stori","line","bad","joke","comedian","fword","everi","word","saidcurs","usual","dose","bother","top","even","wrong","lack","stori","line","part","sandler","begin","talk","camera","random","part","remind","dora","explor","turn","look","screen","ask","question","last","randomli","put","bikini","shot","girl","random","time","opinion","bui","wast","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,8,9,16,17,25,41,61,84,85,89,96,107,126,144,147,151,159,183,186,192,214,222,231,258,265,306,347,364,378,415,441,446,496,538,644,793,859,1039,1251,1291,1634,1679,2694,2722,3008,3748,5946,6144],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,8,9,16,17,25,41,61,84,85,89,96,107,126,144,147,151,159,183,186,192,214,222,231,258,265,306,347,364,378,415,441,446,496,538,644,793,859,1039,1251,1291,1634,1679,2694,2722,3008,3748,5946,6144],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.2796387880827016,1.5687599167621034,3.7637034094785053,2.2212694515902225,2.011190219103739,1.9940046109572438,2.0390708128715254,4.287906797278791,2.2391270689902285,2.2931108769894046,2.2844323215331563,2.8002454868101863,2.300267965194495,2.4885128563647294,2.571852579609833,2.5318267134339894,2.7303758068497004,2.5771019354959765,2.7049353070058615,2.7061321952397077,2.73529586597515,2.8739486825973213,3.0151989841543516,2.9878441007049847,3.130944944345658,3.1588018988486244,3.293679367864308,3.233054746047873,3.293679367864308,3.43462735814388,3.5670958631572662,3.770603439954617,7.881004953500029,4.145296889396028,4.637773374493822,4.449957298382227,4.828393734102471,4.706176101378222,11.756431717202299,5.3064295350454715,5.390512652256013,5.822646007446338,6.489124940924123,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.32083603121134E-5,7.271469922381132E-5,7.327998667323716E-5,7.285657412956135E-5,7.285776780250111E-5,7.275592720287718E-5,7.297231352442733E-5,7.272516966536747E-5,7.288868235824398E-5,8.086601424007564E-5,0.7648746894845804,7.260777520739875E-5,7.396296332566158E-5,7.501806124982996E-5,7.266072003964297E-5,7.245991715960218E-5,7.42673391532292E-5,7.297915047938645E-5,7.275273294931842E-5,7.281303202971775E-5,0.05195769635252015,7.305145435031883E-5,7.313463451347187E-5,7.321342887944436E-5,7.37753043329223E-5,7.338948026059878E-5,7.647463459123384E-5,7.262936083322986E-5,7.263130383872122E-5,7.281531483626544E-5,7.436298730686058E-5,7.297492196080433E-5,7.833239689369214E-5,7.31801896476196E-5,7.27084146262687E-5,7.304401188964933E-5,7.263555897784318E-5,7.267848124906054E-5,7.245955311511974E-5,7.247835246617734E-5,7.264149242906692E-5,7.340770625131624E-5,7.303469084761301E-5,7.2745932096048E-5,7.362987144978314E-5,7.277385238230477E-5,7.519176611611569E-5,7.408604927823566E-5,7.249636729900777E-5,7.26565887041957E-5,7.263138866188371E-5,7.467550896328409E-5,7.2657669695722E-5,7.247191804468821E-5,7.326740106053376E-5,7.267638438263307E-5,7.815546406227881E-5,7.261648959851654E-5,7.24955289201098E-5,7.284167379326599E-5,7.356420197826735E-5,7.283685490221427E-5,7.248211708518682E-5,7.2650

{"value":"I am a huge fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a quite disappointing experience. Apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that I've come to associate with Lynch's work. The visuals are dull, to say the least, and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest.<br /><br />This feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera-work, scenery, sound and script. This film lacks almost all artistic qualities.

{"value":"Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still so bored I walk out, that is a stinker! <br /><br />Karen gets stuck in Paris, and befriends a sissily-handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon. Of course he's married, (\"But, cheri, why should that be a problem?\") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just dull. I walked out. <br /><br />Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left; but it would have had to have gotten a LOT better to make up for a rotten beginning.<br /><br />My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, for the exit. Save your time and your energy. Most assuredly save your money.

{"value":"One of, if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. <br /><br />This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it.<br /><br />In turns gratuitous, puerile, uncouth and unrealistic, this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script.

{"value":"This is almost the worst film you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one, for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis.' It looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station, just prior to demolition. The music really sucks. The acting is wooden and ham. The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of direction beggars belief.<br /><br />But you have to see it, if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever. This is a priceless example of a stupid movie!","finished_norm":["thi","be","almost","the","wrong","film","you","will","ever","see","doomsdai","current","pull","the","rug","from","under","thi","on","for","me","the","prop","be","a","perfect","exampl","of","what","frank","zappa","onc","refer","to","a","cheepni","it","look","a","if","the","space","scene","be","make","in","a","power","station","just","prior","to","demolit","the","music","realli","suck","the","act","be","wooden","and","ham","the","charact","thei","portrai","be","shallow","and","unconvinc","the","plot","be","predict","it","be","immedi","and","brazenli","obviou","when","thei","copi","techniqu","and","idea","from","other","film","the","qualiti","of","direct","beggar","beliefbr","br","but","you","have","to","see","it","if","onli","to","experi","what","have","to","be","on","of","the","big","wast","of","a","tini","budget","ever","thi","be","a","priceless","exampl","of","a","stupid","movi"],"filtered":["thi","almost","wrong","film","ever","see","doomsdai","current","pull","rug","thi","prop","perfect","exampl","frank","zappa","onc","refer","cheepni","look","space","scene","make","power","station","prior","demolit","music","realli","suck","act","wooden","ham","charact","thei","portrai","shallow","unconvinc","plot","predict","immedi","brazenli","obviou","thei","copi","techniqu","idea","film","qualiti","direct","beggar","beliefbr","br","see","onli","experi","big","wast","tini","budget","ever","thi","priceless","exampl","stupid","movi"],"filtered2":["almost","wrong","ever","see","doomsdai","current","pull","rug","prop","perfect","exampl","frank","zappa","onc","refer","cheepni","look","space","scene","make","power","station","prior","demolit","music","realli","suck","act","wooden","ham","charact","portrai","shallow","unconvinc","plot","predict","immedi","brazenli","obviou","copi","techniqu","idea","qualiti","direct","beggar","beliefbr","see","onli","experi","big","wast","tini","budget","ever","priceless","exampl","stupid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,11,13,16,19,21,25,32,44,82,89,102,118,123,131,136,236,256,307,319,333,337,366,383,421,469,544,637,677,715,747,890,987,1150,1259,1359,1398,1435,1797,1889,2055,2074,2200,5117,5880,6891,7065],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,11,13,16,19,21,25,32,44,82,89,102,118,123,131,136,236,256,307,319,333,337,366,383,421,469,544,637,677,715,747,890,987,1150,1259,1359,1398,1435,1797,1889,2055,2074,2200,5117,5880,6891,7065],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,3.209458785004948,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.087553710177271,2.354379525480895,2.2619070973220485,2.2512118082053005,2.346825985579986,2.617923930016232,2.748952192422636,5.753571127865041,2.9056060024680126,2.948928684455311,2.973659465713028,3.185521045582134,3.0433232530252132,3.2597778161886266,3.328770687675578,3.4222967456864013,3.7432044657665027,3.6559115968679063,3.68099128126493,3.7465885637507435,3.8767358583910254,4.035401218572811,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.403125998698128,4.436351646326448,4.6973654716960676,4.798834931860927,4.838444069955973,4.933754249760298,4.933754249760298,5.02684467282631,6.137727054086234,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.590028234739609E-5,7.538846899949009E-5,7.597454245935095E-5,7.553556074363691E-5,7.553679830875614E-5,7.543121295985705E-5,7.565555595609069E-5,7.5399324446423E-5,7.556884961409237E-5,0.49943592377886475,0.3289116083669821,7.527761331305166E-5,7.668263263559159E-5,7.777652724007546E-5,7.533250496339102E-5,7.512431842258766E-5,7.699820057282732E-5,7.566264431061168E-5,7.542790125138597E-5,7.54904175706709E-5,7.622083163668725E-5,7.573760684487937E-5,7.582384560015408E-5,7.590553728945293E-5,7.648807329191533E-5,7.608806220163919E-5,7.92866597905234E-5,7.529999265727193E-5,7.530200710841887E-5,7.549278431759401E-5,7.709736577521239E-5,7.565826030647711E-5,8.12127332975625E-5,0.1658053740808268,7.538195331294977E-5,7.572989071978429E-5,7.530641871194896E-5,7.535091926476151E-5,7.512394099193785E-5,7.514343160813437E-5,7.531257034027742E-5,7.610695837463937E-5,7.57202269365864E-5,7.542085032603774E-5,7.63372927410903E-5,7.54497972605282E-5,7.79566193544186E-5,7.681024454376084E-5,7.516210885882596E-5,7.532822171588238E-5,7.530209505058771E-5,7.742137906906423E-5,7.532934245621465E-5,7.51367605885174E-5,7.596149406496498E-5,7.534874529510541E-5,8.102929452358174E-5,7.52866481383572E-5,7.516123965215615E-5,7.552011251167177E-5,7.626920855769372E-5,7.551511642666361E-5,7.51473346547882E-5,7.532230371416842E-5,7.51248496293023E-5,7.686308293910007E-5,7.577201494370687E-5,7

{"value":"I looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out, since I was a huge SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went to see it, the people coming out of the early show were yelling, \"Don't waste your money!\" But of course we had to find out for ourselves.<br /><br />While there were a few funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show. It was pretty bad.<br /><br />When the opera singer came on, many people got up and walked out. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was just pressing people's buttons on purpose with this movie. Or else he was just insane. Whatever - you don't need to waste your time watching it, it's that bad.","finished_norm":["i","look","forward","to","see","thi","movi","when","it","come","out","sinc","i","be","a","huge","snl","fan","when","my","boyfriend","and","i","go","to","see","it","the","peopl","come","out","of","the","earli","show","be","yell","do","not","wast","your","monei","but","of","cours","we","have","to","find","out","for","ourselvesbr","br","while","there","be","a","few","funni","bit","laser","bra","root","boi","slim","much","of","it","feel","like","it","can","have","be","sever","edit","down","to","a","amus","hour","show","it","be","pretti","badbr","br","when","the","opu","singer","come","on","mani","peopl","get","up","and","walk","out","thi","make","me","laugh","becaus","i","realiz","that","o","donoghu","be","just","press","peopl","button","on","purpos","with","thi","movi","or","els","he","be","just","insan","whatev","you","do","not","ne","to","wast","your","time","watch","it","it","that","bad"],"filtered":["look","forward","see","thi","movi","come","sinc","huge","snl","fan","boyfriend","go","see","peopl","come","earli","show","yell","wast","monei","cours","find","ourselvesbr","br","funni","bit","laser","bra","root","boi","slim","much","feel","like","sever","edit","amus","hour","show","pretti","badbr","br","opu","singer","come","mani","peopl","get","walk","thi","make","laugh","becaus","realiz","o","donoghu","press","peopl","button","purpos","thi","movi","els","insan","whatev","ne","wast","time","watch","bad"],"filtered2":["look","forward","see","come","sinc","huge","snl","fan","boyfriend","go","see","peopl","come","earli","show","yell","wast","monei","cours","find","ourselvesbr","funni","bit","laser","bra","root","boi","slim","feel","like","sever","edit","amus","hour","show","pretti","badbr","opu","singer","come","mani","peopl","get","walk","make","laugh","becaus","realiz","o","donoghu","press","peopl","button","purpos","els","insan","whatev","ne","wast","time","watch","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,9,16,22,23,28,34,38,43,50,62,78,89,110,126,133,140,162,174,196,199,266,282,294,316,348,405,444,556,699,708,794,994,1050,1200,1285,1362,1381,1452,1628,1662,1954,2548,2673,4389,5307,5444],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,9,16,22,23,28,34,38,43,50,62,78,89,110,126,133,140,162,174,196,199,266,282,294,316,348,405,444,556,699,708,794,994,1050,1200,1285,1362,1381,1452,1628,1662,1954,2548,2673,4389,5307,5444],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,4.094543182127343,3.0904588387038183,4.194855026837689,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,3.9880092219144876,2.1290479736304078,2.2391270689902285,2.3212364753796515,2.317169775997098,2.3586007221245198,2.456282578459816,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.747702973022204,2.918851229218033,2.886778509330039,2.878207028279898,3.0103169565570433,3.109204957709252,3.2535472664379905,3.4471119148061256,3.5813614403160887,3.6683728173057184,3.7465885637507435,4.140259095366071,4.240607069200353,4.499089986959872,4.449957298382227,4.396611317676934,4.449957298382227,4.74221603786142,4.613282354485526,4.77960356993304,4.900964426937307,5.185068678041204,5.521540914662417,5.967828017290836,6.342521466732247,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.550621053191089E-5,7.499705450238318E-5,7.5580085087762E-5,7.514338255094328E-5,7.514461369066438E-5,7.503957653748793E-5,7.526275475212809E-5,7.500785358818609E-5,7.517649858665808E-5,0.07275085065356723,0.772006978081594,7.488677437508974E-5,7.62844988826685E-5,7.737271402168259E-5,7.494138102975273E-5,7.473427538674785E-5,7.659842840136229E-5,7.526980630414127E-5,7.503628202330031E-5,7.509847375987385E-5,7.582509553964107E-5,7.534437963535122E-5,7.543017064179277E-5,7.551143819047824E-5,7.60909496848232E-5,7.56930154392133E-5,7.887500601268367E-5,7.490903752647734E-5,7.491104151865896E-5,7.510082821872336E-5,7.669707874121815E-5,7.526544506161462E-5,8.079107940825805E-5,7.547715565190778E-5,7.499057264507703E-5,7.533670357212851E-5,7.491543021728595E-5,7.495969972466501E-5,7.473389991570579E-5,7.475328933725227E-5,7.492154990655873E-5,7.571181350389333E-5,7.532708996298099E-5,7.502926770612883E-5,0.05729823916704171,7.505806434906998E-5,7.755187110358238E-5,7.641144823393052E-5,7.477186961626128E-5,7.493712002072687E-5,7.49111290042349E-5,0.09220467945266526,7.493823494221151E-5,7.474665295335379E-5,7.55671044402184E-5,7.495753704218918E-5,8.060859304246943E-5,7.489576229187399E-5,7.477100492248444E-5,7.512801452569976E-5,7.587322128923555E-5,7.512304438020367E-5,7.47571721194139E-5,7.493123274508673E-5,

{"value":"Well this movie is amazingly awful. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm, which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously, nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher. While watching this \" Creature Unknown\" I could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew. But, if you go into watching this for a laugh you'll be happy, the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of pumping this straight to DVD clichéd wanna be action thriller/horror movie fightfest to light.","finished_norm":["good","thi","movi","be","amazingli","aw","i","feel","sorri","for","the","actor","involv","in","thi","project","becaus","i","be","sure","thei","do","not","write","their","line","which","be","sometim","deliv","with","slight","sarcasm","which","lead","me","to","believ","thei","be","not","take","thi","movi","serious","nor","can","anybodi","who","watch","thi","obnoxi","off","beat","monster","slasher","while","watch","thi","creatur","unknown","i","can","not","help","but","think","that","there","be","not","much","of","a","budget","or","a","compet","writer","on","the","crow","but","if","you","go","into","watch","thi","for","a","laugh","you","will","be","happi","the","movi","be","shameless","to","mock","itself","becaus","i","cant","see","how","anybodi","can","look","at","thi","and","be","proud","of","pump","thi","straight","to","dvd","clichéd","wanna","be","action","thrillerhorror","movi","fightfest","to","light"],"filtered":["good","thi","movi","amazingli","aw","feel","sorri","actor","involv","thi","project","becaus","sure","thei","write","line","sometim","deliv","slight","sarcasm","lead","believ","thei","take","thi","movi","serious","anybodi","watch","thi","obnoxi","beat","monster","slasher","watch","thi","creatur","unknown","help","think","much","budget","compet","writer","crow","go","watch","thi","laugh","happi","movi","shameless","mock","becaus","cant","see","anybodi","look","thi","proud","pump","thi","straight","dvd","clichéd","wanna","action","thrillerhorror","movi","fightfest","light"],"filtered2":["good","amazingli","aw","feel","sorri","actor","involv","project","becaus","sure","write","line","sometim","deliv","slight","sarcasm","lead","believ","take","serious","anybodi","watch","obnoxi","beat","monster","slasher","watch","creatur","unknown","help","think","budget","compet","writer","crow","go","watch","laugh","happi","shameless","mock","becaus","cant","see","anybodi","look","proud","pump","straight","dvd","clichéd","wanna","action","thrillerhorror","fightfest","light"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,7,12,16,22,31,41,43,65,91,107,119,129,133,138,157,185,241,247,256,287,353,371,413,437,500,517,548,605,660,678,731,761,769,1209,1360,1440,1454,1511,1519,1534,2018,2235,2681,2713,4083,4560,4936],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,7,12,16,22,31,41,43,65,91,107,119,129,133,138,157,185,241,247,256,287,353,371,413,437,500,517,548,605,660,678,731,761,769,1209,1360,1440,1454,1511,1519,1534,2018,2235,2681,2713,4083,4560,4936],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,2.8828493162168796,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,2.5958480334723544,1.4070669811451506,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.9073850067444174,2.0105926690411424,2.1439533986393955,2.1653408989309972,2.4106958340079214,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.3360150694757706,2.518833027372001,2.6627744961815836,2.7303758068497004,2.748952192422636,2.841890188081905,3.0266839340212486,3.0466846007279185,3.467417180966871,3.1952392950510555,3.3814747511661465,3.4198487640477615,3.459754308221302,3.5474598886404074,3.6405503117064195,3.6715125373103863,4.096025840389245,3.9405024767500145,3.857614816944247,8.619199881374609,4.396611317676934,4.449957298382227,4.637773374493822,4.566029469634981,4.573751515728891,4.566029469634981,5.00274712124725,5.039114765418124,5.243909178064138,5.426230734858092,5.850044981634453,5.967828017290836,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.399608227014018E-5,7.349710938852076E-5,0.028147472645086435,7.364051086825873E-5,7.364171738511935E-5,7.353878098064197E-5,7.375749561901515E-5,7.350769249202821E-5,7.367296458148245E-5,8.173613255447905E-5,0.8187505737391867,7.338903486969003E-5,7.475880481212514E-5,7.582525558997299E-5,7.344254938832996E-5,7.323958586929701E-5,7.506645572360182E-5,7.376440613960973E-5,7.353555235691487E-5,7.359650025542017E-5,7.430858956060663E-5,7.38374880001944E-5,7.392156318190419E-5,7.400120537525569E-5,7.456912660862125E-5,7.41791510692739E-5,7.729750166055162E-5,7.34108527568554E-5,7.341281666908587E-5,7.359880762496636E-5,0.061355460888121646,7.37601321221676E-5,7.917525348541148E-5,7.396760848929601E-5,7.349075716870849E-5,7.382996545864799E-5,7.341711759350484E-5,7.346050170836114E-5,7.323921790769594E-5,7.325821953977119E-5,7.342311488866384E-5,7.419757317165175E-5,7.382054412219922E-5,7.352867832646316E-5,7.442212886765739E-5,7.355689903500046E-5,7.600082952062247E-5,7.488321516955072E-5,7.327642821220313E-5,7.343837359971323E-5,7.341290240494559E-5,0.08611509879426425,7.343946622270837E-5,7.325171588390673E-5,7.40557582970144E-5,7.345838227965087E-5,7.899641685672957E-5,7.339784302765637E-5,7.327558081234821E-5,7.362545020434462E-5,7.435575279262713E-5,7.3620579462025

{"value":"Unless you're twelve, this movie really isn't worth it. It's obviously a low-budget film with B actors, and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that's not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I enjoy laughing at bad movies. I didn't know how bad though. It's bearable, until after hour 2, then it really starts to burn. Fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics, and wire-fighting. There's no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot, but once again, it's obviously a kid's movie. It seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed, like Sesame Street or something. It's bearable. But much better if you're, say, nine.","finished_norm":["unless","you","re","twelv","thi","movi","realli","be","not","worth","it","it","obvious","a","lowbudget","film","with","b","actor","and","with","a","genr","like","fantasi","that","sometim","requir","intens","cgi","work","that","not","good","i","know","it","would","be","bad","when","i","rent","it","i","enjoi","laugh","at","bad","movi","i","do","not","know","how","bad","though","it","bearabl","until","after","hour","then","it","realli","start","to","burn","fight","styl","go","between","normal","fight","that","obei","the","law","of","physic","and","wirefight","there","no","real","explan","for","the","transit","it","have","a","plot","but","onc","again","it","obvious","a","kid","movi","it","seem","like","there","be","explicit","moral","lesson","of","the","dai","that","be","be","convei","like","sesam","street","or","someth","it","bearabl","but","much","well","if","you","re","sai","nine"],"filtered":["unless","re","twelv","thi","movi","realli","worth","obvious","lowbudget","film","b","actor","genr","like","fantasi","sometim","requir","intens","cgi","work","good","know","bad","rent","enjoi","laugh","bad","movi","know","bad","though","bearabl","hour","realli","start","burn","fight","styl","go","normal","fight","obei","law","physic","wirefight","real","explan","transit","plot","onc","obvious","kid","movi","seem","like","explicit","moral","lesson","dai","convei","like","sesam","street","someth","bearabl","much","well","re","sai","nine"],"filtered2":["unless","re","twelv","realli","worth","obvious","lowbudget","b","actor","genr","like","fantasi","sometim","requir","intens","cgi","work","good","know","bad","rent","enjoi","laugh","bad","know","bad","though","bearabl","hour","realli","start","burn","fight","styl","go","normal","fight","obei","law","physic","wirefight","real","explan","transit","plot","onc","obvious","kid","seem","like","explicit","moral","lesson","dai","convei","like","sesam","street","someth","bearabl","well","re","nine"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,9,13,20,26,32,35,41,48,53,68,71,80,86,114,132,133,174,200,219,232,236,341,380,460,467,500,642,661,664,700,862,878,970,989,996,1000,1012,1029,1222,1272,1350,1613,2918,2995,3629,4096,4704,6209,7943],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,9,13,20,26,32,35,41,48,53,68,71,80,86,114,132,133,174,200,219,232,236,341,380,460,467,500,642,661,664,700,862,878,970,989,996,1000,1012,1029,1222,1272,1350,1613,2918,2995,3629,4096,4704,6209,7943],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,3.205071257016622,2.2635883139467947,1.165345040023057,2.6649848339420377,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,4.012839573363895,1.9214926742550966,1.9951803900462557,2.031112399272319,2.4433074195966826,2.253494045787767,2.3212364753796515,2.456282578459816,2.5308211829319704,2.5792094178355414,5.675566812258503,2.617923930016232,5.867553758869418,3.102062070196872,3.216957819005698,3.342254038012865,3.3814747511661465,3.622422927113863,3.5727776966246974,3.6905607322810807,3.616452760127359,3.944626193933877,4.067587905068712,4.086456389373095,4.044492190274062,4.1302590120314875,4.062925891962901,4.297765483040301,4.280272325592784,4.3336974922663645,4.416284083275639,4.470719289830655,4.6295428753573065,5.482320201509136,5.444579873526289,5.672363804397,5.907203395474402,12.202718819830718,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.606705252894814E-5,6.562154694852941E-5,6.613169190268422E-5,6.5749582282346E-5,6.575065951522593E-5,6.5658753232716E-5,6.585403156447278E-5,6.563099602250596E-5,6.57785584269003E-5,7.29777198646223E-5,0.7184964258347316,6.552505312488936E-5,6.674804574778329E-5,0.034886213185623946,6.557283331007723E-5,6.53916182908218E-5,6.702273041088349E-5,6.58602015901433E-5,6.56558705712719E-5,6.571028761456047E-5,6.63460731870899E-5,6.592545238415877E-5,6.600051851301303E-5,6.607162666915115E-5,6.65786924597438E-5,6.623050464151572E-5,6.901470923717925E-5,6.554453312238654E-5,6.554628659214483E-5,6.571234773856075E-5,6.710904830631676E-5,6.585638555385874E-5,7.069125108430629E-5,0.0840865926068263,6.56158753990752E-5,6.591873591847233E-5,6.555012665219659E-5,6.558886195421796E-5,6.539128975804438E-5,6.540825527548716E-5,6.555548130885062E-5,6.624695272860562E-5,6.591032412272643E-5,6.564973312565308E-5,6.644744622107888E-5,6.5674929851968E-5,6.785698164196991E-5,6.685912494774923E-5,6.5424512802658E-5,6.556910497693544E-5,6.554636314100221E-5,6.739108419133506E-5,6.557008052021556E-5,6.540244851706907E-5,6.612033398765867E-5,6.558696963230528E-5,7.053157764513563E-5,6.553291744712361E-5,6.54237562057003E-5,6.573613543971044E-5,6.63881826560204E-5,6.573178662043777E-5,6.54116526645

{"value":"This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will have you know that Real Men don't watch anything by Truffaut. <br /><br />It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's \"Bicycle Thief\"? Or anything by Hitchcock?<br /><br />So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all his free time 'screwing up his eyes' at the movies, who wrecks schoolroom discipline, gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts), and ultimately escapes societal confines to make 'his own movie'. Sorry...been there, done that too many times for this to matter.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","sort","of","thing","that","onli","now","thrill","the","film","egghead","after","all","feierstein","flex","crush","will","have","you","know","that","real","man","do","not","watch","anyth","by","truffaut","br","br","it","mai","have","be","interest","if","truffaut","have","anyth","to","sai","here","the","cameraasvoyeur","motif","be","noth","new","have","we","all","forget","de","sica","bicycl","thief","or","anyth","by","hitchcockbr","br","so","all","we","get","be","the","extend","metaphor","of","the","juvenil","a","truffaut","who","spend","all","hi","free","time","screw","up","hi","ey","at","the","movi","who","wreck","schoolroom","disciplin","get","accus","of","plagiarismth","mani","petti","theft","and","ultim","escap","societ","confin","to","make","hi","own","movi","sorrybeen","there","do","that","too","mani","time","for","thi","to","matt"],"filtered":["thi","sort","thing","onli","thrill","film","egghead","feierstein","flex","crush","know","real","man","watch","anyth","truffaut","br","br","mai","interest","truffaut","anyth","sai","cameraasvoyeur","motif","noth","new","forget","de","sica","bicycl","thief","anyth","hitchcockbr","br","get","extend","metaphor","juvenil","truffaut","spend","hi","free","time","screw","hi","ey","movi","wreck","schoolroom","disciplin","get","accus","plagiarismth","mani","petti","theft","ultim","escap","societ","confin","make","hi","movi","sorrybeen","mani","time","thi","matt"],"filtered2":["sort","thing","onli","thrill","egghead","feierstein","flex","crush","know","real","man","watch","anyth","truffaut","mai","interest","truffaut","anyth","cameraasvoyeur","motif","noth","new","forget","de","sica","bicycl","thief","anyth","hitchcockbr","get","extend","metaphor","juvenil","truffaut","spend","free","time","screw","ey","wreck","schoolroom","disciplin","get","accus","plagiarismth","mani","petti","theft","ultim","escap","societ","confin","make","sorrybeen","mani","time","matt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,8,11,26,29,45,46,49,50,60,80,87,104,269,281,283,373,408,638,686,735,750,1218,1703,1886,2053,2160,2430,2600,2870,3644,3864,4282,5455,6049,6863,7906],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,8,11,26,29,45,46,49,50,60,80,87,104,269,281,283,373,408,638,686,735,750,1218,1703,1886,2053,2160,2430,2600,2870,3644,3864,4282,5455,6049,6863,7906],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,3.43598877114071,1.838176641236591,1.9951803900462557,2.115024371522662,6.218472051096857,2.76533567167316,2.832333801361687,2.7678802023081546,3.0316467233633775,3.130944944345658,3.613480989738201,3.6016814428070463,3.7132521434831514,4.030886538218284,4.297765483040301,4.751432692966343,4.848596441419991,5.02684467282631,5.014723312293965,5.129498826886393,5.243909178064138,5.408212229355414,5.850044981634453,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825,6.255510089742618,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.61444248248295E-5,8.556353282931316E-5,8.622870770802748E-5,8.57304773162653E-5,8.573188191361439E-5,8.561204587520269E-5,8.586666809499326E-5,8.557585341895171E-5,8.576825913353613E-5,0.16791954916758547,0.29655522186831657,8.54377151241419E-5,8.703236770862107E-5,8.827390355813139E-5,8.550001541473275E-5,8.526373026190956E-5,0.2458803877011065,8.587471315364497E-5,8.560828719061543E-5,8.567924123980216E-5,8.650823815068258E-5,8.595979326399745E-5,8.60576715292817E-5,8.615038901820236E-5,8.681154899442214E-5,8.635754903250273E-5,8.998785633859893E-5,8.5463114973473E-5,8.546540131194268E-5,8.56819274228583E-5,8.750307673187486E-5,8.586973744732448E-5,9.21738889764593E-5,8.611127634725937E-5,8.555613773074442E-5,8.595103570555847E-5,8.547040834270596E-5,8.552091506557793E-5,8.526330189003488E-5,8.528542312423589E-5,8.547739024669501E-5,0.18738834850145075,8.594006761664672E-5,8.560028461289343E-5,8.664041782831998E-5,8.563313846988843E-5,8.847830242366618E-5,8.717720319658045E-5,8.530662121426108E-5,8.549515406400252E-5,8.54655011235286E-5,8.787082159356999E-5,8.549642606890574E-5,8.527785172752793E-5,8.621389819224567E-5,8.551844767863524E-5,9.19656917578664E-5,8.544796936569764E-5,8.53056346921256E-5,8.571294406057719E-5,8.656314442910491E-5,8.570727366178428E-5,8.52898529589962E-5,8.548843731884697E-5,8.526433316476423E-5,8.7237173107553E-5,8.599884537014437E-5,8.581565523816695E-5,8.574060556918169E-5,8.605314370572427E-5,8.526122258666548E-5,8.574240308081269E-5,8.713308793915183E-5,8.541401543345324E-5,0.0957954120949617,8.563984141263962E-5,8.631010175402291E-5,8.578261238121322E-5,8.523449068224396E-5,8.534014468739902E-5]}}
{"value":"I have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of \"Boom!\", and I want to see it in all its widescreen glory. So I voted \"1\" and hope you will too. Together, we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross, and hope that someone will see an opportunity for BIG MONEY in releasing \"Boom!\" in its Director's Cut Extended Version. The movie is one of my howling favoritesyou just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say to yourself, \"Yep, I guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time.\" Producers considering the DVD release of \"Boom!\" should note that, everywhere it's been shown, there have been sellout crowds in the theaters.

{"value":"Its spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs. That was pretty tight. Before and after that the movie pretty much blows. The acting is like E-list and it's shown well in the movie. Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2.

{"value":"It's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments, what's so difficult about capturing the robbers? Just eliminate the bank workers, see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. The Movie is not worth it.

{"value":"I read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it. I'm a big Francophile and art film lover, but I believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something \"arty\" or \"intellectual\" into something it is not. I will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that I never, ever wanted to actually see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is, in essence, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film.","finished_norm":["i","read","the","review","of","thi","movi","and","thei","be","gener","pretti","good","so","i","think","i","should","see","it","i","be","a","big","francophil","and","art","film","lover","but","i","believ","thi","be","yet","anoth","case","in","which","the","critic","make","someth","arti","or","intellectu","into","someth","it","be","not","i","will","be","blunt","it","contain","scene","of","sexual","pervers","that","i","never","ever","want","to","actual","see","obvious","the","piano","teacher","have","some","major","psycholog","issu","but","i","realli","do","not","want","to","see","them","displai","so","graphic","the","film","be","in","essenc","disgust","i","mean","when","i","see","requiem","for","a","dream","i","be","repuls","by","the","last","sort","of","scene","with","jennif","connelli","but","that","be","not","anywher","near","the","sort","of","disgust","and","repuls","i","feel","dure","thi","film"],"filtered":["read","review","thi","movi","thei","gener","pretti","good","think","see","big","francophil","art","film","lover","believ","thi","yet","anoth","case","critic","make","someth","arti","intellectu","someth","blunt","contain","scene","sexual","pervers","never","ever","want","actual","see","obvious","piano","teacher","major","psycholog","issu","realli","want","see","displai","graphic","film","essenc","disgust","mean","see","requiem","dream","repuls","last","sort","scene","jennif","connelli","anywher","near","sort","disgust","repuls","feel","dure","thi","film"],"filtered2":["read","review","gener","pretti","good","think","see","big","francophil","art","lover","believ","yet","anoth","case","critic","make","someth","arti","intellectu","someth","blunt","contain","scene","sexual","pervers","never","ever","want","actual","see","obvious","piano","teacher","major","psycholog","issu","realli","want","see","displai","graphic","essenc","disgust","mean","see","requiem","dream","repuls","last","sort","scene","jennif","connelli","anywher","near","sort","disgust","repuls","feel","dure"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,12,13,19,37,42,43,44,52,53,73,78,82,88,91,144,145,176,194,225,239,269,288,341,382,404,519,555,579,607,711,806,954,963,1062,1114,1146,1292,1578,1702,1848,2844,3248,3253,3480,4080,5158,7958],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,12,13,19,37,42,43,44,52,53,73,78,82,88,91,144,145,176,194,225,239,269,288,341,382,404,519,555,579,607,711,806,954,963,1062,1114,1146,1292,1578,1702,1848,2844,3248,3253,3480,4080,5158,7958],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.62476135602347,2.975308642954861,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,3.400636547121535,1.8950689206770979,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.5040471493269134,2.5378812223426954,2.641219492619754,2.6593400337329487,5.53067134334632,2.8015621426949333,2.933776879434709,3.235085203598255,3.1419947805322432,3.5614461306151473,3.432149042129413,3.5642670069567886,3.68099128126493,3.6375061693251913,3.880604335168946,4.062925891962901,8.070802437145622,4.100845126825194,4.364659717870332,4.297765483040301,4.3336974922663645,4.848596441419991,4.869215728622727,4.900964426937307,10.816424458710827,5.521540914662417,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.960722577309565E-5,6.91378479768667E-5,6.967532881855099E-5,6.927274402636127E-5,6.927387898227973E-5,6.917704794302863E-5,6.938279017621261E-5,6.914780337521514E-5,6.93032728445667E-5,7.688819810444431E-5,0.8032029786730926,6.903618357516087E-5,7.032470970674982E-5,7.132790714358902E-5,6.908652404004533E-5,6.889559869562707E-5,7.061411322376679E-5,6.938929081992886E-5,6.91740108154698E-5,0.04199281472029432,6.990119762749497E-5,6.945803804834378E-5,6.953712656189267E-5,6.961204501654064E-5,7.014628169907057E-5,6.977943639347403E-5,0.04047773106896291,6.90567073995475E-5,6.905855482819279E-5,6.92335142863228E-5,7.070505642473749E-5,6.938527030305925E-5,7.447920992467262E-5,6.958044082947394E-5,6.913187251999023E-5,6.945096168386955E-5,6.906260065613233E-5,6.910341157186085E-5,6.889525255856878E-5,6.891312716562017E-5,6.906824223965071E-5,6.979676584390019E-5,6.944209914583842E-5,6.916754449759264E-5,7.0008002689838E-5,6.919409137913511E-5,7.149306743121037E-5,7.044174103560069E-5,6.893025584505985E-5,6.908259592585188E-5,6.90586354788862E-5,7.100220507558704E-5,6.908362374317915E-5,6.89070092546684E-5,6.966336229476595E-5,6.910141785073104E-5,7.43109804562027E-5,6.904446930355889E-5,6.892945870619503E-5,0.08447345121935633,6.994556351334625E-5,6.925399479192728E-5,6.8916706602234

{"value":"Personally, while I'm able to appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap. You know, those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie-cutter action movie to kill time. This is the only movie that I can remember actually shutting off in the middle, and I have absolutely NO intention of going back to finish it. The plot was so contrived and predictable, I was calling out what the next scene would be easily (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were horrible, I've seen better acting in middle school plays. Even the scene cuts were bad, the flow was all wrong.<br /><br />This movie is like a parody that forgot the

{"value":"Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him. Yeah, right! And we're also presented with the 'sympathetic, attractive' gay friend who is actually a fat, balding, ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive. Even I didn't find him appealing and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but thankfully not balding)! Whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script, and truly awful direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filmdom, but then he's no different than the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed.","finished_norm":["yet","anoth","insult","and","slap","in","the","face","to","gai","man","everywher","thi","lame","attempt","at","a","comedi","have","noth","to","recommend","it","onc","again","we","have","a","attract","straight","hero","who","supposedli","ca","not","get","ani","woman","to","be","interest","in","him","ye","right","and","we","re","conjur","present","with","the","sympathet","attract","gai","friend","who","be","actual","a","fat","bald","ugli","old","man","whom","the","lead","be","suppos","to","find","attract","even","i","do","not","find","him","appeal","and","i","be","a","fat","ugli","old","gai","man","but","thankfulli","not","bald","whatev","act","talent","there","mai","be","here","have","be","throw","awai","on","a","bad","script","and","truli","aw","direct","mr","sneedek","should","be","ban","from","filmdom","but","then","he","no","differ","than","the","countless","other","hack","work","in","hollyw"],"filtered":["yet","anoth","insult","slap","face","gai","man","everywher","thi","lame","attempt","comedi","noth","recommend","onc","attract","straight","hero","supposedli","ca","get","ani","woman","interest","ye","right","re","conjur","present","sympathet","attract","gai","friend","actual","fat","bald","ugli","old","man","lead","suppos","find","attract","even","find","appeal","fat","ugli","old","gai","man","thankfulli","bald","whatev","act","talent","mai","throw","awai","bad","script","truli","aw","direct","mr","sneedek","ban","filmdom","differ","countless","hack","work","hollyw"],"filtered2":["yet","anoth","insult","slap","face","gai","man","everywher","lame","attempt","comedi","noth","recommend","onc","attract","straight","hero","supposedli","ca","get","ani","woman","interest","ye","right","re","conjur","present","sympathet","attract","gai","friend","actual","fat","bald","ugli","old","man","lead","suppos","find","attract","even","find","appeal","fat","ugli","old","gai","man","thankfulli","bald","whatev","act","talent","mai","throw","awai","bad","script","truli","aw","direct","mr","sneedek","ban","filmdom","differ","countless","hack","work","hollyw"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,9,21,27,38,39,45,46,48,49,52,60,67,68,70,73,77,81,102,121,127,138,149,155,157,161,177,194,204,209,236,251,276,298,310,343,357,372,375,411,548,556,640,648,689,709,895,946,1151,1491,1902,2126,2279,2319,2503,2516,4262],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,9,21,27,38,39,45,46,48,49,52,60,67,68,70,73,77,81,102,121,127,138,149,155,157,161,177,194,204,209,236,251,276,298,310,343,357,372,375,411,548,556,640,648,689,709,895,946,1151,1491,1902,2126,2279,2319,2503,2516,4262],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,3.038623282696244,1.5538940054862738,5.44888831938665,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,1.838176641236591,3.9141830778533158,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.087553710177271,2.2190595059394194,2.4359679371086367,2.2907365189289424,2.3253197803590226,2.3074766467914385,2.3360150694757706,2.4323182980210873,2.458149992634611,2.5378812223426954,2.624524614047584,2.6026896854443837,2.617923930016232,2.6942272927333892,2.7884729505849193,2.7819920465008363,2.854312708080462,2.9705344631698933,3.2829611516442836,3.070535816550098,3.2597778161886266,3.229006157521873,3.459754308221302,3.4471119148061256,11.99952574960897,10.831554073822634,3.634471265630037,3.6497387377608255,7.990969222334735,3.9612932464190886,8.667394984532729,4.558366596889411,4.85885294158718,4.933754249760298,5.02684467282631,5.274680836730892,5.156897801074508,5.143104478942172,12.064733076856815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.132170121797326E-5,6.090819465081701E-5,6.138169778527016E-5,6.102703368154574E-5,6.1028033540783844E-5,6.094272854562519E-5,6.112398075918637E-5,6.091696503286066E-5,6.105392857712215E-5,6.77360009536749E-5,0.858892098676983,6.081863162059037E-5,6.195378122000722E-5,6.283756552258847E-5,6.0862979932314236E-5,6.0694780915684546E-5,6.220873630268493E-5,6.112970761480034E-5,6.094005293505954E-5,6.099056140398579E-5,6.158068085725284E-5,6.1190271686326E-5,6.125994609359842E-5,6.132594681465303E-5,6.17965919504407E-5,6.147341317161194E-5,6.405763867902622E-5,6.083671244212734E-5,6.08383399666573E-5,6.0992473556921055E-5,6.228885430388081E-5,6.112616567024671E-5,6.561376074431598E-5,6.129810455409723E-5,6.090293046772179E-5,6.118403763945545E-5,6.0841904209440025E-5,6.087785729840373E-5,6.069447598019785E-5,6.071022292745539E-5,6.084687426096942E-5,6.148867985361946E-5,6.117623003179487E-5,6.0934356319393E-5,6.16747726422482E-5,6.0957743258322625E-5,6.29830663624525E-5,6.205688201

{"value":"This movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident. thought it was a joke before the actual movie. this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did. this movie had not actual facts about the real Zodiac killer. The filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings... they only liked the name... so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name. I am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner. I try to like something out of every movie, i don't hate movies... ever... except this one. If you could have given it no stars, i definitely would have. 1 out of

{"value":"This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in \"Glen or Glenda?\"<br /><br />The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; the Bohemians play it. The Russians -- who speak very questionable \"Russian\" and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English -- play it at the restaurant where they work.<br /><br />If one isn't interested in bridge, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.<br /><br />Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","sure","have","on","of","the","strang","theme","in","histori","right","up","there","with","ed","wood","impass","defens","of","crossdress","in","glen","or","glendabr","br","the","subject","plai","bridg","the","park","avenu","set","plai","it","the","bohemian","plai","it","the","russian","who","speak","veri","question","russian","and","have","much","unconvinc","accent","when","thei","speak","english","plai","it","at","the","restaur","where","thei","workbr","br","if","on","be","not","interest","in","bridg","on","even","despit","the","great","cast","be","not","like","to","be","much","interest","in","thi","bizarr","moviebr","br","loretta","young","and","paul","luka","be","fine","good","frank","mchugh","be","a","unlik","ghost","writer","a","luka","be","a","unlik","russian","but","thei","be","all","sink","by","the","fetishist","script"],"filtered":["thi","movi","sure","strang","theme","histori","right","ed","wood","impass","defens","crossdress","glen","glendabr","br","subject","plai","bridg","park","avenu","set","plai","bohemian","plai","russian","speak","veri","question","russian","much","unconvinc","accent","thei","speak","english","plai","restaur","thei","workbr","br","interest","bridg","even","despit","great","cast","like","much","interest","thi","bizarr","moviebr","br","loretta","young","paul","luka","fine","good","frank","mchugh","unlik","ghost","writer","luka","unlik","russian","thei","sink","fetishist","script"],"filtered2":["sure","strang","theme","histori","right","ed","wood","impass","defens","crossdress","glen","glendabr","subject","plai","bridg","park","avenu","set","plai","bohemian","plai","russian","speak","veri","question","russian","unconvinc","accent","speak","english","plai","restaur","workbr","interest","bridg","even","despit","great","cast","like","interest","bizarr","moviebr","loretta","young","paul","luka","fine","good","frank","mchugh","unlik","ghost","writer","luka","unlik","russian","sink","fetishist","script"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,15,40,51,60,77,92,109,119,121,135,287,344,378,391,417,464,465,499,533,550,559,588,615,655,727,825,840,935,1234,1357,1376,1398,1435,2152,3015,3069,3347,5915,6792,7533],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,15,40,51,60,77,92,109,119,121,135,287,344,378,391,417,464,465,499,533,550,559,588,615,655,727,825,840,935,1234,1357,1376,1398,1435,2152,3015,3069,3347,5915,6792,7533],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.2000607798565692,6.513987503328295,1.7139899308309823,3.676353282473182,1.9463902258768238,2.0489535369135887,2.125691139326857,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.366244071437088,2.841890188081905,5.966186995892774,3.130944944345658,3.109204957709252,3.1932880749197934,3.2872346624216657,3.2681460658591432,3.3814747511661465,3.4933926673701317,3.4751392270607813,3.5727776966246974,3.6375061693251913,7.002637465285105,3.7297814454343623,4.096025840389245,3.850067611308864,4.049068857301474,4.135246553542527,14.22664811358426,4.456830177669989,4.535724120139652,4.436351646326448,4.6973654716960676,10.286208957884345,5.444579873526289,5.5623629091826725,5.541743621979936,13.321950395701563,7.0356686472921925,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.688858246271815E-5,6.6437537113898E-5,6.695402561350182E-5,6.656716454022188E-5,6.656825516826662E-5,6.647520605042056E-5,6.667291262725284E-5,6.644710368512652E-5,6.659650099705295E-5,7.388518249648106E-5,8.604983224696164E-5,6.633984340981058E-5,6.757804368932045E-5,6.854205933187955E-5,6.638821773157442E-5,6.620474934158321E-5,6.785614399856266E-5,6.667915937589775E-5,6.647228754368634E-5,6.652738125148857E-5,6.717107268419034E-5,6.674522154984368E-5,6.682122111025732E-5,6.68932134813947E-5,6.740658452868365E-5,6.705406706800446E-5,6.987289266353892E-5,6.63595656369887E-5,6.636134091077546E-5,6.652946699269848E-5,6.79435352389115E-5,6.66752958880028E-5,7.157028195670617E-5,6.686284365628963E-5,6.643179503991653E-5,6.673842156631591E-5,6.63652287211681E-5,6.640444568854135E-5,6.620441672356965E-5,6.622159320366155E-5,6.637064996185394E-5,6.707071968360563E-5,6.672990517165515E-5,6.646607378021922E-5,6.727370627058346E-5,6.649158382253824E-5,6.870076896863678E-5,0.9809433042628313,6.623805288977107E-5,6.63844430373924E-5,6.636141841150181E-5,6.822907818097367E-5,6.638543071134849E-5,6.621571423942111E-5,6.694252646518644E-5,6.640252983600281E-5,7.140862301182752E-5,6.634780552324146E-5,6.623728688468896E-5,6.655355048892002E-5,6.721370577553015E-5,6.654914759299231E-5,6.62250328385336E-5,6.63792276846504E-5,6.620521747770917E-5,6.773706898716329E-5,6.677554434818683E-5,6.663330266192514E-5,6.657502882722337E-5,6.681770539000015E-5,6.62028022063775E-5,6.657642454151599E-5,0.013812380876245754,6.6321441

{"value":"The movie has one nude scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. It is quite a long scene. What was the point? I almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have THAT staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.<br /><br />The movie is cold. None of the characters are even likeable. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl.<br /><br />I really would not recommend this movie. I had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, educated French family and he looks down on these characters.<br /><br

{"value":"When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really find anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, there's really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all it's English cosiness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another \"Full Monty\". Why they made this film? I haven't got a clue, apart from making money of course.","finished_norm":["when","you","get","your","hand","on","a","british","film","you","expect","some","sort","of","qualiti","and","when","it","come","to","act","camera","work","light","etc","thi","film","doe","the","busi","it","do","by","highli","skill","craftsman","that","alon","can","bring","you","a","enjoy","on","and","a","half","hour","but","when","you","look","under","the","layer","of","profession","you","do","not","realli","find","anyth","apart","from","make","you","feel","good","and","advoc","a","drug","liber","view","there","realli","noth","there","the","script","be","mediocr","the","plot","be","predict","and","the","end","must","be","on","of","the","wrong","east","of","hollywood","in","all","it","english","cosi","it","just","a","shame","and","cynic","attempt","to","make","anoth","full","monti","why","thei","make","thi","film","i","have","not","get","a","clue","apart","from","make","monei","of","cours"],"filtered":["get","hand","british","film","expect","sort","qualiti","come","act","camera","work","light","etc","thi","film","doe","busi","highli","skill","craftsman","alon","bring","enjoy","half","hour","look","layer","profession","realli","find","anyth","apart","make","feel","good","advoc","drug","liber","view","realli","noth","script","mediocr","plot","predict","end","must","wrong","east","hollywood","english","cosi","shame","cynic","attempt","make","anoth","full","monti","thei","make","thi","film","get","clue","apart","make","monei","cours"],"filtered2":["get","hand","british","expect","sort","qualiti","come","act","camera","work","light","etc","doe","busi","highli","skill","craftsman","alon","bring","enjoy","half","hour","look","layer","profession","realli","find","anyth","apart","make","feel","good","advoc","drug","liber","view","realli","noth","script","mediocr","plot","predict","end","must","wrong","east","hollywood","english","cosi","shame","cynic","attempt","make","anoth","full","monti","make","get","clue","apart","make","monei","cours"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,13,16,18,21,24,25,32,34,38,43,48,49,73,77,104,126,130,141,174,177,199,206,231,235,250,269,300,312,319,336,337,353,429,457,572,574,588,696,697,736,787,790,896,976,1038,1160,1887,2150,2582,4576,5068,7561],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,13,16,18,21,24,25,32,34,38,43,48,49,73,77,104,126,130,141,174,177,199,206,231,235,250,269,300,312,319,336,337,353,429,457,572,574,588,696,697,736,787,790,896,976,1038,1160,1887,2150,2582,4576,5068,7561],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,2.2635883139467947,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.0728240170322856,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.2657547357741192,2.456282578459816,2.458149992634611,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.7049353070058615,2.6457189377809835,2.6812935439488212,2.76533567167316,2.932274249550174,2.8824835850471584,2.9056060024680126,2.9233055795674137,2.973659465713028,3.0266839340212486,3.2872346624216657,3.3243163373261977,6.986785334740263,3.5039747767006686,3.6375061693251913,3.8095464139032247,3.7952092507568174,3.68099128126493,3.760240652919071,3.749984152751882,3.8844878351953436,4.058285512406398,4.165705761027235,4.2574141875167335,4.900964426937307,5.116075806554253,5.339219357868463,6.137727054086234,6.1754673820690815,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.48704176729816E-5,7.436554894333789E-5,7.494367017516671E-5,7.451064485049294E-5,7.451186562351919E-5,7.440771292569338E-5,7.462901188941978E-5,7.437625709646668E-5,7.454348203578105E-5,0.36735500280026007,0.490837900342328,7.42561974193596E-5,7.564215252076092E-5,7.672120444777577E-5,7.43103442638846E-5,7.410498253423384E-5,7.59534386258231E-5,7.463600406451041E-5,7.44044461526489E-5,0.07486060112080975,7.51866175398564E-5,7.470994945808298E-5,7.479501806952058E-5,7.487560131254756E-5,7.545023308551362E-5,7.505564960734259E-5,7.821084653205822E-5,7.4278273106E-5,7.42802602237562E-5,7.446844884297705E-5,7.605125828988196E-5,7.463167954541134E-5,8.011078581398145E-5,7.484160744683006E-5,7.435912166589422E-5,7.470233803042E-5,7.428461196776412E-5,7.432850870796996E-5,7.410461022480995E-5,7.412383637957784E-5,7.429068012677587E-5,7.507428938470822E-5,7.469280537175326E-5,7.439749089886753E-5,7.530149842382207E-5,7.442604506241771E-5,7.689885295452001E-5,7.576803290709397E-5,7.414226020511597E-5,7.430611913427966E-5,7.428034697266817E-5,7.63708751594379E-5,7.430722466767406E-5,7.41172558767183E-5,7.493079882993023E-5,7.43263642361561E-5,7.992983605726647E-5,7.426510965424606E

{"value":"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy. She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a \"dumb chick.\" I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says \"Watch my show or I'll kill my dog,\" is actually believable. I know she's a wanna be comedienne. She just comes across as a warped nut-case. I just don't ever want to see her around MY dog.","finished_norm":["and","when","i","watch","sarah","silverman","i","get","the","same","result","i","love","quirki","irrever","humor","but","thi","woman","be","so","darn","bore","annoi","and","yawnworthi","she","conjur","total","lack","in","anyth","whatsoev","humor","the","deadpan","wai","she","try","to","deliv","her","line","be","just","dead","on","arriv","becaus","she","just","not","funni","i","watch","two","segment","of","her","program","and","be","readi","for","novocainebr","br","geez","my","kid","ag","see","her","promo","on","comedi","central","and","sai","she","be","a","dumb","chick","i","think","that","be","a","complim","the","on","where","she","sai","watch","my","show","or","i","will","kill","my","dog","be","actual","believ","i","know","she","a","wanna","be","comedienn","she","just","come","across","a","a","warp","nutcas","i","just","do","not","ever","want","to","see","her","around","my","dog"],"filtered":["watch","sarah","silverman","get","result","love","quirki","irrever","humor","thi","woman","darn","bore","annoi","yawnworthi","conjur","total","lack","anyth","whatsoev","humor","deadpan","wai","try","deliv","line","dead","arriv","becaus","funni","watch","two","segment","program","readi","novocainebr","br","geez","kid","ag","see","promo","comedi","central","sai","dumb","chick","think","complim","sai","watch","show","kill","dog","actual","believ","know","wanna","comedienn","come","across","warp","nutcas","ever","want","see","around","dog"],"filtered2":["watch","sarah","silverman","get","result","love","quirki","irrever","humor","woman","darn","bore","annoi","yawnworthi","conjur","total","lack","anyth","whatsoev","humor","deadpan","wai","try","deliv","line","dead","arriv","becaus","funni","watch","two","segment","program","readi","novocainebr","geez","kid","ag","see","promo","comedi","central","dumb","chick","think","complim","watch","show","kill","dog","actual","believ","know","wanna","comedienn","come","across","warp","nutcas","ever","want","see","around","dog"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,12,22,26,28,33,34,36,37,39,44,47,52,54,62,70,76,91,98,104,107,108,114,127,183,184,228,271,369,420,442,447,503,517,609,992,1042,1101,1263,1334,1422,1532,2018,2242,2734,3466,4362,4957,5077,6134,6603,6883,7639,8194],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,12,22,26,28,33,34,36,37,39,44,47,52,54,62,70,76,91,98,104,107,108,114,127,183,184,228,271,369,420,442,447,503,517,609,992,1042,1101,1263,1334,1422,1532,2018,2242,2734,3466,4362,4957,5077,6134,6603,6883,7639,8194],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,2.8828493162168796,1.066728610262888,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,2.0226120445069267,2.094675786251684,2.1337665533324026,2.0105926690411424,2.0881990796736947,2.0728240170322856,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.4433074195966826,2.4359679371086367,2.4885128563647294,2.496249838866882,2.7742700004069256,2.757740698455715,6.243658221875298,3.3023374306074227,3.257696649984802,3.2070272508030975,3.3490645070153917,3.4198487640477615,7.36198256252986,4.004218291136122,4.176068548062782,4.229557233013768,4.390138803171316,4.383707912841026,4.671389985292807,4.869215728622727,5.00274712124725,5.444579873526289,5.274680836730892,5.626901430320244,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.437507212249236E-5,6.39409759615071E-5,6.443805607874483E-5,6.406573230424024E-5,6.406678194913408E-5,6.397722939095853E-5,6.416750663520663E-5,6.395018304424271E-5,6.409396636833289E-5,0.09255807251971948,0.4934260693944231,6.384695334935134E-5,0.05135886175590687,0.09453165277054419,6.389350988168866E-5,6.371693578782947E-5,6.530627504770994E-5,6.41735186462217E-5,6.397442055461324E-5,6.402744397479473E-5,6.464694704810178E-5,6.423709836425067E-5,6.431024204591911E-5,6.437952911874384E-5,6.487360892994698E-5,6.453433821856198E-5,6.724723920004714E-5,6.386593446317169E-5,6.386764302648478E-5,6.402945133891986E-5,6.53903823376718E-5,6.41698003388107E-5,0.08715598432117884,6.43503005178451E-5,6.393544966070836E-5,6.423055390757488E-5,6.387138474241313E-5,6.390912803147873E-5,6.371661566879234E-5,6.373314669851394E-5,6.387660226605162E-5,6.455036506934704E-5,6.422235753832434E-5,6.396844028927317E-5,6.474572391379376E-5,6.399299172621011E-5,6.611916106447199E-5,0.05243519936048987,0.12383935964786297,6.388987703133872E-5,6.386771761492223E-5,6.566519527005181E-5,6.38908275909083E-5,6.372748865145942E-5,6.44269890404717

trying to make several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, meaning that our lives are deterministic; 2) Science can't be used to explain everything we do, meaning that we have free will; 3) Science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough role to follow and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll

{"value":"The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester, who couldn't act or sing, in the title role. Aside from his very bad \"acting\", all of Lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl. I don't know why they cast him at all, since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well. Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.","finished_norm":["the","produc","make","a","big","mistak","cast","mark","lester","who","can","not","act","or","sing","in","the","titl","role","asid","from","hi","veri","bad","act","all","of","lester","sing","have","to","be","dub","by","a","girl","i","do","not","know","why","thei","cast","him","at","all","sinc","there","would","have","be","so","mani","boi","who","can","have","plai","the","part","infinit","well","and","do","their","own","sing","a","good","shani","walli","be","far","too","old","to","plai","nanci","who","be","onli","suppos","to","be","the","current","west","end","version","be","so","much","well","than","the","movi","in","everi","wai","ross","mccormack","be","the","well","art","dodger","of","all","time","and","he","be","certainli","far","well","look","than","jack","wild","ever","be","it","be","clearli","polit","to","award","thi","oldfashion","music","so","mani","oscar","after","the","tumultu","event","of"],"filtered":["produc","make","big","mistak","cast","mark","lester","act","sing","titl","role","asid","hi","veri","bad","act","lester","sing","dub","girl","know","thei","cast","sinc","mani","boi","plai","part","infinit","well","sing","good","shani","walli","far","old","plai","nanci","onli","suppos","current","west","end","version","much","well","movi","everi","wai","ross","mccormack","well","art","dodger","time","certainli","far","well","look","jack","wild","ever","clearli","polit","award","thi","oldfashion","music","mani","oscar","tumultu","event"],"filtered2":["produc","make","big","mistak","cast","mark","lester","act","sing","titl","role","asid","veri","bad","act","lester","sing","dub","girl","know","cast","sinc","mani","boi","plai","part","infinit","well","sing","good","shani","walli","far","old","plai","nanci","onli","suppos","current","west","end","version","well","everi","wai","ross","mccormack","well","art","dodger","time","certainli","far","well","look","jack","wild","ever","clearli","polit","award","oldfashion","music","mani","oscar","tumultu","event"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,11,15,16,20,21,24,26,33,40,44,50,61,67,82,84,85,92,101,118,128,149,162,220,261,264,282,382,389,470,494,575,593,659,717,777,936,949,979,1004,1090,1106,1359,3284,3743,4506,4836,5319,8142],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,11,15,16,20,21,24,26,33,40,44,50,61,67,82,84,85,92,101,118,128,149,162,220,261,264,282,382,389,470,494,575,593,659,717,777,936,949,979,1004,1090,1106,1359,3284,3743,4506,4836,5319,8142],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,4.661380160092228,2.324031090670098,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,3.2569937516641474,1.604729392502474,3.43598877114071,1.8818517047392527,1.9570915389266579,2.020196584395323,2.2212694515902225,2.011190219103739,4.0979070738271774,4.197164082437498,2.354379525480895,2.3409902041158843,2.3253197803590226,2.3586007221245198,2.8336934208777267,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,2.918851229218033,3.235085203598255,3.0914425013694116,3.3814747511661465,3.3243163373261977,3.6314455447135003,3.5227672760500357,11.407056414807592,3.7398317812878634,4.086456389373095,3.965503778955432,4.086456389373095,4.096025840389245,4.176068548062782,4.339813719283801,4.268777946167049,4.403125998698128,12.511020179485236,6.255510089742618,6.1754673820690815,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.905557852935406E-5,6.858992061945425E-5,6.912314184841032E-5,6.872374759841671E-5,6.872487355964682E-5,6.862880992026431E-5,6.883292161675333E-5,6.859979711984349E-5,6.875403447136099E-5,7.627884811111403E-5,0.569313609254282,6.848906192270743E-5,6.976737629996935E-5,7.076262325329461E-5,6.853900343219043E-5,6.834959119849938E-5,7.005448625262259E-5,6.883937074193613E-5,6.862579686237681E-5,6.86826754465168E-5,6.934722061466092E-5,6.890757313870968E-5,6.898603486444989E-5,6.906035957960381E-5,6.959036235983194E-5,6.922642435587634E-5,7.213657172492068E-5,6.850942309284332E-5,6.851125588035173E-5,6.868482875969238E-5,7.01447087156872E-5,6.883538208823913E-5,7.388895150804028E-5,6.902900586025067E-5,6.858399251893022E-5,6.890055285543844E-5,6.851526964452481E-5,6.855575712789518E-5,6.834924780462691E-5,6.836698075285475E-5,0.06597413669692216,6.924361646792338E-5,6.889176055429182E-5,6.86193817909959E-5,6.94531792315724E-5,6.864571828469614E-5,7.092647462195776E-5,6.988348013876046E-5,6.838397368505416E-5,6.853510644886514E-5,6.851133589187683E-5,7.043950242087699E-5,6.853612612059272E-5,6.83609113272244E-5,6.911127016104192E-5,6.855377920729116E-5,0.22586704044044767,6.849728198551998E-5,6.838318286362913E-5,6.870969249133918E-5,6.939123489450616E

accent,he's from London) the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché's and make's \"scary move\"which was a COMEDY look scary.

{"value":"I went into this movie hoping for the best. I like wartime musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. The love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. I did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of Spike Jones with \"Der Fuhrer's Face.\" The one complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy skits were interminable.<br /><br />There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.","finished_norm":["i","go","into","thi","movi","hope","for","the","well","i","like","wartim","music","in","gener","dick","powel","and","lucil","ball","do","good","job","with","their","role","howev","the","writer","give","them","bore","dialog","the","loveinterest","between","the","two","of","them","be","not","give","ani","real","growth","just","suddenli","it","be","there","i","do","not","think","much","of","the","music","the","well","numb","be","the","snippet","we","hear","of","spike","jone","with","der","fuhrer","face","the","on","complet","numb","that","spike","jone","do","have","littl","of","hi","great","music","comedi","pretti","tame","stuffeven","with","the","monkei","bert","lahr","comedi","skit","be","interminablebr","br","there","be","part","to","enjoi","lucil","ball","be","quit","a","looker","and","there","be","a","good","select","of","bite","player","who","realli","deserv","much","time","on","screen"],"filtered":["go","thi","movi","hope","well","like","wartim","music","gener","dick","powel","lucil","ball","good","job","role","howev","writer","give","bore","dialog","loveinterest","two","give","ani","real","growth","suddenli","think","much","music","well","numb","snippet","hear","spike","jone","der","fuhrer","face","complet","numb","spike","jone","littl","hi","great","music","comedi","pretti","tame","stuffeven","monkei","bert","lahr","comedi","skit","interminablebr","br","part","enjoi","lucil","ball","quit","looker","good","select","bite","player","realli","deserv","much","time","screen"],"filtered2":["go","hope","well","like","wartim","music","gener","dick","powel","lucil","ball","good","job","role","howev","writer","give","bore","dialog","loveinterest","two","give","ani","real","growth","suddenli","think","music","well","numb","snippet","hear","spike","jone","der","fuhrer","face","complet","numb","spike","jone","littl","great","music","comedi","pretti","tame","stuffeven","monkei","bert","lahr","comedi","skit","interminablebr","part","enjoi","lucil","ball","quit","looker","good","select","bite","player","realli","deserv","time","screen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,12,13,14,20,27,30,47,51,61,78,80,103,108,113,118,120,127,128,154,181,192,200,216,225,251,287,289,423,432,516,785,999,1195,1311,1583,1865,2088,2294,2301,2591,5005,5222,5393,5403,5613,6514,7780],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,12,13,14,20,27,30,47,51,61,78,80,103,108,113,118,120,127,128,154,181,192,200,216,225,251,287,289,423,432,516,785,999,1195,1311,1583,1865,2088,2294,2301,2591,5005,5222,5393,5403,5613,6514,7780],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.330690080046114,1.3002700588679295,2.6728839783437044,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,7.063138576442685,2.2044500422972613,4.871935874217273,2.3409902041158843,2.348499626138016,2.4442286541160034,2.5318267134339894,2.5308211829319704,2.6070186965339692,2.641219492619754,2.6942272927333892,2.841890188081905,2.8282659991423613,3.164467636384302,3.235085203598255,6.884198745965162,3.7952092507568174,4.1302590120314875,8.845857251988615,9.012620469866716,4.933754249760298,5.00274712124725,4.9676558014359795,5.116075806554253,5.322690055917252,11.003476574732474,6.725513718988353,6.725513718988353,6.389041482367141,13.737229125258052,6.600350576034347,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.200253372643984E-5,6.158443614651335E-5,6.206319641376603E-5,6.170459460370592E-5,6.170560556401689E-5,6.161935345857451E-5,6.180261804943071E-5,6.159330390291369E-5,6.173178810350982E-5,6.848804909530845E-5,0.5374784019410054,6.149387873059087E-5,6.264163148246282E-5,6.353522812018348E-5,6.153871942546325E-5,6.136865295642863E-5,6.289941723854061E-5,6.180840848823623E-5,6.16166481416795E-5,6.166771738773547E-5,6.226438872230525E-5,6.186964498058389E-5,6.194009295741712E-5,0.10770790164198049,6.248269699770204E-5,6.215593008262946E-5,6.476884730439138E-5,6.151216029690234E-5,6.151380589124422E-5,6.166965077060815E-5,6.298042476071594E-5,6.180482721876258E-5,6.634224642606E-5,6.197867507740131E-5,6.157911351711102E-5,6.186334171936206E-5,0.11567151409699727,6.155376196952845E-5,6.136834463535431E-5,6.138426641523049E-5,6.152243493871696E-5,6.217136626504551E-5,6.185544742667802E-5,6.161088827856456E-5,0.08562041047187664,6.163453487415701E-5,6.3682344402865E-5,6.27458769660823E-5,6.139952376118636E-5,6.153522046353716E-5,6.151387773073047E-5,6.324510948333544E-5,6.153613599030597E-5,6.137881689507062E-5,6.205253725034832E-5,6.155198606537167E-5,6.619239627506291E-5,6.150125923094469E-5,

{"value":"Here's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game; How much better his THE PROFESSIONALS was! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes. This film needed to be sped-up, if anything. That horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments- just lazy. sloppy work. Too bad. The actors did OK, but I've certainly seen all of them do better. Ben Johnson's always a joy, though. I first saw this flick almost 30 years ago; was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later.","finished_norm":["here","a","movi","with","a","good","cast","and","nice","look","locat","work","but","it","just","do","not","have","it","director","richard","brook","must","have","be","a","littl","bite","tire","at","thi","stage","of","the","game","how","much","well","hi","the","profession","be","the","hors","and","the","rest","of","the","action","seem","to","be","in","slow","motion","even","dure","the","nonslow","motion","scene","thi","film","ne","to","be","spedup","if","anyth","that","hors","lather","sure","look","aw","phoni","to","me","and","the","obviou","tire","track","in","that","desert","track","moment","just","lazi","sloppi","work","too","bad","the","actor","do","okai","but","i","have","certainli","see","all","of","them","do","well","ben","johnson","alwai","a","joi","though","i","see","thi","flick","almost","year","ago","be","disappoint","then","and","remain","so","upon","view","year","late"],"filtered":["movi","good","cast","nice","look","locat","work","director","richard","brook","must","littl","bite","tire","thi","stage","game","much","well","hi","profession","hors","rest","action","seem","slow","motion","even","dure","nonslow","motion","scene","thi","film","ne","spedup","anyth","hors","lather","sure","look","aw","phoni","obviou","tire","track","desert","track","moment","lazi","sloppi","work","bad","actor","okai","certainli","see","well","ben","johnson","alwai","joi","though","see","thi","flick","almost","year","ago","disappoint","remain","upon","view","year","late"],"filtered2":["good","cast","nice","look","locat","work","director","richard","brook","must","littl","bite","tire","stage","game","well","profession","hors","rest","action","seem","slow","motion","even","dure","nonslow","motion","scene","ne","spedup","anyth","hors","lather","sure","look","aw","phoni","obviou","tire","track","desert","track","moment","lazi","sloppi","work","bad","actor","okai","certainli","see","well","ben","johnson","alwai","joi","though","see","flick","almost","year","ago","disappoint","remain","upon","view","year","late"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,14,16,19,20,35,41,48,57,58,86,92,104,110,119,129,131,138,141,150,154,187,188,191,197,226,239,257,262,312,374,383,389,390,610,630,641,669,682,775,854,867,900,1021,1126,1160,1187,1531,2001,2144,2184,2359,2677],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,14,16,19,20,35,41,48,57,58,86,92,104,110,119,129,131,138,141,150,154,187,188,191,197,226,239,257,262,312,374,383,389,390,610,630,641,669,682,775,854,867,900,1021,1126,1160,1187,1531,2001,2144,2184,2359,2677],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,3.3910232448024944,3.668325173349496,1.865701314626681,2.031112399272319,2.0489535369135887,2.0728240170322856,2.1290479736304078,2.1653408989309972,2.4106958340079214,2.2512118082053005,2.2907365189289424,2.2657547357741192,2.332712011146513,2.348499626138016,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,2.5460113484259455,2.558331832813986,2.5940874818617203,2.6593400337329487,2.7602659523229094,2.726701583487816,2.8824835850471584,3.4572130107926293,3.0433232530252132,3.0914425013694116,3.132778125427319,3.477726550625732,3.558633189238533,3.7034641371169887,3.7099788181381825,3.6497387377608255,3.753391311073496,4.291900363587903,7.768975670390687,7.8402703478511615,8.153955290837102,8.913660355339978,4.2574141875167335,4.436351646326448,4.605250182788262,4.956227105612356,5.3064295350454715,5.0768550934009715,5.390512652256013,5.290429193699031]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.752457496226892E-5,6.706924096734137E-5,6.759064036204506E-5,6.720010092196594E-5,6.720120191996069E-5,6.710726806904269E-5,6.730685448687843E-5,6.707889849979712E-5,6.722971631678345E-5,0.3887725455318267,0.6059580974699338,6.697061836835492E-5,6.822059174966658E-5,6.919377348149747E-5,6.701945264463835E-5,6.683423979369967E-5,6.850133630257921E-5,6.73131606310904E-5,6.710432181245455E-5,6.715993936429181E-5,6.780975116773774E-5,6.737985093984778E-5,6.745657312209931E-5,6.752925001376892E-5,6.804750231468204E-5,6.769163303441425E-5,7.053726069197927E-5,6.699052811914467E-5,6.699232027265547E-5,6.716204493722361E-5,6.858955847955941E-5,6.730926040823662E-5,7.22507891649516E-5,6.749859142516688E-5,6.706344429635919E-5,6.737298630046454E-5,6.699624504927102E-5,6.703583490086735E-5,6.683390401307516E-5,6.685124381121188E-5,6.700171783639854E-5,6.770844398703245E-5,6.736438892990433E-5,6.709804896705127E-5,6.791336061860195E-5,6.71238015649004E-5,6.93539921671068E-5,6.833412149676043E-5,6.686785999991907E-5,6.701564205976918E-5,6.69923985102771E-5,6.887781643160931E-5,6.701663912

{"value":"This is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is simultaneously bland and offensive, with nudity and lots and lots of violence. However, the nudity is not that exciting, and the violence is repetitive and boring. Also, the plot is flimsy at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. <br /><br />I have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's not. I did not laugh once while watching it, nor did I even crack a smile. The makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie, and they failed on both counts. <br /><br />Some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.","finished_norm":["thi","be","truli","a","aw","movi","and","a","wast","of","hour","of","your","life","it","be","simultan","bland","and","offens","with","nuditi","and","lot","and","lot","of","violenc","howev","the","nuditi","be","not","that","excit","and","the","violenc","be","repetit","and","bore","conjur","the","plot","be","flimsi","at","well","the","charact","be","unrealist","and","undevelop","and","the","act","be","some","of","the","wrong","i","have","ever","see","br","br","i","have","hear","that","thi","movi","be","suppos","to","be","funni","but","it","not","i","do","not","laugh","onc","while","watch","it","nor","do","i","even","crack","a","smile","the","maker","of","thi","film","try","to","combin","a","comedi","movi","with","a","action","movi","and","thei","fail","on","both","count","br","br","some","poorli","make","movi","be","funni","becaus","thei","be","so","bad","but","thi","be","not","on","of","them"],"filtered":["thi","truli","aw","movi","wast","hour","life","simultan","bland","offens","nuditi","lot","lot","violenc","howev","nuditi","excit","violenc","repetit","bore","conjur","plot","flimsi","well","charact","unrealist","undevelop","act","wrong","ever","see","br","br","hear","thi","movi","suppos","funni","laugh","onc","watch","even","crack","smile","maker","thi","film","try","combin","comedi","movi","action","movi","thei","fail","count","br","br","poorli","make","movi","funni","becaus","thei","bad","thi"],"filtered2":["truli","aw","wast","hour","life","simultan","bland","offens","nuditi","lot","lot","violenc","howev","nuditi","excit","violenc","repetit","bore","conjur","plot","flimsi","well","charact","unrealist","undevelop","act","wrong","ever","see","hear","suppos","funni","laugh","onc","watch","even","crack","smile","maker","try","combin","comedi","action","fail","count","poorli","make","funni","becaus","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,10,20,21,22,25,32,36,39,44,62,72,75,89,108,113,127,129,133,138,149,174,215,216,236,343,398,452,524,612,762,884,968,1028,1145,1264,1303,1835,1926,2883,4075,5072],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,10,20,21,22,25,32,36,39,44,62,72,75,89,108,113,127,129,133,138,149,174,215,216,236,343,398,452,524,612,762,884,968,1028,1145,1264,1303,1835,1926,2883,4075,5072],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,4.045224089013853,3.841892750832105,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,2.4359679371086367,2.4106958340079214,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.3253197803590226,2.456282578459816,2.605934685587711,2.6070186965339692,2.617923930016232,2.9705344631698933,3.143848349181566,6.83481352078442,3.4028786598293,7.185844525434329,3.749984152751882,3.9323057095458362,3.9911462095687695,4.086456389373095,4.2574141875167335,4.327618446189983,4.390138803171316,4.828393734102471,4.828393734102471,5.408212229355414,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.168601308861727E-5,9.106775286792064E-5,9.17757178088908E-5,9.124543673367156E-5,9.124693168742156E-5,9.111938671154361E-5,9.139038853463131E-5,9.10808660292791E-5,9.128564901902664E-5,1.0127644449937344E-4,0.8824949292157429,9.0933841430395E-5,9.263107648686743E-5,9.395247914733746E-5,9.100014943895333E-5,9.074866428877158E-5,9.301227620219017E-5,9.139895112419342E-5,9.111538623438022E-5,9.119090468952871E-5,9.207323017694085E-5,9.148950435648003E-5,9.159367903673579E-5,9.169236095283204E-5,9.239605271647923E-5,9.191284737225157E-5,9.577668886703512E-5,9.096087522768316E-5,9.096330864411473E-5,9.119376367216566E-5,9.31320657703264E-5,9.139365533545547E-5,9.810334688877678E-5,9.165073220126394E-5,9.105988204975051E-5,9.148018343270239E-5,9.096863777236685E-5,9.102239354430123E-5,9.074820836014486E-5,9.077175263213479E-5,9.097606881554608E-5,9.193567356882735E-5,9.146850977714587E-5,9.11068688585053E-5,9.221391284652224E-5,9.114183617262437E-5,0.1103431420669811,9.27852291029159E-5,9.079431437496905E-5,9.099497536219112E-5,9.096341487648429E-5,9.352346730642365E-5,9.09963291939503E-5,9.076369417473516E-5,9.17599556111564E-5,9.101976743272198E-5,9.788175654270692E-5,9.094475531747945E-5,9.079326439081033E-5,9.122677558045386E-5,9.213166852361636E-5,9.122074041034273E-5,9.077646743391841E-5,9.098782653525894E-5,9.074930597578889E-5,9.28490568207692E-5,9.153106864717678E-5,9.133609406963052E-5,9.125621652738829E-5,9.158885994262964E-5,9.074599529718312E-5,9.125812967121925E-5,9.273827595326945E-5,9.090861716132483E-5,9.315855806967347E-5,9.114897030925675E-5,9.186234785583404E-5,9.13

{"value":"I was expecting a B-Movie French musical. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were superstars of low budget French films of that time. And it is in color! But I have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity. Musical numbers are awful, and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? This is just a succession of bad numbers, one after another. The only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women. It was not familiar at that time. In fact, some numbers are just there to show us topless women. It adds to the mediocrity!

{"value":"Everyone involved (and the audience) should seek out \"The Candidate\" to see how good this movie could have been. What happened the South American story? What were Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut-outs. Up to now I have liked every Gene Hackman performance and/or movie. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or dreadfully miscast. I have also liked and defended Richard Gere (and been vilified for it). But here he had no \"power\". He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive. All in all I was very disappointed. I really expected much more from this director and cast.

{"value":"While watching the film, I'm not sure what direstion it was to take. There's a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well, you can't do it all. I felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats. Ms. McTeer is the film. To add to her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my view, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt this film didn't have that. Everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted. Watch the film for the sweetness, but most of all for Ms. McTeer's brilliant performance.","finished_norm":["while","watch","the","film","i","be","not","sure","what","direst","it","be","to","take","there","a","reason","a","writer","should","not","direct","hi","work","and","even","act","in","it","a","good","you","ca","not","do","it","all","i","feel","the","stori","realli","suffer","in","thi","film","due","to","the","director","wear","so","mani","hat","m","mcteer","be","the","film","to","add","to","her","amaz","talent","her","portray","of","thi","woman","be","why","i","be","engag","here","be","a","british","actress","who","can","do","anyth","in","my","view","conflict","be","what","make","drama","and","a","great","stori","i","feel","thi","film","do","not","have","that","everyth","be","somewhat","easi","for","the","charact","there","be","no","real","obstacl","prevent","the","chahract","from","get","what","thei","want","watch","the","film","for","the","sweet","but","much","of","all","for","m","mcteer","brilliant","perform"],"filtered":["watch","film","sure","direst","take","reason","writer","direct","hi","work","even","act","good","ca","feel","stori","realli","suffer","thi","film","due","director","wear","mani","hat","m","mcteer","film","add","amaz","talent","portray","thi","woman","engag","british","actress","anyth","view","conflict","make","drama","great","stori","feel","thi","film","everyth","somewhat","easi","charact","real","obstacl","prevent","chahract","get","thei","want","watch","film","sweet","much","m","mcteer","brilliant","perform"],"filtered2":["watch","sure","direst","take","reason","writer","direct","work","even","act","good","ca","feel","stori","realli","suffer","due","director","wear","mani","hat","m","mcteer","add","amaz","talent","portray","woman","engag","british","actress","anyth","view","conflict","make","drama","great","stori","feel","everyth","somewhat","easi","charact","real","obstacl","prevent","chahract","get","want","watch","sweet","m","mcteer","brilliant","perform"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,7,10,13,17,21,31,37,43,48,50,51,58,70,80,81,95,102,104,105,119,193,276,287,299,312,354,463,514,568,596,633,685,696,744,912,943,1221,1331,1388,1423,1651,1731,5126],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,7,10,13,17,21,31,37,43,48,50,51,58,70,80,81,95,102,104,105,119,193,276,287,299,312,354,463,514,568,596,633,685,696,744,912,943,1221,1331,1388,1423,1651,1731,5126],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,3.321622407243643,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,2.094675786251684,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.1653408989309972,2.517840471459249,2.7884729505849193,2.841890188081905,2.7949961309240425,2.8824835850471584,3.0316467233633775,3.3467891931782563,3.405285399859865,3.4471119148061256,3.485528930909917,3.550241531602284,3.607563812710113,3.8095464139032247,3.700222643192818,3.9405024767500145,3.9911462095687695,8.94143857966131,4.513582994262438,4.443131333311827,4.484804029712395,4.646072177308517,4.760735085628657,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.048366297387898965,9.235784794581966E-5,9.307584214585144E-5,9.253804893836256E-5,9.253956507010821E-5,9.241021325107877E-5,9.268505417315659E-5,9.237114687243961E-5,9.257883088388574E-5,1.0271115918641806E-4,0.8914969794261709,9.222203947579915E-5,9.39433181099754E-5,9.528344018554584E-5,9.228928682493384E-5,9.203423905522765E-5,9.432991802307341E-5,9.269373806311648E-5,9.240615610186919E-5,9.248274437574285E-5,9.337756916979831E-5,9.278557410161695E-5,9.289122455389966E-5,9.299130442975909E-5,9.370496491726352E-5,9.321491433071274E-5,9.713349224686635E-5,9.224945624255477E-5,9.225192413154618E-5,9.248564385964738E-5,9.445140456876062E-5,9.268836725253194E-5,9.949311045448364E-5,9.294908595190692E-5,9.23498656271078E-5,9.277612113463511E-5,9.225732875394317E-5,9.231184604743264E-5,9.203377666776935E-5,9.205765447548901E-5,9.226486506767019E-5,9.323806389053096E-5,9.27642821063193E-5,9.239751806610812E-5,9.352024479532577E-5,9.243298073844578E-5,9.550406968410825E-5,9.409965450156404E-5,9.208053583522894E-5,9.228403945053604E-5,0.05296306911172746,9.484835082490749E-5,9.228541246111137E-5,9.204948185938997E-5,9.305985665575422E-5,9.230918273351208E-5,9.926838098829966E-5,9.223310797251835E-5,9.207947097665694E-5,9.251912342524626E-5,9.343683537288879E-5,9.251300275897419E-5,9.206243606867115E-5,9.22767893510222E-5,9.203488983258963E-5,9.41643864233978E-5,9.282772720542433E-5,9.262999055530148E-5,9.254898144210424E-5,9.28863371909564E-5,9.20315322538459E-5,9.2550921688146
