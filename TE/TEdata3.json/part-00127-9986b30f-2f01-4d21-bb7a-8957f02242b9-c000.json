{"value":"Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. One of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust.<br /><br />Avoid this like a leprous prostitute.","finished_norm":["do","not","get","me","wrong","i","assum","thi","movi","would","be","stupid","i","honestli","do","i","give","it","a","incredibli","low","standard","to","meet","the","onli","reason","i","even","see","it","be","becaus","there","be","a","bunch","of","girl","go","differ","stori","for","a","differ","time","a","i","begin","watch","i","notic","someth","thi","film","be","terribl","now","there","be","two","typ","of","terribl","there","freddi","v","jason","terribl","where","you","and","your","friend","sit","back","and","laugh","and","joke","about","how","terribl","it","be","and","then","there","be","a","movi","like","thi","the","cat","in","the","hat","fail","to","creat","even","a","momentari","interest","in","me","a","i","watch","the","bite","of","it","not","onli","be","i","bore","senseless","but","i","feel","a","though","i","have","in","some","wai","be","violat","by","the","horrend","of","sai","movi","mike","myer","be","usual","brilliant","i","love","the","major","of","hi","work","but","someth","in","thi","movi","do","not","click","on","of","the","thing","that","the","directorproducerswriterswhatev","chang","be","that","thei","refus","to","us","ani","of","the","color","of","the","origin","book","red","black","white","on","ani","charact","but","the","cat","coincident","or","not","thei","conjur","refus","to","captur","ani","of","the","origin","and","i","hate","to","us","thi","word","but","it","fit","zani","of","the","origin","the","book","be","like","a","ic","cream","sundai","color","and","delici","and","the","movi","be","about","a","bland","and","hard","to","swallow","a","sawdustbr","br","avoid","thi","like","a","leprou","prostitut"],"filtered":["get","wrong","assum","thi","movi","stupid","honestli","give","incredibli","low","standard","meet","onli","reason","even","see","becaus","bunch","girl","go","differ","stori","differ","time","begin","watch","notic","someth","thi","film","terribl","two","typ","terribl","freddi","v","jason","terribl","friend","sit","back","laugh","joke","terribl","movi","like","thi","cat","hat","fail","creat","even","momentari","interest","watch","bite","onli","bore","senseless","feel","though","wai","violat","horrend","sai","movi","mike","myer","usual","brilliant","love","major","hi","work","someth","thi","movi","click","thing","directorproducerswriterswhatev","chang","thei","refus","us","ani","color","origin","book","red","black","white","ani","charact","cat","coincident","thei","conjur","refus","captur","ani","origin","hate","us","thi","word","fit","zani","origin","book","like","ic","cream","sundai","color","delici","movi","bland","hard","swallow","sawdustbr","br","avoid","thi","like","leprou","prostitut"],"filtered2":["get","wrong","assum","stupid","honestli","give","incredibli","low","standard","meet","onli","reason","even","see","becaus","bunch","girl","go","differ","stori","differ","time","begin","watch","notic","someth","terribl","two","typ","terribl","freddi","v","jason","terribl","friend","sit","back","laugh","joke","terribl","like","cat","hat","fail","creat","even","momentari","interest","watch","bite","onli","bore","senseless","feel","though","wai","violat","horrend","mike","myer","usual","brilliant","love","major","work","someth","click","thing","directorproducerswriterswhatev","chang","refus","us","ani","color","origin","book","red","black","white","ani","charact","cat","coincident","conjur","refus","captur","ani","origin","hate","us","word","fit","zani","origin","book","like","ic","cream","sundai","color","delici","bland","hard","swallow","sawdustbr","avoid","like","leprou","prostitut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,17,22,25,27,29,30,33,39,43,47,48,53,54,56,60,63,69,84,86,95,108,133,136,147,151,154,161,166,171,204,214,215,217,229,244,258,265,278,335,339,350,359,362,384,404,419,616,676,687,688,757,779,792,875,912,920,924,1028,1136,1327,1339,1417,1544,1686,1731,1978,2217,2397,2731,2927,3039,4385,4490,4772,5741,6357,6689],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,17,22,25,27,29,30,33,39,43,47,48,53,54,56,60,63,69,84,86,95,108,133,136,147,151,154,161,166,171,204,214,215,217,229,244,258,265,278,335,339,350,359,362,384,404,419,616,676,687,688,757,779,792,875,912,920,924,1028,1136,1327,1339,1417,1544,1686,1731,1978,2217,2397,2731,2927,3039,4385,4490,4772,5741,6357,6689],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,3.9008101766037884,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891

{"value":"I'm a big fan of horror flicks, and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen. So needless to say I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long while. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's \"Return of the Living Dead\", but whereas that film was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite. It has some of the most laughable acting I've ever witnessed, especially from the main scientist character. His scenes with the General were just hysterical. Also, the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just downright stupid. This, of course, makes it all the more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens its eyes and somehow FLIES OUT OF THE FRIDGE (obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string), latching onto the guys neck, killing him. Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies every law of physics known to man, and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed. That's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess. I can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here.

{"value":"There was a great film to be made about Steve Biko. Sadly this wasn't it. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. Attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable. The Soweto massacre wasn't like this, three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels!) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers. With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce. If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all. at all. The Wood's family dog gets more lines than the black maid. As the family make their escape one the women I saw the film with - incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large, full cinema - whispered \"This is like the sound of music.\" She had a point.<br /><br />Overall this is a film by a well-intentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black people's struggle. And really South Africa needs well-intentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head.","finished_norm":["there","be","a","great","film","to","be","make","about","steve","biko","sadli","thi","be","not","it","denzel","washington","never","the","much","flexibl","of","actor","be","total","unabl","to","convei","the","great","charisma","that","biko","have","attenborough","big","crowd","scene","be","laughabl","the","soweto","massacr","be","not","like","thi","three","neat","line","of","child","some","do","cartwheel","march","happili","into","the","gun","of","the","soldier","with","biko","dead","the","film","rapidli","descend","into","farc","if","the","struggl","against","apartheid","be","anyth","it","be","a","black","peopl","struggl","yet","somehow","we","be","all","suppos","to","be","grip","by","the","escap","of","a","white","man","and","hi","famili","i","be","sure","donald","wood","be","a","decent","man","and","he","would","be","the","to","sai","that","biko","be","import","while","he","be","not","penelop","wilton","accent","be","pure","hampshir","and","she","seem","complet","unawar","that","she","be","in","south","africa","at","all","at","all","the","wood","famili","dog","get","much","line","than","the","black","maid","a","the","famili","make","their","escap","on","the","woman","i","see","the","film","with","incident","on","of","onli","about","a","dozen","black","peopl","in","a","larg","full","cinema","whisper","thi","be","like","the","sound","of","music","she","have","a","pointbr","br","overal","thi","be","a","film","by","a","wellintent","if","somewhat","inept","white","liber","about","a","radic","black","peopl","struggl","and","realli","south","africa","ne","wellintent","white","liber","like","it","ne","a","hole","in","the","head"],"filtered":["great","film","make","steve","biko","sadli","thi","denzel","washington","never","much","flexibl","actor","total","unabl","convei","great","charisma","biko","attenborough","big","crowd","scene","laughabl","soweto","massacr","like","thi","three","neat","line","child","cartwheel","march","happili","gun","soldier","biko","dead","film","rapidli","descend","farc","struggl","apartheid","anyth","black","peopl","struggl","yet","somehow","suppos","grip","escap","white","man","hi","famili","sure","donald","wood","decent","man","sai","biko","import","penelop","wilton","accent","pure","hampshir","seem","complet","unawar","south","africa","wood","famili","dog","get","much","line","black","maid","famili","make","escap","woman","see","film","incident","onli","dozen","black","peopl","larg","full","cinema","whisper","thi","like","sound","music","pointbr","br","overal","thi","film","wellintent","somewhat","inept","white","liber","radic","black","peopl","struggl","realli","south","africa","ne","wellintent","white","liber","like","ne","hole","head"],"filtered2":["great","make","steve","biko","sadli","denzel","washington","never","flexibl","actor","total","unabl","convei","great","charisma","biko","attenborough","big","crowd","scene","laughabl","soweto","massacr","like","three","neat","line","child","cartwheel","march","happili","gun","soldier","biko","dead","rapidli","descend","farc","struggl","apartheid","anyth","black","peopl","struggl","yet","somehow","suppos","grip","escap","white","man","famili","sure","donald","wood","decent","man","biko","import","penelop","wilton","accent","pure","hampshir","seem","complet","unawar","south","africa","wood","famili","dog","get","line","black","maid","famili","make","escap","woman","see","incident","onli","dozen","black","peopl","larg","full","cinema","whisper","like","sound","music","pointbr","overal","wellintent","somewhat","inept","white","liber","radic","black","peopl","struggl","realli","south","africa","ne","wellintent","white","liber","like","ne","hole","head"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,11,13,19,23,35,41,42,45,51,70,82,103,104,107,110,118,119,149,178,180,182,184,194,208,224,228,229,309,336,359,409,412,501,549,552,559,564,596,600,609,638,655,657,705,725,810,842,1105,1299,1323,1414,1500,1613,1720,1887,2025,2156,2411,2623,2639,2671,2756,2793,2962,2996,3187,3191,3228,3498,3609,3822,4008,4120,4868,5446,5502],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,11,13,19,23,35,41,42,45,51,70,82,103,104,107,110,118,119,149,178,180,182,184,194,208,224,228,229,309,336,359,409,412,501,549,552,559,564,596,600,609,638,655,657,705,725,810,842,1105,1299,1323,1414,1500,1613,1720,1887,2025,2156,2411,2623,2639,2671,2756,2793,2962,2996,3187,3191,3228,3498,3609,3822,4008,4120,4868,5446,5502],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,4.094543182127343,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.621

{"value":"It has its merit's; Morvern Callar is both the merits and the disappointments. She's so enigmatic, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un-relatable? Or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary? Personally I'd call her dysfunctional.<br /><br />Morvern is completely detaching herself. Disposing of her boyfriend, not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she selfishly splashes out on a trip to Spain. She's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed. The only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her. Although by the end her friend is dumped and Morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity. She may as well have killed herself.<br /><br />Despite managing to make Spain look as gloomy and bland as the UK the director's shots were superb, the lighting and color made the film visually stunning.<br /><br />It's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest.

{"value":"The fourth \"Tremors\" feature goes back in time, to the year 1889. \"The Legend Begins\" in the small city of \"Perfection\", which was then \"Rejection, Nevada\". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly \"Graboids\". Some of the characters in the present-day \"Tremors\" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is inept with firearms; so, he hires gunslinger Billy Drago (as \"Black Hand\" Kelly) to shoot 'em up some \"Dirt Dragons\".<br /><br />This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster \"Graboids\". These tamer \"Dirt Dragons\" are nowhere near as terrorizing as their \"Tremors\" (1990) counterparts. Consequently, in this film, the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. And, it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave town. Why so helpless? Why didn't Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately rally the people to fight without Gross? Disappointing.<br /><br />**** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.

{"value":"The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one. There are a few things that derail this film.<br /><br />First, Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed, takes away from the character, which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle.<br /><br />Second, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, totally derails the movie as the comic foil. To me, his character is unnecessary to the film's plot.<br /><br />Also, while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan, it's apparent that he was not in his best shape. Although in his later Jungle Jim movies, his physique had improved somewhat from this film.<br /><br />The octopus battle is a terrific idea, but I think it should have been done in an earlier Weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak. Likewise, the battle, which takes only 30 seconds tops, would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate.<br /><br />And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye, it doesn't manage to salvage this last Weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great

{"value":"What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth who specialized in slippery, shifting alliances didn't get hold of this concept first. He could have helped bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the movie stands, it's pretty much of a mess (as asserted by reviewer Chipe). The main problems are with the direction, cheap budget, and poor script. The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept-- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces. What was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole, instead of the sprawling, awkward mess that it is, (try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can). Also, a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots, and gotten the locations out of the all-too-obvious LA outskirts. The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast-- Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were capped), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely deaths. Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this lowly obscure Western, which, in the right hands, could have been so much more.","finished_norm":["what","a","shame","that","a","realli","compet","director","like","andr","de","toth","who","special","in","slipperi","shift","allianc","do","not","get","hold","of","thi","concept","he","can","have","help","bring","out","the","real","potenti","especi","with","the","interest","charact","plai","by","william","bishop","a","the","movi","stand","it","pretti","much","of","a","mess","a","assert","by","review","chipe","the","main","problem","be","with","the","direct","cheap","budget","and","poor","script","the","strength","lie","in","a","excel","cast","and","a","interest","gener","concept","charact","pull","in","differ","direct","by","conflict","forc","what","be","ne","be","someon","with","vision","enough","to","pull","togeth","the","posit","elem","by","rework","the","script","into","some","kind","of","coher","whole","instead","of","the","sprawl","awkward","mess","that","it","be","try","to","figur","out","the","motiv","and","interplai","if","you","can","conjur","a","big","budget","can","have","match","up","contrast","locat","and","studio","shot","and","get","the","locat","out","of","the","alltooobvi","la","outskirt","the","real","shame","lie","in","a","wast","of","a","excel","cast","hayden","taylor","befor","hi","tooth","be","cap","dehner","reev","along","with","jame","millican","and","william","bishop","shortli","befor","their","untim","death","few","film","illustr","the","import","of","a","auteurwithvis","much","than","thi","lowli","obscur","western","which","in","the","right","hand","can","have","be","so","much","much"],"filtered":["shame","realli","compet","director","like","andr","de","toth","special","slipperi","shift","allianc","get","hold","thi","concept","help","bring","real","potenti","especi","interest","charact","plai","william","bishop","movi","stand","pretti","much","mess","assert","review","chipe","main","problem","direct","cheap","budget","poor","script","strength","lie","excel","cast","interest","gener","concept","charact","pull","differ","direct","conflict","forc","ne","someon","vision","enough","pull","togeth","posit","elem","rework","script","kind","coher","whole","instead","sprawl","awkward","mess","try","figur","motiv","interplai","conjur","big","budget","match","contrast","locat","studio","shot","get","locat","alltooobvi","la","outskirt","real","shame","lie","wast","excel","cast","hayden","taylor","befor","hi","tooth","cap","dehner","reev","along","jame","millican","william","bishop","shortli","befor","untim","death","film","illustr","import","auteurwithvis","much","thi","lowli","obscur","western","right","hand","much","much"],"filtered2":["shame","realli","compet","director","like","andr","de","toth","special","slipperi","shift","allianc","get","hold","concept","help","bring","real","potenti","especi","interest","charact","plai","william","bishop","stand","pretti","mess","assert","review","chipe","main","problem","direct","cheap","budget","poor","script","strength","lie","excel","cast","interest","gener","concept","charact","pull","differ","direct","conflict","forc","ne","someon","vision","enough","pull","togeth","posit","elem","rework","script","kind","coher","whole","instead","sprawl","awkward","mess","try","figur","motiv","interplai","conjur","big","budget","match","contrast","locat","studio","shot","get","locat","alltooobvi","la","outskirt","real","shame","lie","wast","excel","cast","hayden","taylor","befor","tooth","cap","dehner","reev","along","jame","millican","william","bishop","shortli","befor","untim","death","illustr","import","auteurwithvis","lowli","obscur","western","right","hand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,10,13,36,39,40,58,60,77,78,79,80,82,89,92,93,102,110,111,121,122,139,146,152,167,176,179,185,203,204,225,235,245,250,256,267,270,324,338,351,377,407,414,415,441,479,509,544,547,574,580,600,620,650,719,726,750,766,770,775,902,919,932,1212,1331,1360,1509,1516,1615,1850,2085,2221,2383,2817,2981,2983,3722,3761,4596,5079,5322,5759,5935,7145,8214,8258,8438],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,10,13,36,39,40,58,60,77,78,79,80,82,89,92,93,102,110,111,121,122,139,146,152,167,176,179,185,203,204,225,235,245,250,256,267,270,324,338,351,377,407,414,415,441,479,509,544,547,574,580,600,620,650,719,726,750,766,770,775,902,919,932,1212,1331,1360,1509,1516,1615,1850,2085,2221,2383,2817,2981,2983,3722,3761,4596,5079,5322,5759,5935,7145,8214,8258,8438],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.865701314626681,3.676353282473182,3.8927804517536475,2.0064197866819473,3.89390121390

{"value":"Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan's Black Wedding/Criminally Insane, and it's a good thing too, because when I've seen a movie and know there's a sequel (especially something that's as obscure as this) I'm always curious. I've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again. Most of CI2 is nothing but \"flashbacks\" to CI, and footage of Ethel asleep, recalling fond memories, I guess. Thanks to Proposition 13 she's released from Napa State (wonder if she got to see The Cramps play while she was there?) and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that Ethel promptly takes to calling \"granny\". This is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic, and it's even complete with a couple of \"rolls\". Of course Ethel does her thing, which is to dispatch anyone between her and food, especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert. Also, you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. Guess that's all a matter of misguided \"trust\". If you liked or disliked Criminally Insane, either way there's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity.

{"value":"This movie was a complete waste of time.<br /><br />I viewed this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts, who have varied taste in movies yet always a keen eye for a work of \"genius\" (as one of my fellow commenters on this site had the gall to label this steaming pile); not one of them found a single redeeming quality. We ended the movie with a rousing chorus of expletives I will not reprint here.<br /><br />I can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, himself. Afterall, as one of those reviewers will tell you, he financed the film himself  because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world, for that matter, would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film. Don't let the semi-famous actors who appear in the film lure you into its clutches  as Christian Slater admits in the special features \"making of\" he signed on to the film without reading the

{"value":"I had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying SS new movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this. A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me. I bought this film thinking I'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up.<br /><br />Did i hell. Segal is old and bloated, the plot was ludicrous even by SS standards and to cap it all off Segal's acting (such as it was to start with) is exceptionally dire. So dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded NOTHING LIKE HIM. Either SS cant act no more (a moot point) of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn't record the sound properly. The voice would flick back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who does voice overs for Honda adverts!<br /><br />Plot wise isn't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one, nothing new there.

{"value":"In what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 I've had to endure in a long time, Al Pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure. Not his usual typecasting, which was nice. But his character was just truely pathetic. Someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the Hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy. But in this movie we needed someone to like. And for some reason, every character in the picture said \"I don't know why I like you, Eli\" to Al Pacino's chracter and I couldn't even come close to liking him.<br /><br />All the other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on TV or in earlier films. And Kim Basinger wasn't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind.<br /><br />The movie's story had no momentum. Most scenes never driving the story forward, but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti-climactic ending. It had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story.<br /><br />Whats the point of the film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have you believe \"Once Hollywood has you, you can't get out.\" Yeah right!

{"value":"Being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of Edward D. Wood Jr. I purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant Ed Wood actually was. <br /><br />What I got was a disappointing self-centered, conflictive, contradictory compilation of bitter self-aggrandizing has-beens. <br /><br />Where people DO remember Ed Wood Jr., do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the duct tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /><br />It appears as though, the very minute there is a renewed interest in Ed Wood, these people come out of the \"Wood\"work! Only to take mean spirited swipes at someone who actually gave them a chance when no-one else would! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didn't get the $75 they were promised!<br /><br />Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain. In-fact that was ALL he lived for. You may giggle when you see Ed's films, but somehow you are aware that you are laughing WITH him, and not AT him. <br /><br />But, I digress...

{"value":"Nell Shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in 'Back to God's Country' of the previous year, and she failed miserably. This time, she does better, although it seems pointless. 'Something New' hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase. There's a brief premise, which sets up the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) to have to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it's nothing but an exciting, implausible chase from there. Of course, it plays out like an hour-long advertisement for a Maxwell Sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. It doesn't seem that she learned much from the last-minute rescue films of D.W. Griffith or its parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she's imitating.<br /><br />One point of interest is that Shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film's story, which has as its protagonist a writer (Shipman again), although she doesn't do much else clever or humorous with it, even though she attempts to. Again, others had pioneered the writer's joke in the intertitles, like Anita Loos with 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion with 'A Girl's Folly' (both 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously--and neither do I.

{"value":"Not a knock on Korman as he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks' movies (\"High Anxiety\" comes to mind). He is, however, not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less. This one is basically a \"Gremlins\" knockoff, following a tradition of such movies as \"Critters\" and \"Ghoulies\". It is not a very good knockoff either, on par with \"Ghoulies\", but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got. In fact, this one is too light and frothy, and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat. Though I did give it a 3 for a score, this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse \"Gremlin\" knockoff. If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know the one I am talking about...the infamous \"Hobgoblins\". This one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place (I only saw this movie once a long time ago so I don't remember everything to clearly) and it starts out friendly enough. However, this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie. More misses than hits in the joke department, and it is also really lame to see Korman playing the evil brother role.

{"value":"Don't get fooled with all the big names like Burt Reynolds,James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified extra's. Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so. Whatever their motives for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of him. To me this is a sign of bad direction through and through. The plot itself wasn't that bad. And the acting from most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. however was terrible. He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was meant as a serious movie that can't be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad,but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting. Again better direction was needed. Also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this. It took the main character almost half an hour to get in action. For an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. She does her best to make it all work. Too bad the director left her hanging. Yes,this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off. And for an action/stunt coordinator of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes.

{"value":"I'm sure that the folks on the Texas/Louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when Paramount's B picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public. Very simply the area along the Sabine River where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the Deep South or at least the Deep South was post Civl War. No big cattle empires there, they're much farther west in Texas, farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire.<br /><br />The film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle, they keep the cattle. And that's the beginning of the big Ponderosa like ranch they start.<br /><br />Along the way Foster marries Dix's sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors. They also have some further run ins with Leo Carrillo.<br /><br />Anyway, us easterners who like westerns usually don't bother with geographical trifles and it's still a good western from the production mill of Harry Sherman who produced all those Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount.

{"value":"It seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema. Namely, happy endings aren't very common. Beautiful Thing excluded, gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death. And some, like Come Undone, just end... period.<br /><br />The creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot, direction, and timelines. Within the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a bit confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim's character having a little psych session. It seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency. There's no real way to tell when you're viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback. I could only take so much before it became truly unappealing.<br /><br />Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this film \"...shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real.\" Well, it seems that Stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing, as this is truly far from beautiful. Due to all the praise this film received, I expected something worth watching. Sadly, the film lived down to its title. And by the end of the movie (which provided no resolution whatsoever, I might add) it's plain to see that the writers, the director and the film have all Come Undone.","finished_norm":["it","seem","there","a","bite","of","a","curs","out","there","when","it","come","to","gai","cinema","name","happi","end","be","not","veri","common","beauti","thing","exclud","gai","film","tend","to","end","in","break","relationship","or","untim","death","and","some","like","come","undo","just","end","periodbr","br","the","creator","of","thi","horrid","piec","of","nonsens","have","a","thing","or","two","to","learn","about","plot","direct","and","timelin","within","the","ten","minut","of","thi","film","i","find","myself","a","bite","confus","and","even","much","so","after","the","glimps","of","jeremi","elkaim","charact","have","a","littl","psych","session","it","seem","thi","film","be","randomli","piec","togeth","without","the","slight","attempt","at","continu","or","consist","there","no","real","wai","to","tell","when","you","re","view","the","present","or","some","sort","of","ether","flashback","i","can","onli","take","so","much","befor","it","becom","truli","unappealingbr","br","stephen","holden","of","the","new","york","time","call","thi","film","shimmeringli","beauti","and","utterli","real","good","it","seem","that","stephen","invest","in","beer","goggl","prior","to","view","a","thi","be","truli","far","from","beauti","due","to","all","the","prais","thi","film","receiv","i","expect","someth","worth","watch","sadli","the","film","live","down","to","it","titl","and","by","the","end","of","the","movi","which","provid","no","resolut","whatsoev","i","mai","add","it","plain","to","see","that","the","writer","the","director","and","the","film","have","all","come","undo"],"filtered":["seem","bite","curs","come","gai","cinema","name","happi","end","veri","common","beauti","thing","exclud","gai","film","tend","end","break","relationship","untim","death","like","come","undo","end","periodbr","br","creator","thi","horrid","piec","nonsens","thing","two","learn","plot","direct","timelin","within","ten","minut","thi","film","find","bite","confus","even","much","glimps","jeremi","elkaim","charact","littl","psych","session","seem","thi","film","randomli","piec","togeth","without","slight","attempt","continu","consist","real","wai","tell","re","view","present","sort","ether","flashback","onli","take","much","befor","becom","truli","unappealingbr","br","stephen","holden","new","york","time","call","thi","film","shimmeringli","beauti","utterli","real","good","seem","stephen","invest","beer","goggl","prior","view","thi","truli","far","beauti","due","prais","thi","film","receiv","expect","someth","worth","watch","sadli","film","live","titl","end","movi","provid","resolut","whatsoev","mai","add","plain","see","writer","director","film","come","undo"],"filtered2":["seem","bite","curs","come","gai","cinema","name","happi","end","veri","common","beauti","thing","exclud","gai","tend","end","break","relationship","untim","death","like","come","undo","end","periodbr","creator","horrid","piec","nonsens","thing","two","learn","plot","direct","timelin","within","ten","minut","find","bite","confus","even","glimps","jeremi","elkaim","charact","littl","psych","session","seem","randomli","piec","togeth","without","slight","attempt","continu","consist","real","wai","tell","re","view","present","sort","ether","flashback","onli","take","befor","becom","truli","unappealingbr","stephen","holden","new","york","time","call","shimmeringli","beauti","utterli","real","good","seem","stephen","invest","beer","goggl","prior","view","truli","far","beauti","due","prais","receiv","expect","someth","worth","watch","sadli","live","titl","end","provid","resolut","whatsoev","mai","add","plain","see","writer","director","come","undo"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,10,11,14,15,24,29,31,32,33,34,35,38,46,47,53,58,59,68,79,80,87,90,101,102,115,116,125,130,142,143,154,177,218,219,245,264,269,270,287,299,312,325,343,360,409,411,427,430,433,545,568,577,586,605,640,672,694,705,816,827,828,905,939,992,1031,1051,1347,1440,1566,1645,1709,1898,2036,2074,2080,2155,2376,2405,2722,3159,3845,4898,6165,6216,6744,7551,7991,8258],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,10,11,14,15,24,29,31,32,33,34,35,38,46,47,53,58,59,68,79,80,87,90,101,102,115,116,125,130,142,143,154,177,218,219,245,264,269,270,287,299,312,325,343,360,409,411,427,430,433,545,568,577,586,605,640,672,694,705,816,827,828,905,939,992,1031,1051,1347,1440,1566,1645,1709,1898,2036,2074,2080,2155,2376,2405,2722,3159,3845,4898,6165,6216,6744,7551,7991,8258],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.941893

{"value":"I thought this film would be a lot better then it was. It sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener, and the start of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film came up short.<br /><br />The plot is just to ridiculous. The KGB and Soviet Union in Russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies' how to act like Americans, but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated, so they grab two yanks from the US to spice things up. I don't know, but this seems just to out there. It gets really odd when next to no one in this all Russian town speaks in a Russian accent. Someone screwed up in the casting job.<br /><br />Also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. There is one, two funny spots tops, and they are nothing to sing and dance about. The film in the end will likely put you to sleep.<br /><br />And, as a twisted punch in the face, this film is so pro the US it makes me sick. The movie keeps on saying again and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the Japanese in World War 2. It's films like these that makes everyone think that the US is full of itself.<br /><br />This gets a 4 out of 10, and I'm being kind. It should really get a one, but the dance scene was funny, but then again it dragged far to long to be really

{"value":"This early role for Barbara Shelley(in fact,her first in Britain after working in Italy),was made when she was 24 years old,and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957's \"Cat Girl.\" While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention(I'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard),the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability(one such example being 1960's \"Village of the Damned,\" in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband,George Sanders).She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of \"Cat People,\" and is seen to great advantage throughout(it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase).Her character apparently sleeps in the nude,and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened(also exposed 8 years later in 1965's \"Rasputin-The Mad Monk\").The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder(I don't see what held that dress up,but I'd sure like to).All in all,proof positive that Barbara Shelley,in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses,rises above her material and

{"value":"A very \"straight\" nice old lady, desperate for money to save her house and possessions, grows \"pot\" in her house, smokes it with a few old-biddy friends and then sells it. That's the story for this low-key comedy, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor the predicament brings. For much of the film, it works. The humor isn't of the laugh-out-loud variety but it does keep you entertained for an hour-and-a- half, so I guess it serves its purpose.<br /><br />There ARE funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the ending really ruined a \"cute\" movie with insultingly-bad messages that only the ultra-liberals of the film world would like to see happen.<br /><br />Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending, too, but it should not all warm and fuzzy for those who blatantly break the law. Also in here are the typical (1) children out of wedlock but that poses no problem and is deemed okay; (2) clerics portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a medical doctor who gets stoned, too! <br /><br />Hello? And reviewers here blast Hollywood? This is exhibit A how a secular society has lowered the standards in the UK and Europe in general.

{"value":"The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive cover of the VHS made me buy and watch this flick, expecting to see a good teen slash movie. What a crap! The full of clichés screenplay, the dialogs and the performances are awful, dreadful, very bad, terrible, horrendous  summarizing, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, only an absolutely boring story, with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, indeed three couples, together like a group of friends, but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies, playing a ridiculous senseless game called \"Taboo\", and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues. That is it: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationship. Then, there is an ellipsis to one year later, and the same group is gathered together in a New Years Eve party, insulting each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and the twists are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review.

{"value":"Okay I must say that before the revealing of the 'monster'. saying that he really didn't fit into that category, just some weird thing that had an annoying screech! And personally I think a granny could have ran away from that thing, but anyway. I actually was getting into this film, although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn't come as an appeal. But such scenes as when she runs away from the train, and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy, also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen.<br /><br />But then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror, with limited thrills or scares. Slowly I became more bored, and wanted to shut the thing off. I like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it, specially the guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. I think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are! Just boring and well not worth the money.<br /><br />if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a mindless gore fest (which is limited, hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go, but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else, much better films out there.","finished_norm":["okai","i","must","sai","that","befor","the","reveal","of","the","monster","sai","that","he","realli","do","not","fit","into","that","categori","just","some","weird","thing","that","have","a","annoi","screech","and","person","i","think","a","granni","can","have","run","awai","from","that","thing","but","anywai","i","actual","be","get","into","thi","film","although","have","the","main","charact","a","drink","and","a","heroin","addict","do","not","come","a","a","appeal","but","such","scene","a","when","she","run","awai","from","the","train","and","you","can","see","the","figur","at","the","door","be","kind","of","creepi","conjur","where","the","guard","have","just","be","kill","and","the","monster","put","hi","hand","on","the","screenbr","br","but","then","disast","stick","form","the","moment","the","monster","be","reveal","it","just","becom","your","averag","horror","with","limit","thrill","or","scare","slowli","i","becom","much","bore","and","want","to","shut","the","thing","off","i","like","much","peopl","have","sai","be","root","for","the","homeless","peopl","to","make","it","special","the","gui","he","give","me","a","few","cheap","laugh","here","and","there","i","think","thi","film","can","have","realli","be","someth","special","instead","it","becom","what","everi","other","horror","nowadai","be","just","bore","and","good","not","worth","the","moneybr","br","if","you","be","look","for","a","cheap","scare","here","and","there","or","a","mindless","gore","fest","which","be","limit","hardli","ani","in","fact","by","all","mean","give","it","a","go","but","for","all","you","seriou","horror","watcher","look","somewher","els","much","well","film","out","there"],"filtered":["okai","must","sai","befor","reveal","monster","sai","realli","fit","categori","weird","thing","annoi","screech","person","think","granni","run","awai","thing","anywai","actual","get","thi","film","although","main","charact","drink","heroin","addict","come","appeal","scene","run","awai","train","see","figur","door","kind","creepi","conjur","guard","kill","monster","put","hi","hand","screenbr","br","disast","stick","form","moment","monster","reveal","becom","averag","horror","limit","thrill","scare","slowli","becom","much","bore","want","shut","thing","like","much","peopl","sai","root","homeless","peopl","make","special","gui","give","cheap","laugh","think","thi","film","realli","someth","special","instead","becom","everi","horror","nowadai","bore","good","worth","moneybr","br","look","cheap","scare","mindless","gore","fest","limit","hardli","ani","fact","mean","give","go","seriou","horror","watcher","look","somewher","els","much","well","film"],"filtered2":["okai","must","befor","reveal","monster","realli","fit","categori","weird","thing","annoi","screech","person","think","granni","run","awai","thing","anywai","actual","get","although","main","charact","drink","heroin","addict","come","appeal","scene","run","awai","train","see","figur","door","kind","creepi","conjur","guard","kill","monster","put","hand","screenbr","disast","stick","form","moment","monster","reveal","becom","averag","horror","limit","thrill","scare","slowli","becom","bore","want","shut","thing","like","peopl","root","homeless","peopl","make","special","gui","give","cheap","laugh","think","realli","someth","special","instead","becom","everi","horror","nowadai","bore","good","worth","moneybr","look","cheap","scare","mindless","gore","fest","limit","hardli","ani","fact","mean","give","go","seriou","horror","watcher","look","somewher","els","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,10,12,13,16,19,20,23,27,29,30,34,37,39,52,53,55,76,79,83,85,88,97,108,115,122,133,137,141,152,153,155,159,179,188,191,196,203,219,235,237,271,351,358,386,413,415,416,493,623,625,643,665,667,676,689,690,713,755,804,833,838,1027,1034,1218,1308,1362,1374,1473,1591,1711,1817,2210,2705,2832,3203,3643,3996,4246,6098,7498],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,10,12,13,16,19,20,23,27,29,30,34,37,39,52,53,55,76,79,83,85,88,97,108,115,122,133,137,141,152,153,155,159,179,188,191,196,203,219,235,237,271,351,358,386,413,415,416,493,623,625,643,665,667,676,689,690,713,755,804,833,838,1027,1034,1218,1308,1362,1374,1473,1591,1711,1817,2210,2705,2832,3203,3643,3996,4246,6098,7498],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,2.393227744058217,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,2.729695454751562,1.3002700588679295,3.9586154332014196,2.6728839783437044,1.398285008945896

{"value":"i can't believe that NONE of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes. It's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't seem to condemn these assaults - as in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. One man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with \"you cannot force a woman to love you\" rather than \"you should never force a woman sexually, you jerk\"... From a woman's point of view, the movie is a let down. It sort of \"throws a bone\" to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. She never even makes them apologize - rather, SHE seems apologetic. Overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as Hero by a long

{"value":"I rented this film about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless film is 'TRASH' The acting is so badly done I've seen kids in high school do a better job The whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out, no feeling, no emotion, and no room to capture the viewer. On another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack.<br /><br />The clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover. Heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters. There is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either Since I've seen it I've questioned a few things 1. If is 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' Wouldn't that be a Serial Killer who kills clowns? 2. If your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her? Sad really.<br /><br />3. Why is it that the only REAL acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden? Did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs? This film is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than

{"value":"Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie: a whole cast of commercial-quality actors, a poorly designed creature to be the \"bad guy,\" and a script that is more full of technical, political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with.<br /><br />I checked out the movie because of the creature (I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos), and right off the bat, I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors I expected because of the type of film it is (really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point). The music was typical, not-thought-out action symphonic music.<br /><br />I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. The movie even flowed really well, with guiding screens letting you know which set you're watching the story unfold in. But there isn't much of a story here anyways.<br /><br />This movie gets a 3/10 stars IMO. The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it...kinda lame. Even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you don't see coming.

{"value":"Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue, I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained \"your father died today\" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.<br /><br />This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.<br /><br />This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over. I LOVED movies such as \"Trainspotting\" or \"Requiem for a Dream\" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every

{"value":"While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. As a consequence of that, I haven't seen many of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points.

{"value":"What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this tripe. That doesn't rule it out however; get a group of lads and some Stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter. Great wasted night stuff. Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs (estate agent???). But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other TV productions of low quality (Grange Hill) or soon to go on to poor quality drama (Eastenders) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable. Are we really to believe that the ICF (on whom of course the drama is based) would EVER go to another town to fight with just SIX blokes?<br /><br />The ICF would crowd out tube stations and the like with HUNDREDS. Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- Oldman is so camp it is unbelievable. Most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of Mr Matey.

{"value":"The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students... to learn how NOT to make a film!<br /><br />Let's see... what did the crew mess up in this flick? Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script WORST ALL-TIME DIRECTING Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst sets Worst lighting Etc. Let's face it, if this \"film\" had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white, AND silent... it still would have been awful. All scenes are dark (lighting people call it \"black\"), often, the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs, which was OK because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. The \"evil\" robot was hilarious... what was that? Jazz dancing? Oh... I guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something. I'm sure it struck fear into the hearts... of the poor editors. And, how do you edit so much footage of garbage? Not possible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you splice it. How did anyone ever get this thru the dailys???<br /><br />Bottom line is- I couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad... but I did see the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had ANY good parts in it at all.

{"value":"May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, unsure, and questioning her life and future. Finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, but for all its heralded realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, even repellent characters, and asks the viewer to engage with them. Reid shines as May, and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters, that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold-hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was Kureishi trying to say. As directed, they are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness. <br /><br />Worth seeing for Reid's performance, but little else.

{"value":"Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and to the expense of Tobe Hooper who usually makes pretty good horror movies but he failed pretty bad at this one. Englund plays the well known Marque De Sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain. The story is so confusing with the flip flop from one century to another and I became confused as to what was going on and what was the purpose of this movie. All I saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this Arabian with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then Englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the Madam Momoselle(spelled that wrong) or whoever it was in the picture above De Sades wall. The movie was terrible, I am surprised at Hooper for hireing Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes.

{"value":"Yes, this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space. This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things. Give it a rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts just yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp. However, you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me. Probably for a few others as well, who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face ripped apart by some strange super alien
