{"value":"The tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while I was studying cinema. So imagine how I was forced to watch it in complete. Believe me going through hell is much much easier. Our professor told us that this is some film ???, but he never thought that we'd disagree or assume the apposite. I don't think that there is any gods on earth, we're only humans, so all the filmmakers, therefore they CAN make mistakes, bad movies.. Or very bad too. The main problem wasn't that art, by all means, is susceptible to endless points of view, but that a lot of people just don't get it, that every single human got his own genuine taste, his own opinion, hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made, can also be your worst one ever, and how that is right both ways, but how many people can understand this correctly?. So my professor believes in this movie, and simply I don't. However, the only way to evaluate this \"thing\" is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society's mentality, imagination, and nature. To tell you the damn truth Mr. Pier Paolo Pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place. The movie is so UGLY. I can't stand this, so how about analyzing it, then discovering the potential beauty in it !! It's beyond your mind hideousness, and strangely not for the sake of the movie's case or anything, it's for the sake of the unstable vision of (Pasolini). His work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent. The deadly cinematic technique, the effective sense of silliness, and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious. Look at the atrocious acting, the unfruitful cinematography, the awfully poor sets, .. OH MY GOD I've got the nausea already. It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor. There are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this. So originally, how to continue THAT just to review it fairly ? Actually, you don't. As this very movie doesn't treat you fair at all. There is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera (!) I'm trying to connect some things like that with Pasolini's end as

{"value":"National Treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage is in no way a believable action hero, and this film is no \"Indiana Jones\". People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker.<br /><br />I can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for. Maybe the pre-teen audience will like it, but I found it to be absolutely ludicrous. I also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film. Simply put: it's just OK at best.<br /><br />National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired, borrowing what it does have from \"The Da Vinci Code\". I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006, and passing on this nonsense.<br /><br />The whole idea of being able to so easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while never damaging it once), while fighting the \"bad guys\" and experiencing what is supposed to be \"non-stop action\" is absurd. I particularly loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it. Oh brother! <br /><br />Reminded me of that episode of the \"Brady Bunch\" where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except, that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole film! <br /><br />The idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the US is outlandish. Literally, there are thousand of undiscovered \"priceless\" items in this treasure trove. Yeah right!! Ridiculous!! <br /><br />Even worse, the speed and accuracy of which Cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be \"tough\" clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous!!! Oh.. the humanity! <br /><br />The performances by Cage, Voight, and the other actors in \"National Treasure\" are as stiff ,wooden, and flat as they come. However, when you're working with such lousy dialogue, it's hard to fault the actor's 100% for that.<br /><br />National Treasure is an OK film to see once. I can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT purchase this over the top, outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess.<br /><br />Rent it if you must see it

{"value":"Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.<br /><br />From the first, BU is just a chase film. We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.<br /><br />If you haven't see the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost. If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He gets blown up. He clears tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he SURVIVES. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He'll survive. Yawn.<br /><br />There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. I've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.<br /><br />Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.<br /><br />The 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this film the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better end now before the slide continues.<br /><br />I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /><br />The idea that it 'shows the way' to the Bond franchise is utter crap.

{"value":"I love all types of films, especially horror. That being said, Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding it.<br /><br />I can't give it any points on originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes, or remaking what others have done. It has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods, a crazed killer, and as of lately, throw in some crazy family. On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though the twist in that one is obvious), and others. Survival falls up way short against comparable films. The plot was just not original in ANY way. Some films can get by with a weak (and way over-done) plot with superb acting, special fx, or a slew of other factors. Survivial doesn't have any of that to bank on. If you will, note the following: The acting in the movie never took off. I don't knock or blame the actors for that, nor the director. The dialogue was at best mediocre, and the actors involved never showed (not saying didn't HAVE) the talent to pull it off. I mention 2 standouts. The leading man in this film certainly has the look, but I seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film. The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential, but we never got to see any of it (watch the movie to see why, you won't believe it..).<br /><br />The grainy film look. Ah yes, that little tid-bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of \"Grindhouse\" films. In today's film making, that has become a gimmick. It either works or it doesn't. In this case it just does not work. There are too many other flaws going on, so it winds up distracting from the film, not adding to it. That being said, I think they did a good job of adding that grain. That is some good, quality grain. I think with a different script, better direction, and possibly actors, they should try another \"Grindhouse\" attempt. They will probably pull it off.<br /><br />As far as the tech aspects, in my opinion, they never quite gelled for me either. Better care could have been taken with audio (sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing wrong with that) and for being shot on DV, it was too soft for my taste.<br /><br

{"value":"Although it really isn't such a terribly movie (especially considering it was made directly for TV-distribution), it'll be very difficult to point out one aspect in \"Bloodsuckers\" that is actually original or refreshing. Vampires in space isn't exactly a new formula, and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting, still no one seems to realize it's an incredibly stupid premise that can't possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie. \"Bloodsuckers\" even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare. The plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from John Carpenter's \"Ghosts of Mars\" and James Cameron's \"Aliens\", as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons, like the Voorhees and the Leatherfaces. The good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes, constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters. Captain Damian is the unpopular rookie, who'll really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous (and far more loved) Captain Churchill. The other annoying characters include a typical cowboy-style and trigger happy macho pilot, a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board (she's of Asian descent, like the girl in \"Aliens\" was Latino) and the army's most valuable secret weapon: a Blade-girl! Quintana is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans. She can spot enemies when they're still light-years away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someone's wet dreams. They eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampire-meanie: Michael Ironside (in yet another downgrading role). \"Bloodsuckers\" is an irredeemably stupid film, but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings, infantile dialogs and OTT make-up effects. It only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla. This film is a non-stop series of lame clichés and uncreative ideas, but at least it's

{"value":"I just finished watching this movie. I was very excited since I'm a big fan of Punk Rock, Horror films and Spoofs. I was very surprised at what I saw. I knew it was low budget, but I wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera. It opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, The Horrorpops, reforming their song, Where They Wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. It's a great opening. But the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. A live performance, A death. Another live performance, A death. It gets old. And there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. Why doesn't the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? Don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. Like the hardcore French band, known simply as BERET, the prospect of a band named Atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and Bowling For Soup's Overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that I will save for the future watchers of this movie. But the big problem I have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the \"actors\". Especially Warped Tour creator, Kevin Lyman. He tries very hard, but I suspect that he didn't want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something. In addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the DVD. The Movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and Lloyd Kaufman as the devil. Bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent Horror, Music, or Comedy film. Although I have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that I would never have listened to, otherwise. Such as Tsunami Bomb, and the Phenomonauts(an insane, Psychobilly band). I recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on.

{"value":"When a film has no fewer than FIVE different titles, it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere. Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad. I saw the version on video called Rosemary's Disciples. Yes, I am sure it differs from other versions, but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have - going to be really any better. The story is perhaps the biggest problem: the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists(yep, it gets bad this early!). The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the \"owner\" of the town are allowed in. Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr. Cato - the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back(hence the name Necromancy). The people in the town do witch kind of stuff - have ceremonies, some like wearing a goat's head, and promiscuity abounds(not much really shown in this area), but none of these people are very good actors. Mr. Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger-than-life movie maverick Orson Welles. Welles is misused, but, make no mistake, he is the best thing in this movie. And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance. In one scene at a party, director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames! It looked ridiculous. As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman's arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash. It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin. The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens: many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed. This also applies to the corny, hokey ending. The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent. Other than her performance, real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles. The direction and story were both done by Gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine. This is not a good movie in any way under any

{"value":"After a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene, 'Set It Off' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. In short, it's no different from 90% of Hollywood product. But it's the racial angle that makes 'Set It Off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. Posing as a celebration of 'sistahood', the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating Afican-American 'gangsta' stereotype. The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, 'Set It Off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to Rodney King), and aspirational 'good' sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. 'Set It Off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of 'Shaft' and 'Superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. 'Set It Off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African-American film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early

{"value":"...and you can look at that statement in different ways, by the way. First of all, it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick, disgusting, offensive, brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now, I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence', but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The \"movie\" contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture, murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative, if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally, I think that is an interesting topic, so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.<br /><br />Secondly, the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash, for example ). There's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one.<br /><br />Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind.

{"value":"*****THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS - but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story*****<br /><br />The CINDERELLA story ranks as my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful tale.<br /><br />The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale. This cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing.<br /><br />This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling that never hatches or rather, is never transformed into a swan.<br /><br />All the production value that money can buy, cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting.<br /><br />The entrance of Cinderella at the ball as so poorly done, there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery.<br /><br />The writing made me very nervous, too. The Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory. Why would any girl want to marry a boorish, self-absorbed prince who disliked women? <br /><br />Turner's turn on the Stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one-liners more than acting nuance.<br /><br />Even the Cinderella part held little interest or sympathy.<br /><br />Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: So cheaply '90's,<br /><br />What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography, matte work and production design. It was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes, sets and settings as the story unfolded.<br /><br />For some Cinderella storytelling, go for two gems:<br /><br />1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stagey TV - 60's look to the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - bar none. An all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment. Engaging, diverting and memorable writing and music. This is the classic.<br /><br />2) Ever After- this Drew Barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective, alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale. The characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well.","finished_norm":["thi","review","mai","have","spoiler","but","that","determin","would","be","neglig","in","such","a","classic","and","wellknown","storybr","br","the","cinderella","stori","rank","a","my","favorit","fairi","tale","the","world","will","never","have","enough","of","thi","wonder","talebr","br","the","problem","be","that","everyon","want","to","tell","their","own","version","of","the","tale","thi","cannot","work","if","the","stori","deviat","or","attempt","to","throw","some","interest","idea","togeth","with","some","magic","photographi","and","scrumptiou","look","product","design","with","poor","direct","and","editingbr","br","thi","cinderella","stori","be","much","like","a","ugli","duckl","that","never","hatch","or","rather","be","never","transform","into","a","swanbr","br","all","the","product","valu","that","monei","can","bui","cannot","purchas","good","cinemat","time","and","dramat","develop","or","good","actingbr","br","the","entranc","of","cinderella","at","the","ball","a","so","poorli","do","there","be","no","drama","of","anticip","nor","excit","of","discoverybr","br","the","write","make","me","veri","nervou","too","the","princ","charm","be","the","much","undesir","of","memori","why","would","ani","girl","want","to","marri","a","boorish","selfabsorb","princ","who","dislik","woman","br","br","turner","turn","on","the","stepmoth","role","be","a","embarrassingli","pain","show","that","demonstr","onelin","much","than","act","nuancebr","br","even","the","cinderella","part","hold","littl","interest","or","sympathybr","br","perhap","onli","on","sentenc","will","describ","thi","attempt","so","cheapli","sbr","br","what","must","be","mention","and","mention","in","shame","excess","be","the","gloriou","photographi","matt","work","and","product","design","it","be","a","pleasur","to","perus","the","landscap","set","and","set","a","the","stori","unfoldedbr","br","for","some","cinderella","storytel","go","for","two","gemsbr","br","rodger","and","hammerstein","cinderella","music","with","leslei","ann","warren","even","with","the","obviou","stagei","tv","look","to","the","set","thi","be","the","well","version","on","celluloid","bar","none","a","all","star","cast","make","everi","effort","to","provid","the","high","entertain","engag","divert","and","memor","write","and","music","thi","be","the","classicbr","br","ever","after","thi","draw","barrymor","gem","maintain","the","histor","perspect","alter","the","stori","line","but","not","enough","to","derail","the","effect","develop","of","the","salient","point","of","thi","classic","tale","the","charact","of","the","princip","and","of","all","of","the","support","role","be","write","smartli","and","act","good"],"filtered":["thi","review","mai","spoiler","determin","neglig","classic","wellknown","storybr","br","cinderella","stori","rank","favorit","fairi","tale","world","never","enough","thi","wonder","talebr","br","problem","everyon","want","tell","version","tale","thi","work","stori","deviat","attempt","throw","interest","idea","togeth","magic","photographi","scrumptiou","look","product","design","poor","direct","editingbr","br","thi","cinderella","stori","much","like","ugli","duckl","never","hatch","rather","never","transform","swanbr","br","product","valu","monei","bui","purchas","good","cinemat","time","dramat","develop","good","actingbr","br","entranc","cinderella","ball","poorli","drama","anticip","excit","discoverybr","br","write","make","veri","nervou","princ","charm","much","undesir","memori","ani","girl","want","marri","boorish","selfabsorb","princ","dislik","woman","br","br","turner","turn","stepmoth","role","embarrassingli","pain","show","demonstr","onelin","much","act","nuancebr","br","even","cinderella","part","hold","littl","interest","sympathybr","br","perhap","onli","sentenc","describ","thi","attempt","cheapli","sbr","br","must","mention","mention","shame","excess","gloriou","photographi","matt","work","product","design","pleasur","perus","landscap","set","set","stori","unfoldedbr","br","cinderella","storytel","go","two","gemsbr","br","rodger","hammerstein","cinderella","music","leslei","ann","warren","even","obviou","stagei","tv","look","set","thi","well","version","celluloid","bar","none","star","cast","make","everi","effort","provid","high","entertain","engag","divert","memor","write","music","thi","classicbr","br","ever","thi","draw","barrymor","gem","maintain","histor","perspect","alter","stori","line","enough","derail","effect","develop","salient","point","thi","classic","tale","charact","princip","support","role","write","smartli","act","good"],"filtered2":["review","mai","spoiler","determin","neglig","classic","wellknown","storybr","cinderella","stori","rank","favorit","fairi","tale","world","never","enough","wonder","talebr","problem","everyon","want","tell","version","tale","work","stori","deviat","attempt","throw","interest","idea","togeth","magic","photographi","scrumptiou","look","product","design","poor","direct","editingbr

{"value":"-might contain spoilers... but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish.<br /><br />I walked into this movie with high expectations. It was my own fault. I had put too much stock in Steve Carell's record to date. 40 year old virgin... Little Miss Sunshine... The Office. And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. It's always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely off lately. The last time I felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching \"Blue Steel\" in 1990.<br /><br />This flick fumbled from start to finish. The script was flunky material. Awful writing all around. \"Murderer of love\"? \"Love is an ability\"? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck American Beauty's writer(s)... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard. The entire flick was peppered with Three's Company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene. Or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene. Or the awful laundry room scene. Right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen, they toss in one of these terrible moments. And it happens over and over and over again.<br /><br />And what's with Carell's character? The guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. They both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie.... Carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny (I think the exact line was \"this one time when I was a kid\"... that's it. seriously), but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses. The actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing.<br /><br />Back to the IMDb thing... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio. Check out The Family Stone's rating... if that's a mid 5, then this absolutely has got to be a 2... and that's pushing

{"value":"For every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. From such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.<br /><br />And so it goes with True Blood; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen play, a pilot, and finally a series. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings. Oh how wrong they so often are...<br /><br />True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines, worst acting, and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history. Its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents. Alan Ball's not so secret desires for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline. Tara's angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the Glorious Dead of the Confedercy. Sam finds suppressed love for Sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning, noon, and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship.<br /><br />As for Bill the Vampire, his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with Sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her (although she remains somewhat unharmed). We find the other vampires not so mainstream as Bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as Happy Meals with legs.<br /><br />Despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes, I have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show, its still bad.

{"value":"I've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting, considering medical facts that can be learned. But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters. Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. There doesn't seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome.<br /><br />Then we are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. For instance, in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. Anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.<br /><br />And I think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro-lifers. Addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. The general feeling was that if you opposed abortion, you're a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the US. Two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets, in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. What's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in. The script could have been written by Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />All in all, this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole

{"value":"Absolutely one of the worst movies of the year. The plot is ridiculous, the characters poorly developed, and the premise irritatingly stupid. It all begins when Michael Keaton, fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman, loses his beautiful author wife, Anna, to a car accident, possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she's supposed to be rich. In his grief, Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby: recording nothing and then watching it. He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy fellows who lived in his TV. Pretty soon, he starts to see dead people, thanks to EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, which is evidently this deal wherein dead people can send messages to living people through tape recorders, video cameras, dead cell phones (\"Anna cell calling? But she's...DEAD!...Must be ghosts. Mhmmm. No other possible explanation. I'd better start messing around with this indiscriminately.\") etc. Why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative pictograms is never explained. ANyway, eventually Batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future, and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know. He gets out of his house just in the nick of time, because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves (\"D*mn it! Can travel between the living and dead using electronics, but I'll be d*mned if we can be on time! Am I right guys? (They nod in bemused agreement).\"). He tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie (look hard, or you'll miss him!) is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons, who in Raiders of the Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him, looking like the cartoons that they are. Just then some detectives show up and save the lady. After Batman's funeral, he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot, evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it. The little kid just smiles. Nothing phases that dude, not even when his dad, Batman of course, starts talking to TV's. The high-point of the movie was when someone's phone rang and some guy yelled out, \"It's

{"value":"Although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film (and more than once after that). The plot development is disjointed and slow, the verbal diarrhoea of the main character's only friend is practically insufferable, the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying.<br /><br />It is typical of Ventura Pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters. However, this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film. In AMOR IDIOTA we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman. Supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn't support that. I won't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there Is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his unwavering attention? Even though I watched the whole thing I wasn't made to care even for a moment about either of them.<br /><br />If you can sit through all this prejudice, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, flimsy philosophy, etc the camera-work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst I've seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her movies (while in person she is actually attractive).<br /><br />I suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then Pons has achieved his objective. The barrage of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film (if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance). True that I heard much of the male audience squirm in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes.<br /><br />Save yourselves and watch something

{"value":"How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. \"Gymkata\" is a ridiculous action movie, filled (or is that empty?) with paper-thin plots, dumb characters, and preposterous situations. But take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor, yet goofy, movies, you will enjoy \"Gymkata\" a great deal.<br /><br />The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see his dad was another quasi-government agent, who has gone missing competing in this game, called, eloquently, \"The Game.\" So the gymnast (played blandly by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad.<br /><br />Sounds promising doesn't it? Okay, so it doesn't but still, that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie. They can be found in the movie's strange details. Like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie, then all of a sudden begins to talk, and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time! Or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break \"The Game\"'s non-existent rules whenever he so pleases. And of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the \"Village of The Crazies\" (Evidently that's the place's real name!). Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />But where this movie really shines is the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of Middle Eastern cities, so that our Gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses. It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />One interesting thing of note. A lot, I'd say about half the cast, dies from being shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie. If these were indeed effects, my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds. More likely, this was the film's way of not paying extras. Nevertheless, \"Gymkata\" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.<br /><br

{"value":"About five minutes in, and I saw where this was heading. Bunch of high school kids get annoyed by the school's administration and thoughts of rebellion start fomenting. I said to my girlfriend: if it gets below a 5 on IMDb, I'll go and read a book. It got 5.0, so she persuaded me to go on watching. What are the good things? Well, it is a good thing this film does not have a story, because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing. It's like the student's drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers, all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meat-grinder, and left half the stock destroyed, with the other half spliced into two-second bits. Even in a ten-second scene of the local TV news, there are about six cuts and three different angles. And then there are the montages. These are all set to electronic music, which forewarns you of yet another montage, so that like Pavlov's dog you start cringing every time you hear it, which is about every three minutes. Oh, I was supposed to say what's good about this film. Well, the film was shot very well, with a nice color palette, that nicely matched the emotional content - such as there was - of the scenes. Okay, now with the film's major flaw, and it wasn't the story, or lack thereof. The director made that fatal mistake of leading you astray about people and situations, not by clever storytelling, but by being highly selective about what to show about the main characters. That's just cheating. I guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable. But it just became plain annoying. If the story is full of holes, it's no good trying to patch it up by misdirecting the viewer. And often there wasn't even any point to it. And then the ending. Basically, the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy, if a coward. Plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie, that you should stand up for a just cause on its head, by the already mentioned misdirection, and makes it into a point about the nature of revolutions, that was already made, and much better, by animal farm. It also committed what I call the Bill Cosby sin: no matter how things may seem at first, in the end adults are always right, and children always wrong.

I do not write many reviews here, but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment. Movies like this erode at Movie making as an Art form. Movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current Reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them. People hone there craft, there 5 senses, and there business sense - overlooking there own inner life. However I do not put blame on them, it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age - qualified by films like this one. But by proxy these Manufacturers I would dare not call Artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen - diffusing it to everyone. A story of bounty hunters, guns guns and more guns, heavy handed flaunting of sex - for the oh so popular actress (did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her?), over saturated, over exaggerated, one liners, non-linear plots. All different and yet all the same. Annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat. A story? a development of character? or just withheld, missing information, revealed at the end to create the *effect* of a story - as if one took place. It altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety. It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre. Where are the films with Awareness? What about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there? What about the depth of a look? What about editing with a point about mind and consciousness? yes even in action films this can happen. Sure they have honed a craft; but what use is it without soul or wisdom? of insight into the human condition? Can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art, or compare this to Picasso and others - I say put this next to Gandhi or the Godfather, even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings; then look me in the face and say it again. It is a good crew, but they need some help with depth and story. I hope they get it because I like the crews previous work. better luck next

{"value":"I am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. The movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what I tried to emphasize in my original review. The movie fails, not necessarily because I really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as \"random\" and doesn't follow through. Let me clarify. In Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. The viewer can make the distinction however. In Zero Day, the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. Neo-nazism, talking about going on CNN with Wolf Blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know his name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie)..etc. This movie doesn't depict 'reality', it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. Unfortunately you fell for the bait and didn't see this, and you didn't pick up on it from my review either. The entire movie is just taking Michael Moore's hypothesis and applying it to something \"real life\" in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and doesn't support it. Of course I don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if I'm not mistaken, didn't video tape exist of the Columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in Doom? Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue. Zero Day is a bad movie not because I really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker doesn't know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it. It's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'Zero Day' in retaliation. If you want to see the 'mindless' teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch Bully.","finished_norm":["i","be","fulli","awar","there","be","no","statist","datum","that","readili","support","the","correl","between","video","game","and","real","life","violenc","the","movi","be","fals","and","phoni","becaus","it","be","in","complet","contradict","of","itself","which","be","what","i","try","to","emphas","in","my","origin","review","the","movi","fail","not","necessarili","becaus","i","realli","do","think","thi","kid","be","influenc","by","video","game","but","becaus","the","movi","set","it","up","a","random","and","doe","not","follow","through","let","me","clarifi","in","aileen","life","and","death","of","a","serial","killer","you","can","see","her","claim","about","the","polic","and","be","control","by","radio","wave","be","ridicul","yet","she","be","so","troubl","she","realli","believ","them","to","be","true","the","viewer","can","make","the","distinct","howev","in","zero","dai","the","kid","keep","sai","how","thei","be","not","influenc","by","anyth","environment","which","be","obvious","fals","sinc","everyth","thei","do","contradict","thi","neonaz","talk","about","go","on","cnn","with","wolf","blitzer","which","be","laughabl","not","onli","becaus","thei","know","hi","name","but","it","a","shameless","attempt","by","the","filmmak","to","get","coverag","of","hi","bad","movieetc","thi","movi","doe","not","depict","realiti","it","show","noth","but","phoni","to","prove","a","point","unfortun","you","fall","for","the","bait","and","do","not","see","thi","and","you","do","not","pick","up","on","it","from","my","review","either","the","entir","movi","be","just","take","michael","moor","hypothesi","and","appli","it","to","someth","real","life","in","hope","of","valid","and","it","fail","not","necessarili","becaus","the","hypothesi","be","wrong","but","becaus","the","movi","be","wrong","and","doe","not","support","it","of","cours","i","do","not","think","kid","that","plai","video","game","be","much","like","to","kill","peopl","but","if","i","be","not","mistak","do","not","video","tape","exist","of","the","columbin","kid","or","some","teen","killer","shoot","gun","in","the","forest","claim","how","much","thei","look","or","act","like","the","weaponri","in","doom","hmmmmmmm","the","distinct","be","kid","be","much","like","awar","of","the","medium","influenc","but","obvious","balanc","or","intellig","enough","that","it","not","even","a","issu","zero","dai","be","a","bad","movi","not","becaus","i","realli","believ","a","correl","exist","but","becaus","the","film","maker","doe","not","know","what","he","try","to","sai","and","the","movi","doe","much","to","disprov","hi","point","then","support","it","it","almost","a","if","the","new","rate","give","to","video","game","make","someon","upset","so","thei","come","up","with","zero","dai","in","retali","if","you","want","to","see","the","mindless","teen","killer","theori","pull","off","right","go","watch","bulli"],"filtered":["fulli","awar","statist","datum","readili","support","correl","video","game","real","life","violenc","movi","fals","phoni","becaus","complet","contradict","try","emphas","origin","review","movi","fail","necessarili","becaus","realli","think","thi","kid","influenc","video","game","becaus","movi","set","random","doe","follow","let","clarifi","aileen","life","death","serial","killer","see","claim","polic","control","radio","wave","ridicul","yet","troubl","realli","believ","true","viewer","make","distinct","howev","zero","dai","kid","keep","sai","thei","influenc","anyth","environment","obvious","fals","sinc","everyth","thei","contradict","thi","neonaz","talk","go","cnn","wolf","blitzer","laughabl","onli","becaus","thei","know","hi","name","shameless","attempt","filmmak","get","coverag","hi","bad","movieetc","thi","movi","doe","depict","realiti","show","noth","phoni","prove","point","unfortun","fall","bait","see","thi","pick","review","either","entir","movi","take","michael","moor","hypothesi","appli","someth","real","life","hope","valid","fail","necessarili","becaus","hypothesi","wrong","becaus","movi","wrong","doe","support","cours","think","kid","plai","video","game","much","like","kill","peopl","mistak","video","tape","exist","columbin","kid","teen","killer","shoot","gun","forest","claim","much","thei","look","act","like","weaponri","doom","hmmmmmmm","distinct","kid","much","like","awar","medium","influenc","obvious","balanc","intellig","enough","even","issu","zero","dai","bad","movi","becaus","realli","believ","correl","exist","becaus","film","maker","doe","know","try","sai","movi","doe","much","disprov","hi","point","support","almost","new","rate","give","video","game","make","someon","upset","thei","come","zero","dai","retali","want","see","mindless","teen","killer","theori","pull","right","go","watch","bulli"],"filtered2":["fulli","awar","statist","datum","readili","support","correl","video","game","real","life","violenc","fals","phoni","becaus","complet","contradict","try","emphas","origin","review","fail","necessarili","becaus"

{"value":"Revolt of the Zombies starts with Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) trying to convince General Duval (George Cleveland) that his mate Tsiang (William Crowell) is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people & render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies (a bit like the people I work with really). Anyway, Tsiang is murdered by Colonel Mazovia (Roy D'Arcy) but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies. An expedition has been set up by General Duval to hunt for the secret since Tsiang ain't going to tell them much anymore. General Duval heads the expedition along with his daughter Claire (Dorothy Stone) who is engaged to Louque who also comes along. During the expedition Claire dumps Louque for his mate Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland) at which Louque isn't too pleased about. In a way that could only happen in a film Louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself & starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on Claire & Clifford... Co-written & directed by Victor Halperin Revolt of the Zombies has a bad reputation & after watching it I can see why. The script by Halperin, Howard Higgin & Rollo Lloyd all uncredited, has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull & as exciting as watching paint dry. Nothing much happens for ages & then nothing much happens afterwards either. How Halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie, these zombies are just brainwashed people & filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before George A.Romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in Night of the Living Dead (1968). At only about an hour in length Revolt of the Zombies still feels too long. Technically the film is OK considering it was made 70 years ago, the black & white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location. The acting is wooden & largely unimpressive. Revolt of the Zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it hasn't dated well & in 2005 it's an absolute chore to sit through. I believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap DVD compilations & budget labels, but it's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it

To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.<br /><br />Let me declare, I do not like James McAvoy. I'm not sure what it is about him, but I thought his Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was creepy and pervy. I think that Kerry Washington would never look twice at him so I can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like Amin would risk and lose her life for him. I don't believe him as a Doctor, and I just don't see the appeal. His character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense, and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just...there's that word again...absurd. Think about it, you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.<br /><br />Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits. Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance, and highlighted, with his incomprehensible pre-Oscar speeches, just how much he was acting. It's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist.","finished_norm":["forest","whitak","perform","be","all","the","much","impress","for","make","it","almost","worthwhil","to","sit","through","thi","dreck","histor","fiction","doe","not","justifi","chang","histori","the","absurd","begin","from","the","grind","up","with","the","imaginari","lead","charact","plai","by","jame","mcavoi","to","creat","a","fiction","observ","for","the","purpos","of","give","the","reader","a","point","of","connect","in","the","book","be","regrett","regrett","that","white","peopl","ca","not","just","read","a","book","without","a","white","protagonist","to","connect","to","but","at","littl","he","be","place","in","a","somewhat","passiv","role","make","up","a","fake","histor","actor","and","credit","thi","fiction","with","expos","amin","to","the","world","be","irrespons","lazi","and","stupid","not","make","the","action","of","thi","creation","believ","or","even","sane","be","just","crimin","and","have","open","the","door","for","movi","like","the","on","thei","re","plan","to","make","with","leonardo","dicaprio","a","a","heroic","enron","whistleblow","who","never","exist","the","logic","of","the","world","doe","not","appli","in","thi","film","where","some","scottish","kid","think","it","okai","to","sleep","with","the","wife","of","a","murder","dictat","it","doe","not","appli","where","the","wife","of","the","dictat","desir","to","sleep","with","some","stupid","scrawni","irrespons","white","boi","for","that","matt","everybodi","be","line","up","to","sleep","with","thi","scrawni","irrespons","arrog","white","boi","he","even","have","gillian","anderson","lick","her","come","chopsbr","br","let","me","declar","i","do","not","like","jame","mcavoi","i","be","not","sure","what","it","be","about","him","but","i","think","hi","mr","tumnu","in","narnia","be","creepi","and","pervi","i","think","that","kerri","washington","would","never","look","twice","at","him","so","i","ca","not","believ","that","the","wife","of","a","power","danger","man","like","amin","would","risk","and","lose","her","life","for","him","i","do","not","believ","him","a","a","doctor","and","i","just","do","not","see","the","appeal","hi","charact","seem","to","have","far","much","arrog","than","would","make","sens","and","try","to","make","him","look","like","a","badass","in","shoot","the","cow","be","justther","that","word","againabsurd","think","about","it","you","be","watch","all","of","thi","charact","bend","themselv","into","knot","in","order","to","accommod","thi","unbeliev","main","charact","and","there","never","be","such","a","guybr","br","gillian","anderson","look","incred","and","sound","much","british","than","much","brit","whitak","give","a","great","expans","magnet","perform","and","highlight","with","hi","incomprehens","preoscar","speech","just","how","much","he","be","act","it","a","shame","the","film","around","him","have","no","reason","to","exist"],"filtered":["forest","whitak","perform","much","impress","make","almost","worthwhil","sit","thi","dreck","histor","fiction","doe","justifi","chang","histori","absurd","begin","grind","imaginari","lead","charact","plai","jame","mcavoi","creat","fiction","observ","purpos","give","reader","point","connect","book","regrett","regrett","white","peopl","ca","read","book","without","white","protagonist","connect","littl","place","somewhat","passiv","role","make","fake","histor","actor","credit","thi","fiction","expos","amin","world","irrespons","lazi","stupid","make","action","thi","creation","believ","even","sane","crimin","open","door","movi","like","thei","re","plan","make","leonardo","dicaprio","heroic","enron","whistleblow","never","exist","logic","world","doe","appli","thi","film","scottish","kid","think","okai","sleep","wife","murder","dictat","doe","appli","wife","dictat","desir","sleep","stupid","scrawni","irrespons","white","boi","matt","everybodi","line","sleep","thi","scrawni","irrespons","arrog","white","boi","even","gillian","anderson","lick","come","chopsbr","br","let","declar","like","jame","mcavoi","sure","think","hi","mr","tumnu","narnia","creepi","pervi","think","kerri","washington","never","look","twice","ca","believ","wife","power","danger","man","like","amin","risk","lose","life","believ","doctor","see","appeal","hi","charact","seem","far","much","arrog","make","sens","try","make","look","like","badass","shoot","cow","justther","word","againabsurd","think","watch","thi","charact","bend","themselv","knot","order","accommod","thi","unbeliev","main","charact","never","guybr","br","gillian","anderson","look","incred","sound","much","british","much","brit","whitak","give","great","expans","magnet","perform","highlight","hi","incomprehens","preoscar","speech","much","act","shame","film","around","reason","exist"],"filtered2":["forest","whitak","perform","impress","make","almost","worthwhil","sit","dreck","histor","fiction","doe","justifi","chang","histori","absurd","begin","grind","imaginari","lead","charact","plai","jame","mcavoi","creat","fiction","ob

I understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage, and I would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as \"Fury of the Wolfman\". In short, the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is utter nonsense, and incomprehensible nonsense at that.<br /><br />Waldemar Daninsky, that venerable lycanthropic antihero portrayed by Paul Naschy in a seemingly endless series of films, is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to Tibet, where he was attacked by a yeti. Somehow this has turned him into a werewolf. Daninsky is a doctor, a scientist, and an instructor at what appears to be a college. One of his female colleagues, Ilona Elmann, is involved in a vague form of hypnosis...\"Chematodes\", a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of wires attached to a victim's head. Ellman feels this will enable her to \"change the direction of the human brain\", naturally enabling her to rule the world, provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble.<br /><br />Elmann is also into werewolves, because she kidnaps Daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory. She has a bunch of other people trapped there as well. Some of them look like gypsies, and are chained up, being in varying states of lucidity. Others are clearly hippies. Elmann feels that one day she may be able to \"help them be human again\" (?), but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes. Waldemar becomes her hairy hit man, wandering around like a werewolf zombie--that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another Naschy werewolf film, \"Frankenstein's Bloody Terror\" (don't ask), at which point Naschy's werewolf makeup changes considerably and he lurches around like an animal.<br /><br />Is this making any sense? No? Good. That's the film's saving grace. It doesn't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level, it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can muster up. \"Fury of the Wolfman\" may be the best Halloween party movie ever.

{"value":"Pretty awful but watchable and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you've lived through the 80s). Vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the States. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite!<br /><br />Time goes on, the soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait -- in fact, the friend is dead and it is his dad that's in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an exceedingly horrifying (super pointy) meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father's small store from the local \"protection\" gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war. Desperate for help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral.<br /><br />Well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the old gang saddles up for the city. You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The one thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning, and about how they're really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey wouldn't have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in Vietnam in the first place if the unit hadn't been messing around! Then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs, they do it again. For no reason at all, they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. Phh!!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Foolishness!<br /><br />There is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it's real. EVERY single one of them. Hmm....<br /><br />What are you going to do? Keep watching, I guess. The movie isn't too horrible to watch, but it IS a tease. There are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie -- the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's death battle, and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside (poor Teddy!).<br /><br />I guess my main beef with this movie is that I feel let down by it. Even the confusing subplots with \"mystery helpers\" and their bizarrely cross-purpose motives wasn't enough to save it at the end. But someday maybe it'll all come right and they'll make a sequel.

{"value":"I've been using IMDb for a few years now, but have never written any reviews before. However, this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I couldn't keep quiet anymore.<br /><br />Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante, \"The Rectifier\", and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding.<br /><br />I take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is really no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of Robbins' character. <br /><br />Yes, we're all annoyed by noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. I say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's eye-rolling.<br /><br />Robbin's character, very shortly into the movie, becomes completely unrelatable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore, and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy, The Rectifier. However... the transformation doesn't take place. He just renames himself.<br /><br />I could go on for a while. Annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie, and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves Robbins face doesn't help either. <br /><br />Overall, I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it's pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. Just one guy's opinion, cheers.","finished_norm":["i","have","be","us","imdb","for","a","few","year","now","but","have","never","write","ani","review","befor","howev","thi","movi","so","disappoint","me","even","with","a","modest","score","of","at","the","time","of","write","that","i","can","not","keep","quiet","anymorebr","br","nois","be","the","stori","of","a","new","yorker","tim","robbinswho","be","so","perturb","by","nois","pollut","that","he","take","on","a","alterego","a","a","a","a","vigilant","the","rectifi","and","vandal","ani","car","he","find","with","a","caralarm","soundingbr","br","i","take","the","name","of","the","movi","to","be","somewhat","of","a","misnom","although","there","be","on","or","two","instanc","of","other","sourc","of","nois","be","address","or","mention","the","onli","true","focu","of","our","protagonist","be","car","alarm","car","alarm","car","alarm","car","alarm","there","be","realli","no","other","focu","when","the","movi","try","to","tie","other","exampl","of","nois","pollut","to","the","problem","of","car","alarm","it","seem","to","be","just","throw","in","to","give","merit","to","the","action","of","robbin","charact","br","br","ye","we","re","all","annoi","by","nois","nobodi","like","the","sound","of","car","alarm","of","cours","we","all","have","that","intern","urg","to","take","a","basebal","bat","to","a","shriek","vehicl","and","thi","movi","us","that","fact","and","pretti","much","that","fact","alon","to","sell","thi","movi","i","sai","pretti","much","becaus","there","be","conjur","a","blatantli","contriv","sexual","relationship","includ","a","complet","needless","threesom","which","be","obvious","throw","in","for","that","moviego","who","ne","such","thing","throw","in","in","order","to","enjoi","a","movi","honestli","it","eyerollingbr","br","robbin","charact","veri","shortli","into","the","movi","becom","complet","unrelat","it","seem","littl","that","he","decid","not","to","put","up","with","the","nois","anymor","and","much","that","by","focu","so","much","on","the","nois","he","have","begin","to","lose","hi","saniti","the","half","of","the","movi","be","essenti","the","stori","of","how","he","turn","from","just","a","angri","carbash","dude","into","thi","hero","of","the","littl","gui","the","rectifi","howev","the","transform","doe","not","take","place","he","just","renam","himselfbr","br","i","can","go","on","for","a","while","annoi","gener","social","commentari","come","in","everi","now","and","then","to","add","to","the","pretenti","of","the","movi","and","the","selfsatisfi","smirk","which","never","quit","leav","robbin","face","doe","not","help","either","br","br","overal","i","think","it","veri","obviou","what","thi","movi","be","try","to","be","a","it","pretti","much","shove","down","your","throat","but","in","my","opinion","it","fail","in","a","big","wai","just","on","gui","opinion","cheer"],"filtered":["us","imdb","year","never","write","ani","review","befor","howev","thi","movi","disappoint","even","modest","score","time","write","keep","quiet","anymorebr","br","nois","stori","new","yorker","tim","robbinswho","perturb","nois","pollut","take","alterego","vigilant","rectifi","vandal","ani","car","find","caralarm","soundingbr","br","take","name","movi","somewhat","misnom","although","two","instanc","sourc","nois","address","mention","onli","true","focu","protagonist","car","alarm","car","alarm","car","alarm","car","alarm","realli","focu","movi","try","tie","exampl","nois","pollut","problem","car","alarm","seem","throw","give","merit","action","robbin","charact","br","br","ye","re","annoi","nois","nobodi","like","sound","car","alarm","cours","intern","urg","take","basebal","bat","shriek","vehicl","thi","movi","us","fact","pretti","much","fact","alon","sell","thi","movi","sai","pretti","much","becaus","conjur","blatantli","contriv","sexual","relationship","includ","complet","needless","threesom","obvious","throw","moviego","ne","thing","throw","order","enjoi","movi","honestli","eyerollingbr","br","robbin","charact","veri","shortli","movi","becom","complet","unrelat","seem","littl","decid","put","nois","anymor","much","focu","much","nois","begin","lose","hi","saniti","half","movi","essenti","stori","turn","angri","carbash","dude","thi","hero","littl","gui","rectifi","howev","transform","doe","take","place","renam","himselfbr","br","go","annoi","gener","social","commentari","come","everi","add","pretenti","movi","selfsatisfi","smirk","never","quit","leav","robbin","face","doe","help","either","br","br","overal","think","veri","obviou","thi","movi","try","pretti","much","shove","throat","opinion","fail","big","wai","gui","opinion","cheer"],"filtered2":["us","imdb","year","never","write","ani","review","befor","howev","disappoint","even","modest","score","time","write","keep","quiet","anymorebr","nois","stori","new","yorker","tim","robbinswho","perturb","nois","pollut","take","alterego","vigilant","rectifi","vandal","ani","car","find","caralarm","soundingbr","take","name","somewhat","misnom"

The fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80's. My guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving world.<br /><br />There is a plot. Kind of. A strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses. At this point I feel obliged to point out that the loner's favourite song is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this his favourite song? Because he's an idiot. We are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity. It gets even stupider.<br /><br />The loner is the nostril picker. I can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose. That clears up the title. He decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls. And kill them. That's more or less it.<br /><br />The acting is universally appalling. Every single performance in this movie sucks. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie. It really is that terrible. The nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker. The characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot even typing this. Anyway, it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls. And not in a good way. There is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top. It is very possibly the worst song ever recorded. I'm not even going to describe it. You'll know it when you hear it. And you'll agree with me.<br /><br />There are some scenes of violence, sure. And there is a Benny Hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual. There is even an immortal bit of dialogue, that may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril picker says to a prostitute, 'I've got the cash if you've got the gash'.

{"value":"Following the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy, the prequel Cube Zero.<br /><br />Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution, time and place unknown, two low-ranking operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers, some of which are rigged with death traps. Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection, these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to be put inside the Cube. Suddenly it's realized that perhaps their \"jobs\" are not what they seem, and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted...<br /><br />For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this prequel will probably not be to your liking. It's not that the story does not have potential; it's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on. Standing alone, it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message. It was also nicely self-contained. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original, attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.<br /><br />What this new film has to offer, which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, certainly are good questions to be raised, but probably should have been done so on their own merits, rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations.<br /><br />Having said this, the other traits of the film, such as acting and direction and writing, are not awful. There is a bleak, dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City', and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash, these are not enough positive qualities to save it.","finished_norm":["follow","the","releas","of","cube","hypercub","and","plai","off","the","alleg","success","of","the","origin","cube","director","erni","barbarash","take","the","liberti","of","bring","u","the","instal","in","the","trilogi","the","prequel","cube","zerobr","br","deep","in","the","bowel","of","a","giant","and","faceless","institut","time","and","place","unknown","two","lowrank","oper","wynn","zachari","bennett","and","dodd","david","huband","sit","and","observ","on","monitor","the","behavior","of","peopl","that","have","be","place","in","a","giant","network","of","cubic","chamber","some","of","which","be","rig","with","death","trap","tell","that","the","peopl","thei","be","observ","be","convict","felon","who","choos","thi","horrif","and","deadli","ordeal","over","a","lethal","inject","thi","observ","have","have","no","problem","with","their","job","until","wynn","a","mathemat","geniu","discov","that","on","of","the","prison","a","woman","name","cassandra","stephani","moor","never","agre","to","be","put","insid","the","cube","suddenli","it","realiz","that","perhap","their","job","be","not","what","thei","seem","and","that","thei","mai","be","part","of","someth","deepli","sick","and","twistedbr","br","for","peopl","that","have","see","and","enjoi","the","origin","cube","thi","prequel","will","probabl","not","be","to","your","like","it","not","that","the","stori","doe","not","have","potenti","it","simpli","that","the","cube","film","never","ne","to","be","expand","on","stand","alon","it","be","a","neat","littl","psycholog","thriller","with","veri","interest","concept","and","a","certainti","about","it","own","messag","it","be","conjur","nice","selfcontain","the","problem","with","cube","zero","be","that","it","destroi","some","of","the","mystiqu","of","the","origin","attempt","to","answer","question","with","much","question","but","onli","realli","result","in","make","a","mess","of","what","never","ne","fixingbr","br","what","thi","new","film","have","to","offer","which","be","question","about","the","psycholog","natur","of","authoritarian","and","the","banal","of","evil","certainli","be","good","question","to","be","rais","but","probabl","should","have","be","do","so","on","their","own","merit","rather","than","a","a","continu","of","a","film","that","have","no","such","aspirationsbr","br","have","sai","thi","the","other","trait","of","the","film","such","a","act","and","direct","and","write","be","not","aw","there","be","a","bleak","dark","look","to","the","film","akin","to","such","film","noir","a","the","matrix","and","dark","citi","and","thei","have","certainli","manag","to","recaptur","the","claustrophob","feel","of","the","cube","unfortun","for","barbarash","thi","be","not","enough","posit","qualiti","to","save","it"],"filtered":["follow","releas","cube","hypercub","plai","alleg","success","origin","cube","director","erni","barbarash","take","liberti","bring","u","instal","trilogi","prequel","cube","zerobr","br","deep","bowel","giant","faceless","institut","time","place","unknown","two","lowrank","oper","wynn","zachari","bennett","dodd","david","huband","sit","observ","monitor","behavior","peopl","place","giant","network","cubic","chamber","rig","death","trap","tell","peopl","thei","observ","convict","felon","choos","thi","horrif","deadli","ordeal","lethal","inject","thi","observ","problem","job","wynn","mathemat","geniu","discov","prison","woman","name","cassandra","stephani","moor","never","agre","put","insid","cube","suddenli","realiz","perhap","job","thei","seem","thei","mai","part","someth","deepli","sick","twistedbr","br","peopl","see","enjoi","origin","cube","thi","prequel","probabl","like","stori","doe","potenti","simpli","cube","film","never","ne","expand","stand","alon","neat","littl","psycholog","thriller","veri","interest","concept","certainti","messag","conjur","nice","selfcontain","problem","cube","zero","destroi","mystiqu","origin","attempt","answer","question","much","question","onli","realli","result","make","mess","never","ne","fixingbr","br","thi","new","film","offer","question","psycholog","natur","authoritarian","banal","evil","certainli","good","question","rais","probabl","merit","rather","continu","film","aspirationsbr","br","sai","thi","trait","film","act","direct","write","aw","bleak","dark","look","film","akin","film","noir","matrix","dark","citi","thei","certainli","manag","recaptur","claustrophob","feel","cube","unfortun","barbarash","thi","enough","posit","qualiti","save"],"filtered2":["follow","releas","cube","hypercub","plai","alleg","success","origin","cube","director","erni","barbarash","take","liberti","bring","u","instal","trilogi","prequel","cube","zerobr","deep","bowel","giant","faceless","institut","time","place","unknown","two","lowrank","oper","wynn","zachari","bennett","dodd","david","huband","sit","observ","monitor","behavior","peopl","place","giant","network","cubic","chamber","rig","death","trap","tell","peopl","observ","convict","felon","ch

{"value":"\"Her Cardboard Lover\" is Norma Shearer's last movie. She quit the movies and, I think, joined the Board of Directors at MGM. That was a good move on her part. \"Her Cardboard Lover\" was talky and boring in parts. It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat. <br /><br />The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman (Norma Shearer) hiring a man (Robert Taylor) to make her playboy fiancee (George Sanders)jealous. I am surprised that the director, George Cukor, did not cut many of the talky scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor. Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in \"The Women\" but not in this movie. <br /><br />The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor. During Mr. Taylor's career, he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and \"When Ladies Meet\" in 1941. In 1942, he gave his best comedy performance in \"Her Cardboard Lover\" and, up to then, his best dramatic performance in \"Johnny Eager.\" He had a busy year. I think of all the actors at MGM, Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot. Also, MGM gave Mr. Taylor all types of movies to make - most of them were successful. That is why MGM kept him for 25 years. <br /><br />Mr. George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel. He played a similar role eight years later in \"All About Eve\" for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role. As for Ms. Shearer, this was one of her worst performances, she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy. It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939, \"The Women\", and gave her best performance. It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in \"Her Cardboard Lover.\" Also, it didn't help that some of her clothes were awful.<br /><br />Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together, the superb \"Escape\". The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie, \"Personal Property\" that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow. It was too talky, boring, and the actress looked old. Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor, so in 1937, she died at age 26. What a waste! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles.","finished_norm":["her","cardboard","lover","be","norma","shearer","last","movi","she","quit","the","movi","and","i","think","join","the","board","of","director","at","mgm","that","be","a","good","move","on","her","part","her","cardboard","lover","be","talki","and","bore","in","part","it","be","obviou","there","be","onli","a","hand","of","actor","with","speak","part","so","thei","have","a","lot","of","dialogu","to","speak","to","keep","thi","turkei","afloat","br","br","the","stori","be","a","good","idea","about","a","wealthi","woman","norma","shearer","hire","a","man","robert","taylor","to","make","her","playboi","fiance","georg","sandersjeal","i","be","surpris","that","the","director","georg","cukor","do","not","cut","mani","of","the","talki","scene","between","m","shearer","and","mr","taylor","mr","cukor","serv","m","shearer","good","in","the","woman","but","not","in","thi","movi","br","br","the","well","perform","in","the","movi","be","give","by","robert","taylor","dure","mr","taylor","career","he","be","give","hi","well","comedi","role","in","thi","movi","and","when","ladi","meet","in","in","he","give","hi","well","comedi","perform","in","her","cardboard","lover","and","up","to","then","hi","well","dramat","perform","in","johnni","eager","he","have","a","busi","year","i","think","of","all","the","actor","at","mgm","mr","taylor","work","with","all","the","major","and","minor","actress","on","the","lot","conjur","mgm","give","mr","taylor","all","typ","of","movi","to","make","much","of","them","be","success","that","be","why","mgm","keep","him","for","year","br","br","mr","georg","sander","be","veri","good","a","a","socialit","heel","he","plai","a","similar","role","eight","year","late","in","all","about","ev","for","which","he","win","a","oscar","for","a","support","role","a","for","m","shearer","thi","be","on","of","her","wrong","perform","she","be","not","funni","and","too","dramat","for","thi","comedi","it","be","strang","that","she","make","a","great","comedi","in","the","woman","and","give","her","well","perform","it","be","obviou","that","she","be","too","old","look","for","her","young","lead","man","in","her","cardboard","lover","conjur","it","do","not","help","that","some","of","her","cloth","be","awfulbr","br","too","bad","she","and","mr","taylor","do","not","make","anoth","dramat","movi","like","their","last","movi","togeth","the","superb","escap","the","same","comment","about","thi","movi","can","be","sai","of","anoth","movi","person","properti","that","mr","taylor","make","in","with","jean","harlow","it","be","too","talki","bore","and","the","actress","look","old","m","harlow","look","ill","throughout","the","movi","and","nobodi","in","hollywood","notic","to","tell","her","to","see","a","doctor","so","in","she","die","at","ag","what","a","wast","she","be","becom","a","good","actress","and","get","well","role"],"filtered":["cardboard","lover","norma","shearer","last","movi","quit","movi","think","join","board","director","mgm","good","move","part","cardboard","lover","talki","bore","part","obviou","onli","hand","actor","speak","part","thei","lot","dialogu","speak","keep","thi","turkei","afloat","br","br","stori","good","idea","wealthi","woman","norma","shearer","hire","man","robert","taylor","make","playboi","fiance","georg","sandersjeal","surpris","director","georg","cukor","cut","mani","talki","scene","m","shearer","mr","taylor","mr","cukor","serv","m","shearer","good","woman","thi","movi","br","br","well","perform","movi","give","robert","taylor","dure","mr","taylor","career","give","hi","well","comedi","role","thi","movi","ladi","meet","give","hi","well","comedi","perform","cardboard","lover","hi","well","dramat","perform","johnni","eager","busi","year","think","actor","mgm","mr","taylor","work","major","minor","actress","lot","conjur","mgm","give","mr","taylor","typ","movi","make","much","success","mgm","keep","year","br","br","mr","georg","sander","veri","good","socialit","heel","plai","similar","role","eight","year","late","ev","win","oscar","support","role","m","shearer","thi","wrong","perform","funni","dramat","thi","comedi","strang","make","great","comedi","woman","give","well","perform","obviou","old","look","young","lead","man","cardboard","lover","conjur","help","cloth","awfulbr","br","bad","mr","taylor","make","anoth","dramat","movi","like","last","movi","togeth","superb","escap","comment","thi","movi","sai","anoth","movi","person","properti","mr","taylor","make","jean","harlow","talki","bore","actress","look","old","m","harlow","look","ill","throughout","movi","nobodi","hollywood","notic","tell","see","doctor","die","ag","wast","becom","good","actress","get","well","role"],"filtered2":["cardboard","lover","norma","shearer","last","quit","think","join","board","director","mgm","good","move","part","cardboard","lover","talki","bore","part","obviou","onli","hand","actor","speak","part","lot","dialogu","speak","keep","turkei","afloat","stori","good","idea","wealthi","woman","n

{"value":"The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that portion of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a physician). It ends as Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets to Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guess what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.<br /><br />When I realized this was supposed to be an \"epic\" (I never knew *anything* but the title before it started), I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later.<br /><br />Not to be a racist, but aside from what I've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are, well, indistinguishable -- unknown Hispanic actors who look alike, especially considering they all wear \"Che\" beards and all wear Che fatigues. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toro's terrific, think of \"Lawrence\" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Because the other characters are interchangeable, this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed, you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think that's a spoiler), there's no empathy from the audience -- he's just killed.<br /><br />He's too one-dimensional to relate to as a human being. Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude, the only thing we learn about Che is that he's married with five children (he tells another character that near the end). What was his motivation? A complete enigma.<br /><br />Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mystery man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn). He was as courageous as he was insecure -- i.e., had human qualities. Che is like a machine, about as warm as The Terminator.<br /><br />Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongol.

{"value":"Why do I watch movies like this ? - other than I have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day I will find a true gem amongst all this dross I can't think one one good reason. This movie was dross from start to finish - but semi-hilarious dross. Where else but in a bad Italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges of surreal mangled English like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret X-files like organisation dedicated to hiding \"The Truth\":<br /><br />Man in Black: Silence is best for us until we are able to prove that the UFOs have no bellicose motives.<br /><br />Military Type: In any event I find your interference abusive.<br /><br />Man in Black: Whoever has to impose his will is.<br /><br />I rewound the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half dozen times and I still can't make those lines mean anything sensible. My other fave line was:<br /><br />\"We can be quite hard on those who contravert our interests.\"<br /><br />It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /><br />The other highlights of this dull plonker of a movie for me were the totally spaced out acting of the photographer character at the start. Saddled with the worst haircut EVER in the history of everything, the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig till kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas by some aliens. The aliens are most effectively not seen as a POV shot - hand held camera with a fish-eye lens - sort of spooky the first time but, used over and over again it lost its power (incidentaly, if it is a Point of View shot, it means the aliens always walk out of rooms backwards for some reason).<br /><br />The film was set in \"England\". This meant the Spanish Italian set designers put some British number plates on a couple of English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero's press card... and that was about it. No other attempt to make it look like the UK at all.<br /><br />Favourite moment? When the Foley artists didn't notice that characters they were foleying (is there such a word?) were no longer walking on gravel but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud \"crunch! crunch!\" noises. Other than that, another total waste of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove those UFOs have no bellicose motives

{"value":"When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors. It was one of many movies I watched with my parents, but this was the only one we walked out of. Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently, and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it. What a pretentious, ponderous, and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career. In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, muted, insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce, estrangement, career, love, non-love, halitosis, whatever. The film, intentionally, has no comic relief, no music, and is drenched in shadowy pathos. This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature, using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a \"more pronounced depth of meaning and truth\". But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman. The film is painfully slow and dull. But beyond that, I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters. Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, whining, nicotine stained, martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity. Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room. Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes. Everyone is \"lost\" and \"struggling\", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. It's never about resolution, it's only about interminable introspective babble. It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. I highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise, let's just pretend this film never

{"value":"I was excited when I heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie. The whole era (1980's Southern California) and subject matter (drug and porn industry) is intriguing to me. I thought this would be a sure fire hit. I was not thrilled with the choice of Kilmer as Holmes, they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms. I guess he sells tickets? However, I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot. I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing. Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do, I will admit that. There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act. John Holmes was there, but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family (and self) if he talked to police about it. In fact, Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved. So this was still really one big mystery, a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on. The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead. However, there is no real storyline, it is fragmented claptrap. The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting. The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved. Kilmer's character disappears for long stretches, his girlfriend is dull, the police are jokes. Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial. It is a very shallow piece and dare I say, boring. The director even tries to turn it into a love story. Which is nice, unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was. Perhaps a couple of viewings of Anderson's \"Boogie Nights\" might have helped here. \"Boogie Nights\" was innovative and exciting in all regards. This film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style. Even the music is out of place, with Duran Duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980. Then we have Gordon Lightfoot? Gordon Lightfoot? There could have been a great film based on this gruesome event, but I have not seen it yet. I have not seen even a decent one yet (unless you consider the Rahad Jackson scene from Boogie

{"value":"When i finally had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3(Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe)on an import Region 2 Japanese dvd,i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is.The transfer is just about immaculate,as good as it's ever going to look unless Anchor Bay gets a hold of it.The gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.The sound is also terrific.It's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2,you can really appreciate the cheesy music(actually a very good score),and the effective although cheap sound effects.It never sounded so good,and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I never realized just how much blood flows in this film,it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots,exploding puss filled mega pimples,a cleaver to a zombies throat,a woman's burned off extremities(how come it did'nt burn the guy also),intestinal munching,zombie babies and so much more i lost track.<br /><br />This is no doubt for hardcore Zombie action fans,especially of the Italian kind.There is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found,i think people don't give it enough credit,if you see a clean print,and not some horrendous pirate copy,it's a whole other experience entirely.<br /><br />This film never lets up for a second,and i realize it's inconsistent plotwise,the dubbing is horrible,the acting is stiff,and it's sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion,but that's part of it's charm.<br /><br />To me this is one of the best horror films ever made,you can't make a film this bad,so good,on purpose.It's accidental genius of the highest order.If they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster,but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it's nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards.<br /><br />Tons of action sequences,exotic locales,excellent set design,good,sometimes great cinematography,wonderfully cheesy acting,and inconsistent but still interesting plot,great makeup effects,beautiful women who can kick butt,excellent music,and sometimes hilarious,sometimes creepy,but always entertaining zombies.How can you go wrong with this film,it has it all,a cult classic that stands the test of
