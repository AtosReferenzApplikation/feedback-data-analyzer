{"value":"The idea of making a miniseries about the Berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting German (post)war movies. It is a theme that has not been explored much as yet. However, the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés. It starts already with the DVD cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the cover of 'Pearl Harbor'.<br /><br />Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) gets to hear that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) has died in Russia and after the war she's struggling to survive. She finds a job at the American base, gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in town, falls in love with 'm, gets pregnant, and all of a sudden her husband turns up again. Come on!!! We've seen this once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well; Bettina Zimmermann however never really seems to convince. For some reason it always seems she's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes. It just didn't work for me.<br /><br />The action scenes with the planes and the air lift, we're sometimes exciting, more often not. Nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot.<br /><br />Unless you're a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice-cream brings a lot more satisfaction!<br /><br />4 out

{"value":"\"Die Sieger\" was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in Germany. I watched it last night and I must admit, that I am deeply disappointed. If that is supposed to be \"the last best hope\" for entertaining and challenging German action cinema, well then there is not much left.<br /><br />\"Die Sieger\" tries to be sexy, daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind. The characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected (which doesn't happen too much) the act against their nature. That makes it hard - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them.<br /><br />Most of all I think the film is very bad cast. There is not one character in whom I believe. Maybe the superior officer at the SWAT unit - but that's about it. Those people that try to look like or act like special units, like elite cops - I don't believe them. Not for a second.<br /><br />The story is not so bad after all. But I think it's badly told. You don't get to know the bad guy at all - for example.

{"value":"An incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track, \"Soul Survivors\" is the latest entry in the \"who's dead and who's alive\" genre of horror films. Two teenaged couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, prepare to go off to different colleges, but before they part until Thanksgiving Break, they attend one last fling at a rave-type party in some burnt-out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, a.k.a. Faith, the other vampire slayer). Motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and before long, the quartet leave the party. Driving away in their SUV, they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys, who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway, causing a nasty and fatal accident as the SUV flips over an embankment and plunges into a river. Sean is killed (or is he?), and Cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when she's not being haunted by Sean's ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys. Much unexplained incoherence follows as Cassie's mental state degenerates further, until we reach the predictable conclusion. So, who is dead and who is alive?

{"value":"The orders fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is that the character's simply don't resonate or even react.<br /><br />Two examples: A priest, walking through a graveyard late at night, is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits. After fighting them off, he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up. \"Anything wrong?\" His buddy asks, having seen the attack. \"Just some demonic spirits-nothing I couldn't handle.\" No reaction, no surprise, just like he'd changed a tire. His buddy is equally unconcerned... must be standard priest training... [\"And then you put the wafer into their mouths. Any questions? Ok, moving on, Demon Spirit attacks...\"]<br /><br />Example two: At one point the priests need an answer to a question, and only a demon (or something, who cared by now) could provide it. How? Why, you have to ask a dying man! So the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing, gasping man. \"Hey, don't kill him!\" or maybe \"That's not nice!\" would have been more realistic then their response.

{"value":"We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we'd missed something... nope, what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction. I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.<br /><br />So, the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots. All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is. The dialog is one, long, unwavering cringe. Scenes don't make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet, the movie stumbles blindly on, convinced that it is saying something profound.<br /><br />This is too bad to even be funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see, and I'm happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess.","finished_norm":["we","actual","watch","thi","twice","in","the","theater","becaus","we","can","not","believ","how","bad","it","be","the","time","mayb","we","have","miss","someth","no","what","miss","be","miss","from","the","begin","of","preproduct","i","actual","go","back","to","robbin","novel","to","see","if","i","can","find","the","problem","and","i","discov","that","what","i","think","be","funni","and","excit","back","in","the","dai","be","now","just","so","much","disconnect","and","fuzzyhead","junkbr","br","so","the","initi","problem","with","the","film","be","decid","to","do","it","at","all","and","the","rest","of","the","train","wreck","progress","from","there","absolut","noth","work","not","a","bless","thing","some","beauti","exterior","photographi","get","steamrol","by","random","camera","placem","in","interior","shot","all","of","the","actor","look","at","littl","uncomfort","angi","dickenson","look","posit","mortifi","except","for","rain","phoenix","who","give","the","impress","that","she","be","too","unawar","to","realiz","how","aw","her","perform","realli","be","the","dialog","be","on","long","unwav","cring","scene","do","not","make","sens","from","to","and","the","connect","between","them","be","nonexist","and","yet","the","movi","stumbl","blindli","on","convinc","that","it","be","sai","someth","profoundbr","br","thi","be","too","bad","to","even","be","funni","it","be","simpli","excruci","gu","van","zant","have","do","other","goodtogreat","movi","which","i","encourag","you","to","see","and","i","be","happi","he","surviv","and","appear","to","have","learn","from","thi","mess"],"filtered":["actual","watch","thi","twice","theater","becaus","believ","bad","time","mayb","miss","someth","miss","miss","begin","preproduct","actual","go","back","robbin","novel","see","find","problem","discov","think","funni","excit","back","dai","much","disconnect","fuzzyhead","junkbr","br","initi","problem","film","decid","rest","train","wreck","progress","absolut","noth","work","bless","thing","beauti","exterior","photographi","get","steamrol","random","camera","placem","interior","shot","actor","look","littl","uncomfort","angi","dickenson","look","posit","mortifi","except","rain","phoenix","give","impress","unawar","realiz","aw","perform","realli","dialog","long","unwav","cring","scene","make","sens","connect","nonexist","yet","movi","stumbl","blindli","convinc","sai","someth","profoundbr","br","thi","bad","even","funni","simpli","excruci","gu","van","zant","goodtogreat","movi","encourag","see","happi","surviv","appear","learn","thi","mess"],"filtered2":["actual","watch","twice","theater","becaus","believ","bad","time","mayb","miss","someth","miss","miss","begin","preproduct","actual","go","back","robbin","novel","see","find","problem","discov","think","funni","excit","back","dai","disconnect","fuzzyhead","junkbr","initi","problem","decid","rest","train","wreck","progress","absolut","noth","work","bless","thing","beauti","exterior","photographi","get","steamrol","random","camera","placem","interior","shot","actor","look","littl","uncomfort","angi","dickenson","look","posit","mortifi","except","rain","phoenix","give","impress","unawar","realiz","aw","perform","realli","dialog","long","unwav","cring","scene","make","sens","connect","nonexist","yet","stumbl","blindli","convinc","someth","profoundbr","bad","even","funni","simpli","excruci","gu","van","zant","goodtogreat","encourag","see","happi","surviv","appear","learn","mess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,16,19,22,29,30,38,41,48,49,52,53,62,63,91,99,105,132,138,147,163,167,169,173,194,201,222,226,231,233,249,255,325,405,407,418,424,430,432,441,474,478,509,524,605,713,767,782,818,859,885,1226,1256,1371,1484,1502,1779,1827,1886,2058,2061,2256,3358,3410,3613,3628,4008,4568,4590,4972,5236,5575,5662,7266],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,16,19,22,29,30,38,41,48,49,52,53,62,63,91,99,105,132,138,147,163,167,169,173,194,201,222,226,231,233,249,255,325,405,407,418,424,430,432,441,474,478,509,524,605,713,767,782,818,859,885,1226,1256,1371,1484,1502,1779,1827,1886,2058,2061,2256,3358,3410,3613,3628,4008,4568,4590,4972,5236,5575,5662,7266],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,3.4244306149452273,3.400636547121535,4.

{"value":"Please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />So, it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later.<br /><br />So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost...<br /><br />So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.<br /><br />In short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho.

{"value":"This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory. HOWEVER, everything else sucks. The director, Emmanuel, is quite incompetent at film-making. He uses some of the most idiotic shots ever.<br /><br />- a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film. I don't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn't. It was stupid. Random shots of the trailer the main character lived in, random buildings, random pan shots of buildings, random cat which walks away. WTF? And clouds. Lots of gloomy dark clouds.<br /><br />- he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him. Instead of just one shot, he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid.<br /><br />The acting is horrible but it's what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope.

{"value":"Until now, the worst movie I had ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one. The review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it, evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online. At least the people who made Ben & Arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs, instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music... what else goes into a movie? Whatever it is, here it's as bad as it gets. If it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. I kept watching it thinking it must get better, because I hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable.<br /><br />It does not take a lot of money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant's amazing Mala Noche, but there are many others. Sideline SecretsDirector's Cut or originalis bad not because the people who made it had no money, but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except self-promotion.","finished_norm":["until","now","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","be","ben","arthur","you","realli","should","check","the","review","for","that","movi","instead","of","thi","on","the","review","statist","for","thi","movi","have","be","skew","posit","through","a","relentless","and","unscrupul","push","by","some","of","the","peopl","involv","in","make","it","evid","for","which","be","fairli","easi","to","uncov","onlin","at","littl","the","peopl","who","make","ben","arthur","be","honor","enough","to","let","it","stand","on","it","own","shaki","leg","instead","of","unscrupul","promot","it","so","sucker","like","me","would","bui","itbr","br","everyth","about","thi","movi","be","terribl","the","script","the","stori","the","cast","the","act","the","direct","the","photographi","the","edit","the","music","what","els","go","into","a","movi","whatev","it","be","here","it","a","bad","a","it","get","if","it","be","not","so","unpleas","it","would","be","ridicul","i","keep","watch","it","think","it","must","get","well","becaus","i","have","not","yet","discov","that","none","of","the","posit","review","for","it","be","reliablebr","br","it","doe","not","take","a","lot","of","monei","to","make","a","great","movi","nor","doe","a","low","budget","mean","a","movi","have","to","be","bad","my","favorit","exampl","of","a","shoestringbudget","masterpiec","be","gu","van","sant","amaz","mala","noch","but","there","be","mani","other","sidelin","secretsdirector","cut","or","originali","bad","not","becaus","the","peopl","who","make","it","have","no","monei","but","becaus","thei","have","gigant","ego","and","no","talent","for","anyth","at","all","except","selfpromot"],"filtered":["wrong","movi","ever","see","ben","arthur","realli","check","review","movi","instead","thi","review","statist","thi","movi","skew","posit","relentless","unscrupul","push","peopl","involv","make","evid","fairli","easi","uncov","onlin","littl","peopl","make","ben","arthur","honor","enough","let","stand","shaki","leg","instead","unscrupul","promot","sucker","like","bui","itbr","br","everyth","thi","movi","terribl","script","stori","cast","act","direct","photographi","edit","music","els","go","movi","whatev","bad","get","unpleas","ridicul","keep","watch","think","must","get","well","becaus","yet","discov","none","posit","review","reliablebr","br","doe","take","lot","monei","make","great","movi","doe","low","budget","mean","movi","bad","favorit","exampl","shoestringbudget","masterpiec","gu","van","sant","amaz","mala","noch","mani","sidelin","secretsdirector","cut","originali","bad","becaus","peopl","make","monei","becaus","thei","gigant","ego","talent","anyth","except","selfpromot"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","ben","arthur","realli","check","review","instead","review","statist","skew","posit","relentless","unscrupul","push","peopl","involv","make","evid","fairli","easi","uncov","onlin","littl","peopl","make","ben","arthur","honor","enough","let","stand","shaki","leg","instead","unscrupul","promot","sucker","like","bui","itbr","everyth","terribl","script","stori","cast","act","direct","photographi","edit","music","els","go","whatev","bad","get","unpleas","ridicul","keep","watch","think","must","get","well","becaus","yet","discov","none","posit","review","reliablebr","doe","take","lot","monei","make","great","doe","low","budget","mean","bad","favorit","exampl","shoestringbudget","masterpiec","gu","van","sant","amaz","mala","noch","mani","sidelin","secretsdirector","cut","originali","bad","becaus","peopl","make","monei","becaus","gigant","ego","talent","anyth","except","selfpromot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,9,12,13,14,17,18,20,21,22,23,25,31,44,50,51,72,77,88,92,93,102,104,118,124,126,134,141,152,166,176,193,194,196,217,233,241,256,274,276,303,307,347,348,370,377,431,504,509,556,685,744,782,818,819,822,854,1015,1174,1257,1371,1378,1477,1892,2048,2351,2664,2994,3244,3518,3825,4826,4890,5662,7605,7768,7806],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,9,12,13,14,17,18,20,21,22,23,25,31,44,50,51,72,77,88,92,93,102,104,118,124,126,134,141,152,166,176,193,194,196,217,233,241,256,274,276,303,307,347,348,370,377,431,504,509,556,685,744,782,818,819,822,854,1015,1174,1257,1371,1378,1477,1892,2048,2351,2664,2994,3244,3518,3825,4826,4890,5662,7605,7768,7806],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,3.205071257016622,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,3.893772050208532,4.094543182127343,1.27963878

{"value":"Jenny Neumann (from the sexploitation flick MISTRESS OF THE APES, the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who gets a lead role in an Australian stage production. She's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, a black-gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass.<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILER***<br /><br />The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in her dead mother's voice, washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl!), but this has gratuitous heavy-breathing POV camera-work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it's supposed to be some big surprise.<br /><br />The entire cast seems obsessed with talking about, having or trying to have sex, and, in one case, even blackmailing their way into getting laid. There's quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there's no sense of continuity, the photography is murky and the editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also scripted and produced) is terrible. The theater setting for a slasher film predates Soavi's film of the same name and Argento's OPERA (both of which are better than this one ) by five years though, and Neumann is pretty hot.","finished_norm":["jenni","neumann","from","the","sexploit","flick","mistress","of","the","ap","the","american","slasher","hell","night","and","other","be","helen","selleck","a","american","actress","who","get","a","lead","role","in","a","australian","stage","product","she","a","virgin","becaus","a","a","littl","girl","she","see","her","mom","have","sex","and","then","accident","caus","the","car","accid","that","kill","her","meanwhil","a","blackglov","killer","prowl","around","the","theater","slash","up","peopl","with","shard","of","glassbr","br","major","spoilerbr","br","the","killer","be","obvious","helen","she","speak","in","her","dead","mother","voic","wash","blood","off","her","hand","after","the","murder","and","be","see","kill","a","child","molest","with","a","break","bottl","a","a","littl","girl","but","thi","have","gratuit","heavybreath","pov","camerawork","and","conceal","the","ident","of","the","murder","until","the","veri","end","like","it","suppos","to","be","some","big","surprisebr","br","the","entir","cast","seem","obsess","with","talk","about","have","or","try","to","have","sex","and","in","on","case","even","blackmail","their","wai","into","get","lai","there","quit","a","bite","of","nuditi","and","blood","but","there","no","sens","of","continu","the","photographi","be","murki","and","the","edit","by","colin","eggleston","who","conjur","script","and","produc","be","terribl","the","theater","set","for","a","slasher","film","predat","soavi","film","of","the","same","name","and","argento","opu","both","of","which","be","well","than","thi","on","by","five","year","though","and","neumann","be","pretti","hot"],"filtered":["jenni","neumann","sexploit","flick","mistress","ap","american","slasher","hell","night","helen","selleck","american","actress","get","lead","role","australian","stage","product","virgin","becaus","littl","girl","see","mom","sex","accident","caus","car","accid","kill","meanwhil","blackglov","killer","prowl","around","theater","slash","peopl","shard","glassbr","br","major","spoilerbr","br","killer","obvious","helen","speak","dead","mother","voic","wash","blood","hand","murder","see","kill","child","molest","break","bottl","littl","girl","thi","gratuit","heavybreath","pov","camerawork","conceal","ident","murder","veri","end","like","suppos","big","surprisebr","br","entir","cast","seem","obsess","talk","try","sex","case","even","blackmail","wai","get","lai","quit","bite","nuditi","blood","sens","continu","photographi","murki","edit","colin","eggleston","conjur","script","produc","terribl","theater","set","slasher","film","predat","soavi","film","name","argento","opu","well","thi","five","year","though","neumann","pretti","hot"],"filtered2":["jenni","neumann","sexploit","flick","mistress","ap","american","slasher","hell","night","helen","selleck","american","actress","get","lead","role","australian","stage","product","virgin","becaus","littl","girl","see","mom","sex","accident","caus","car","accid","kill","meanwhil","blackglov","killer","prowl","around","theater","slash","peopl","shard","glassbr","major","spoilerbr","killer","obvious","helen","speak","dead","mother","voic","wash","blood","hand","murder","see","kill","child","molest","break","bottl","littl","girl","gratuit","heavybreath","pov","camerawork","conceal","ident","murder","veri","end","like","suppos","big","surprisebr","entir","cast","seem","obsess","talk","try","sex","case","even","blackmail","wai","get","lai","quit","bite","nuditi","blood","sens","continu","photographi","murki","edit","colin","eggleston","conjur","script","produc","terribl","theater","set","slasher","predat","soavi","name","argento","opu","well","five","year","though","neumann","pretti","hot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,14,15,20,22,23,24,33,35,36,39,57,76,77,78,82,84,86,92,98,109,120,128,143,149,154,157,166,173,180,186,190,198,210,223,228,235,252,254,257,261,273,284,288,341,344,348,354,355,360,394,397,404,424,428,433,453,505,612,666,669,731,1121,1122,1200,1320,1325,1371,1441,1608,1623,1706,1727,1758,2118,2398,2672,2808,2946,3081,3376,3596,3856,3952,4094,4189,4931,5121,5197,6693,7151,7280,7927],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,14,15,20,22,23,24,33,35,36,39,57,76,77,78,82,84,86,92,98,109,120,128,143,149,154,157,166,173,180,186,190,198,210,223,228,235,252,254,257,261,273,284,288,341,344,348,354,355,360,394,397,404,424,428,433,453,505,612,666,669,731,1121,1122,1200,1320,1325,1371,1441,1608,1623,1706,1727,1758,2118,2398,2672,2808,2946,3081,3376,3596,3856,3952,4094,4189,4931,5121,5197,6693,7151,7280,7927],"values":[0.6460

{"value":"Anurag Basu who co-directed the flop KUCCH TO HAI made his debut in this film <br /><br />The film was ahead of it's times in a way though it has a story not to different and it came closest to HAWAS which released 1 week before and luckily this was better and did a better business<br /><br />The movie starts off well, Malika's guilt is well shown at the start though the scene with Emraan- Malika is too crude/vulgar<br /><br />The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well handled and the twist in the tale where Ashmith confronts Emraan is brilliant<br /><br />The pace moves fast and the viewer is kept on the edge but the second girlfriend track of Emraan isn't fully convincing<br /><br />Also the cop track seems half baked<br /><br />The finale is too filmy too<br /><br />Direction by Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner, all songs were fab Camera-work was stunning<br /><br />Emraan played his naughty streak very well, this was the role that gave him stardom and though he kept playing such roles and got annoying in this film he was superb Ashmith too was good in his role for once, He did a nice job and one of his only good performance and he looked good too Malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half but her dial delivery was at times not up to the mark Sadly rarely she showed such potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is

{"value":"It a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an Asian background does NOT EVEN SHOW ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN person, not even as an extra. That fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general. - However.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />Buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in Oslo. The protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion, and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up. The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models. Quite the cliché. Although the story is mildly funny, the acting is good and as a 'young person' one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy' situations and complicated love affairs, I don't find the story or the characters very believable. To polished and lacking in depth. This film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `Friends' (yes that show on TV).<br /><br />Has Norwegian film finally found

{"value":"When watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying. First of all, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every cliché possible, you can guess not only the general plot, but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there. On the top of it all comes the \"message\" of the show, that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most ostensible manner. The actors, as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: the \"I am a good carrying person\" smile, the concerned look and the \"victory is ours\" body posture, while the bad guys have the \"I'm a bad one\" frowning and the \"you caught me\" look, followed by the \"I'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society\" head banding (this kind of also sums up the general development of each show). True story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that producers don't give a s**t about viewers, that we are all thought to be idiots.

{"value":"Istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that Errol Flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. It's a remake of the Fred MacMurray- Ava Gardner film Singapore from a decade ago.<br /><br />Unlike that studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film, was way too old to be playing these action/adventure types any longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really do lack conviction.<br /><br />As for Cornell, she plays Errol's former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia. She both doesn't remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /><br />But Errol's got some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession. Got to deal with them too.<br /><br />Best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today don't realize that Cole was an accomplished jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer.

{"value":"To anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book this film should be interesting. It is colorful, well acted and depicts high adventure, but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling. I could hardly sit through it.<br /><br />For some reason screen-writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But, why do the screen-writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it? In this case the writers out-did themselves.<br /><br />Just a few examples: There was no mutiny on the Renown. The officers did take over the ship after the half-insane Captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway -for reasons implied but never given. There was no court martial. The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor does Col. Ortega's wife. Hornblower, himself, was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore. There are plenty of such manipulations of Forrester's story.<br /><br />On a purely technical basis, I think the film's repeated use of the flash-back device hurts the continuity of the story.<br

{"value":"I saw the original \"Chorus Line\" on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to re-imagine \"Chorus\" for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough fresh of the musical work of \"Ghandi\" and dancing with animals in \"Doctor Doolittle\" ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was mis-cast. People that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy \"Landers\" woman who couldn't sing, act, or dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi's wife. The dances by Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from \"Flashdance\" rejects and nothing works. I sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. If you truly love this show and it is coming back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was \"A Chorus Line\" has any thing at all to do with this

{"value":"Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to hook up with her, but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die.<br /><br />To be honest the real reason I wanted to watch this film is because Dana Kimmel of Friday The 13th pt 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie. When I started watching it I realized that \"Sweet Sixteen\" isn't a very good slasher, it's really dull and boring and just doesn't go anywhere. After over an hour, only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way.<br /><br />The movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s, the movie suffers from being too dark at times. The acting is actually pretty good though and Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even though she's a complete slut.<br /><br />The story line isn't completely rubbish but it's just way too dull to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested was Melissa she was stunning and Dana Kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie.<br /><br />All in all pretty dull

{"value":"Ah, the sex-and-gore movie. It's too bad they don't make these anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out like this, that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />The movie basically consists of the two lovely vampires picking up \"johns\" along a country road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them, and then eating them (except the first victim, who they keep around for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing. It gets real ugly from here. By the end, the two vamps are in such a bloodlust that they're eating everything in sight, and manage to let their captive victim escape. Oops, so much for that secret existence.<br /><br />The fact that the two vampyres don't mind taking their clothes off and fooling around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why is their tomb so far away from their castle?), watchable only for the scant few minutes of vampyre playtime. The only thing I got out of this movie was these two valuable bits of advice: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and, don't pick up hookers along a country road; they are probably vampires. Other than that, it really wasn't worth my time.","finished_norm":["ah","the","sexandgor","movi","it","too","bad","thei","do","not","make","thi","anymor","unless","you","live","in","japan","but","if","thei","all","turn","out","like","thi","that","be","not","a","bad","thingbr","br","the","movi","basic","consist","of","the","two","love","vampir","pick","up","john","along","a","countri","road","take","them","home","to","their","castl","have","crazi","sex","with","them","and","then","eat","them","except","the","victim","who","thei","keep","around","for","no","particular","reason","thing","be","complic","when","a","woman","camp","with","her","husband","becom","too","curiou","about","thi","mysteri","woman","she","keep","see","it","get","real","ugli","from","here","by","the","end","the","two","vamp","be","in","such","a","bloodlust","that","thei","re","eat","everyth","in","sight","and","manag","to","let","their","captiv","victim","escap","oop","so","much","for","that","secret","existencebr","br","the","fact","that","the","two","vampyr","do","not","mind","take","their","cloth","off","and","fool","around","with","each","other","be","the","onli","thing","thi","movi","have","go","for","it","otherwis","it","a","bloodi","confus","mess","why","be","their","tomb","so","far","awai","from","their","castl","watchabl","onli","for","the","scant","few","minut","of","vampyr","playtim","the","onli","thing","i","get","out","of","thi","movi","be","thi","two","valuabl","bit","of","advic","shoot","lesbian","will","not","kill","them","it","will","onli","turn","them","into","vampir","and","do","not","pick","up","hooker","along","a","countri","road","thei","be","probabl","vampir","other","than","that","it","realli","be","not","worth","my","time"],"filtered":["ah","sexandgor","movi","bad","thei","make","thi","anymor","unless","live","japan","thei","turn","like","thi","bad","thingbr","br","movi","basic","consist","two","love","vampir","pick","john","along","countri","road","take","home","castl","crazi","sex","eat","except","victim","thei","keep","around","particular","reason","thing","complic","woman","camp","husband","becom","curiou","thi","mysteri","woman","keep","see","get","real","ugli","end","two","vamp","bloodlust","thei","re","eat","everyth","sight","manag","let","captiv","victim","escap","oop","much","secret","existencebr","br","fact","two","vampyr","mind","take","cloth","fool","around","onli","thing","thi","movi","go","otherwis","bloodi","confus","mess","tomb","far","awai","castl","watchabl","onli","scant","minut","vampyr","playtim","onli","thing","get","thi","movi","thi","two","valuabl","bit","advic","shoot","lesbian","kill","onli","turn","vampir","pick","hooker","along","countri","road","thei","probabl","vampir","realli","worth","time"],"filtered2":["ah","sexandgor","bad","make","anymor","unless","live","japan","turn","like","bad","thingbr","basic","consist","two","love","vampir","pick","john","along","countri","road","take","home","castl","crazi","sex","eat","except","victim","keep","around","particular","reason","thing","complic","woman","camp","husband","becom","curiou","mysteri","woman","keep","see","get","real","ugli","end","two","vamp","bloodlust","re","eat","everyth","sight","manag","let","captiv","victim","escap","oop","secret","existencebr","fact","two","vampyr","mind","take","cloth","fool","around","onli","thing","go","otherwis","bloodi","confus","mess","tomb","far","awai","castl","watchabl","onli","scant","minut","vampyr","playtim","onli","thing","get","two","valuabl","bit","advic","shoot","lesbian","kill","onli","turn","vampir","pick","hooker","along","countri","road","probabl","vampir","realli","worth","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,9,11,13,24,29,31,47,54,59,68,70,76,80,95,96,97,98,101,115,116,117,124,134,148,155,193,219,233,238,254,286,291,302,324,345,403,407,427,446,460,485,535,536,599,608,627,638,712,798,828,832,879,895,908,1057,1080,1178,1179,1239,1280,1283,1352,1381,1595,1841,1960,2103,2684,2719,3143,3561,3574,3753,6691,7746,8329],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,9,11,13,24,29,31,47,54,59,68,70,76,80,95,96,97,98,101,115,116,117,124,134,148,155,193,219,233,238,254,286,291,302,324,345,403,407,427,446,460,485,535,536,599,608,627,638,712,798,828,832,879,895,908,1057,1080,1178,1179,1239,1280,1283,1352,1381,1595,1841,1960,2103,2684,2719,3143,3561,3574,3753,6691,7746,8329],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,3.965239261355278,1.1317941569733974,1.3210361566119257,3.9586154332014196,2.814133962290301,6.825877741242886,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197

{"value":"As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, \"Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could have done with this!\" Chances are, you will too. It does start out intrigueing. A British park ranger living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a pretty, demure brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom he met in a park only a short time ago. Then, one day she dissappears. The police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed, and Firth conducts his own search. So far, so good. Just as he's about to give up, he turns to his womanizing best friend (Billy Zane), and they stumble onto her former life in L.A.'s sordid underground of drugs, nightclubs, and ametuer filmmaking, and then to her history of mental instability. At that point, Firth's life is in danger, and the film falls apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zane's past are remotely interesting. The film moves slowly, and there's very little action. There is a subplot regarding missing drug money, but it's just a throwaway. No chases, no cliffhanging sequences, and no suspense. Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters. One thing worth noting, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear in a scene together.

{"value":"Now look, I won't lie to you, but I only got this movie for $3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band \"Cradle Of Filth\" in it. I expected of course violence and gore at its finest, as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as, amongst a plot line.<br /><br />But dear god, I was oh so wrong. This movie seriously bites, big time. Being a low budget film (haha, wait, make that ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects. Nope, it's all one camera, bad angles, and bad blood scenes.<br /><br />Take for example when our star and violent fiend, Mr Filth, violently kills a mugger. A grab at the throat, and blood spits out, but oh my, it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt.<br /><br />To you Cradle Of Filth fans: You'll hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and shoddy filming, they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN.<br /><br />My final comment: Steer well away from it. It's blood, gore, breasts, and hey, even a shoddy story to go with it. So if you like appalling violence, near no voices (yes, there's hardly any words in this movie), then by all means, buy it.

{"value":"Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**SPOILER**) needs a family member in order to do it.<br /><br />A failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all. Works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (Too many wisecracks, that's for sure.) The actors aren't interesting (save Robert Englund, as always, and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. The finale is OK but doesn't provide as many sparks as I think one might hope.<br /><br />In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story, it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before.<br /><br />There are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper, and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.<br /><br />Film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer.<br /><br

{"value":"I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again.<br /><br />I have seen action films, I have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.<br /><br />Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /><br />Furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. <br /><br />I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.<br /><br />Go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action

{"value":"I'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the people there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the \"hype\" would lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed Forces ever did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they came home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a

{"value":"Must every good story be \"improved\" with added corny Broadway music? Apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out, and this was a great example of just that... So of course, take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Fetch me a basin.<br /><br />The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of, but then they must go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (pardon if I'm mistaken, it's been a while).<br /><br />My biggest complaint I've stated. Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story? Seldom has this been done to good effect. Generally it ruins the story. It did with this one.

{"value":"Normally, I don't like revenge films....PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locales(i.e. Hong Kong), awesome gun battles, and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat. Like all revenge flicks, it has villains you'd love to throw out of a plate-glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist, racist, and venomous social stereotypes that invaded \"Eye for an Eye\" and \"Death Wish 2\".<br /><br />But in the plot department Double Impact is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys were talking in French accents is a lousy one. It wasn't the watery plot that made this movie bad, but the use of clichéd lines and moves from other movies (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made it worse. But nonetheless Double Impact is still watchable.

{"value":"The explosion of TV channels must be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line, because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred Randolph Scott movies playing on at least one no-budget station.<br /><br />\"Man Behind The Gun\" is a typical early 1950's period melodrama with pre-WWII production values that relies on a historically-topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script's complete absence of character development, and thus lack of suspense. In years to come the role of these films would be taken over by TV shows like 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc - and these actually did the job better. Randolph Scott, looking particularly grizzled in this, is the good guy, struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail. There's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling, unless you count wondering whether he'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end. The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the 'characters' than the acting is.

{"value":"This film is notable for three reasons.<br /><br />First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking George Reeves' and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is re-used in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth' allowing the 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot).<br /><br />Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. No 'mild mannered reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout (\"I'll handle this!\"), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, he is gentler than Clark towards the feisty Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as \"Nazi storm troopers.\" <br /><br />Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of Superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'Adventures of Superman' had not yet been made.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","notabl","for","three","reasonsbr","br","appar","capit","on","the","success","of","the","two","superman","serial","thi","low","budget","featur","be","make","and","releas","to","theater","mark","georg","reev","and","phylli","coat","initi","appear","a","clark","kent","superman","and","loi","lane","part","of","the","open","be","reus","in","the","seri","outsid","the","town","of","silbi","a","sixmil","deep","oil","good","penetr","the","hollow","earth","allow","the","molemen","to","come","to","the","surfac","forget","about","the","other","hole","that","in","the","plotbr","br","unlik","much","sf","invas","film","of","the","fifti","the","hero","plai","a","domin","and","control","forc","in","preach","and","enforc","toler","and","accept","of","differ","against","a","rage","mob","of","segregationist","vigilant","no","mild","manner","report","here","clark","kent","knowledg","and","selfassert","grab","control","of","the","situat","throughout","i","will","handl","thi","even","assist","in","a","hospit","gown","in","the","remov","of","a","bullet","from","a","moleman","a","superman","he","be","gentl","than","clark","toward","the","feisti","loi","but","be","conjur","the","voic","of","reason","and","toler","a","he","rail","against","the","vigilant","a","nazi","storm","trooper","br","br","you","will","notic","that","the","transit","from","the","fleisherlik","cartoon","anim","fly","of","superman","in","the","two","serial","to","the","live","action","fly","in","the","adventur","of","superman","have","not","yet","be","make"],"filtered":["thi","film","notabl","three","reasonsbr","br","appar","capit","success","two","superman","serial","thi","low","budget","featur","make","releas","theater","mark","georg","reev","phylli","coat","initi","appear","clark","kent","superman","loi","lane","part","open","reus","seri","outsid","town","silbi","sixmil","deep","oil","good","penetr","hollow","earth","allow","molemen","come","surfac","forget","hole","plotbr","br","unlik","much","sf","invas","film","fifti","hero","plai","domin","control","forc","preach","enforc","toler","accept","differ","rage","mob","segregationist","vigilant","mild","manner","report","clark","kent","knowledg","selfassert","grab","control","situat","throughout","handl","thi","even","assist","hospit","gown","remov","bullet","moleman","superman","gentl","clark","toward","feisti","loi","conjur","voic","reason","toler","rail","vigilant","nazi","storm","trooper","br","br","notic","transit","fleisherlik","cartoon","anim","fly","superman","two","serial","live","action","fly","adventur","superman","yet","make"],"filtered2":["notabl","three","reasonsbr","appar","capit","success","two","superman","serial","low","budget","featur","make","releas","theater","mark","georg","reev","phylli","coat","initi","appear","clark","kent","superman","loi","lane","part","open","reus","outsid","town","silbi","sixmil","deep","oil","good","penetr","hollow","earth","allow","molemen","come","surfac","forget","hole","plotbr","unlik","sf","invas","fifti","hero","plai","domin","control","forc","preach","enforc","toler","accept","differ","rage","mob","segregationist","vigilant","mild","manner","report","clark","kent","knowledg","selfassert","grab","control","situat","throughout","handl","even","assist","hospit","gown","remov","bullet","moleman","superman","gentl","clark","toward","feisti","loi","conjur","voic","reason","toler","rail","vigilant","nazi","storm","trooper","notic","transit","fleisherlik","cartoon","anim","fly","superman","two","serial","live","action","fly","adventur","superman","yet","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,34,39,40,47,61,95,116,129,169,194,204,217,224,242,256,277,305,308,327,338,373,375,424,428,438,450,473,521,522,532,563,615,652,653,680,688,717,742,791,810,823,834,945,990,1046,1076,1133,1143,1168,1226,1518,1526,1550,1621,1631,1673,1721,1773,1934,2125,2145,2264,2283,2314,2404,2487,2500,2590,2726,2925,2958,2995,3074,3189,3266,3397,3761,5001,5510,5518,5533,5570,5956,6090,6115,6496,6679,6872,7066],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,34,39,40,47,61,95,116,129,169,194,204,217,224,242,256,277,305,308,327,338,373,375,424,428,438,450,473,521,522,532,563,615,652,653,680,688,717,742,791,810,823,834,945,990,1046,1076,1133,1143,1168,1226,1518,1526,1550,1621,1631,1673,1721,1773,1934,2125,2145,2264,2283,2314,2404,2487,2500,2590,2726,2925,2958,2995,3074,3189,3266,3397,3761,5001,5510,5518,5533,5570,5956,6090,6115,6496,6679,6872,7066],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.628496875832

{"value":"Shiri Appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon-kicking Buffy clone, Elle. But I'm getting ahead of myself, you see Lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to Adam. But she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from Eden. A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but doesn't kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not really explained that well) Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy-clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of Lilith's blood. <br /><br />If the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted, that's because it is. The movie is also dull, generic, and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesn't seem to know a lick about it. This bargain basement lousy-CGIed movie was apparently a failed series pilot. All I can say to the fact that it didn't get picked up is a resounding Amen.<br /><br />My Grade: D-<br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary by Writer/Director Bill Platt and Co-writer Chris Regina; and

{"value":"I do agree with everything Calamine has said! And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine has said is very true, it is time for the girls to move on to better roles. I would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their career as well as their personal life. So producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit, move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets. This movie that is being commented is not too bad, but as I have seen further on in their movies, their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography. When In Rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds, maybe some that are like the sixth sense, the hour, chocolat, that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them, humour ones too yes, but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and New York Minute.

{"value":"With a cast of stalwart British character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film. Unfortunately I found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - I couldn't quite believe how awful it was. I must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time, but this was really hard going.<br /><br />As others have noted, a major problem is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a bit gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in! It's not believable on any level, either the storyline itself or the fact that Daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time. Other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave Donald Sinden as a songwriter (a songwriter for God's sake!), the fact he has Diana Dors for a fiancée and doesn't appear to have the slightest interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher's office. The whole thing's silly in the worst possible way.<br /><br />If I had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after that

{"value":"I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi.

{"value":"A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up. Unfortunately, the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully did in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book, because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is droll the entire way through, and hardly does any acting until the end. We never really find out what he does for a living, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion. This book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film. Besides that, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old Winston he was supposed to be portraying. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen.

{"value":"This kid is rather bad, but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn. No, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems. A nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not. Through in a bizarre Michael Richards character and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. I actually prefer the sequel to this film as I like the fact they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is. Even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one, and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too. The plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart, they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion. Add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort. Not sure about this character, at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. Not all that good, but I will pick this ahead of that Culkin kid any day of the
