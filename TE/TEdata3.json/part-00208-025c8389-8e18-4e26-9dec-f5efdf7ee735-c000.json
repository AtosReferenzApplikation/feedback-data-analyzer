{"value":"OK. I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved. So, when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie, I decided to tag along. I wish I'd stayed home and watched the TV show instead.<br /><br />The fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie. The plot is next to non-existant, the characters seem to exist in a vacuum, and, worst of all, Gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever. It appears that Disney took all of the things that make Inspector Gadget work on TV and tossed them all. To be fair, my younger child (8 years old) liked the movie but the older one (10 years old) came away thinking it silly (he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor).<br /><br />Generally, I like Disney films but this one misses by a mile. It is OK for a very narrow age band (say 7 to 9) but a must miss for everybody else.","finished_norm":["okai","i","think","the","tv","show","be","kind","of","cute","and","it","alwai","have","some","kind","of","lesson","involv","so","when","my","kid","decid","thei","want","to","see","thi","movi","i","decid","to","tag","along","i","wish","i","have","stai","home","and","watch","the","tv","show","insteadbr","br","the","fact","that","the","humor","be","silli","and","unorigin","be","the","littl","of","the","problem","with","thi","movi","the","plot","be","next","to","nonexist","the","charact","seem","to","exist","in","a","vacuum","and","wrong","of","all","gadget","doe","not","carri","ani","lesson","whatsoev","it","appear","that","disnei","take","all","of","the","thing","that","make","inspector","gadget","work","on","tv","and","toss","them","all","to","be","fair","my","young","child","year","old","like","the","movi","but","the","old","on","year","old","come","awai","think","it","silli","he","be","too","old","for","the","youth","humor","but","too","young","for","ani","of","the","adult","humorbr","br","gener","i","like","disnei","film","but","thi","on","miss","by","a","mile","it","be","okai","for","a","veri","narrow","ag","band","sai","to","but","a","must","miss","for","everybodi","els"],"filtered":["okai","think","tv","show","kind","cute","alwai","kind","lesson","involv","kid","decid","thei","want","see","thi","movi","decid","tag","along","wish","stai","home","watch","tv","show","insteadbr","br","fact","humor","silli","unorigin","littl","problem","thi","movi","plot","next","nonexist","charact","seem","exist","vacuum","wrong","gadget","doe","carri","ani","lesson","whatsoev","appear","disnei","take","thing","make","inspector","gadget","work","tv","toss","fair","young","child","year","old","like","movi","old","year","old","come","awai","think","silli","old","youth","humor","young","ani","adult","humorbr","br","gener","like","disnei","film","thi","miss","mile","okai","veri","narrow","ag","band","sai","must","miss","everybodi","els"],"filtered2":["okai","think","tv","show","kind","cute","alwai","kind","lesson","involv","kid","decid","want","see","decid","tag","along","wish","stai","home","watch","tv","show","insteadbr","fact","humor","silli","unorigin","littl","problem","plot","next","nonexist","charact","seem","exist","vacuum","wrong","gadget","doe","carri","ani","lesson","whatsoev","appear","disnei","take","thing","make","inspector","gadget","work","tv","toss","fair","young","child","year","old","like","old","year","old","come","awai","think","silli","old","youth","humor","young","ani","adult","humorbr","gener","like","disnei","miss","mile","okai","veri","narrow","ag","band","must","miss","everybodi","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,10,12,14,15,18,25,27,28,29,31,32,34,35,37,48,57,67,97,114,122,135,141,155,167,170,172,180,191,196,197,225,241,249,255,297,302,324,366,369,385,399,442,528,621,734,841,855,877,927,991,1206,1215,1272,1484,1640,1879,2215,2324,2382,3354,4885,5110,8113],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,10,12,14,15,18,25,27,28,29,31,32,34,35,37,48,57,67,97,114,122,135,141,155,167,170,172,180,191,196,197,225,241,249,255,297,302,324,366,369,385,399,442,528,621,734,841,855,877,927,991,1206,1215,1272,1484,1640,1879,2215,2324,2382,3354,4885,5110,8113],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.2796387880827016,2.600540117735859,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.6955116224012472,3.668325173349496,7.8283661557066315,2.0545557924622586,2.4433074195966826,4.497869534746497,4.732488142874176,2.2657547357741192,2.3074766467914385,2.4609576687888097,2.4214486257841834,7.500422683079545,2.7097314792693545,5.092022696851891,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.641219492619754,2.6627744961815836,5.3509388313256645,5.3509388313256645,2.813490713560207,2.902686292364678,2.8753661172782943,3.008694896185175,6.243658221875298,6.18993968377476,3.129115117668582,3.257696649984802,3.4198487640477615,3.5446859617576822,3.79165684915245,8.60733041033498,3.9201351739255808,3.865219416329466,4.251780369798478,4.004218291136122,4.364659717870332,4.291900363587903,8.832568166551278,4.484804029712395,4.688631791727313,12.132536180208179,4.979216623837056,5.604922523601468,5.102830579804232,5.583416318380505,6.1754673820690815,6.137727054086234,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.3963750387914215E-4,1.395137640275363E-4,1.3954821105359317E-4,1.3952015739942527E-4,1.3953336132737322E-4,1.395129947907303E-4,1.3955638526901267E-4,1.394922375

{"value":"Discovery Channel/Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This Fantasy is modeled after the \"Walking with Dinosuars\" series. Even though this is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci-Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.<br /><br />On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10. Don't get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong. I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.<br /><br />I also think this weakens the great \"Walking with Dinosuars\" series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.","finished_norm":["discoveri","channelanim","planet","must","be","asham","of","themselv","thi","fantasi","be","model","after","the","walk","with","dinosuar","seri","even","though","thi","be","fantasi","it","be","present","in","the","same","factual","and","archaeolog","wai","even","mix","the","fantasi","dragon","with","trex","and","the","extinct","of","the","dino","add","to","be","show","on","a","educ","channel","instead","of","sai","scifi","it","give","a","air","of","factual","authent","to","thi","showbr","br","on","it","own","the","show","be","about","a","far","a","entertain","go","but","the","wai","in","which","it","be","present","i","have","to","give","it","a","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","have","no","problem","with","fantasi","but","thei","wai","thei","put","thi","out","be","so","wrong","i","can","realli","see","young","kid","and","slow","adult","believ","that","thei","do","find","a","dragon","and","that","thi","be","realbr","br","i","conjur","think","thi","weaken","the","great","walk","with","dinosuar","seri","becaus","now","you","have","to","view","that","with","a","mind","of","how","much","be","fantasi","on","that","miniseri"],"filtered":["discoveri","channelanim","planet","must","asham","themselv","thi","fantasi","model","walk","dinosuar","seri","even","though","thi","fantasi","present","factual","archaeolog","wai","even","mix","fantasi","dragon","trex","extinct","dino","add","show","educ","channel","instead","sai","scifi","give","air","factual","authent","thi","showbr","br","show","far","entertain","go","wai","present","give","get","wrong","problem","fantasi","thei","wai","thei","put","thi","wrong","realli","see","young","kid","slow","adult","believ","thei","find","dragon","thi","realbr","br","conjur","think","thi","weaken","great","walk","dinosuar","seri","becaus","view","mind","much","fantasi","miniseri"],"filtered2":["discoveri","channelanim","planet","must","asham","themselv","fantasi","model","walk","dinosuar","even","though","fantasi","present","factual","archaeolog","wai","even","mix","fantasi","dragon","trex","extinct","dino","add","show","educ","channel","instead","scifi","give","air","factual","authent","showbr","show","far","entertain","go","wai","present","give","get","wrong","problem","fantasi","wai","put","wrong","realli","see","young","kid","slow","adult","believ","find","dragon","realbr","conjur","think","weaken","great","walk","dinosuar","becaus","view","mind","fantasi","miniseri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,12,13,22,25,28,30,33,38,39,51,86,91,101,114,135,141,152,159,167,195,238,294,299,312,390,411,436,679,728,734,781,782,996,1007,1105,1477,1584,1719,2389,3113,3251,3568,4895,5041,5093,6502,7557,7570],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,12,13,22,25,28,30,33,38,39,51,86,91,101,114,135,141,152,159,167,195,238,294,299,312,390,411,436,679,728,734,781,782,996,1007,1105,1477,1584,1719,2389,3113,3251,3568,4895,5041,5093,6502,7557,7570],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,3.0904588387038183,2.6728839783437044,4.205560634305565,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7139899308309823,2.031112399272319,2.0105926690411424,2.098582041218749,2.4433074195966826,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,2.3131195476980753,2.300267965194495,2.4609576687888097,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,5.773557018660078,2.7949961309240425,2.8824835850471584,3.132778125427319,6.458012315043746,3.2070272508030975,3.6715125373103863,3.7740817043309423,3.79165684915245,3.9363956947973615,3.7568101178222815,20.651295060157437,4.358390104856736,4.390138803171316,10.179516996473758,4.597282013139085,4.74221603786142,5.170884043049248,5.649374286172302,5.501738287366237,5.672363804397,6.489124940924123,12.511020179485236,6.660975197850782,6.489124940924123,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8341338219946435E-4,1.8325085032897537E-4,1.8329609637950112E-4,1.832592480010136E-4,1.8327659131506585E-4,1.832498399390702E-4,1.83306833183406E-4,1.832225753516671E-4,1.8325088905716926E-4,1.834402589938744E-4,1.8489580405681546E-4,1.832511917402506E-4,1.8342474219911888E-4,1.8344385189267553E-4,1.8336051814059898E-4,1.8325996983266748E-4,1.8332301834983033E-4,1.834092907855143E-4,1.8326943075474964E-4,1.8326876070352743E-4,1.834336388134801E-4,1.8328712236231627E-4,1.8328739975149178E-4,1.8340481562219995E-4,1.832694968646481E-4,1.8344604449948906E-4,1.8331535934666972E-4,1.8325043962579604E-4,1.8333351754392825E-4,1.8338947357617624E-4,1.8328802141531582E-4,1.83386186488204E-4,1.8347622452756656E-4,1.8364651891350798E-4,1.8331504257257505E-4,1.8325985868259065E-4,1.8332593421105953E-4,1.8

{"value":"If you liked \"Blair with\" you'll like this one. It has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.<br /><br />It also has Tom Savini, so if you like Romero's \"Dawn of the dead\" or Tarantino and Rodriguez' \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" you're in for a treat. He is an icon and a very good actor as well.<br /><br />No, seriously. This movie is definitely the lousiest movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well. I can tell you that I find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but this was just a pure waste of time.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth... No, I'm just kidding.

{"value":"I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not. But this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not, that may prevent many from just not caring about a Shakespeare based story.<br /><br />The largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during character's interacting, it's nearly difficult to distinguish who's lines are who's. Granted, I believe this movie is dubbed in English. Certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic, literary lines.<br /><br />It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1, although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget. Still, it's absolutely painful and boring.

{"value":"Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.This film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.No sex, no blood(it's suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90'T.V film.It's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.So Rest in peace Bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:Zombi 3, Robowar,Rats, l'altro inferno,Virus, Cruel jaws and few others.So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco's spirit's new film, pass on this

{"value":"I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie, although having very good FX, better then I expected, was NOT a good movie. I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time, that ruined it even more (and Im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood.

{"value":"I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance. Quite a few people walked out, and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst.<br /><br />At 106 minutes, it is at least 95 minutes too long. You get to watch the main character's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate, in extended real time. The same grimaces, hand over mouth motions, kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again - WE GET THE POINT.<br /><br />One site actually compares this work to early Mike Leigh. What drugs would you have to be on to make that statement? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you'd have to be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film. Unbelievably, this won a jury award at the festival.

{"value":"The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as thus : \" An experiment on a severed arm goes awry \" so right away I thought this was going to be about an arm that`s got a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone getting an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS . Both premises are tried and tested , or to be more accurate tired and tested so I was curious as to how the producers would approach the story . I actually thought they were making an arthouse movie like PI down to the use of B&W photography at the start of the film but the makers seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD . I`ve very little to say on this except that I disliked THE EVIL DEAD movies and I disliked SEVERED TIES and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third

{"value":"Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. He travels to this small town where it's said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community.<br /><br />His car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the town is wondering who murdered this woman...who I guess was the witch but I am not entirely sure. Ivan is now being pursued by her spirit, or something, and he has to have faith, or something, to beat it.<br /><br />I really hate Christian films. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid storyline and minimal effects. Not to mention that this isn't just a Christian film...but a foreign one as well. The voice-over actor for Ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing, because it is so high pitched and whiny.

{"value":"Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not her, than what other reason to watch this. five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition. Problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting, and the group are short a few people. Then, a killer is on the loose. I honestly wanted to say I was going to enjoy this one. It had a fair set up, or maybe that was just Daphne Zuniga in it. The film is too slow, and almost as silent as a library. Most of the acting is below average, and the \"point-of-view\" moments are so old news. Acclaimed composer Christopher Young of such films as \"Hellraiser\" and \"Entrapment\" scored this, in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a TV movie. Still, it seems higher than the movie deserves.

{"value":"Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling \"dial it down; think zombie, only less lively\" through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. If the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the Hallmark\\Lifetime TV channel crowd. As is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to catch a little snoozing time.

{"value":"I guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian Dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of Church & State and GOOD Science Fiction it is a terrible joke!<br /><br />There are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens.<br /><br />I WAS entertained by this movie in the same way I was entertained by \"Reefer Madness.\" That movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach \"Christian\" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world.<br /><br />It had me howling with laughter and

{"value":"I have seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this film is so awful, so BORING, that I got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest. A pity. Boasting talent such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged her cat, etc, etc, so Branagh has him sent to a nuthouse, and he promptly escapes. Somehow (I couldn't figure out how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary. I wanted to like this, and, being a huge Grisham fan, have read all about this movie and I (foolishly) expected something interesting.

{"value":"I finally got to have a look at this experimental Lynch short after waiting for so long....and unfortunately, it wasn't worth it! Even for a die hard Lynch fan, I found this to be really tedious....<br /><br />nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful pauses where nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing, or caring, what the hell it was all about, what happened before and what happened afterward. <br /><br />There was a Mulholland Drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita -esque, and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly. <br /><br />Unfortunately, It's all very uninteresting and very dull, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and I think i will delete it from my computer and forget I ever watched it.

{"value":"This is not really a proper review since I did not see most of the film. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that is not why I stopped watching.<br /><br />Here was the problem: I watched just enough to be introduced to several characters, all of whom were not interesting. Everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath, with no engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look forward to. I found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them.<br /><br />If there had been even one person of interest, and I don't mean good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. Watch \"State of Grace\" to see what I mean. In that film the Gary Oldman character is a complete lunatic, but he is *very* interesting.

{"value":"Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying something or another. She tracks him down (how?) and he tells her of the natives' stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle. Turns out to be the Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the film's best dialogue), who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers. Normally I'm very open-minded to varying opinions about any film, but this is the sole exception. This is the worst film ever made. If you don't agree, you haven't seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it \"unendurable,\" which is the best one-word summary I can think of.

{"value":"I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue I've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections

{"value":"I love Columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot. A mind-bogglingly tedious, pointless, muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored-looking Peter Falk. The 'plot', such as it is, just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with. One part of the proceedings which I found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was Peter Falk's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's first name a secret, why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous?

{"value":"Blazing saddles! It's a fight between two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences, with dippy love-interest Debra Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the TV whiz-kid behind \"Moonlighting\") smothers the darkly-textured comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with a presentation so slick, the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant. It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature, but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities. These aren't even characters, they're plot functions. Barely-released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good.

{"value":"Looking through the other comments, I'm amazed that there aren't any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage. First off, I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered Indiana Jones knock-off. What I got was one of the most offensive movies I can remember trying to sit through, made all the more shocking by the movie's comparatively high production values.<br /><br />I don't think this is a spoiler, but if it is, be warned...<br /><br />If your idea of entertainment is watching Bimbo getting raped from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief, while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other's severed head, by all means, rent this flick.

{"value":"As much as I like Japanese movies this one didn't just cut it... A movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot.<br /><br />The photography is OK, though I've seen much better sword fight scenes in other Japanese movies, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn't convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak you don't even notice its presence.But worst of all was the way the plot evolved.I have to admit that, at some times, I had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on...Anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence.<br /><br />All in all, if your looking for an action Japanese movie this isn't it.

{"value":"This really should have been a one star, but there was so many, clichés, predictable twists, seen it all before slasher flick parallels that I actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh...although this was never the directors intention Im sure.<br /><br />I don't often write comments about films, they have to be either sensational, or in this ones case really bad.<br /><br />To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it I knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films.<br /><br />Somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through, possibly for the hilarious voice of MR T, (not relay Mr T, but you'll know what I mean if you bother to watch this), if you do watch it, make sure you don't pay to see it.

{"value":"I'm stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did. It's an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated cliché' of a film that had two big names from the past in it (both of whom did a decent job), but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels. I like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching this--and before we saw the rating-we said, \"There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. It's possible to make a good film like that (and Away from Her is an example), but this was amateur hour. There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one. Truly, another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films. Watch The Family Stone.

{"value":"Well, if it weren't for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (here billed without the Jr.), Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes I've seen from the early talkie era and wouldn't have been worth seeing because of that. Ms. Waters is excellent here singing \"Am I Blue?\" and \"Underneath Our Harlem Moon\" while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult. He's so good tap-dancing here that for awhile I thought he was a little person with decades of experience. So if you're willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should provide some good enjoyment. P.S. This marks the fourth time today I've seen and heard the song, \"I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You\" performed on film, this time by Davis.

{"value":"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an \"edge-of-the-seat\" film. But it disappoints, and disappoints severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to \"spoil\" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the \"Friday the 13th\" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his

{"value":"Set in the 70s, \"Seed\" centers around convicted serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is sentenced to death, but in the electric chair he doesn't die, even after being shocked three times.<br /><br />Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Paré) and other officers cover up this secret by burying Seed alive. Seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin.<br /><br />Filmed by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), \"Seed\" is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline. And he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they will be set free. This is an urban legend, and it would never happen.

{"value":"This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this movie.Get on the Bus while apparenly anti racist, does nothing but berate whites and degrade the black status quo. The plot of this movie is about a group of black men who travel on a bus to Louis Farrakhan's million man march. The bus has every type of person you could imagine:gay, muslim, gangbanger and the Uncle Tom(He is thrown off the bus though). There was one only white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist the minute he got on the bus to drive. Despite him being a jew and the fact that he explained is situation he ended up being a racist and leaving the bus.I hate to say it but films like this need to realize their own hipocracy and rienforcation of steryotypes. This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment. You may think I am a racist for writing this but I mean well.

{"value":"One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid. They've both sold themselves out in this one, worse than Pryor's character. Two: Horrible, overly sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie its so cliched. Three: Choice of a black actor as the toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable, as its never addressed. There's no message here, Pryor's part could have been played by any comedic actor. Four: That kid...I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting...that would mean movies like this one and Kid Co. might not have been made...and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power. So if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick, go ahead.

{"value":"\"Arahan\" adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre. To compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake.<br /><br />Firstly the fight scenes are nothing new. All that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fights in intelligent Motion Pictures need logic. There seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the \"Matrix\" sequels.<br /><br />The attractive female lead So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in \"House Of Flying Daggers\". Having a Martial Arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. To cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (See Aya Ueto in \"Asumi\") unless you are a very talented director which as \"Arahan\" proves Seung-wan Ryoo is

{"value":"I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time.<br /><br />Trying to get the 'same characters' with different people is *such* a bad idea. If they couldn't get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this one, they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it. Instead they get NEW actors that are horrible at what they did. I seriously felt like I was at a High School or (bad) College play with the lever of acting these people put forth.<br /><br />Where do they get some of these people? Was this their first movie? It sure seemed like it.<br /><br />This movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech. I had just got done watching the first one and popped #2 in. I was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show I've seen in a while. I don't hardly EVER *EVER* turn off a movie, but this one definitely went off after about 30 - 40

{"value":"This was one of the worst movies EVER!!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing through the WHOLE movie! The plot was SO cheesy; especially the end. This movie turns from an end-of-the-world-disaster to save-the-eels! I mean, c'mon! And I swear...I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced. How predictable! It was SO terrible that my mom, my sister, and I couldn't finish it, and when we DID finish it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time, we did MST3K-like comments throughout the movie.<br /><br />Summary: Only watch this if you're a movie basher! Make hilarious comments, watch this at a sleepover for laughs, and I mean HUGE laughs. Also watch for mockery.
