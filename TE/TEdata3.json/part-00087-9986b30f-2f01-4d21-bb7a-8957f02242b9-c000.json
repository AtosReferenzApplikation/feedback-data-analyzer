{"value":"I considered myself to be quite melancholy, especially when I watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies. But not for this one (which surprised me!) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.<br /><br />There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies: 1. Despite guilt-ridden Ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action. Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly, in the end this was a disturbing action to me.<br /><br />2. The movie story line is over-dramatized, but the logic is over-simplified. Medically, blood type match is required to be an organ donor. Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type, same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.<br /><br />3. Why the doctors allow Ben's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?<br /><br />I might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie. However, some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie. If you go for a soap-opera type of film, go for it. But it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment, give this one a miss!","finished_norm":["i","consid","myself","to","be","quit","melancholi","especi","when","i","watch","a","great","touch","and","tearjerk","movi","but","not","for","thi","on","which","surpris","me","and","it","be","conjur","realli","surpris","me","to","see","how","mani","peopl","prais","thi","movi","so","highlybr","br","there","be","sever","disturb","fact","throughout","the","movi","despit","guiltridden","ben","real","intent","to","save","live","to","redeem","hi","past","i","find","it","disturb","that","the","film","seem","encourag","thi","typ","of","suicid","action","some","peopl","mai","perceiv","thi","be","a","heroic","action","and","some","other","think","he","behav","cowardli","in","the","end","thi","be","a","disturb","action","to","mebr","br","the","movi","stori","line","be","overdramat","but","the","logic","be","oversimplifi","medic","blood","typ","match","be","requir","to","be","a","organ","donor","toward","the","end","of","the","film","we","learn","that","emili","have","rear","blood","typ","that","limit","her","chanc","to","get","the","donor","within","short","time","period","nevertheless","it","seem","that","ben","have","the","rare","blood","typ","same","a","her","which","allow","him","to","be","her","donor","and","conveni","despit","the","rariti","of","ben","blood","typ","he","be","abl","to","donat","not","onli","hi","heart","but","conjur","hi","kidnei","hi","corneum","and","hi","bone","marrow","which","in","all","case","requir","not","onli","match","blood","typ","but","conjur","tissu","antigenbr","br","why","the","doctor","allow","ben","organ","be","donat","despit","the","jellyfish","venom","he","us","to","kill","himselfbr","br","i","mai","be","overanalyz","the","whole","stori","a","after","all","thi","be","just","a","movi","howev","some","disturb","fact","outlin","abov","hopefulli","will","help","you","reconsid","your","plan","to","go","to","watch","thi","movi","if","you","go","for","a","soapopera","typ","of","film","go","for","it","but","it","you","go","seek","for","a","intellig","entertain","give","thi","on","a","miss"],"filtered":["consid","quit","melancholi","especi","watch","great","touch","tearjerk","movi","thi","surpris","conjur","realli","surpris","see","mani","peopl","prais","thi","movi","highlybr","br","sever","disturb","fact","throughout","movi","despit","guiltridden","ben","real","intent","save","live","redeem","hi","past","find","disturb","film","seem","encourag","thi","typ","suicid","action","peopl","mai","perceiv","thi","heroic","action","think","behav","cowardli","end","thi","disturb","action","mebr","br","movi","stori","line","overdramat","logic","oversimplifi","medic","blood","typ","match","requir","organ","donor","toward","end","film","learn","emili","rear","blood","typ","limit","chanc","get","donor","within","short","time","period","nevertheless","seem","ben","rare","blood","typ","allow","donor","conveni","despit","rariti","ben","blood","typ","abl","donat","onli","hi","heart","conjur","hi","kidnei","hi","corneum","hi","bone","marrow","case","requir","onli","match","blood","typ","conjur","tissu","antigenbr","br","doctor","allow","ben","organ","donat","despit","jellyfish","venom","us","kill","himselfbr","br","mai","overanalyz","whole","stori","thi","movi","howev","disturb","fact","outlin","abov","hopefulli","help","reconsid","plan","go","watch","thi","movi","go","soapopera","typ","film","go","go","seek","intellig","entertain","give","thi","miss"],"filtered2":["consid","quit","melancholi","especi","watch","great","touch","tearjerk","surpris","conjur","realli","surpris","see","mani","peopl","prais","highlybr","sever","disturb","fact","throughout","despit","guiltridden","ben","real","intent","save","live","redeem","past","find","disturb","seem","encourag","typ","suicid","action","peopl","mai","perceiv","heroic","action","think","behav","cowardli","end","disturb","action","mebr","stori","line","overdramat","logic","oversimplifi","medic","blood","typ","match","requir","organ","donor","toward","end","learn","emili","rear","blood","typ","limit","chanc","get","donor","within","short","time","period","nevertheless","seem","ben","rare","blood","typ","allow","donor","conveni","despit","rariti","ben","blood","typ","abl","donat","onli","heart","conjur","kidnei","corneum","bone","marrow","case","requir","onli","match","blood","typ","conjur","tissu","antigenbr","doctor","allow","ben","organ","donat","despit","jellyfish","venom","us","kill","himselfbr","mai","overanalyz","whole","stori","howev","disturb","fact","outlin","abov","hopefulli","help","reconsid","plan","go","watch","go","soapopera","typ","go","go","seek","intellig","entertain","give","miss"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,8,11,12,13,17,23,24,30,35,38,39,46,50,51,56,76,80,97,107,111,113,116,120,129,185,189,195,255,267,272,288,316,317,326,355,384,391,430,438,440,454,486,521,563,581,603,614,634,672,693,704,743,745,811,839,854,919,973,989,1013,1027,1238,1372,1599,1645,1649,1696,1819,1840,2181,2256,2416,2464,3422,

{"value":"Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies. This movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine. But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. I mean come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this!! This is a move that I recommend NOT to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence! Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good

{"value":"The longer this film went on-and it seemed to tediously go on for ever- the more annoyed I became, as quite frankly, what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense. How on earth do people get to make films like this,or indeed receive finance for such rubbish? Don't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time. And in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns, so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the USA has such an obscene and fatal 'gun culture'. <br /><br />Anyhow:<br /><br />The lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an Urban sprawl.He comes across a family with two spoiled brat children, a teenage girl and boy; taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope. The cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice-versa, and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser.<br /><br />The cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression.A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living, and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally.<br /><br />Ask

{"value":"Any movie in which Brooke Shields out-acts a Fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror. Shields actually is only bad because she's youthful, inexperienced, and clearly not well directed by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. I liked him in Ulee's Gold, years later, but Lord above, he's awful here. Not that anyone else is good. There's not a single performance (outside Henry Fonda's delightful cameo) that is even passable. I've never seen a movie with this many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the chief villain, it's clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction, as he's done good work in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The writing is just bloody awful, and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say. But they say them so badly! The editing and direction are worse than pedestrian. Shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason, or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized. This picture was far worse than I'd imagined and would have been utterly forgotten (and probably never even made) without the participation of a couple of famous names. One bright spot: the cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big-screen Imax productions have not quite done so well. And finally: either this is a bad version of Paper Moon, with a lovable pair of father-daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty-something and a 13-year-old. It suggests more of the latter than the former, and thus is pretty disturbing.","finished_norm":["ani","movi","in","which","brook","shield","outact","a","fonda","be","go","to","be","both","a","anomali","and","a","horror","shield","actual","be","onli","bad","becaus","she","youth","inexperienc","and","clearli","not","good","direct","by","her","costar","peter","fonda","be","bad","becaus","good","becaus","he","bad","i","like","him","in","ule","gold","year","late","but","lord","abov","he","aw","here","not","that","anyon","els","be","good","there","not","a","singl","perform","outsid","henri","fonda","delight","cameo","that","be","even","passabl","i","have","never","see","a","movi","with","thi","mani","bad","perform","in","the","case","of","luke","askew","the","chief","villain","it","clear","thi","be","becaus","of","poor","dialogu","and","direct","a","he","do","good","work","in","the","past","but","hi","partner","plai","by","ted","markland","be","a","embarrass","ham","the","write","be","just","bloodi","aw","and","the","actor","cannot","be","fault","for","the","terribl","thing","thei","have","to","sai","but","thei","sai","them","so","badli","the","edit","and","direct","be","wrong","than","pedestrian","shot","be","hold","wai","too","long","for","no","dramat","reason","or","cut","off","befor","the","impact","of","the","scene","can","be","realiz","thi","pictur","be","far","wrong","than","i","have","imagin","and","would","have","be","utterli","forget","and","probabl","never","even","make","without","the","particip","of","a","coupl","of","famou","name","on","bright","spot","the","cinematographi","in","the","grand","canyon","be","exquisit","captur","the","beauti","of","that","area","in","a","wai","even","bigscreen","imax","product","have","not","quit","do","so","good","and","final","either","thi","be","a","bad","version","of","paper","moon","with","a","lovabl","pair","of","fatherdaught","typ","or","it","a","bad","version","of","pretti","babi","with","a","consider","much","icki","romant","relationship","between","a","fortysometh","and","a","yearold","it","suggest","much","of","the","latter","than","the","former","and","thu","be","pretti","disturb"],"filtered":["ani","movi","brook","shield","outact","fonda","go","anomali","horror","shield","actual","onli","bad","becaus","youth","inexperienc","clearli","good","direct","costar","peter","fonda","bad","becaus","good","becaus","bad","like","ule","gold","year","late","lord","abov","aw","anyon","els","good","singl","perform","outsid","henri","fonda","delight","cameo","even","passabl","never","see","movi","thi","mani","bad","perform","case","luke","askew","chief","villain","clear","thi","becaus","poor","dialogu","direct","good","work","past","hi","partner","plai","ted","markland","embarrass","ham","write","bloodi","aw","actor","fault","terribl","thing","thei","sai","thei","sai","badli","edit","direct","wrong","pedestrian","shot","hold","wai","long","dramat","reason","cut","befor","impact","scene","realiz","thi","pictur","far","wrong","imagin","utterli","forget","probabl","never","even","make","without","particip","coupl","famou","name","bright","spot","cinematographi","grand","canyon","exquisit","captur","beauti","area","wai","even","bigscreen","imax","product","quit","good","final","either","thi","bad","version","paper","moon","lovabl","pair","fatherdaught","typ","bad","version","pretti","babi","consider","much","icki","romant","relationship","fortysometh","yearold","suggest","much","latter","former","thu","pretti","disturb"],"filtered2":["ani","brook","shield","outact","fonda","go","anomali","horror","shield","actual","onli","bad","becaus","youth","inexperienc","clearli","good","direct","costar","peter","fonda","bad","becaus","good","becaus","bad","like","ule","gold","year","late","lord","abov","aw","anyon","els","good","singl","perform","outsid","henri","fonda","delight","cameo","even","passabl","never","see","mani","bad","perform","case","luke","askew","chief","villain","clear","becaus","poor","dialogu","direct","good","work","past","partner","plai","ted","markland","embarrass","ham","write","bloodi","aw","actor","fault","terribl","thing","badli","edit","direct","wrong","pedestrian","shot","hold","wai","long","dramat","reason","cut","befor","impact","scene","realiz","pictur","far","wrong","imagin","utterli","forget","probabl","never","even","make","without","particip","coupl","famou","name","bright","spot","cinematographi","grand","canyon","exquisit","captur","beauti","area","wai","even","bigscreen","imax","product","quit","good","final","either","bad","version","paper","moon","lovabl","pair","fatherdaught","typ","bad","version","pretti","babi","consider","icki","romant","relationship","fortysometh","yearold","suggest","latter","former","thu","pretti","disturb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,9,11,19,22,25,27,29,33,40,41,42,48,50,52,57,65,78,79,83,95,99,101,102,105,120,125,138,143,146,148,150,156,158,166,190,196,207,220,248,253,288,303,311,325,340,348,373,384,405,414,440,441,443,448,494,520,557,577,590,629,646,698,704

{"value":"When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore sub-par production values, and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare. This movies simply has no good scares to offer. It can't even be enjoyed as camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the kills were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was wretched, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but who had to deal with terrible, contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they got any rehearsal, either. It's embarrassing to watch, and so boring than making it through to the contrived \"surprise\" ending requires tremendous endurance. It's quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you must watch this movie, don't miss the \"Making of\"-featurette. The writer/director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold, daring move. (Seen it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it's a new-age \"Citizen Kane.\" It's like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant. They truly think they've created something of substance. It's sad, really The only reason I gave this movie a \"2\" is because I think \"1\" should be reserved for true atrocities, like \"Manos: Hands of Fate\" and \"Space Mutiny.\" So \"American Nightmare\" isn't the WORST movie I've ever seen, but I'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty.","finished_norm":["when","it","come","to","horror","movi","i","be","much","than","will","to","suspend","disbelief","ignor","subpar","product","valu","and","overlook","plot","hole","in","the","interest","of","a","good","scare","thi","movi","simpli","have","no","good","scare","to","offer","it","ca","not","even","be","enjoi","a","camp","bad","dialogu","bad","act","bad","direct","the","kill","be","predict","and","poorli","stage","the","music","be","annoi","the","camera","work","be","wretch","even","the","costum","be","bad","i","feel","realli","bad","for","the","actor","who","be","obvious","try","but","who","have","to","deal","with","terribl","contriv","dialogu","and","a","obviou","lack","of","direct","i","doubt","thei","get","ani","rehears","either","it","embarrass","to","watch","and","so","bore","than","make","it","through","to","the","contriv","surpris","end","requir","tremend","endur","it","quit","easili","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","i","do","not","normal","write","review","but","thi","on","be","so","bad","that","i","feel","compel","to","warn","other","thi","movi","be","a","complet","wast","of","time","if","you","must","watch","thi","movi","do","not","miss","the","make","offeaturett","the","writerdirector","seem","to","be","under","the","impress","that","make","the","killer","a","woman","be","kind","of","bold","dare","move","see","it","he","and","the","cast","spend","half","a","hour","deconstruct","thi","film","a","if","it","a","newag","citizen","kane","it","like","listen","to","a","group","of","thirdgrad","take","you","behind","the","scene","of","their","christma","pageant","thei","truli","think","thei","have","creat","someth","of","substanc","it","sad","realli","the","onli","reason","i","give","thi","movi","a","be","becaus","i","think","should","be","reserv","for","true","atroc","like","mano","hand","of","fate","and","space","mutini","so","american","nightmar","be","not","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","but","i","have","have","to","sai","that","it","somewher","in","the","bottom","fifti"],"filtered":["come","horror","movi","much","suspend","disbelief","ignor","subpar","product","valu","overlook","plot","hole","interest","good","scare","thi","movi","simpli","good","scare","offer","ca","even","enjoi","camp","bad","dialogu","bad","act","bad","direct","kill","predict","poorli","stage","music","annoi","camera","work","wretch","even","costum","bad","feel","realli","bad","actor","obvious","try","deal","terribl","contriv","dialogu","obviou","lack","direct","doubt","thei","get","ani","rehears","either","embarrass","watch","bore","make","contriv","surpris","end","requir","tremend","endur","quit","easili","wrong","movi","ever","seenbr","br","normal","write","review","thi","bad","feel","compel","warn","thi","movi","complet","wast","time","must","watch","thi","movi","miss","make","offeaturett","writerdirector","seem","impress","make","killer","woman","kind","bold","dare","move","see","cast","spend","half","hour","deconstruct","thi","film","newag","citizen","kane","like","listen","group","thirdgrad","take","behind","scene","christma","pageant","thei","truli","think","thei","creat","someth","substanc","sad","realli","onli","reason","give","thi","movi","becaus","think","reserv","true","atroc","like","mano","hand","fate","space","mutini","american","nightmar","wrong","movi","ever","see","sai","somewher","bottom","fifti"],"filtered2":["come","horror","suspend","disbelief","ignor","subpar","product","valu","overlook","plot","hole","interest","good","scare","simpli","good","scare","offer","ca","even","enjoi","camp","bad","dialogu","bad","act","bad","direct","kill","predict","poorli","stage","music","annoi","camera","work","wretch","even","costum","bad","feel","realli","bad","actor","obvious","try","deal","terribl","contriv","dialogu","obviou","lack","direct","doubt","get","ani","rehears","either","embarrass","watch","bore","make","contriv","surpris","end","requir","tremend","endur","quit","easili","wrong","ever","seenbr","normal","write","review","bad","feel","compel","warn","complet","wast","time","must","watch","miss","make","offeaturett","writerdirector","seem","impress","make","killer","woman","kind","bold","dare","move","see","cast","spend","half","hour","deconstruct","newag","citizen","kane","like","listen","group","thirdgrad","take","behind","scene","christma","pageant","truli","think","creat","someth","substanc","sad","realli","onli","reason","give","becaus","think","reserv","true","atroc","like","mano","hand","fate","space","mutini","american","nightmar","wrong","ever","see","somewher","bottom","fifti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13,19,21,22,24,25,27,30,31,32,34,35,36,41,43,44,48,53,60,65,70,76,81,83,89,92,95,102,103,108,118,120,122,141,166,174,176,183,190,200,201,206,207,223,231,235,248,252,255,271,275,283,304,326,337,341,343,362,383,393,398,410,418,451,455,468,507,527,557,567,583,623,637,669,700,748,763,776,804,810,845,86

{"value":"I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. That has been done in great detail already, many times over. The 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles. Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason I went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene. It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan's face in the bar in 'Russia' (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part. Having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.<br /><br />I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD, I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets. This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.","finished_norm":["i","shall","not","wast","my","time","write","anyth","much","far","about","how","everi","aspect","of","thi","film","be","indescrib","bad","that","have","be","do","in","great","detail","alreadi","mani","time","over","the","plot","start","out","a","a","veri","uninspir","cocknei","wideboygangsterbynumb","bear","and","veri","quickli","descend","into","a","utter","shambl","anybodi","who","pretend","that","thei","can","see","some","hide","masterpiec","insid","thi","aw","mess","be","just","kid","themselv","it","be","now","or","year","sinc","i","watch","it","dure","it","week","run","at","the","cinema","befor","it","be","pull","yet","it","stick","in","my","mind","for","be","easili","the","much","terribl","film","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","i","be","onli","make","thi","comment","and","ind","the","onli","reason","i","go","to","see","the","film","be","becaus","of","the","amus","fact","that","my","brother","eddi","appear","in","it","a","the","heavi","in","the","pub","scene","it","be","hi","hand","that","thrust","a","zippo","light","toward","rhy","ifan","face","in","the","bar","in","russia","it","be","actual","film","at","the","former","butlin","holidai","camp","at","barri","island","my","brother","have","absolut","no","act","experi","whatsoev","he","have","recent","join","a","extra","agenc","and","thi","be","hi","part","have","see","the","film","it","appear","that","nobodi","in","it","requir","ani","act","experi","whatsoeverbr","br","i","rememb","there","be","about","peopl","in","the","whole","cinema","and","thi","be","just","a","coupl","of","dai","after","it","have","be","releas","i","have","never","hear","of","a","other","film","that","be","so","unpopular","and","disappear","so","fast","and","rightli","so","in","case","you","be","think","of","rent","thi","film","on","dvd","i","would","advis","you","instead","to","put","your","two","pound","coin","in","a","fire","until","thei","be","redhot","then","jam","them","into","your","ey","socket","thi","will","probabl","be","a","lot","littl","pain","than","watch","the","film"],"filtered":["shall","wast","time","write","anyth","much","far","everi","aspect","thi","film","indescrib","bad","great","detail","alreadi","mani","time","plot","start","veri","uninspir","cocknei","wideboygangsterbynumb","bear","veri","quickli","descend","utter","shambl","anybodi","pretend","thei","see","hide","masterpiec","insid","thi","aw","mess","kid","themselv","year","sinc","watch","dure","week","run","cinema","befor","pull","yet","stick","mind","easili","much","terribl","film","ever","seenbr","br","onli","make","thi","comment","ind","onli","reason","go","see","film","becaus","amus","fact","brother","eddi","appear","heavi","pub","scene","hi","hand","thrust","zippo","light","toward","rhy","ifan","face","bar","russia","actual","film","former","butlin","holidai","camp","barri","island","brother","absolut","act","experi","whatsoev","recent","join","extra","agenc","thi","hi","part","see","film","appear","nobodi","requir","ani","act","experi","whatsoeverbr","br","rememb","peopl","whole","cinema","thi","coupl","dai","releas","never","hear","film","unpopular","disappear","fast","rightli","case","think","rent","thi","film","dvd","advis","instead","put","two","pound","coin","fire","thei","redhot","jam","ey","socket","thi","probabl","lot","littl","pain","watch","film"],"filtered2":["shall","wast","time","write","anyth","far","everi","aspect","indescrib","bad","great","detail","alreadi","mani","time","plot","start","veri","uninspir","cocknei","wideboygangsterbynumb","bear","veri","quickli","descend","utter","shambl","anybodi","pretend","see","hide","masterpiec","insid","aw","mess","kid","themselv","year","sinc","watch","dure","week","run","cinema","befor","pull","yet","stick","mind","easili","terribl","ever","seenbr","onli","make","comment","ind","onli","reason","go","see","becaus","amus","fact","brother","eddi","appear","heavi","pub","scene","hand","thrust","zippo","light","toward","rhy","ifan","face","bar","russia","actual","former","butlin","holidai","camp","barri","island","brother","absolut","act","experi","whatsoev","recent","join","extra","agenc","part","see","appear","nobodi","requir","ani","act","experi","whatsoeverbr","rememb","peopl","whole","cinema","coupl","dai","releas","never","hear","unpopular","disappear","fast","rightli","case","think","rent","dvd","advis","instead","put","two","pound","coin","fire","redhot","jam","ey","socket","probabl","lot","littl","pain","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,19,21,22,23,27,32,42,44,47,50,51,52,57,61,65,71,72,79,85,89,95,97,101,104,111,114,132,137,138,148,152,159,162,166,169,194,216,222,235,238,239,247,251,253,280,281,288,290,327,330,333,353,381,407,409,416,436,459,525,542,544,551,562,563,583,645,661,707,708,720,741,771,829,857,866,891,908,989,992,1001,1024,1040,1070,1174,1177,1203,1209,1319,1368,1549,1618,2031,2043,2432,2671,2796,2930,3109,3771,4264,4288,4603,4888,6059,6107,6680,6827,8119,8204

{"value":"Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! This movie, while a great attempt at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L+H movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars, Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can, and learn how things WERE. You know what a MAGNATE is, don't you? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin 'Here's another fine mess'? Why skip 'any the wiser'? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ????

{"value":"You ever get that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chores and watching a movie so bad it defies reason? Well, out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the T-Rex. Knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was the T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I KNEW I had to rent this just cause I was in the mood for a bad movie.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its fortune and shareholders than lives, and of course, a big, poorly animated, sock-puppet T-Rex. Is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies? Not to mention the Rex's hungry is never satisfied...ever. How he has hungry is beyond me because he actually doesn't have an throat (Really if you look down his mouth when he roars, it's solid...like a toy or something). Now, I like watching incredibly bad B-Movies from time to time because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. This one was hilarious. I'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you will laugh. <br /><br />Do I blame the movie's budget...yes, but the acting didn't help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles...when you cry shouldn't \"tears\" come out? Meh, I am not going to be angry at this movie, i knew what i was getting into and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then immediately watch Jurassic Park and then Lost World back to back.

{"value":"There is no possible reason I can fathom why this movie was ever made.<br /><br />Why must Hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another? ( Cases in point: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - awful! )<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was so miserably miscast in this role. His manic portrayal of our beloved \"Uncle Martin\" is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal. His ranting, groaning, grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character.<br /><br />The director must have thought that fast movements, screaming dialogue and \"one-take\" slapstick had some similarity to comedy. Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants.<br /><br />Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script. I think the writer used \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" as an example of a fine comedy script. As manic as that 1963 classic is, it is far superior to this claptrap - in fact - suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison.<br /><br />What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children. I just am not sure whose children it was made for. Certainly no self-respecting, card-carrying child I know!<br /><br />If they HAD to remake \"My Favorite Martian\", why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /><br />Unfortunately, IMDB.com cannot factor in \"zero\" as a rating for its readers, that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty.<br /><br />One good thing did come from this movie, the actors and crew were paid - I

{"value":"SOME NOT-SO-SPOILY SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Why do people, when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club, cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /><br />Who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room? <br /><br />How often do you knock on a stranger's door and when they don't IMMEDIATELY answer, you open the door, walk in, shout a few hello's and then start going through their stuff? <br /><br />If you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer, what would you do? Quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements? Run, quietly of course, to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure? <br /><br />I could be talking about almost any thriller that's come out in the last few years, but since this is the \"The Return\" page, obviously I'm talking about \"The Return.\" I saw it free because I work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the \"scary\" movies. I thought this one was tolerable... aside from the well-worn clichés. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really drab and looks kind of \"Huh?\" through most of the film. The details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn't enough explanation as it moved on and so I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie, eh, I guess it's worth a matinée ticket. If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can't wait...

{"value":"I remember this show being on the television when I was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs. It was called power rangers. I remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.<br /><br />I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. The footage is ridiculous at best. The colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts. All the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.<br /><br />The toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. And of course two of the worst movies ever made, and I do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on.<br /><br />Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising. As an adult, I don't look at it fondly, but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows, fashion and guys'

{"value":"Zu Warriors most definitely should've been an animated series because as a movie it's like watching an old anime on acid.The movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something.Whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical God /Demon/Wizard thing.The plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie.The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying,princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something.Even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like (yes that's a word!).I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand....who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all.It felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time.I can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching Inu-Yasha at episode 134 drunk...yeah

{"value":"Spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors I have ever seen. He is the critic's darling because he supposedly makes films with a \"message\" or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula Hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different.<br /><br />Summer Of Sam does not even do that well. The cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone, and so is the narrative. The plot is a lot like \"Do The Right thing\". The portrayal of \"Guidos\" or for the PC set Italian-Americans (of which I happen to be one) is straight out of Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of a macho Italian guy picking a fight with a much taller African-American is much, MUCH more believable than the cartoonish, broad Italian caricatures shown here (the John Leguizamo character being a possible exception).<br /><br />Is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up? As soon as Richie came into the film I could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach, I could already see him being accused of being the killer. This character had the most integrity in the whole film so, of course, Lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd (what a white bearded clique!)<br /><br />Someone please, please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to all the Basketball games he wants. So, maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we won't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore I won't have to see critics (some of them whom I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an Emperor with no

{"value":"I *loved* the original Scary Movie. I'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. I think the Wayans' are a family of comical geniuses. Alas, even geniuses make mistakes.<br /><br />The movie begins with promise. I liked \"The Exorcist\" parody, especially the \"come on out, ma\" gag. Now, that's Wayans-quality material. But, other than that, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he's saying, \"It was just a booty call!!\" That was kinda funny. 2) The \"Save the Last Dance\" parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags. Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. For example, in Scary Movie I, several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay. This was hilarious. But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is the pattern of the whole film. Shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /><br />As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one a 2 out of 10.","finished_norm":["i","love","the","origin","scari","movi","i","be","a","huge","fan","of","parodi","it","be","my","favorit","form","of","humor","it","be","sometim","regard","a","the","much","intellig","form","of","humor","the","wayan","boi","seem","to","grasp","that","concept","perfectli","in","the","origin","film","then","temporarili","forget","it","when","make","the","sequel","i","think","the","wayan","be","a","famili","of","comic","geniu","ala","even","geniu","make","mistakesbr","br","the","movi","begin","with","promis","i","like","the","exorcist","parodi","especi","the","come","on","out","ma","gag","now","that","wayansqu","materi","but","other","than","that","i","can","onli","think","of","two","other","time","i","laugh","when","toru","spell","be","seduc","in","the","middl","of","the","night","by","a","spirit","then","becom","clingi","and","start","talk","about","marriag","with","him","meanwhil","he","sai","it","be","just","a","booti","call","that","be","kinda","funni","the","save","the","last","danc","parodi","where","the","cindi","charact","inadvert","beat","up","a","girl","while","practic","her","new","move","but","even","the","shortliv","giggl","be","no","match","for","the","sidesplit","laugh","of","the","scari","moviebr","br","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","pure","trash","fill","with","cheap","grossout","gag","joke","from","the","movi","which","be","subtl","or","impli","be","magnifi","and","overdo","for","exampl","in","scari","movi","i","sever","innuendo","be","make","to","impli","that","the","charact","rai","be","gai","thi","be","hilari","but","in","scari","movi","ii","the","whole","penisstrangul","scene","with","rai","under","the","bed","be","mindnumb","and","incredibli","unfunni","thi","be","the","pattern","of","the","whole","film","shock","humor","alon","doe","not","take","a","movi","veri","far","thi","be","a","trend","in","and","unfortun","br","br","a","much","a","it","pain","me","to","rate","a","wayan","movi","so","low","i","have","to","give","thi","on","a","out","of"],"filtered":["love","origin","scari","movi","huge","fan","parodi","favorit","form","humor","sometim","regard","much","intellig","form","humor","wayan","boi","seem","grasp","concept","perfectli","origin","film","temporarili","forget","make","sequel","think","wayan","famili","comic","geniu","ala","even","geniu","make","mistakesbr","br","movi","begin","promis","like","exorcist","parodi","especi","come","ma","gag","wayansqu","materi","onli","think","two","time","laugh","toru","spell","seduc","middl","night","spirit","becom","clingi","start","talk","marriag","meanwhil","sai","booti","call","kinda","funni","save","last","danc","parodi","cindi","charact","inadvert","beat","girl","practic","new","move","even","shortliv","giggl","match","sidesplit","laugh","scari","moviebr","br","rest","movi","pure","trash","fill","cheap","grossout","gag","joke","movi","subtl","impli","magnifi","overdo","exampl","scari","movi","sever","innuendo","make","impli","charact","rai","gai","thi","hilari","scari","movi","ii","whole","penisstrangul","scene","rai","bed","mindnumb","incredibli","unfunni","thi","pattern","whole","film","shock","humor","alon","doe","take","movi","veri","far","thi","trend","unfortun","br","br","much","pain","rate","wayan","movi","low","give","thi"],"filtered2":["love","origin","scari","huge","fan","parodi","favorit","form","humor","sometim","regard","intellig","form","humor","wayan","boi","seem","grasp","concept","perfectli","origin","temporarili","forget","make","sequel","think","wayan","famili","comic","geniu","ala","even","geniu","make","mistakesbr","begin","promis","like","exorcist","parodi","especi","come","ma","gag","wayansqu","materi","onli","think","two","time","laugh","toru","spell","seduc","middl","night","spirit","becom","clingi","start","talk","marriag","meanwhil","booti","call","kinda","funni","save","last","danc","parodi","cindi","charact","inadvert","beat","girl","practic","new","move","even","shortliv","giggl","match","sidesplit","laugh","scari","moviebr","rest","pure","trash","fill","cheap","grossout","gag","joke","subtl","impli","magnifi","overdo","exampl","scari","sever","innuendo","make","impli","charact","rai","gai","hilari","scari","ii","whole","penisstrangul","scene","rai","bed","mindnumb","incredibli","unfunni","pattern","whole","shock","humor","alon","doe","take","veri","far","trend","unfortun","pain","rate","wayan","low","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,8,10,11,12,15,18,19,30,31,34,35,47,54,62,69,71,84,87,101,111,115,133,140,142,144,147,182,186,189,202,210,214,217,226,227,267,275,282,307,316,351,369,373,387,396,444,457,459,465,480,492,500,508,537,553,554,603,632,640,671,678,683,687,690,725,726,822,894,917,919,948,998,1019,1065,1169,1294,1341,1397,1462,1475,1478,1558,1727,1783,1977,2006,2203,2660,2873,3037,3086,3516,3697,4028,4702,4973,5674,5682,5801,6131,7243,7886,8536],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

{"value":"Isabel Allende's magical, lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive Latin mellifluousness of Allende's characters, and a plodding Scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make certain I had not missed something vital that might change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had not missed a thing. None among Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director Bille August. All of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, by putting forth as little effort as possible, they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets. (Yes, the film was art directed within an inch of its life.) Curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing KFC products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before KFC came into being. Back then, it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even pardoning that, what on earth is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. \"The House of the Spirits\" should have been the motion picture event of 1993. Because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have pressed charges for rape.","finished_norm":["isabel","allend","magic","lyric","novel","about","three","gener","of","a","aristocrat","south","american","famili","be","vandal","the","lumber","oaf","of","a","movi","that","resultedlarg","due","to","a","magnific","cast","of","anglo","actor","complet","unabl","to","carri","off","the","evas","latin","melliflu","of","allend","charact","and","a","plod","scandinavian","directori","handwa","so","uncomfort","in","it","own","skin","that","i","return","to","the","theater","a","time","to","make","certain","i","have","not","miss","someth","vital","that","mai","chang","my","opinion","to","my","disappoint","i","have","not","miss","a","thing","none","among","meryl","streep","jeremi","iron","glenn","close","and","vanessa","redgrav","can","wiggl","free","of","the","trap","set","for","them","by","director","bill","august","all","of","them","look","perfectli","stiff","and","resign","a","if","by","putt","forth","a","littl","effort","a","possibl","thei","expect","to","fade","unnot","into","love","period","set","ye","the","film","be","art","direct","within","a","inch","of","it","life","curiou","that","the","product","design","be","permit","the","gaff","of","place","kfc","product","promin","in","a","scene","that","occur","circa","year","befor","kfc","come","into","be","back","then","it","be","know","by","it","origin","name","kentucki","fry","chicken","even","pardon","that","what","on","earth","be","kentucki","fry","chicken","do","in","a","militari","dictatorship","in","south","america","in","american","fast","food","chain","do","not","hit","south","america","until","the","earli","the","hous","of","the","spirit","should","have","be","the","motion","pictur","event","of","becaus","it","be","so","clubfoot","and","slavishli","faith","to","it","vagu","idea","of","what","the","novel","repres","miramax","have","to","market","it","a","a","art","film","a","a","result","it","be","neither","event","nor","art","and","for","that","isabel","allend","should","have","press","charg","for","rape"],"filtered":["isabel","allend","magic","lyric","novel","three","gener","aristocrat","south","american","famili","vandal","lumber","oaf","movi","resultedlarg","due","magnific","cast","anglo","actor","complet","unabl","carri","evas","latin","melliflu","allend","charact","plod","scandinavian","directori","handwa","uncomfort","skin","return","theater","time","make","certain","miss","someth","vital","mai","chang","opinion","disappoint","miss","thing","none","among","meryl","streep","jeremi","iron","glenn","close","vanessa","redgrav","wiggl","free","trap","set","director","bill","august","look","perfectli","stiff","resign","putt","forth","littl","effort","possibl","thei","expect","fade","unnot","love","period","set","ye","film","art","direct","within","inch","life","curiou","product","design","permit","gaff","place","kfc","product","promin","scene","occur","circa","year","befor","kfc","come","back","know","origin","name","kentucki","fry","chicken","even","pardon","earth","kentucki","fry","chicken","militari","dictatorship","south","america","american","fast","food","chain","hit","south","america","earli","hous","spirit","motion","pictur","event","becaus","clubfoot","slavishli","faith","vagu","idea","novel","repres","miramax","market","art","film","result","neither","event","art","isabel","allend","press","charg","rape"],"filtered2":["isabel","allend","magic","lyric","novel","three","gener","aristocrat","south","american","famili","vandal","lumber","oaf","resultedlarg","due","magnific","cast","anglo","actor","complet","unabl","carri","evas","latin","melliflu","allend","charact","plod","scandinavian","directori","handwa","uncomfort","skin","return","theater","time","make","certain","miss","someth","vital","mai","chang","opinion","disappoint","miss","thing","none","among","meryl","streep","jeremi","iron","glenn","close","vanessa","redgrav","wiggl","free","trap","set","director","bill","august","look","perfectli","stiff","resign","putt","forth","littl","effort","possibl","expect","fade","unnot","love","period","set","ye","art","direct","within","inch","life","curiou","product","design","permit","gaff","place","kfc","product","promin","scene","occur","circa","year","befor","kfc","come","back","know","origin","name","kentucki","fry","chicken","even","pardon","earth","kentucki","fry","chicken","militari","dictatorship","south","america","american","fast","food","chain","hit","south","america","earli","hous","spirit","motion","pictur","event","becaus","clubfoot","slavishli","faith","vagu","idea","novel","repres","miramax","market","art","result","neither","event","art","isabel","allend","press","charg","rape"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,10,14,16,19,22,26,29,34,41,46,53,54,57,58,63,69,75,79,92,102,103,109,123,130,143,164,182,187,190,209,213,223,224,225,255,266,278,295,311,370,382,388,401,402,424,447,470,474,488,522,538,542,568,621,672,681,686,718,722,743,746,774,809,826,894,984,1021,1022,1072,1154,1213,1241,1246,1253,1299

{"value":"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show.<br /><br />Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at \"Scripts-R-Us\", where you buy a standard blank \"Monster Movie\" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually \"let's split up\" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie.

{"value":"This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the \"Wild Western Canada\" is left. When Archie began to write his stories for the papers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert/absorb the First Nation Peoples.<br /><br />The film puts forward and asks the question; why would a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian?<br /><br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is. Sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't it.<br /><br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the \"Cigar store Indian\" a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done acting on the part of Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and or reality of it weren't realized till he met and married his wife, Annie.<br /><br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the Englishman's world stage, not as himself but Grey Owl -an Canadian Native of the wilderness frontier.<br /><br /> This is the closest Archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype.<br /><br /> Mr. Brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors is both well done. I have watched documentaries on Grey Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.<br /><br />Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Grand

{"value":"It doesn't take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head didn't make it onto the network schedules. The TV pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be. Maybe I missed something, because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. Based on what I got out of the muddled mess, a terrorist or thief or something named \"Tree\" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The world's dullest secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is out to stop him. There might have been more, but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway.<br /><br />Action movies should have action. Suspenseful moments should have suspense. And dramatic moments should have drama. There's none of that in Code Name: Diamond Head. I've seen others use the word \"turgid\" to describe this made for TV snoozer  and it's better than any one word description I can come up with. None of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about. And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable. His charisma is just slightly north of a slug. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member. Now if McShane had been cast in the series lead, well then you might have had something.<br /><br />I'm quickly discovering that these Gawd awful 70s made-for-TV movies make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots. So while I may only give the movie a 3/10, I rate Episode #608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating

{"value":"Nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure crap. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then, and even as a child I didn't like it. Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are overacting, and how much the special-FX sucked even back then. When the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. I don't know about you, but I didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all, and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very cliché alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. You never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.<br /><br />There is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is just a quick way to make some money though. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I \"just don't get it\" anyway, or something along that line. I really don't care though; this was crap back then and it still crap

{"value":"I have to admit that I'm a great fan of this show, so you must know how disappointed I got when I watched this movie. First of all, the plot was awful, I thought it was going to be something more interesting, like to see what happened to Arnold fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, between many other places, so many people tries to stop this.<br /><br />I must admit that the plot wasn't so bad after all, but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy,; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for God sake), and to worse everything, they make super-moves on the bus, things that many persons had already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, 'cause they are experts on a video game.<br /><br />Honestly, my mom, my sister, even me got really disappointed after watching this movie, 'cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I must admit that I used to enjoy \"Hey Arnold!\", it was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after this crap of movie, I'm not quite sure if I'm going to watch \"Hey Arnold!\" as I used to watch it on the past.<br /><br />Other thing Nickelodeon, with that enormous number of dynamite I can assure you that not a simple street would explode, I think that the whole city could explode with that, oh, and please, if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that, don't do more movies, you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good.<br /><br />Honestly,

{"value":"\"The Screaming Skull\" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when I first saw \"House on Haunted Hill\" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958!

{"value":"Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...<br /><br />I thought \"Straightheads\" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I didn't dislike the phrase a great deal I would call \"Straightheads\" a video nasty. Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's. Frankly I don't know how \"Straightheads\" got a cinema release.<br /><br />I am not a prude. I don't mind sex and violence in the movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterisation or c) preferably both. \"Straightheads\" had neither. No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid. Luckily \"Straightheads\" went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long.<br /><br />It was a shame, because there was the germ of an interesting film here, with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it could have been good if it had been done properly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film. She, especially, is very underrated (and is still particularly fit).<br /><br />If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows' \"Dead Man's Shoes\".

{"value":"I've seen all kinds of \"Hamlet\"s. <br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's was most ambitious, Mel Gibson's was quick and to the point, Laurence Olivier's was the best - hands down. But now we come to Maximilian Schell's take on the Bard.<br /><br />For one, this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare's venerable chestnut. But if there's a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade school-level. <br /><br />Having seen it on MST3K helps, with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject.<br /><br />Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. Best lines? \"I'm gonna unleash the Great Dane\", \"I don't think so, 'breather'\", \"Meet the Beatles\", \"Hey, Dad, will you help me with my science project\" and, my personal favorite, during a party - \"Garrison Keillor's leaving Germany (YAAAY!!)\".<br /><br />But then there's Schell, playing Shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would, only not as expressive. No doubt he's a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in \"The Silver Chalice\". Ever see that one?

But, when her dad gets ratted out, and then killed (I hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you'd have to be brain-dead and blind not to see this coming in the film) he's pretty emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip (metaphorically) of his hat, leaves her behind to save his dad, never mind her loss, and says (paraphrasing) \"If god wills it, we'll meet again\"... Basically meaning, \"I'm gonna get my dad and MY job done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye!\" - callus beyond even low-life Hollywood standards...<br /><br />#3) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie, that you can drive all the jeeps, trucks camels and any extra stuff through it. Pass - really, complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but NOT worth watching just for this.<br /><br />Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 I'd

{"value":"While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film, it's surprisingly watchable on several levels. First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s.<br /><br />A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water, it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry!!! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film--so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film--since both of them starred in many grade-z horror films. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over-generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans.","finished_norm":["while","thi","film","certainli","doe","possess","the","stench","of","a","bad","film","it","surprisingli","watchabl","on","sever","level","for","old","movi","fan","it","interest","to","see","the","lead","role","plai","by","dean","jagger","no","relat","to","mick","while","jagger","late","go","on","to","a","veri","respect","role","a","a","support","actor","even","garner","the","oscar","in","thi","categori","for","o","clock","high","here","hi","perform","be","truli","uniqu","sinc","he","actual","have","a","full","head","of","hair","i","never","see","him","thi","wai","befor","and","becaus","he","be","by","far","the","wrong","actor","in","the","film","thi","film","just","go","to","show","that","if","a","actor","cannot","act","in","hi","earli","film","doe","not","mean","he","ca","not","eventu","learn","to","be","a","great","actor","anoth","good","exampl","of","thi","phenomenon","be","paul","newman","whose","movi","the","silver","chalic","be","consid","on","of","the","wrong","film","of","the","sbr","br","a","reason","to","watch","the","film","be","the","shear","cheesi","of","it","all","the","write","be","bad","the","act","be","bad","and","the","special","effect","be","bad","for","exampl","when","jagger","and","a","unnam","cambodian","be","wade","through","the","water","it","obviou","thei","be","realli","just","walk","in","place","and","the","background","be","poorli","project","behind","them","plu","onc","thei","leav","the","water","their","costum","be","spindri","horrid","continu","and","mindlessli","bad","dialog","abound","throughout","the","filmso","much","so","that","it","hard","to","imagin","why","thei","do","not","ask","bela","lugosi","or","georg","zucco","to","star","in","the","filmsinc","both","of","them","star","in","mani","gradez","horror","film","in","mani","wai","thi","would","be","a","perfect","exampl","for","a","film","class","on","how","not","to","make","a","filmbr","br","so","while","give","it","a","be","probabl","a","bite","overgener","it","fun","to","laugh","at","and","short","so","it","worth","a","look","for","bad","film","fan"],"filtered":["thi","film","certainli","doe","possess","stench","bad","film","surprisingli","watchabl","sever","level","old","movi","fan","interest","see","lead","role","plai","dean","jagger","relat","mick","jagger","late","go","veri","respect","role","support","actor","even","garner","oscar","thi","categori","o","clock","high","hi","perform","truli","uniqu","sinc","actual","full","head","hair","never","see","thi","wai","befor","becaus","far","wrong","actor","film","thi","film","go","show","actor","act","hi","earli","film","doe","mean","ca","eventu","learn","great","actor","anoth","good","exampl","thi","phenomenon","paul","newman","whose","movi","silver","chalic","consid","wrong","film","sbr","br","reason","watch","film","shear","cheesi","write","bad","act","bad","special","effect","bad","exampl","jagger","unnam","cambodian","wade","water","obviou","thei","realli","walk","place","background","poorli","project","behind","plu","onc","thei","leav","water","costum","spindri","horrid","continu","mindlessli","bad","dialog","abound","throughout","filmso","much","hard","imagin","thei","ask","bela","lugosi","georg","zucco","star","filmsinc","star","mani","gradez","horror","film","mani","wai","thi","perfect","exampl","film","class","make","filmbr","br","give","probabl","bite","overgener","fun","laugh","short","worth","look","bad","film","fan"],"filtered2":["certainli","doe","possess","stench","bad","surprisingli","watchabl","sever","level","old","fan","interest","see","lead","role","plai","dean","jagger","relat","mick","jagger","late","go","veri","respect","role","support","actor","even","garner","oscar","categori","o","clock","high","perform","truli","uniqu","sinc","actual","full","head","hair","never","see","wai","befor","becaus","far","wrong","actor","go","show","actor","act","earli","doe","mean","ca","eventu","learn","great","actor","anoth","good","exampl","phenomenon","paul","newman","whose","silver","chalic","consid","wrong","sbr","reason","watch","shear","cheesi","write","bad","act","bad","special","effect","bad","exampl","jagger","unnam","cambodian","wade","water","obviou","realli","walk","place","background","poorli","project","behind","plu","onc","leav","water","costum","spindri","horrid","continu","mindlessli","bad","dialog","abound","throughout","filmso","hard","imagin","ask","bela","lugosi","georg","zucco","star","filmsinc","star","mani","gradez","horror","mani","wai","perfect","exampl","class","make","filmbr","give","probabl","bite","overgener","fun","laugh","short","worth","look","bad","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,9,13,15,16,18,21,22,25,28,30,33,40,41,42,50,51,52,60,65,67,73,74,79,81,83,88,95,100,101,105,106,128,133,140,148,150,154,157,162,164,171,203,208,211,219,236,259,266,272,294,306,307,316,317,336,340,343,383,389,393,398,430,432,433,438,445,458,543,566,598,628,660,677,680,695,716,749,776,801,813,830,840,90

{"value":"After being a big fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of 'Stella Street', I awaited this film with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately I was left feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />I was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the T.V Episodes, and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had said them once, and couldn't be bothered to say them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* The plot of the film starts with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey), gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years', including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster, and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people. There are some nice moments, but on the whole, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. *END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />In the T.V Episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including females), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. Her impersonations weren't funny, and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do.<br /><br />If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street, you may find this film entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated.

{"value":"This movie really shows its age. The print I saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. However, this was not the major problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur fashion. Sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces--all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and \"cleaverly\" (?) hide the fact that the film was dubbed. Well, its true that this Czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap.<br /><br />Overall, the film looked low budget and silly. It's really a shame though, because there was a grain of a good story--a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. EVEN with a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat chunky) Hedy Lamarr, it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even by 1933 standards, this film was a poorly made dud. About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to America--she looks like 2 completely different people.<br /><br />It's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film, I don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews. For technical problems alone, the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","realli","show","it","ag","the","print","i","see","be","terribl","due","to","ag","but","it","be","possibl","that","there","be","well","print","out","there","howev","thi","be","not","the","major","problem","with","the","movi","the","problem","be","that","although","the","film","be","make","in","it","be","essenti","a","silent","film","with","onli","the","bare","of","dialog","scatter","onli","a","few","sentenc","in","the","film","in","the","much","amateur","fashion","sometim","the","charact","back","be","turn","or","thei","be","talk","with","their","hand","over","their","facesal","in","a","pathet","attempt","to","obscur","their","lip","and","cleaverli","hide","the","fact","that","the","film","be","dub","good","it","true","that","thi","czech","film","would","ne","to","be","dub","into","mani","languag","but","to","do","it","thi","wai","be","realli","stupid","and","obviou","it","just","look","cheapbr","br","overal","the","film","look","low","budget","and","silli","it","realli","a","shame","though","becaus","there","be","a","grain","of","a","good","storya","young","woman","who","marri","a","old","man","who","be","either","gai","andor","have","no","interest","in","woman","but","in","the","st","centuri","few","peopl","would","realli","be","will","to","sit","through","thi","archaic","mess","even","with","a","few","glimps","of","the","nake","and","somewhat","chunki","hedi","lamarr","it","be","not","worth","all","the","fuss","that","accompani","the","film","when","it","debut","even","by","standard","thi","film","be","a","poorli","make","dud","about","the","onli","interest","thing","about","the","film","be","to","see","how","differ","lamarr","look","in","compar","with","the","glamor","imag","hollywood","creat","when","she","come","to","americash","look","like","complet","differ","peoplebr","br","it","such","a","incomplet","look","and","technic","inferior","film","i","do","not","see","how","it","have","get","such","rave","review","for","technic","problem","alon","the","movi","ca","not","rate","a","or","anyth","near","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","realli","show","ag","print","see","terribl","due","ag","possibl","well","print","howev","thi","major","problem","movi","problem","although","film","make","essenti","silent","film","onli","bare","dialog","scatter","onli","sentenc","film","much","amateur","fashion","sometim","charact","back","turn","thei","talk","hand","facesal","pathet","attempt","obscur","lip","cleaverli","hide","fact","film","dub","good","true","thi","czech","film","ne","dub","mani","languag","thi","wai","realli","stupid","obviou","look","cheapbr","br","overal","film","look","low","budget","silli","realli","shame","though","becaus","grain","good","storya","young","woman","marri","old","man","either","gai","andor","interest","woman","st","centuri","peopl","realli","sit","thi","archaic","mess","even","glimps","nake","somewhat","chunki","hedi","lamarr","worth","fuss","accompani","film","debut","even","standard","thi","film","poorli","make","dud","onli","interest","thing","film","see","differ","lamarr","look","compar","glamor","imag","hollywood","creat","come","americash","look","like","complet","differ","peoplebr","br","incomplet","look","technic","inferior","film","see","get","rave","review","technic","problem","alon","movi","ca","rate","anyth","near"],"filtered2":["realli","show","ag","print","see","terribl","due","ag","possibl","well","print","howev","major","problem","problem","although","make","essenti","silent","onli","bare","dialog","scatter","onli","sentenc","amateur","fashion","sometim","charact","back","turn","talk","hand","facesal","pathet","attempt","obscur","lip","cleaverli","hide","fact","dub","good","true","czech","ne","dub","mani","languag","wai","realli","stupid","obviou","look","cheapbr","overal","look","low","budget","silli","realli","shame","though","becaus","grain","good","storya","young","woman","marri","old","man","either","gai","andor","interest","woman","st","centuri","peopl","realli","sit","archaic","mess","even","glimps","nake","somewhat","chunki","hedi","lamarr","worth","fuss","accompani","debut","even","standard","poorli","make","dud","onli","interest","thing","see","differ","lamarr","look","compar","glamor","imag","hollywood","creat","come","americash","look","like","complet","differ","peoplebr","incomplet","look","technic","inferior","see","get","rave","review","technic","problem","alon","ca","rate","anyth","near"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,10,11,13,16,20,22,23,28,29,33,34,45,50,60,63,67,70,81,86,96,97,103,104,110,113,135,136,166,167,176,177,186,202,204,207,217,219,235,237,244,256,300,304,362,383,385,398,402,404,407,412,432,442,457,482,500,555,568,574,589,596,601,616,640,707,733,740,893,944,949,1037,1094,1127,1158,1163,1197,1225,1927,2000,2085,2114,2153,2255,2316,2405,2437,2752,3124,3463,4273,5053,5723,7534,7753,8126],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,

{"value":"***SPOILER*** Do not read this, if you think about watching that movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway)<br /><br />If you are wondering whether to see \"Coyote Ugly\" or not: don't! It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical \"Chick-Feel-Good-Flick\", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York. The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the \"tragic\" accident of the father, the \"difficulties\" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails in convincing one of \"Jersey's\" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and quite funny thing) about \"Coyote Ugly\" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.<br /><br />I was very astonished, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First \"Gone In 60 Seconds\" and now this... what happened to great movies like \"The Rock\" and \"Con Air\"? THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff.<br /><br />If you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see \"Charlie's Angels\" (it's much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this flick.<br /><br />Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).","finished_norm":["spoiler","do","not","read","thi","if","you","think","about","watch","that","movi","although","it","would","be","a","wast","of","time","by","the","wai","the","plot","be","so","predict","that","it","doe","not","make","ani","differ","if","you","read","thi","or","not","anywaybr","br","if","you","be","wonder","whether","to","see","coyot","ugli","or","not","do","not","it","not","worth","either","the","monei","for","the","ticket","or","the","vh","dvd","a","typic","chickfeelgoodflick","on","can","sai","the","plot","itself","be","a","shallow","a","it","can","be","a","ridicul","and","uncrit","version","of","the","american","dream","the","young","goodlook","girl","from","a","small","town","becom","a","big","success","in","new","york","the","few","desper","attempt","of","give","the","movi","ani","depth","fail","such","a","the","tragic","accid","of","the","father","the","difficulti","of","violet","relationship","with","her","boyfriend","and","so","on","mcnalli","director","try","to","arous","the","audienc","piti","and","sad","put","doe","not","have","ani","chanc","to","succ","in","thi","attempt","due","to","the","bad","script","and","the","shallow","act","especi","piper","perabo","complet","fail","in","convinc","on","of","jersei","fear","of","sing","in","front","of","a","audienc","the","onli","good","and","quit","funni","thing","about","coyot","ugli","be","john","goodman","who","repres","the","small","rai","of","hope","of","thi","moviebr","br","i","be","veri","astonish","that","jerri","bruckheim","produc","thi","movi","go","in","second","and","now","thi","what","happen","to","great","movi","like","the","rock","and","con","air","that","be","true","bruckheim","stuffbr","br","if","you","be","look","for","a","superfici","movi","with","good","look","woman","just","to","have","a","relax","even","you","should","well","go","and","see","charli","angel","it","much","much","funni","entertain","and","selfiron","instead","of","thi","flickbr","br","two","thumb","down","out","of"],"filtered":["spoiler","read","thi","think","watch","movi","although","wast","time","wai","plot","predict","doe","make","ani","differ","read","thi","anywaybr","br","wonder","whether","see","coyot","ugli","worth","either","monei","ticket","vh","dvd","typic","chickfeelgoodflick","sai","plot","shallow","ridicul","uncrit","version","american","dream","young","goodlook","girl","small","town","becom","big","success","new","york","desper","attempt","give","movi","ani","depth","fail","tragic","accid","father","difficulti","violet","relationship","boyfriend","mcnalli","director","try","arous","audienc","piti","sad","put","doe","ani","chanc","succ","thi","attempt","due","bad","script","shallow","act","especi","piper","perabo","complet","fail","convinc","jersei","fear","sing","front","audienc","onli","good","quit","funni","thing","coyot","ugli","john","goodman","repres","small","rai","hope","thi","moviebr","br","veri","astonish","jerri","bruckheim","produc","thi","movi","go","second","thi","happen","great","movi","like","rock","con","air","true","bruckheim","stuffbr","br","look","superfici","movi","good","look","woman","relax","even","well","go","see","charli","angel","much","much","funni","entertain","selfiron","instead","thi","flickbr","br","two","thumb"],"filtered2":["spoiler","read","think","watch","although","wast","time","wai","plot","predict","doe","make","ani","differ","read","anywaybr","wonder","whether","see","coyot","ugli","worth","either","monei","ticket","vh","dvd","typic","chickfeelgoodflick","plot","shallow","ridicul","uncrit","version","american","dream","young","goodlook","girl","small","town","becom","big","success","new","york","desper","attempt","give","ani","depth","fail","tragic","accid","father","difficulti","violet","relationship","boyfriend","mcnalli","director","try","arous","audienc","piti","sad","put","doe","ani","chanc","succ","attempt","due","bad","script","shallow","act","especi","piper","perabo","complet","fail","convinc","jersei","fear","sing","front","audienc","onli","good","quit","funni","thing","coyot","ugli","john","goodman","repres","small","rai","hope","moviebr","veri","astonish","jerri","bruckheim","produc","go","second","happen","great","like","rock","con","air","true","bruckheim","stuffbr","look","superfici","good","look","woman","relax","even","well","go","see","charli","angel","funni","entertain","selfiron","instead","flickbr","two","thumb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,16,18,20,21,27,29,30,32,33,36,47,51,58,62,70,77,82,84,87,89,94,103,115,120,126,135,145,152,159,168,175,177,181,195,204,207,215,219,220,223,237,247,261,267,274,291,304,337,342,363,450,455,465,478,486,490,532,568,577,582,597,607,613,659,679,773,788,812,827,895,914,947,1036,1050,1139,1150,1266,1325,1349,1432,1462,1490,2078,2178,2219,2278,2350,2444,3654,3676,4007,4124,4474,4689,4729,5635,6346,6402,6760,6937],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

{"value":"I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. I mean with the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover... the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed by the finished product. The film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson's performance compels you to pay attention each time she's on screen. Her performance of \"And I Am Telling You\" was the only time that I felt the hype was deserved. You cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. As many reviewers have stated, she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /><br />Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, cruised through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary \"Ray\" performance and Beyonce Knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping, posing and shimmying her way through the movie.

{"value":"What a dreadful movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby, dirty, mean-spirited, misanthropes living inside. These folks who presumably work together on complicated scientific projects cannot seem to agree on how to survive death at the hands of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers: An extra-nasty scientist whose main acting skill is \"leering\" and \"the sinister stare\" has cloned a Dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on this kind of thing, the other scientists are shocked, because apparently they were all way behind in their experiments and got caught with their pants down. The rest of the story is like THE THING, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and/or defeat the \"Dragon.\" The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details in the body of the Dragon. All it looks like is a gray blob. The acting is less than horrible. These scientists act like a bunch of children who cannot agree on anything, and this makes it easier for the Dragon to kill them off in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the cast of unknown actors in this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his supporting cast. This movie is really, really atrocious. The acting is bad. The story is dumb. The CGI is very very cheap and amateurish. There is nothing commendable about this movie, it is not even a good time-killer to glance at while doing chores or other work.","finished_norm":["what","a","dread","movi","for","some","reason","scientif","laboratori","and","outpost","alwai","have","a","staff","of","grubbi","dirti","meanspirit","misanthrop","live","insid","thi","folk","who","presum","work","togeth","on","complic","scientif","project","cannot","seem","to","agre","on","how","to","surviv","death","at","the","hand","of","a","cgi","dragon","spoiler","a","extranasti","scientist","whose","main","act","skill","be","leer","and","the","sinist","stare","have","clone","a","dragon","while","the","lab","be","suppos","to","work","on","thi","kind","of","thing","the","other","scientist","be","shock","becaus","appar","thei","be","all","wai","behind","in","their","experi","and","get","catch","with","their","pant","down","the","rest","of","the","stori","be","like","the","thing","or","ten","littl","indian","where","the","staff","be","hunt","and","kill","off","a","thei","try","to","formul","a","wai","to","escap","andor","defeat","the","dragon","the","cgi","dragon","creatur","be","dark","grai","which","seem","to","be","the","popular","color","for","much","of","the","cheap","cgi","special","effect","it","hardli","look","well","than","a","cartoon","and","the","dark","grai","tone","make","it","difficult","to","see","ani","interest","detail","in","the","bodi","of","the","dragon","all","it","look","like","be","a","grai","blob","the","act","be","littl","than","horribl","thi","scientist","act","like","a","bunch","of","child","who","cannot","agre","on","anyth","and","thi","make","it","easi","for","the","dragon","to","kill","them","off","in","variou","attempt","to","escap","hide","etc","dean","cain","be","hardli","well","than","ani","of","the","cast","of","unknown","actor","in","thi","movi","he","seem","to","sink","to","the","level","of","hi","support","cast","thi","movi","be","realli","realli","atroci","the","act","be","bad","the","stori","be","dumb","the","cgi","be","veri","veri","cheap","and","amateurish","there","be","noth","commend","about","thi","movi","it","be","not","even","a","good","timekil","to","glanc","at","while","do","chore","or","other","work"],"filtered":["dread","movi","reason","scientif","laboratori","outpost","alwai","staff","grubbi","dirti","meanspirit","misanthrop","live","insid","thi","folk","presum","work","togeth","complic","scientif","project","seem","agre","surviv","death","hand","cgi","dragon","spoiler","extranasti","scientist","whose","main","act","skill","leer","sinist","stare","clone","dragon","lab","suppos","work","thi","kind","thing","scientist","shock","becaus","appar","thei","wai","behind","experi","get","catch","pant","rest","stori","like","thing","ten","littl","indian","staff","hunt","kill","thei","try","formul","wai","escap","andor","defeat","dragon","cgi","dragon","creatur","dark","grai","seem","popular","color","much","cheap","cgi","special","effect","hardli","look","well","cartoon","dark","grai","tone","make","difficult","see","ani","interest","detail","bodi","dragon","look","like","grai","blob","act","littl","horribl","thi","scientist","act","like","bunch","child","agre","anyth","thi","make","easi","dragon","kill","variou","attempt","escap","hide","etc","dean","cain","hardli","well","ani","cast","unknown","actor","thi","movi","seem","sink","level","hi","support","cast","thi","movi","realli","realli","atroci","act","bad","stori","dumb","cgi","veri","veri","cheap","amateurish","noth","commend","thi","movi","even","good","timekil","glanc","chore","work"],"filtered2":["dread","reason","scientif","laboratori","outpost","alwai","staff","grubbi","dirti","meanspirit","misanthrop","live","insid","folk","presum","work","togeth","complic","scientif","project","seem","agre","surviv","death","hand","cgi","dragon","spoiler","extranasti","scientist","whose","main","act","skill","leer","sinist","stare","clone","dragon","lab","suppos","work","kind","thing","scientist","shock","becaus","appar","wai","behind","experi","get","catch","pant","rest","stori","like","thing","ten","littl","indian","staff","hunt","kill","try","formul","wai","escap","andor","defeat","dragon","cgi","dragon","creatur","dark","grai","seem","popular","color","cheap","cgi","special","effect","hardli","look","well","cartoon","dark","grai","tone","make","difficult","see","ani","interest","detail","bodi","dragon","look","like","grai","blob","act","littl","horribl","scientist","act","like","bunch","child","agre","anyth","make","easi","dragon","kill","variou","attempt","escap","hide","etc","dean","cain","hardli","well","ani","cast","unknown","actor","seem","sink","level","support","cast","realli","realli","atroci","act","bad","stori","dumb","cgi","veri","veri","cheap","amateurish","noth","commend","even","good","timekil","glanc","chore","work"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,9,13,14,15,16,17,20,21,22,27,29,33,35,36,41,48,49,60,76,92,95,104,106,116,122,149,177,179,180,197,203,226,230,235,245,270,308,333,351,368,376,393,419,420,429,445,458,490,508,512,545,598,622,638,653,660,665,70

{"value":"What I found so curious about this film--I saw the full 4 hour roadshow version, is how oddly dispassionate it is. For a film about 2 very charismatic men--Castro and Che, engaged in a gargantuan political struggle, it's almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level actor,with a slightly high pitched voice) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do this and that, with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in. Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro--Joaquim de Almeida, but he's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes a dullish epic-length film about hairy, bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end. Several of the reviews I've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely. (One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd, odd thing to do since a) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b) it's no more than a competent job of work, with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone's JFK in the black and white cut up camera-work when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie.","finished_norm":["what","i","find","so","curiou","about","thi","filmi","see","the","full","hour","roadshow","version","be","how","oddli","dispassion","it","be","for","a","film","about","veri","charismat","mencastro","and","che","engag","in","a","gargantuan","polit","struggl","it","almost","total","devoid","of","emot","fire","the","scene","between","benicio","del","toro","and","demian","bichir","who","be","at","well","a","level","actorwith","a","slightli","high","pitch","voic","have","no","drama","or","depth","and","basic","come","down","to","castro","tell","che","go","here","go","there","do","thi","and","that","with","no","explan","a","to","what","effect","or","us","thi","action","will","result","in","odd","still","be","there","be","a","actor","in","the","cast","who","have","the","requisit","power","to","plai","castrojoaquim","de","almeida","but","he","shunt","asid","in","a","minor","part","in","the","half","without","the","tension","or","passion","that","you","would","expect","to","fire","thi","man","and","their","follow","the","film","becom","a","dullish","epiclength","film","about","hairi","beard","man","run","through","variou","jungl","shout","and","shoot","to","no","particular","purpos","or","end","sever","of","the","review","i","have","read","shower","prais","on","the","work","of","director","steven","soderbergh","while","ignor","the","actor","almost","complet","on","in","fact","spend","much","time","talk","about","soderbergh","new","digit","film","camera","than","the","plot","or","actor","or","the","fact","that","it","entir","in","spanish","with","english","subtitlesthi","be","a","odd","odd","thing","to","do","sinc","a","soderbergh","be","onli","a","hire","gun","on","the","film","and","b","it","no","much","than","a","compet","job","of","work","with","a","unremark","upon","nod","to","oliv","stone","jfk","in","the","black","and","white","cut","up","camerawork","when","che","visit","new","york","if","you","can","imagin","red","direct","by","andrew","mclaglen","instead","of","warren","beatti","you","have","get","a","idea","of","the","dull","compet","of","thi","movi"],"filtered":["find","curiou","thi","filmi","see","full","hour","roadshow","version","oddli","dispassion","film","veri","charismat","mencastro","che","engag","gargantuan","polit","struggl","almost","total","devoid","emot","fire","scene","benicio","del","toro","demian","bichir","well","level","actorwith","slightli","high","pitch","voic","drama","depth","basic","come","castro","tell","che","go","go","thi","explan","effect","us","thi","action","result","odd","still","actor","cast","requisit","power","plai","castrojoaquim","de","almeida","shunt","asid","minor","part","half","without","tension","passion","expect","fire","thi","man","follow","film","becom","dullish","epiclength","film","hairi","beard","man","run","variou","jungl","shout","shoot","particular","purpos","end","sever","review","read","shower","prais","work","director","steven","soderbergh","ignor","actor","almost","complet","fact","spend","much","time","talk","soderbergh","new","digit","film","camera","plot","actor","fact","entir","spanish","english","subtitlesthi","odd","odd","thing","sinc","soderbergh","onli","hire","gun","film","b","much","compet","job","work","unremark","upon","nod","oliv","stone","jfk","black","white","cut","camerawork","che","visit","new","york","imagin","red","direct","andrew","mclaglen","instead","warren","beatti","get","idea","dull","compet","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["find","curiou","filmi","see","full","hour","roadshow","version","oddli","dispassion","veri","charismat","mencastro","che","engag","gargantuan","polit","struggl","almost","total","devoid","emot","fire","scene","benicio","del","toro","demian","bichir","well","level","actorwith","slightli","high","pitch","voic","drama","depth","basic","come","castro","tell","che","go","go","explan","effect","us","action","result","odd","still","actor","cast","requisit","power","plai","castrojoaquim","de","almeida","shunt","asid","minor","part","half","without","tension","passion","expect","fire","man","follow","becom","dullish","epiclength","hairi","beard","man","run","variou","jungl","shout","shoot","particular","purpos","end","sever","review","read","shower","prais","work","director","steven","soderbergh","ignor","actor","almost","complet","fact","spend","time","talk","soderbergh","new","digit","camera","plot","actor","fact","entir","spanish","english","subtitlesthi","odd","odd","thing","sinc","soderbergh","onli","hire","gun","b","compet","job","work","unremark","upon","nod","oliv","stone","jfk","black","white","cut","camerawork","che","visit","new","york","imagin","red","direct","andrew","mclaglen","instead","warren","beatti","get","idea","dull","compet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,8,11,15,19,20,24,29,32,34,38,40,41,45,48,56,58,61,64,87,90,92,97,102,103,106,115,117,123,125,129,130,131,137,145,152,162,174,176,184,186,198,206,211,220,229,231,260,283,286,289,303,316,336,340,359,366,367

{"value":"This film is absolutely awful, but nevertheless, it can be hilarious at times, although this humor is entirely unintentional.<br /><br />The plot was beyond ridiculous. I don't even think a 2 year-old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film-makers tried to slap together into a story. However, on the positive side, some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor. For example, \"Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard!\" It gets worse (and even funnier), but I'll spare you.<br /><br />The acting is generally laughable. Most of the kids' roles are sort of cute, but not very believable. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful all-around. The adults don't take their roles seriously at all, but this is largely a good thing. If they'd tried to be believable, the film would've been even worse. Which is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />Once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie, there are actually a few standout moments of almost-not-crappiness. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, though it's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police. The butler character, while very minor, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never quite pierces through the gloom.<br /><br />Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain. Nevertheless, there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally. Judged on its good parts alone, the movie would be about a 5; unfortunately, the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1. Thus, I give it a 3.<br /><br />That's being pretty generous, I'd
