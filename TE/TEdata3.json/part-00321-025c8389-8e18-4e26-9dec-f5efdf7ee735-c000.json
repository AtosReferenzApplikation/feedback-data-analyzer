{"value":"This film was the worst film I have ever viewed. It was like a \"homework assignment\" for a film class. It totally misses the mark when it comes to the \"message\" it is TRYING to relay. Characters are over exaggerated, poor acting and as for a plot...well it is utterly ridiculous. The cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film, the co-actor is handsome and that's about it. Moral of this movie: NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than I. It was painful to watch and quite frankly I am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it!","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","view","it","be","like","a","homework","assign","for","a","film","class","it","total","miss","the","mark","when","it","come","to","the","messag","it","be","try","to","relai","charact","be","over","exagger","poor","act","and","a","for","a","plotwel","it","be","utterli","ridicul","the","cover","shoot","be","what","make","me","think","it","mai","be","a","decent","film","the","coactor","be","handsom","and","that","about","it","moral","of","thi","movi","never","judg","a","movi","by","it","cover","save","your","time","monei","and","energi","and","make","your","own","home","movi","and","you","will","be","far","well","off","than","i","it","be","pain","to","watch","and","quit","frankli","i","be","surpris","that","anyon","would","spend","monei","to","make","and","distribut","it"],"filtered":["thi","film","wrong","film","ever","view","like","homework","assign","film","class","total","miss","mark","come","messag","try","relai","charact","exagger","poor","act","plotwel","utterli","ridicul","cover","shoot","make","think","mai","decent","film","coactor","handsom","moral","thi","movi","never","judg","movi","cover","save","time","monei","energi","make","home","movi","far","well","pain","watch","quit","frankli","surpris","anyon","spend","monei","make","distribut"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","view","like","homework","assign","class","total","miss","mark","come","messag","try","relai","charact","exagger","poor","act","plotwel","utterli","ridicul","cover","shoot","make","think","mai","decent","coactor","handsom","moral","never","judg","cover","save","time","monei","energi","make","home","far","well","pain","watch","quit","frankli","surpris","anyon","spend","monei","make","distribut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,10,12,20,21,25,34,36,42,44,46,101,117,120,126,146,158,184,189,255,274,283,302,309,312,326,458,491,569,628,717,816,878,1023,1333,1374,2046,2401,2470,2521,7368],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,10,12,20,21,25,34,36,42,44,46,101,117,120,126,146,158,184,189,255,274,283,302,309,312,326,458,491,569,628,717,816,878,1023,1333,1374,2046,2401,2470,2521,7368],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,2.2044500422972613,4.478254137980457,2.326138445979858,2.3106972614914807,2.496249838866882,2.498193474075453,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.7678802023081546,2.902686292364678,2.848772527704847,2.8824835850471584,2.942840385588056,3.2829611516442836,6.73955742280591,3.6436037491933098,3.607563812710113,3.7398317812878634,3.7881170224473255,4.067587905068712,4.1302590120314875,4.383707912841026,4.443131333311827,4.900964426937307,5.143104478942172,5.1994574154933035,5.214056214914456,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278305E-4,2.5058620691581333E-4,2.5064807858603375E-4,2.505976903047264E-4,2.5062140640359255E-4,2.505848252590658E-4,2.506627606186687E-4,2.505475423240715E-4,2.5058625987464645E-4,2.508452136206053E-4,2.5283559737960366E-4,2.505866737783479E-4,2.5082399519387334E-4,2.508501267267698E-4,2.507361720640578E-4,2.505986773727583E-4,2.5068489300962516E-4,2.5080286617253615E-4,2.506116147019671E-4,2.506106984410389E-4,2.5083616086100756E-4,2.5063580707447943E-4,2.5063618639005263E-4,2.507967466145736E-4,2.50611705103887E-4,2.508531250049425E-4,2.5067441971279007E-4,2.5058564530012806E-4,2.506992501229479E-4,2.5077576714783436E-4,2.5063703648367763E-4,2.5077127222240684E-4,2.508943946566084E-4,2.511272635582015E-4,2.506739865403454E-4,2.5059852538068784E-4,2.5068888030138403E-4,2.506239760011387E-4,2.505478097371298E-4,2.5061153709162826E-4,2.5086269267877043E-4,2.507250787007576E-4,2.5077184368692935E-4,2.5056027947365384E-4,2.506116008157935E-4,2.5059843114607423E-4,2.506832564429231E-4,2.5072672523291837E-4,2.506757413701452E-4,2.506360088222568E-4,2.5059905085673826E-4,2.5111248761528865E-4,2.506621087966182E-4,2.5061154337593277E-4,2.506607664081856E-4,2.5058590168330826E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867716E-4,2.5059940266573117E-4,2.505857586424852E-4,2.5078623326048414E-4,2.506855613798028E-4,2.5058565389105843E-4,2.5056017738973017E-4,2.5053498079616153E-4,2.5076150407809313E-4,2.505979299011485E-4,2.507118423993321E-4,2.507854199692586E-4,2.5067164350437744E-4,2.5061187530262E-4,2.5056050585742625E-4,2.506246038642507E-4,2.505603709024345E-4,2.505735199054818E-4,2.505605129489131E-4,2.5072316173520954E-4,2.50648538498599E-4,2.5058598835840635E-4,2.506102623091282E-4]}}
{"value":"I have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, a lot, but this is without a doubt the worst one ever! I usually like dumb movies, if they are somewhat entertaining, but I can't even think of one good thing about this movie. I like \"Teen Witch\" for Heaven's sake. But S.I.C.K. has horrible acting, lame porn music throughout the whole thing, and even the sex scenes sucked! I would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of \"Twin Dragons\", \"Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys\" or even \"a Very Brady Sequel\". Although, this is by far worse then any of those. I beg you, don't even waste your time.

{"value":"If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white.

{"value":"I think this could've been a decent movie, and some of its parts are OK... but in whole it's a B movie. Same about the plot, parts are OK but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up. Acting is mostly OK, I've seen worse of this too. :)<br /><br />The beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making \"cool\" but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (In slow motion! Cool!), like the drivers had never seen sand before... It gets slightly better from there, but not much.<br /><br />If you're gonna rent this, get another one too and use this one as a warm-up.

{"value":"In Hollywood in the 1930's and 1940's, I think that every studio can make a western, except Warner bros. The few times they try, it always ridiculous (except, perhaps, for They Died with their Boots on - which is a cavalery western.) I have read that Humphrey Bogart, seing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said that he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too XXe century to be credible in a western movie. The story here had no suprise, and it did't help. Every 10 minutes, I figure I can see Bogart and Cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930's black car.","finished_norm":["in","hollywood","in","the","and","i","think","that","everi","studio","can","make","a","western","except","warner","bro","the","few","time","thei","try","it","alwai","ridicul","except","perhap","for","thei","die","with","their","boot","on","which","be","a","cavaleri","western","i","have","read","that","humphrei","bogart","se","jame","cagnei","with","thi","big","cowboi","hat","on","hi","head","sai","that","he","look","like","a","mushroom","true","cagnei","and","bogart","be","too","urban","too","xxe","centuri","to","be","credibl","in","a","western","movi","the","stori","here","have","no","supris","and","it","do","t","help","everi","minut","i","figur","i","can","see","bogart","and","cagnei","drop","their","littl","gun","and","put","hand","in","a","machin","gun","to","get","awai","from","the","set","in","a","black","car"],"filtered":["hollywood","think","everi","studio","make","western","except","warner","bro","time","thei","try","alwai","ridicul","except","perhap","thei","die","boot","cavaleri","western","read","humphrei","bogart","se","jame","cagnei","thi","big","cowboi","hat","hi","head","sai","look","like","mushroom","true","cagnei","bogart","urban","xxe","centuri","credibl","western","movi","stori","supris","help","everi","minut","figur","see","bogart","cagnei","drop","littl","gun","put","hand","machin","gun","get","awai","set","black","car"],"filtered2":["hollywood","think","everi","studio","make","western","except","warner","bro","time","try","alwai","ridicul","except","perhap","die","boot","cavaleri","western","read","humphrei","bogart","se","jame","cagnei","big","cowboi","hat","head","look","like","mushroom","true","cagnei","bogart","urban","xxe","centuri","credibl","western","stori","supris","help","everi","minut","figur","see","bogart","cagnei","drop","littl","gun","put","hand","machin","gun","get","awai","set","black","car"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,8,12,14,16,17,36,59,82,85,109,145,155,159,185,197,208,229,232,235,274,284,293,300,304,318,415,501,620,769,904,932,1071,1163,1207,1732,1736,2406,2500,2574,3137,3855,3911,5848,6375,8427],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,8,12,14,16,17,36,59,82,85,109,145,155,159,185,197,208,229,232,235,274,284,293,300,304,318,415,501,620,769,904,932,1071,1163,1207,1732,1736,2406,2500,2574,3137,3855,3911,5848,6375,8427],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.4680183469605717,1.8693254449200722,2.020196584395323,4.022380438207478,2.125691139326857,2.34599021453259,2.3074766467914385,2.300267965194495,2.518833027372001,2.558331832813986,2.6289494000279396,2.8432628718938773,5.220555595469753,2.6457189377809835,2.748952192422636,3.110998680163279,2.9012296278682137,2.932274249550174,2.871119826396843,2.902686292364678,3.1588018988486244,7.0239710008934955,3.7568101178222815,12.160999699650311,3.9121030022283168,4.058285512406398,4.30366520516749,4.2860694432771105,4.297765483040301,4.760735085628657,5.3560264761848435,5.3064295350454715,5.408212229355414,5.1994574154933035,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149,19.629576486583197,19.80105172810304,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.082887361285244E-4,2.0810416094933743E-4,2.0815554347424265E-4,2.0811369755170683E-4,2.0813339304459242E-4,2.081030135257753E-4,2.0816773645214093E-4,2.0807205119149436E-4,2.0810420493002445E-4,2.083192580755695E-4,0.047882441746106064,2.081045486643567E-4,2.0830163682280357E-4,2.0832333825958525E-4,2.082287024064718E-4,2.081145172814402E-4,2.0818611672416976E-4,2.082840898184765E-4,2.0812526133664203E-4,2.081245004100371E-4,2.083117400363145E-4,2.0814535236018643E-4,2.081456673701388E-4,2.0827900771323678E-4,2.0812533641266444E-4,2.0832582823766943E-4,2.0817741897229803E-4,2.0810369454473204E-4,2.0819803986654246E-4,2.082615849094174E-4,2.0814637334682737E-4,2.082578520116808E-4,2.083601014178987E-4,2.0855349190005527E-4,2.0817705923586535E-4,2.0811439105668632E-4,2.0818942804771049E-4,2.0813552701656117E-4,2.0807227326983938E-4,2.0812519688363546E-4,2.083337738974035E-4,2.0821948970841425E-4,2.0825832659544352E-4,2.080826290036547E-4,2.0812524980460067E-4,2.0811431279772928E-4,2.0818475760570686E-4,2.0822085710288504E-4,2.0817851656820455E-4,2.0814551990552924E-4,2.0811482744843317E-4,2.0854122093255087E-4,2.0816719513391523E-4,2.0812520210255765E-4,2.0816608032148452E-4,2.0810390746310155E-4,0.9358796341337215,2.0813637514793606E-4,2.08115119615014E-4,2.0810378867208414E-4,2.0827027669504354E-4,2.081866717851076E-4,2.081037016792363E-4,2.0808254422608632E-4,2.0806161922774774E-4,2.0824973986735546E-4,2.081138965291885E-4,2.0820849736595404E

{"value":"Seriously, there is absolutely NOTHING good about this crap fest at all. Randolph Scott, a closet homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is at his most wooden and boring in the least role. At 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles, although it doesn't matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn't enough to save this garbage.

The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life. Brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of Gig Young playing a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions \"Gig Young\" and then who appears but Gig Young, the actor! Worth seeing though far below what it could have been.","finished_norm":["here","be","on","of","that","movi","spoil","by","the","studio","insist","on","a","happi","end","conflict","which","have","stretch","out","for","year","be","settl","in","a","few","minut","it","would","have","be","far","much","interest","to","inject","a","tone","of","ambigu","the","talent","barbara","stanwyck","be","undo","by","a","sudden","metamorphosi","from","independ","and","assert","woman","to","a","compliant","femal","of","the","kind","she","have","put","down","all","her","life","brent","a","usual","be","good","over","hi","head","and","then","there","be","the","ludicr","situat","of","gig","young","plai","a","charact","name","gig","young","someon","mention","gig","young","and","then","who","appear","but","gig","young","the","actor","worth","see","though","far","below","what","it","can","have","be"],"filtered":["movi","spoil","studio","insist","happi","end","conflict","stretch","year","settl","minut","far","much","interest","inject","tone","ambigu","talent","barbara","stanwyck","undo","sudden","metamorphosi","independ","assert","woman","compliant","femal","kind","put","life","brent","usual","good","hi","head","ludicr","situat","gig","young","plai","charact","name","gig","young","someon","mention","gig","young","appear","gig","young","actor","worth","see","though","far"],"filtered2":["spoil","studio","insist","happi","end","conflict","stretch","year","settl","minut","far","interest","inject","tone","ambigu","talent","barbara","stanwyck","undo","sudden","metamorphosi","independ","assert","woman","compliant","femal","kind","put","life","brent","usual","good","head","ludicr","situat","gig","young","plai","charact","name","gig","young","someon","mention","gig","young","appear","gig","young","actor","worth","see","though","far"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,10,24,40,41,57,59,60,70,75,86,101,122,135,139,143,159,170,208,219,265,276,285,422,473,605,932,967,1193,1211,1220,1331,1394,1784,1912,2188,2756,3117,3491,4594,4604,5262,6108,6224],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,10,24,40,41,57,59,60,70,75,86,101,122,135,139,143,159,170,208,219,265,276,285,422,473,605,932,967,1193,1211,1220,1331,1394,1784,1912,2188,2756,3117,3491,4594,4604,5262,6108,6224],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.3210361566119257,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,2.094675786251684,1.9742250248702675,2.031112399272319,4.197164082437498,2.2489347673732487,9.464976285748351,2.2939035841256437,2.3409902041158843,2.300267965194495,2.4214486257841834,2.6289494000279396,2.5792094178355414,2.73529586597515,2.7884729505849193,2.808171552082607,3.2090054908152035,3.335489637924323,3.5474598886404074,4.058285512406398,4.110553940952155,4.240607069200353,4.364659717870332,4.30366520516749,4.513582994262438,4.403125998698128,4.77960356993304,4.838444069955973,5.02684467282631,5.373120909544144,5.626901430320244,5.719991853386255,6.600350576034347,6.1754673820690815,26.401402304137388,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651723E-4,2.3166917872259986E-4,2.3172637963242876E-4,2.316797952178619E-4,2.3170172096235694E-4,2.3166790136863887E-4,2.3173995330228234E-4,2.3163343296338704E-4,2.3166922768351247E-4,2.3190863272655853E-4,2.337487602278494E-4,2.3166961034116858E-4,2.3188901610218292E-4,2.3191317493693843E-4,2.3180782283696843E-4,2.3168070777104309E-4,2.317604148947185E-4,2.3186948213389054E-4,2.316926684470498E-4,2.316918213556662E-4,2.3190026336973322E-4,2.3171503451077E-4,2.3171538519139366E-4,2.3186382454808493E-4,2.3169275202442939E-4,2.3191594687179627E-4,2.3175073223857332E-4,2.316686595039E-4,2.3177368817377586E-4,2.3184442884434953E-4,2.3171617111051655E-4,2.3184027324578318E-4,2.3195410103209614E-4,2.3216939040434894E-4,2.3175033176679258E-4,2.3168056725302112E-4,2.3176410118143985E-4,2.3170409657815994E-4,2.316336801891396E-4,2.3169259669560076E-4,2.3192479227141058E-4,2.3179756692385707E-4,2.3184080156982072E-4,2.3164520857154732E-4,2.316926556091587E-4,2.3168048013228205E-4,2.3175890187423562E-4,2.3179908915749522E-4,2.3175195412256197E-4,2.3171522102838593E-4,2.3168105306030693E-4,2.321557299136076E-4,2.3173935068699484E-4,2.316926025054962E-4,2.3173810963694053E-4,2.3166889653243212E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908942E-4,2.3168137831085223E-4,2.31668764289918E-4,2.318541048586515E-4,2.317610328088968E-4,2.316686674462916E-4,2.316451141940512E-4,2.3162181971902603E-4,2.318312425094204E-4,2.3168001672688675E-4,2.3178532984537495E-4,2.318533529636745E-4,2.317481656091852E-4,2.3169290937467298E-4,2.316454178653599E-4,2.3170467704319554E-4,2.3164529309826885E-4,2.3165744946862326E-4,2.3164542442150258E-4,2.3179579467214528E-4,2.3172680482568895E-4,2.31668

{"value":"Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.","finished_norm":["horribl","film","with","bit","of","the","ramon","strew","about","your","wrong","than","averag","comedi","format","of","the","cool","kid","take","over","the","school","with","some","whimsic","plan","thi","movi","be","terribl","the","plot","consist","of","a","girl","who","enjoi","the","ramon","and","a","school","bend","on","fight","against","their","oppress","administr","forget","thi","movi","and","watch","someth","like","wild","zero","star","guitar","wolf","if","you","want","a","entertain","b","movi","terribl","act","terribl","write","terribl","plot","with","the","stamp","of","approv","of","the","ramon","who","probabl","ne","some","monei","quick","so","thei","sai","ye","to","thi","movi","that","be","the","onli","logic","thing","i","can","think","of","becaus","thi","movi","blow"],"filtered":["horribl","film","bit","ramon","strew","wrong","averag","comedi","format","cool","kid","take","school","whimsic","plan","thi","movi","terribl","plot","consist","girl","enjoi","ramon","school","bend","fight","oppress","administr","forget","thi","movi","watch","someth","like","wild","zero","star","guitar","wolf","want","entertain","b","movi","terribl","act","terribl","write","terribl","plot","stamp","approv","ramon","probabl","ne","monei","quick","thei","sai","ye","thi","movi","onli","logic","thing","think","becaus","thi","movi","blow"],"filtered2":["horribl","bit","ramon","strew","wrong","averag","comedi","format","cool","kid","take","school","whimsic","plan","terribl","plot","consist","girl","enjoi","ramon","school","bend","fight","oppress","administr","forget","watch","someth","like","wild","zero","star","guitar","wolf","want","entertain","b","terribl","act","terribl","write","terribl","plot","stamp","approv","ramon","probabl","ne","monei","quick","ye","onli","logic","thing","think","becaus","blow"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,12,21,22,25,29,31,32,37,53,65,84,100,110,114,126,127,148,166,195,200,209,230,233,296,372,481,581,642,643,754,828,964,973,1107,1173,1382,1866,2281,3110,3724,4252,4259,5048,5281,8142],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,12,21,22,25,29,31,32,37,53,65,84,100,110,114,126,127,148,166,195,200,209,230,233,296,372,481,581,642,643,754,828,964,973,1107,1173,1382,1866,2281,3110,3724,4252,4259,5048,5281,8142],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,1.4876543214774305,1.7003182735607676,1.9073850067444174,2.2212694515902225,2.1405462403177813,2.1290479736304078,2.4433074195966826,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.3018654096236517,9.769548131877414,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,2.6026896854443837,2.7121382192999195,2.8377834061292515,5.900913137266729,3.0316467233633775,3.353630724994973,3.530930586689197,3.622422927113863,3.5813614403160887,3.7465885637507435,3.827761853794566,4.062925891962901,4.072271754381138,4.268777946167049,4.2574141875167335,4.449957298382227,5.143104478942172,5.129498826886393,5.521540914662417,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125571E-4,2.273779263270827E-4,2.2743406769354602E-4,2.2738834617097757E-4,2.2740986578072433E-4,2.2737667263379285E-4,2.2744738993572328E-4,2.2734284269338738E-4,2.27377974381083E-4,2.276129448788428E-4,2.2941898734736622E-4,2.2737834995069833E-4,2.2759369161694297E-4,2.276174029529933E-4,2.275140023100702E-4,2.273892418207621E-4,2.2746747251417907E-4,2.2757451948007197E-4,2.2740098094688527E-4,2.2740014954633695E-4,2.2760473054921068E-4,2.2742293271974017E-4,2.2742327690463971E-4,2.2756896669080763E-4,2.274010629761451E-4,2.276201235427729E-4,2.2745796921172092E-4,2.2737741672596988E-4,2.2748049992975616E-4,2.2754993025739283E-4,2.2742404826603274E-4,2.2754585163377154E-4,2.2765757096628245E-4,2.2786887249241994E-4,2.2745757615795538E-4,2.2738910390558226E-4,2.2747109051910822E-4,2.2741219739254258E-4,2.2734308533973015E-4,2.27400910524502E-4,2.2762880509736262E-4,2.27503936369194E-4,2.2754637017156215E-4,2.2735440017971115E-4,2.2740096834679289E-4,2.2738901839859728E-4,2.2746598751966326E-4,2.275054304062081E-4,2.2745916846251936E-4,2.274231157824547E-4,2.2738958071416703E-4,2.2785546503755478E-4,2.2744679848279374E-4,2.2740091622677964E-4,2.2744558042094633E-4,2.2737764936397726E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441381E-4,2.2738989994003443E-4,2.2737751957101646E-4,2.275594270410359E-4,2.2746807898261516E-4,2.2737742452124304E-4,2.2735430755038743E-4,2.2733144456336726E-4,2.275369881754613E-4,2.273885635769485E-4,2.274919259604512E-4,2.2755868907355298E-4,2.2745545012449865E-4,2.2740121741176013E-4,2.

{"value":"my friend bought the movie for 5 (its is not even 1 cent worth), because they wrote it was like American pie. but we would soon find out that there is a long way from American pie to that piece of crap. it is not even a comedy, its more like a really really really bad documentary. not only the story is bad, the picture and sound also sucks to. they put in some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunken teens. and the result is a disaster. if you see this movie don't buy it, rather spend your money on something else, and better. if you are gonna torture yourself, then don't invite your friend/s, unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them.","finished_norm":["my","friend","bui","the","movi","for","it","be","not","even","cent","worth","becaus","thei","write","it","be","like","american","pie","but","we","would","soon","find","out","that","there","be","a","long","wai","from","american","pie","to","that","piec","of","crap","it","be","not","even","a","comedi","it","much","like","a","realli","realli","realli","bad","documentari","not","onli","the","stori","be","bad","the","pictur","and","sound","conjur","suck","to","thei","put","in","some","alcohol","chick","dwarf","and","drunken","teen","and","the","result","be","a","disast","if","you","see","thi","movi","do","not","bui","it","rather","spend","your","monei","on","someth","els","and","well","if","you","be","gonna","tortur","yourself","then","do","not","invit","your","friend","unless","you","hate","realli","much","and","you","want","to","get","rid","of","them"],"filtered":["friend","bui","movi","even","cent","worth","becaus","thei","write","like","american","pie","soon","find","long","wai","american","pie","piec","crap","even","comedi","much","like","realli","realli","realli","bad","documentari","onli","stori","bad","pictur","sound","conjur","suck","thei","put","alcohol","chick","dwarf","drunken","teen","result","disast","see","thi","movi","bui","rather","spend","monei","someth","els","well","gonna","tortur","invit","friend","unless","hate","realli","much","want","get","rid"],"filtered2":["friend","bui","even","cent","worth","becaus","write","like","american","pie","soon","find","long","wai","american","pie","piec","crap","even","comedi","like","realli","realli","realli","bad","documentari","onli","stori","bad","pictur","sound","conjur","suck","put","alcohol","chick","dwarf","drunken","teen","result","disast","see","bui","rather","spend","monei","someth","els","well","gonna","tortur","invit","friend","unless","hate","realli","want","get","rid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,9,11,13,17,20,22,33,37,38,39,53,65,99,126,127,159,160,161,178,196,218,219,223,283,311,313,339,347,421,447,449,460,624,802,881,1034,1041,1351,1916,1917,2106,2929,2940,3056,3851],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,9,11,13,17,20,22,33,37,38,39,53,65,99,126,127,159,160,161,178,196,218,219,223,283,311,313,339,347,421,447,449,460,624,802,881,1034,1041,1351,1916,1917,2106,2929,2940,3056,3851],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,4.527176627893589,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7003182735607676,1.9073850067444174,2.056430207256609,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.300267965194495,2.3722295531801256,4.864636596042175,2.532833256045391,2.478925055209576,2.5940874818617203,2.5792094178355414,5.651126589588952,2.7678802023081546,2.9203338091782562,2.907069060519773,3.003844442051426,6.030397968308703,3.2597778161886266,3.2070272508030975,3.2597778161886266,3.216957819005698,3.9241755834625858,3.8883864756110005,4.086456389373095,4.125296222689358,4.176068548062782,4.436351646326448,4.869215728622727,5.00274712124725,10.518353300389853,5.390512652256013,5.444579873526289,5.482320201509136,5.850044981634453]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745137E-4,2.04634970709764E-4,2.0468549666480018E-4,2.046443483326699E-4,2.0466371549280436E-4,2.0463384241427022E-4,2.046974863802566E-4,2.0460339623606897E-4,2.0463501395727308E-4,2.0484648206987066E-4,2.0647187955333366E-4,2.0463535196139899E-4,2.0482915457133735E-4,2.0485049423537828E-4,2.047574360046268E-4,2.046451543971388E-4,2.047155602448593E-4,2.0481190008348791E-4,2.0465571934409374E-4,2.0465497110247856E-4,2.0483908935972143E-4,2.0467547544121252E-4,2.0467578519980687E-4,2.048069026992351E-4,2.04655793168565E-4,2.0485294270440455E-4,2.0470700748843486E-4,2.0463451208033374E-4,2.0472728462307007E-4,2.0478977034141488E-4,2.0467647940754558E-4,2.0478609967276748E-4,2.0488664453525865E-4,2.0507681111083851E-4,2.047066537489708E-4,2.0464503027660852E-4,2.0471881636714283E-4,2.0466581389049773E-4,2.0460361461226782E-4,2.0465565596554787E-4,2.0486075590640652E-4,2.0474837688640177E-4,2.047865663450048E-4,2.046137977113289E-4,2.046557080042967E-4,2.046449533222636E-4,2.0471422378351425E-4,2.047497214857899E-4,2.047080867869225E-4,2.0467564019349888E-4,2.046454593935081E-4,2.050647447058979E-4,2.046969540860499E-4,2.0465566109746826E-4,2.046958578580453E-4,2.0463472144925798E-4,0.9838262975203443,2.0466664788314004E-4,2.046457466895402E-4,2.0463460463854041E-4,2.0479831723105375E-4,2.0471610605268093E-4,2.0463451909590258E-4,2.0461371434704086E-4,2.045931381778639E-4,2.0477812276154745E-4,2.0464454399310718E-4,2.0473756779124905E-4,2.04797653077

I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting, crappy filming and crappy effects. But nope, I don't even get the pleasure of that. Even the \"musicians\" weren't very good. I was hoping for maybe some laughs, but I wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one-liners or not.

{"value":"I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at Wal-Mart earlier in the week. All three children actually got physically ill while watching it. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all had picked up from school, but really it could have been this film. Absolutely disgusting. How any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me. Fortunately, I turned off the film when I noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely. For any parents out there, I strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie.","finished_norm":["i","be","babysit","a","famili","of","three","small","child","for","a","night","and","their","mother","give","me","thi","to","show","for","them","have","just","grab","it","at","walmart","earli","in","the","week","all","three","child","actual","get","physic","ill","while","watch","it","i","be","pretti","sure","it","be","the","pizza","thei","eat","or","someth","thei","all","have","pick","up","from","school","but","realli","it","can","have","be","thi","film","absolut","disgust","how","ani","on","can","produc","thi","calib","of","trash","be","beyond","me","fortun","i","turn","off","the","film","when","i","notic","the","child","be","not","respond","and","act","strang","for","ani","parent","out","there","i","strongli","advis","you","to","refrain","from","let","young","child","view","thi","movi"],"filtered":["babysit","famili","three","small","child","night","mother","give","thi","show","grab","walmart","earli","week","three","child","actual","get","physic","ill","watch","pretti","sure","pizza","thei","eat","someth","thei","pick","school","realli","thi","film","absolut","disgust","ani","produc","thi","calib","trash","beyond","fortun","turn","film","notic","child","respond","act","strang","ani","parent","strongli","advis","refrain","let","young","child","view","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["babysit","famili","three","small","child","night","mother","give","show","grab","walmart","earli","week","three","child","actual","get","physic","ill","watch","pretti","sure","pizza","eat","someth","pick","school","realli","absolut","disgust","ani","produc","calib","trash","beyond","fortun","turn","notic","child","respond","act","strang","ani","parent","strongli","advis","refrain","let","young","child","view"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,13,21,27,28,30,52,53,78,96,119,124,135,180,182,210,222,224,261,266,296,312,363,397,417,446,502,599,670,671,688,857,963,970,1465,1488,1550,2043,2217,3816,3987,4396,5322,6547,8475],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,13,21,27,28,30,52,53,78,96,119,124,135,180,182,210,222,224,261,266,296,312,363,397,417,446,502,599,670,671,688,857,963,970,1465,1488,1550,2043,2217,3816,3987,4396,5322,6547,8475],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,2.600540117735859,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,2.0064197866819473,2.0390708128715254,2.1653408989309972,2.2323930368088845,2.366244071437088,10.838925917077418,2.7365296724240786,2.687151791517189,2.5771019354959765,5.379009467558432,2.7085302779237206,2.747702973022204,2.9504565686333644,2.8824835850471584,3.0349689855553557,3.3176717946075294,3.1932880749197934,3.233054746047873,3.3132665011396125,3.6254214301101193,3.7264536553416874,3.6466665387238555,3.6016814428070463,3.9612932464190886,4.035401218572811,4.086456389373095,4.506310234933358,4.5432147918688095,4.558366596889411,4.900964426937307,5.00274712124725,5.7446844659766265,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4,2.3612500142009964E-4,2.3610099510202473E-4,2.360772525389538E-4,2.3629070374590536E-4,2.3613656901327567E-4,2.3624390791467605E-4,2.3631323951260914E-4,2.3620602879437978E-4,2.361497096615575E-4,2.3610130461469635E-4,2.361617036906907E-4,2.361011774476095E-4,2.361135676555683E-4,2.3610131129695174E-4,2.3625457404084343E-4,2.3618425711895646E-4,2.3612

{"value":"This movie is by far the worst movie ever made. If you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film. I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS of a movie. Adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace. Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender. Anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I'd give it to the support Lorraina Bobbitt foundation before buying this

{"value":"Sergio Leone spins in his grave... If there was any film that tramples upon a man's life work its this one. The lead character's \"lone wolf\" bravado is uninspiring and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education. Whoever's idea this was should be horse whipped. The only reason I'm spending time trashing it is because there's a 10 line minimum. Sergio Leone's family should sue, not because its crap, but because now it's immortalized as crap by MST 3000.

{"value":"A young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on limb regeneration.His overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes.A young doctor uses reptilian DNA he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later,he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm...Admittedly the special effects in \"Severed Ties\" are pretty good and grotesque,but the rest of the film is awful.The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few

{"value":"I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. I mean, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little. \"Groundbreaking\" is a little over the top. This is a Boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film. It's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. A silly action film without much creativity. It's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it.

{"value":"After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it, I finally had a chance to see it's sequel Life In Transformation. I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie. The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless. A watered down version of Baraka, which is the same idea but done better. I truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste.","finished_norm":["after","have","watch","koyaanisqatsi","two","or","three","dozen","time","and","love","everi","of","it","i","final","have","a","chanc","to","see","it","sequel","life","in","transform","i","be","truli","dissappoint","a","it","do","not","nearli","stand","up","to","the","high","standard","of","the","minut","of","peopl","with","basket","on","their","head","be","not","my","idea","of","a","good","movi","the","philip","glass","score","for","thi","on","have","neither","the","beauti","nor","the","correl","strength","of","the","compar","with","koyaanisqatsi","thi","movi","seem","slow","and","pointless","a","water","down","version","of","baraka","which","be","the","same","idea","but","do","well","i","truli","hope","the","movi","in","thi","seri","will","not","follow","the","exampl","of","thi","wast"],"filtered":["watch","koyaanisqatsi","two","three","dozen","time","love","everi","final","chanc","see","sequel","life","transform","truli","dissappoint","nearli","stand","high","standard","minut","peopl","basket","head","idea","good","movi","philip","glass","score","thi","neither","beauti","correl","strength","compar","koyaanisqatsi","thi","movi","seem","slow","pointless","water","version","baraka","idea","well","truli","hope","movi","thi","seri","follow","exampl","thi","wast"],"filtered2":["watch","koyaanisqatsi","two","three","dozen","time","love","everi","final","chanc","see","sequel","life","transform","truli","dissappoint","nearli","stand","high","standard","minut","peopl","basket","head","idea","good","philip","glass","score","neither","beauti","correl","strength","compar","koyaanisqatsi","seem","slow","pointless","water","version","baraka","idea","well","truli","hope","follow","exampl","wast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,8,20,23,35,47,54,59,75,85,89,123,156,181,208,211,220,224,260,307,325,342,377,387,390,482,486,518,531,611,616,718,830,1323,1529,1777,2231,3408,3746],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,8,20,23,35,47,54,59,75,85,89,123,156,181,208,211,220,224,260,307,325,342,377,387,390,482,486,518,531,611,616,718,830,1323,1529,1777,2231,3408,3746],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.463169012899134,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.9742250248702675,2.011190219103739,1.9940046109572438,4.523814194644097,2.3451551414151686,2.4442286541160034,2.6289494000279396,2.5687161421197025,2.8336934208777267,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.8767855639325206,2.973659465713028,5.941068926339787,3.0602441305135506,3.360519385990158,3.132778125427319,3.3154667220492153,3.3066947359763783,3.4101163271295305,3.4272107604888307,3.520060914452293,3.5173618574831282,3.634471265630037,3.9571003681590526,4.383707912841026,4.671389985292807,4.770124825978496,5.02684467282631,6.389041482367141,5.7446844659766265]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.793182480923802E-4,2.7907073007172245E-4,2.791396347907478E-4,2.7908351879528035E-4,2.79109930739922E-4,2.7906919135990753E-4,2.791559857528252E-4,2.790276704158135E-4,2.790707890504684E-4,2.793591784707361E-4,2.815758122415373E-4,2.790712500032461E-4,2.793355481124975E-4,2.7936465005730556E-4,2.7923774199117726E-4,2.7908461806486776E-4,2.7918063396702045E-4,2.7931201732250377E-4,2.79099026000372E-4,2.7909800558664164E-4,2.7934909666990117E-4,2.7912596835742454E-4,2.791263907903878E-4,2.793052021448875E-4,2.790991266784184E-4,2.793679891544127E-4,2.7916897015427516E-4,2.790701046163104E-4,2.791966230757029E-4,2.79281837909595E-4,2.7912733751547493E-4,2.792768320390161E-4,2.794139499914514E-4,2.7967328946259965E-4,2.791684877424462E-4,2.7908444879562276E-4,2.791850745004235E-4,2.791127924276103E-4,2.7902796822612926E-4,2.7909893956794545E-4,2.7937864440057776E-4,2.792253876280491E-4,2.7927746846279804E-4,2.7904185541696236E-4,2.7909901053573547E-4,2.7908434384921427E-4,2.791788113692407E-4,2.792272213240767E-4,2.7917044204647356E-4,2.79126193038185E-4,2.790850340033516E-4,2.7965683391531737E-4,2.7915525983715023E-4,2.7909894656659657E-4,2.791537648573406E-4,2.7907039014296467E-4,0.9779431299389859,2.791139297842154E-4,2.790854258030188E-4,2.790702308424692E-4,2.792934937215175E-4,2.791813783118738E-4,2.7907011418378517E-4,2.790417417290006E-4,2.790136809995252E-4,2.7926595353457395E-4,2.7908378562699977E-4,2.7921064673569224E-4,2.7929258798221575E-4,2.791658783699424E-4,2.7909931622390567E-4,2.790421075341296E-4,2.7911349166089705E-4,2.790419572385945E-4,2.790566009092309E-4,2.7904211543171677E-4,2.7922325275805124E-4,2.791401469822883E-4,2.7907048667055577E-4,2.7909751987893955E-4]}}
{"value":"I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of these. <br /><br />I should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a starring role.<br /><br />One poster here called the movie incoherent. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I am so glad I got it from the library for free, yet I still feel ripped off.<br /><br />IMDb needs to include a \"0\" in the \"rate this film\" vote, just for movies like this

{"value":"******SPOILERS******<br /><br />The unfunny radio quiz show host Kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for Lugosi, Karloff, and Lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland, sporatically watchable haunted house spoof. Lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress' fortune; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums, but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /><br />Of course, Kay Kyser and his band of 30-something year old \"kids\" uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way. Not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist.","finished_norm":["spoilersbr","br","the","unfunni","radio","quiz","show","host","kyser","and","hi","mediocr","band","be","the","excus","for","lugosi","karloff","and","lorr","to","pick","up","a","paycheck","in","thi","bland","sporat","watchabl","haunt","hous","spoof","lugosi","be","a","mystic","whose","seanc","be","expos","a","a","fraudul","attempt","to","bilk","a","heiress","fortun","karloff","be","the","butler","and","lorr","be","a","professor","who","expos","fake","medium","but","it","turn","out","that","thei","re","both","in","conspiraci","with","lugosi","br","br","of","cours","kai","kyser","and","hi","band","of","someth","year","old","kid","uncov","the","truth","with","the","minimum","of","possibl","humor","along","the","wai","not","recommend","to","ani","but","the","absolut","horror","completist"],"filtered":["spoilersbr","br","unfunni","radio","quiz","show","host","kyser","hi","mediocr","band","excus","lugosi","karloff","lorr","pick","paycheck","thi","bland","sporat","watchabl","haunt","hous","spoof","lugosi","mystic","whose","seanc","expos","fraudul","attempt","bilk","heiress","fortun","karloff","butler","lorr","professor","expos","fake","medium","turn","thei","re","conspiraci","lugosi","br","br","cours","kai","kyser","hi","band","someth","year","old","kid","uncov","truth","minimum","possibl","humor","along","wai","recommend","ani","absolut","horror","completist"],"filtered2":["spoilersbr","unfunni","radio","quiz","show","host","kyser","mediocr","band","excus","lugosi","karloff","lorr","pick","paycheck","bland","sporat","watchabl","haunt","hous","spoof","lugosi","mystic","whose","seanc","expos","fraudul","attempt","bilk","heiress","fortun","karloff","butler","lorr","professor","expos","fake","medium","turn","re","conspiraci","lugosi","cours","kai","kyser","band","someth","year","old","kid","uncov","truth","minimum","possibl","humor","along","wai","recommend","ani","absolut","horror","completist"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[27,28,33,53,57,67,68,83,96,114,177,199,213,222,298,324,369,402,446,598,617,639,758,787,927,948,1028,1178,1245,1262,1465,1547,1751,1765,1790,2124,2128,2167,2725,3027,3081,3171,3279,3638,3774,4045,4592,6684,7376],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[27,28,33,53,57,67,68,83,96,114,177,199,213,222,298,324,369,402,446,598,617,639,758,787,927,948,1028,1178,1245,1262,1465,1547,1751,1765,1790,2124,2128,2167,2725,3027,3081,3171,3279,3638,3774,4045,4592,6684,7376],"values":[1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,2.292318797740072,2.0390708128715254,2.4433074195966826,2.458149992634611,2.558331832813986,2.8432628718938773,2.5771019354959765,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,3.121829110937649,3.084424928710765,3.233054746047873,3.5642670069567886,3.5119855004467477,3.616452760127359,3.8240921249056035,3.760240652919071,8.503560739596956,4.049068857301474,4.086456389373095,4.229557233013768,4.409683399244287,4.528289141652134,4.506310234933358,4.724033718778229,5.0768550934009715,4.789173020949191,9.521470171257315,5.051537285416681,5.185068678041204,17.159975560158767,5.274680836730892,5.5623629091826725,12.685042933464494,5.501738287366237,6.101359409915359,5.649374286172302,5.770002273960917,5.9370563586240825,6.0662680901040895,13.321950395701563,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805352E-4,2.1925531043720596E-4,2.193094462670603E-4,2.1926535805328186E-4,2.1928610891855596E-4,2.1925410152956963E-4,2.1932229259911848E-4,2.1922148009526646E-4,2.192553567745744E-4,2.194819334272078E-4,2.2122345868647706E-4,2.192557189277259E-4,2.1946336794909403E-4,2.1948623224568855E-4,2.1938652538130762E-4,2.1926622170779188E-4,2.1934165776813392E-4,2.1944488069798178E-4,2.1927754147741058E-4,2.1927673977696293E-4,2.194740125378646E-4,2.1929870906764104E-4,2.1929904095723218E-4,2.1943952627086736E-4,2.1927762057634122E-4,2.1948885564790856E-4,2.1933249395190822E-4,2.1925481904056074E-4,2.1935421980567507E-4,2.1942116987548016E-4,2.1929978476330173E-4,2.1941723695242693E-4,2.1952496533805872E-4,0.3778719397906865,2.193321149391924E-4,2.1926608871935253E-4,2.1934514652716483E-4,2.192883572382644E-4,2.192217140735601E-4,2.192774735707243E-4,2.1949722707154408E-4,2.1937681902578184E-4,2.1941773696650523E-4,2.1923262471379968E-4,2.1927752932743096E-4,2.1926600626693136E-4,2.193402258220395E-4,2.193782596913496E-4,2.1933365036190083E-4,2.1929888559081088E-4,2.192665484949163E-4,2.1971579004444682E-4,2.193217222746469E-4,2.1927747906929965E-4,2.19320547725592E-4,2.192550433680465E-4,0.6050185409223158,2.1928925081630268E-4,2.1926685631708614E-4,2.1925491821167634E-4,2.1943032740576223E-4,2.1934224257171345E-4,2.1925482655736354E-4,2.1923253

{"value":"...but this has to be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And that takes some doing, what with the likes of various Lifetime efforts. Don't get me wrong--I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles (look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery. And chew it she does, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tying into a Christmas goose.<br /><br />Give me the classics anytime: Alastair Sim, 1951.

{"value":"'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a made-for-television sequel to the original 'The Omen' film. Instead of Satan possessing the body of a little boy, he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents, who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong. The film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening, and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all of the events that surround it. I just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening, particularly when compared to the original.","finished_norm":["the","omen","the","awaken","be","a","madefortelevis","sequel","to","the","origin","the","omen","film","instead","of","satan","possess","the","bodi","of","a","littl","boi","he","possess","the","bodi","of","a","littl","girl","adopt","by","rich","parent","who","be","bulli","at","school","and","who","end","up","get","reveng","against","that","who","do","her","wrong","the","film","seem","to","struggl","with","ani","horror","factor","and","a","lot","of","the","event","that","happen","be","simpli","silli","rather","than","particularli","frighten","and","it","be","difficult","to","believ","that","thi","littl","girl","be","satan","even","with","all","of","the","event","that","surround","it","i","just","do","not","find","thi","film","veri","suspens","or","frighten","particularli","when","compar","to","the","origin"],"filtered":["omen","awaken","madefortelevis","sequel","origin","omen","film","instead","satan","possess","bodi","littl","boi","possess","bodi","littl","girl","adopt","rich","parent","bulli","school","end","get","reveng","wrong","film","seem","struggl","ani","horror","factor","lot","event","happen","simpli","silli","rather","particularli","frighten","difficult","believ","thi","littl","girl","satan","even","event","surround","find","thi","film","veri","suspens","frighten","particularli","compar","origin"],"filtered2":["omen","awaken","madefortelevis","sequel","origin","omen","instead","satan","possess","bodi","littl","boi","possess","bodi","littl","girl","adopt","rich","parent","bulli","school","end","get","reveng","wrong","seem","struggl","ani","horror","factor","lot","event","happen","simpli","silli","rather","particularli","frighten","difficult","believ","littl","girl","satan","even","event","surround","find","veri","suspens","frighten","particularli","compar","origin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,14,15,24,25,27,35,38,69,72,83,84,91,94,152,160,201,282,296,376,385,387,470,482,497,529,670,803,842,871,937,1275,1305,1572,1710,1813,2438,2659,2980,3646],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,14,15,24,25,27,35,38,69,72,83,84,91,94,152,160,201,282,296,376,385,387,470,482,497,529,670,803,842,871,937,1275,1305,1572,1710,1813,2438,2659,2980,3646],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,3.3525245991777624,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,4.254065042302116,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,4.442538903180445,2.0105926690411424,2.08112281984698,2.3131195476980753,2.3722295531801256,2.561435818751577,2.918851229218033,2.9504565686333644,6.313840861497837,3.09496984188738,3.360519385990158,6.762949502332293,3.3154667220492153,6.68450807602573,3.4648563601051974,3.7264536553416874,3.7636829971100436,3.8883864756110005,3.9954846111673676,4.030886538218284,4.3095999406873045,8.927501241029125,4.573751515728891,9.377263583454626,10.153710186801943,11.591955520728355,5.373120909544144,5.501738287366237,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651704E-4,2.3166917872259967E-4,2.317263796324286E-4,2.316797952178617E-4,2.3170172096235677E-4,2.316679013686387E-4,2.3173995330228215E-4,2.3163343296338685E-4,2.3166922768351228E-4,2.3190863272655834E-4,2.3374876022784922E-4,2.3166961034116841E-4,2.3188901610218273E-4,2.3191317493693824E-4,2.3180782283696824E-4,2.3168070777104292E-4,2.3176041489471832E-4,2.3186948213389035E-4,2.3169266844704961E-4,2.31691821355666E-4,2.3190026336973303E-4,2.317150345107698E-4,2.3171538519139347E-4,2.3186382454808477E-4,2.316927520244292E-4,2.3191594687179608E-4,2.3175073223857313E-4,2.3166865950389982E-4,2.3177368817377567E-4,2.3184442884434934E-4,2.3171617111051636E-4,2.31840273245783E-4,2.3195410103209595E-4,2.3216939040434875E-4,2.317503317667924E-4,2.3168056725302093E-4,2.3176410118143966E-4,2.3170409657815975E-4,2.316336801891394E-4,2.3169259669560057E-4,2.319247922714104E-4,2.3179756692385688E-4,2.3184080156982053E-4,2.3164520857154713E-4,2.3169265560915852E-4,2.3168048013228186E-4,2.3175890187423543E-4,2.3179908915749503E-4,2.3175195412256179E-4,2.3171522102838574E-4,2.3168105306030674E-4,2.3215572991360742E-4,2.3173935068699465E-4,2.3169260250549602E-4,2.3173810963694034E-4,2.3166889653243193E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908923E-4,2.3168137831085204E-4,2.3166876428991782E-4,2.318541048586513E-4,2.317610328088966E-4,2.316686674462914E-4,2.3164511419405105E-4,2.3162181971902584E-4,2.3183124250942023E-4,2.3168001672688656E-4,2.3178532984537476E-4,2.318533529636743E-4,2.3174816560918505E-4,2.316929093746728E-4,2.3164541786535971E-4,2.3170467704319535E-4,2.3164529309826866E-4,2.3165744946862307E-4,2.316454244215024E-4,2.317957946721451E-4,2.3172680482568876E-4,2.316689766643316E-4,2.316914181478326E-4]}}

{"value":"The idea is nice. Bringing so many stars in one movie is great. But.... too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense. No connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories... but these were out of 18. The frame reminded me of \"All the invisible children\" - a movie which I liked a lot. Compared to it, however, \"Paris Je T'Aime\" lacks the intriguing short story, which develops - starts and has its end. And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children. I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together.Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it...","finished_norm":["the","idea","be","nice","bring","so","mani","star","in","on","movi","be","great","but","too","mani","stori","too","short","and","lack","realli","ani","sens","no","connect","between","the","scene","there","be","some","brilliant","stori","but","thi","be","out","of","the","frame","remind","me","of","all","the","invis","child","a","movi","which","i","like","a","lot","compar","to","it","howev","pari","je","t","aim","lack","the","intrigu","short","stori","which","develop","start","and","have","it","end","and","it","lack","the","topic","connect","all","that","child","i","do","not","find","pari","enough","of","a","topic","to","connect","short","sketch","togetherperhap","for","peopl","who","know","pari","it","be","interest","otherwis","i","would","not","recommend","it"],"filtered":["idea","nice","bring","mani","star","movi","great","mani","stori","short","lack","realli","ani","sens","connect","scene","brilliant","stori","thi","frame","remind","invis","child","movi","like","lot","compar","howev","pari","je","aim","lack","intrigu","short","stori","develop","start","end","lack","topic","connect","child","find","pari","enough","topic","connect","short","sketch","togetherperhap","peopl","know","pari","interest","otherwis","recommend"],"filtered2":["idea","nice","bring","mani","star","great","mani","stori","short","lack","realli","ani","sens","connect","scene","brilliant","stori","frame","remind","invis","child","like","lot","compar","howev","pari","je","aim","lack","intrigu","short","stori","develop","start","end","lack","topic","connect","child","find","pari","enough","topic","connect","short","sketch","togetherperhap","peopl","know","pari","interest","otherwis","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,13,17,19,23,24,26,27,38,50,51,60,71,72,93,100,113,123,173,180,183,250,262,272,298,320,482,627,644,767,912,1017,1208,1401,1782,1883,1886,2621],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,13,17,19,23,24,26,27,38,50,51,60,71,72,93,100,113,123,173,180,183,250,262,272,298,320,482,627,644,767,912,1017,1208,1401,1782,1883,1886,2621],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.1317941569733974,3.83116108203179,1.312380678011735,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.519311641348122,3.43598877114071,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,2.035389827120098,2.1405462403177813,2.1521782565202803,2.2619070973220485,2.4368824319140248,5.419462958538709,7.465538569094188,2.6812935439488212,2.726701583487816,8.408641603344574,2.7819920465008363,2.938298364153555,3.3154667220492153,3.477726550625732,3.5670958631572662,11.37497054745735,3.9405024767500145,4.0536665665501035,4.339813719283801,4.470719289830655,5.3064295350454715,9.697192882839982,15.598372246479911,5.408212229355414]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918346E-4,2.361255225312206E-4,2.361838237467603E-4,2.3613634324334563E-4,2.3615869074724893E-4,2.3612422060632427E-4,2.3619765851711912E-4,2.360890891734518E-4,2.3612557243393593E-4,2.3636958262639036E-4,2.3824510646673101E-4,2.361259624523212E-4,2.363495886603974E-4,2.3637421220985637E-4,2.3626683357713386E-4,2.361372733502245E-4,2.3621851370481586E-4,2.3632967894044425E-4,2.361494640994967E-4,2.36148600713626E-4,2.3636105227822524E-4,2.3617226039252117E-4,2.3617261781876993E-4,2.3632391252640517E-4,2.361495492845547E-4,2.3637703746512051E-4,2.3620864479495748E-4,2.361249933249296E-4,2.362320423061188E-4,2.3630414373063943E-4,2.3617341885568205E-4,2.362999081957775E-4,2.3641592555151693E-4,2.3663535618876833E-4,2.3620823661977855E-4,2.3613713012922484E-4,2.362222709002403E-4,2.3616111205994106E-4,2.3608934115479144E-4,2.361493909678506E-4,2.3638605301314224E-4,2.3625638038324848E-4,2.363004466825547E-4,2.3610109129494806E-4,2.361494510146584E-4,2.3613704133264798E-4,2.3621697158016168E-4,2.362579318982804E-4,2.3620989018287178E-4,2.3617245049795411E-4,2.3613762528140625E-4,2.3662143292745187E-4,2.3619704431003974E-4,2.3614939688950407E-4,2.3619577938738503E-4,2.3612523491289703E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276112E-4,2.3613795678840854E-4,2.361251001265913E-4,2.3631400587089335E-4,2.3621914350507257E-4,2.361250014200995E-4,2.361009951020246E-4,2.3607725253895365E-4,2.3629070374590522E-4,2.3613656901327553E-4,2.3624390791467592E-4,2.36313239512609E-4,2.3620602879437965E-4,2.3614970966155736E-4,2.3610130461469621E-4,2.3616170369069057E-4,2.3610117744760938E-4,2.361135676555682E-4,2.361013112969516E-4,2.362545740408433E-4,2.3618425711895632E-4,2.361253165861985E-4,2.361481897497642E-4]}}
{"value":"OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low.<br /><br />Still, after sitting through this crap there's one key thing I can't seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.<br /><br />The acting is awful, the characters boring

{"value":"This Tim Burton remake of the original \"Planet of the Apes\" from 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is a far, far cry from the quality and plot of the original.<br /><br />Certainly special effects have improved since 1968, but writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialog was awful. I sat through the entire film with a friend (who thankfully only rented it) and completely understood why, before Christmas, all of the \"Planet of the Apes\" toys at Target were in the clearance bin.<br /><br />My advice to Tim Burton: don't put this on your resume.<br /><br />My advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 \"Planet of the Apes\" movie.","finished_norm":["thi","tim","burton","remak","of","the","origin","planet","of","the","ap","from","and","star","charleton","heston","be","a","far","far","cry","from","the","qualiti","and","plot","of","the","originalbr","br","certainli","special","effect","have","improv","sinc","but","write","have","not","the","charact","be","bore","and","the","dialog","be","aw","i","sit","through","the","entir","film","with","a","friend","who","thankfulli","onli","rent","it","and","complet","understand","why","befor","christma","all","of","the","planet","of","the","ap","toi","at","target","be","in","the","clearanc","binbr","br","my","advic","to","tim","burton","do","not","put","thi","on","your","resumebr","br","my","advic","to","everyon","els","watch","the","origin","planet","of","the","ap","movi"],"filtered":["thi","tim","burton","remak","origin","planet","ap","star","charleton","heston","far","far","cry","qualiti","plot","originalbr","br","certainli","special","effect","improv","sinc","write","charact","bore","dialog","aw","sit","entir","film","friend","thankfulli","onli","rent","complet","understand","befor","christma","planet","ap","toi","target","clearanc","binbr","br","advic","tim","burton","put","thi","resumebr","br","advic","everyon","els","watch","origin","planet","ap","movi"],"filtered2":["tim","burton","remak","origin","planet","ap","star","charleton","heston","far","far","cry","qualiti","plot","originalbr","certainli","special","effect","improv","sinc","write","charact","bore","dialog","aw","sit","entir","friend","thankfulli","onli","rent","complet","understand","befor","christma","planet","ap","toi","target","clearanc","binbr","advic","tim","burton","put","resumebr","advic","everyon","els","watch","origin","planet","ap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,10,11,32,65,69,79,100,101,103,106,108,138,159,161,162,196,198,203,212,244,246,319,389,432,483,661,748,856,1007,1117,1271,1283,1412,1441,1444,2094,2504,2817,5013],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,10,11,32,65,69,79,100,101,103,106,108,138,159,161,162,196,198,203,212,244,246,319,389,432,483,661,748,856,1007,1117,1271,1283,1412,1441,1444,2094,2504,2817,5013],"values":[0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.3711311285073675,1.9073850067444174,4.254065042302116,1.9469506069506084,2.1405462403177813,4.197164082437498,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,2.2907365189289424,2.300267965194495,2.4323182980210873,2.3586007221245198,2.478925055209576,2.5439726117360975,2.569760528637609,2.5983793339432615,2.634508058031767,2.673149229007135,2.9056060024680126,3.0914425013694116,3.235085203598255,3.613480989738201,3.5727776966246974,4.246178114249808,3.900174431363043,13.075170314570208,4.181290492043933,4.3773181147422555,8.754636229484511,4.605250182788262,15.388496480659178,9.597669863721855,11.083487243959873,5.156897801074508,5.878215858601149,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.457909248881569E-4,2.455731171235749E-4,2.4563375102320043E-4,2.4558437078212714E-4,2.456076124297671E-4,2.4557176310749217E-4,2.4564813933516803E-4,2.4553522603438366E-4,2.455731690229428E-4,2.458269422827268E-4,2.4777750751927863E-4,2.455735746463145E-4,2.4580614834016643E-4,2.458317570999924E-4,2.4572008215156897E-4,2.4558533810341906E-4,2.456698289576874E-4,2.457854420144057E-4,2.455980166155373E-4,2.4559711868482115E-4,2.4581807062765707E-4,2.456217250087549E-4,2.4562209673594947E-4,2.4577944488095305E-4,2.4559810520892613E-4,2.4583469539626147E-4,2.456595651838668E-4,2.455725667432641E-4,2.456838988504998E-4,2.4575888511788323E-4,2.456229298230691E-4,2.457544801154609E-4,2.458751394299812E-4,2.4610334968444493E-4,2.456591406772317E-4,2.4558518915201836E-4,2.4567373648188103E-4,2.456101306213584E-4,2.455354880977234E-4,2.4559794055782825E-4,2.4584407166447064E-4,2.4570921071599174E-4,2.457550401475785E-4,2.45547708371559E-4,2.455980030071629E-4,2.4558509680261057E-4,2.456682251312384E-4,2.45710824308536E-4,2.45660860400872E-4,2.456219227204773E-4,2.45585704115684E-4,2.4608886934091685E-4,2.4564750055311083E-4,2.455979467164124E-4,2.456461850197627E-4,2.455728179973834E-4,0.9085021118797352,2.456111314579804E-4,2.4558604888657974E-4,2.4557267781815637E-4,2.4576914185124143E-4,2.45670483956819E-4,2.45572575162329E-4,2.455476083298701E-4,2.455229158054901E-4,2.4574490738726824E-4,2.455846055853151E-4,2.4569623921273046E-4,0.07233433204945042,2.456568445147523E-4,2.45598272002757E-4,2.455479302264222E-4,2.456107459237865E-4,2.4554779797126576E-4,2.4556068392259214E-4,2.455479371760406E-4,2.4570733210020184E-4,2.456342017350079E-4,2.455729029385072E-4,2.455966912779255E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie was seriously awful. The acting was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, well it's an old movie. Then I remembered that that is no excuse! I've seen older movies with way better acting and such.<br /><br />The music was terrible to. It was really choppy. The editing was poor (most of the dialog was out of sync.)<br /><br />Overall, this movie doesn't even deserve a 1. I only watched it because I was so bored, and the movie hardly entertained me. It was just laughable. My dead grandmother's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","serious","aw","the","act","be","the","wrong","it","be","wrong","than","a","student","film","super","cheesi","and","i","think","the","wrong","actor","be","the","old","ladi","at","i","think","to","myself","good","it","a","old","movi","then","i","rememb","that","that","be","no","excus","i","have","see","old","movi","with","wai","well","act","and","suchbr","br","the","music","be","terribl","to","it","be","realli","choppi","the","edit","be","poor","much","of","the","dialog","be","out","of","syncbr","br","overal","thi","movi","doe","not","even","deserv","a","i","onli","watch","it","becaus","i","be","so","bore","and","the","movi","hardli","entertain","me","it","be","just","laughabl","my","dead","grandmoth","leav","pinki","toe","can","make","a","well","movi","than","thi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","serious","aw","act","wrong","wrong","student","film","super","cheesi","think","wrong","actor","old","ladi","think","good","old","movi","rememb","excus","see","old","movi","wai","well","act","suchbr","br","music","terribl","realli","choppi","edit","poor","much","dialog","syncbr","br","overal","thi","movi","doe","even","deserv","onli","watch","becaus","bore","movi","hardli","entertain","laughabl","dead","grandmoth","leav","pinki","toe","make","well","movi","thi"],"filtered2":["serious","aw","act","wrong","wrong","student","super","cheesi","think","wrong","actor","old","ladi","think","good","old","rememb","excus","see","old","wai","well","act","suchbr","music","terribl","realli","choppi","edit","poor","dialog","syncbr","overal","doe","even","deserv","onli","watch","becaus","bore","hardli","entertain","laughabl","dead","grandmoth","leav","pinki","toe","make","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,11,12,13,18,20,21,22,25,33,41,67,74,108,118,138,146,166,195,228,290,348,371,412,423,432,472,543,552,617,626,665,1342,2896,2909,5449],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,11,12,13,18,20,21,22,25,33,41,67,74,108,118,138,146,166,195,228,290,348,371,412,423,432,472,543,552,617,626,665,1342,2896,2909,5449],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,3.838916364248105,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,5.871274616779973,1.9486336368009016,2.138507503627933,2.354379525480895,2.2907365189289424,2.326138445979858,2.4423870329693536,2.51289241584188,2.7742700004069256,2.8612813773965557,3.0103169565570433,3.0466846007279185,3.107414446935464,3.164467636384302,3.235085203598255,3.4222967456864013,3.477726550625732,3.424750734647968,3.5119855004467477,3.6528204042982337,3.5929222627171646,4.484804029712395,5.649374286172302,5.373120909544144,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351967E-4,2.558082347393929E-4,2.558713957686222E-4,2.558199574334823E-4,2.5584416775798705E-4,2.558068242899594E-4,2.558863837637596E-4,2.5576876440667936E-4,2.5580828880184827E-4,2.5607263894884233E-4,2.5810450080634116E-4,2.5580871133099113E-4,2.560509783460779E-4,2.56077654440439E-4,2.5596132504838087E-4,2.5582096507126853E-4,2.559089773770745E-4,2.560294090118493E-4,2.558341720046743E-4,2.5583323664955847E-4,2.5606339753655267E-4,2.5585886852800936E-4,2.5585925574823345E-4,2.560231619269078E-4,2.558342642905021E-4,2.560807152004707E-4,2.558982858246214E-4,2.5580766142005977E-4,2.5592363368182595E-4,2.5600174526388235E-4,2.5586012355716933E-4,2.5599715666759426E-4,2.5612284488059513E-4,2.563605665947126E-4,2.558978436251892E-4,2.558208099117978E-4,2.5591304776099067E-4,2.5584679090401074E-4,2.5576903739242437E-4,2.558340927769945E-4,2.560904822574153E-4,2.559500005077444E-4,2.5599774004100704E-4,2.557817669888661E-4,2.5583415782912334E-4,2.5582071371340584E-4,2.55907306705555E-4,2.559516813523953E-4,2.5589963502432037E-4,2.558590744800585E-4,2.558213463383734E-4,2.56345482732278E-4,2.5588571835822845E-4,2.5583409919225915E-4,2.558843479954319E-4,2.558079231460724E-4,0.9797817241789057,2.5584783345399556E-4,2.558217054788007E-4,2.5580777712438626E-4,2.560124294824372E-4,2.5590965967558333E-4,2.5580767019001865E-4,2.557816627775903E-4,2.557559411059884E-4,2.5598718496250994E-4,2.558202020229134E-4,2.559364883717661E-4,2.5601159924283504E-4,2.5589545176211634E-4,2.558344380360486E-4,2.557819980903058E-4,2.558474318513172E-4,2.557818603229537E-4,2.557952833413213E-4,2.5578200532957383E-4,2.559480435940781E-4,2.558718652654189E-4,2.558080116274142E-4,2.558327914289872E-4]}}
{"value":"This film's kind of like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note.

{"value":"There was nothing about this movie that I liked. It was so obviously low-budget with bad lighting and camera work (almost like Blair Witch Project, only it wasn't supposed to be that way). There wasn't really much to the plot, and the movie just drug on and on. I actually fast-forwarded through the last 1/3 of the movies, but that did not help matters much. It looked like it might be good from the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie even resembled good. No good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was horrible, and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my own personal scale, I give this movie a 0 of 10.

{"value":"Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork).
