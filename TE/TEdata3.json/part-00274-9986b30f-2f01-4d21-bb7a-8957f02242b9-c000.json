{"value":"Frankly I'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering. Have they all been written by his pals? The action clunks along, the music is irritating and over used, the script is simply dire and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) mediocre at best. I do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i.e. continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's his first film, low budget etc. - I get it, but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch.","finished_norm":["frankli","i","be","rather","incens","that","on","the","basi","of","the","dazzl","review","attribut","to","steven","smith","i","wast","nearli","two","hour","on","hi","debut","offer","have","thei","all","be","write","by","hi","pal","the","action","clunk","along","the","music","be","irrit","and","over","us","the","script","be","simpli","dire","and","the","actor","with","the","except","of","the","garden","mediocr","at","well","i","do","think","we","should","support","the","effort","of","a","young","filmmak","but","sai","it","brilliant","when","it","not","will","sure","onli","encourag","him","to","make","the","same","mistak","again","ie","continu","to","write","hi","own","script","and","us","the","same","actor","for","anoth","ventur","ye","it","hi","film","low","budget","etc","i","get","it","but","it","conjur","out","there","for","member","of","the","public","to","purchas","and","it","just","not","up","to","scratch"],"filtered":["frankli","rather","incens","basi","dazzl","review","attribut","steven","smith","wast","nearli","two","hour","hi","debut","offer","thei","write","hi","pal","action","clunk","along","music","irrit","us","script","simpli","dire","actor","except","garden","mediocr","well","think","support","effort","young","filmmak","sai","brilliant","sure","onli","encourag","make","mistak","ie","continu","write","hi","script","us","actor","anoth","ventur","ye","hi","film","low","budget","etc","get","conjur","member","public","purchas","scratch"],"filtered2":["frankli","rather","incens","basi","dazzl","review","attribut","steven","smith","wast","nearli","two","hour","debut","offer","write","pal","action","clunk","along","music","irrit","us","script","simpli","dire","actor","except","garden","mediocr","well","think","support","effort","young","filmmak","brilliant","sure","onli","encourag","make","mistak","ie","continu","write","script","us","actor","anoth","ventur","ye","low","budget","etc","get","conjur","member","public","purchas","scratch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,11,12,20,39,41,47,56,65,73,77,89,118,119,129,135,160,174,176,201,209,217,233,256,323,324,401,429,433,458,507,593,611,618,780,787,912,959,1194,1332,1416,1528,1911,2034,2255,2256,2345,2363,2490,3355,3396,3506,5593],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,11,12,20,39,41,47,56,65,73,77,89,118,119,129,135,160,174,176,201,209,217,233,256,323,324,401,429,433,458,507,593,611,618,780,787,912,959,1194,1332,1416,1528,1911,2034,2255,2256,2345,2363,2490,3355,3396,3506,5593],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.5538940054862738,3.1375198335242067,1.7064694353107215,3.7221218701403576,3.8147700134888347,1.8950689206770979,3.8927804517536475,1.9940046109572438,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.4106958340079214,2.366244071437088,2.3722295531801256,2.456282578459816,2.5040471493269134,2.561435818751577,2.6026896854443837,2.6113665294700725,2.6102777977348763,2.748952192422636,3.0433232530252132,2.8753661172782943,3.0879275592619675,3.2872346624216657,3.164467636384302,3.2850956241729166,3.365138331846453,3.5227672760500357,3.520060914452293,3.5642670069567886,3.7775721092707104,3.760240652919071,3.9405024767500145,3.969732115064953,4.499089986959872,4.383707912841026,4.484804029712395,4.848596441419991,4.8796870284900224,4.890269137820559,5.051537285416681,5.064116067623542,5.214056214914456,5.156897801074508,5.156897801074508,5.672363804397,5.583416318380505,5.604922523601468,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.788566616294064E-5,6.742789724563074E-5,6.795208485090173E-5,6.755945698071542E-5,6.756056386635459E-5,6.746612769924977E-5,6.766678141590663E-5,6.743760642224704E-5,6.758923074540758E-5,0.2601016153876499,0.693943318271684,6.732874725713164E-5,6.858540493655723E-5,6.956379080866173E-5,6.73778426772648E-5,6.719163939090668E-5,6.886765078566833E-5,6.767312128255502E-5,6.746316568740023E-5,6.751908065700847E-5,6.817236736310204E-5,6.774016822123085E-5,6.781730067936967E-5,6.789036621452336E-5,6.841138989675494E-5,6.805361758687511E-5,7.0914462387356E-5,6.734876347635635E-5,6.73505652135019E-5,6.752119748960179E-5,6.895634473535987E-5,6.766920020305527E-5,7.263715404356994E-5,6.785954367751328E-5,6.742206957664693E-5,6.773326687282902E-5,6.735451097806592E-5,6.739431253846688E-5,6.71913018146777E-5,6.720873433829297E-5,6.736001303120919E-5,6.807051843694278E-5,6.772462352737953E-5,6.745685929762767E-5,6.827653087093048E-5,6.74827496088424E-5,6.972486627208254E-5,6.86995417899189E-5,6.722543938293942E-5,6.737401171509349E-5,6.73506438695033E-5,0.04072677732409991,6.737501411194497E-5,6.720276773847704E-5,6.794041428897688E-5,6.739236812701336E-5,7.247308530776734E-5,6.7336828

{"value":"This movie deserves more than a 1. But I'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list. Seriously it's not that great its not that bad. Its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous. These are the types who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say \"I'm rick james b!tch\" No matter how old or annoying it gets. I dread having to hear \"I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane\" months from now from idiots trying to be funny.

{"value":"There was not one original idea in this story. Themes were pulled from various sources; a few being The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film), and The Ring. It even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and using it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red. Claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop-out. This was bottom-of-the-barrel. Throwing gore and \"disturbing\" imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film. Carpenter used to know that.

Now imagine something 50 times worse.<br /><br />Got that?<br /><br />Ok, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie. That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the single worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs...very few. But it was lame. Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it. He wasted his money. Vince Offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's not surprise why.","finished_norm":["imagin","the","wrong","skit","from","saturdai","night","live","and","mad","tv","in","on","minut","movi","now","imagin","that","all","the","humor","in","that","bad","skit","be","remov","and","replac","with","stupid","now","imagin","someth","time","worsebr","br","get","thatbr","br","okai","now","go","see","the","underground","comedi","movi","that","vision","you","just","have","will","seem","like","the","funni","thing","ever","ucm","be","the","singl","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","there","be","a","few","cheap","laughsveri","few","but","it","be","lame","even","if","the","intent","of","the","movi","be","to","be","lame","it","be","too","lame","to","be","funnybr","br","the","onli","reason","i","be","not","angri","for","wast","my","time","watch","thi","be","someon","els","i","know","bui","it","he","wast","hi","monei","vinc","offer","have","not","write","or","direct","anyth","els","and","it","not","surpris","why"],"filtered":["imagin","wrong","skit","saturdai","night","live","mad","tv","minut","movi","imagin","humor","bad","skit","remov","replac","stupid","imagin","someth","time","worsebr","br","get","thatbr","br","okai","go","see","underground","comedi","movi","vision","seem","like","funni","thing","ever","ucm","singl","wrong","movi","ever","see","cheap","laughsveri","lame","even","intent","movi","lame","lame","funnybr","br","onli","reason","angri","wast","time","watch","thi","someon","els","know","bui","wast","hi","monei","vinc","offer","write","direct","anyth","els","surpris"],"filtered2":["imagin","wrong","skit","saturdai","night","live","mad","tv","minut","imagin","humor","bad","skit","remov","replac","stupid","imagin","someth","time","worsebr","get","thatbr","okai","go","see","underground","comedi","vision","seem","like","funni","thing","ever","ucm","singl","wrong","ever","see","cheap","laughsveri","lame","even","intent","lame","lame","funnybr","onli","reason","angri","wast","time","watch","someon","els","know","bui","wast","monei","vinc","offer","write","direct","anyth","els","surpris"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,25,26,29,35,44,53,59,62,65,89,95,102,104,116,126,127,136,139,172,191,196,210,326,340,347,351,369,372,443,507,811,831,1161,1202,1509,1518,1589,1793,2284,2301,2413,3423,4067],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,25,26,29,35,44,53,59,62,65,89,95,102,104,116,126,127,136,139,172,191,196,210,326,340,347,351,369,372,443,507,811,831,1161,1202,1509,1518,1589,1793,2284,2301,2413,3423,4067],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,3.209458785004948,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,3.9880092219144876,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.0728240170322856,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.5001408943598484,2.5460113484259455,4.957850110419152,2.687151791517189,2.942840385588056,8.846786053365934,3.0151989841543516,3.0135689919434205,3.121829110937649,9.211607449650295,3.239158528985891,3.365138331846453,3.8425769395797067,3.9282323841582003,4.327618446189983,4.315570107673808,4.597282013139085,4.5432147918688095,4.558366596889411,4.77960356993304,5.185068678041204,10.645380111834504,5.129498826886393,5.626901430320244,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.4201111370406E-5,7.37007559296316E-5,7.427370902969166E-5,7.384455474765377E-5,7.384576460754363E-5,7.374254298582574E-5,7.396186364095203E-5,7.37113683569103E-5,7.387709838395746E-5,8.196260786509985E-5,0.8405915796022713,7.359238195682063E-5,7.496594727179781E-5,7.603535298234954E-5,7.36460447540352E-5,7.344251886161142E-5,7.527445062556118E-5,7.396879330928763E-5,7.373930541619504E-5,7.380042218975981E-5,7.451448455926363E-5,7.404207766583778E-5,7.412638580391947E-5,7.420624867067348E-5,7.4775743505991E-5,7.438468741843752E-5,7.75116783673724E-5,7.361426029721052E-5,7.361622965106906E-5,7.38027359525891E-5,7.53713958278539E-5,7.396450744935433E-5,7.939463308616073E-5,7.417255869411915E-5,7.369438610902381E-5,7.403453428075645E-5,7.362054249253332E-5,7.366404681653801E-5,7.34421498804586E-5,7.346120416245001E-5,7.362655640505898E-5,7.440316056496474E-5,7.402508683957246E-5,7.373241233910957E-5,0.15361071801871132,7.376071124187422E-5,7.621141339503872E-5,7.509070234671199E-5,7.347946328765744E-5,7.364185739510074E-5,7.361631562448657E-5,7.56881554729966E-5,7.364295304554683E-5,7.345468248618948E-5,7.426095274822478E-5,7.366192151529304E-5,7.921530093512211E-5,7.360121452052099E-5,7.347861353981835E-5,7.3829452353

Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen, and was not funny the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which \"Envy\" certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies, \"Flirting With Disaster\", and \"Duplex\", immediately come to mind. Be certain that \"Envy\" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just total nonsense. \"Envy\" deserves it's low rating, because like it's subject matter, it stinks. -

{"value":"I went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when I got in the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! This shouted to me that this film is not very good. <br /><br />Not to my surprise, the film was dire. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him. His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good. The plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent.<br /><br />However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny.<br /><br />I hope this review stops other people wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I came out of the

{"value":"I grew up watching and loving TNG. I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD, which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark. The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY. They could have featured memories that would be \"new\" to the audience, rather than simply regurgitating old show clips. The in and out transitions between the \"memories\" and the \"present\" in this episode start as cliché in the beginning, and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on. Bar none- worst episode

{"value":"Boring. Minimal plot. No character development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It COULD have been an awesome movie. It COULD have probably become a cult classic. Nope, it was a giant let-down. It was poorly cast and had horrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who were the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I am still left puzzled by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so-called \"prophecy\", which is never really FULLY explained. I felt like I was watching a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It seemed very much like a made-for-TV movie. Don't go see this movie. It is a waste of time AND

{"value":"After we counted the use of the f word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film, listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse, and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together, well, we turned it off. Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers. <br /><br />We did give it a second chance, thinking surely it would get better. No dice. Later, my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved, still no dice.<br /><br />The main character did have a cool bike.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except

{"value":"The problem is the role of the characters in the film. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... The kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he 'manages' to relate to the pygmies... No notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... I find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the 'white mans'

{"value":"Frank Tashlin's 'The Home Front' is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Rather than have Snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster, 'The Home Front' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too. Snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. It's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief. The result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact.","finished_norm":["frank","tashlin","the","home","front","be","on","of","the","much","lifeless","privat","snafu","short","a","seri","of","cartoon","make","a","instruct","film","for","the","militari","rather","than","have","snafu","take","some","inadvis","action","lead","to","disast","the","home","front","instead","focu","on","hi","love","on","back","home","and","how","much","thei","have","to","offer","to","the","war","effort","too","snafu","realis","he","be","wrong","when","he","think","thei","have","it","easi","it","a","concept","with","few","possibl","for","good","gag","and","instead","tashlin","plai","the","risqué","card","much","heavili","extend","joke","involv","stripper","and","scantili","cloth","danc","girl","in","place","of","much","effect","comic","relief","the","result","be","a","wellmean","short","which","have","littl","relev","or","entertain","valu","todai","other","than","a","a","histor","artefact"],"filtered":["frank","tashlin","home","front","much","lifeless","privat","snafu","short","seri","cartoon","make","instruct","film","militari","rather","snafu","take","inadvis","action","lead","disast","home","front","instead","focu","hi","love","back","home","much","thei","offer","war","effort","snafu","realis","wrong","think","thei","easi","concept","possibl","good","gag","instead","tashlin","plai","risqué","card","much","heavili","extend","joke","involv","stripper","scantili","cloth","danc","girl","place","much","effect","comic","relief","result","wellmean","short","littl","relev","entertain","valu","todai","histor","artefact"],"filtered2":["frank","tashlin","home","front","lifeless","privat","snafu","short","cartoon","make","instruct","militari","rather","snafu","take","inadvis","action","lead","disast","home","front","instead","focu","love","back","home","offer","war","effort","snafu","realis","wrong","think","easi","concept","possibl","good","gag","instead","tashlin","plai","risqué","card","heavili","extend","joke","involv","stripper","scantili","cloth","danc","girl","place","effect","comic","relief","result","wellmean","short","littl","relev","entertain","valu","todai","histor","artefact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,12,14,25,31,40,54,63,84,106,129,152,157,160,164,195,214,241,272,302,314,401,402,447,451,480,492,507,619,653,726,744,773,789,879,953,984,998,1034,1435,1576,1690,1694,1748,2017,2099,2430,3007,3891,4511,6367],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,12,14,25,31,40,54,63,84,106,129,152,157,160,164,195,214,241,272,302,314,401,402,447,451,480,492,507,619,653,726,744,773,789,879,953,984,998,1034,1435,1576,1690,1694,1748,2017,2099,2430,3007,3891,4511,6367],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,1.6284968758320737,1.8113893252729412,1.8729627573220065,2.2212694515902225,2.159084361316692,2.4106958340079214,4.6262390953961505,2.3360150694757706,2.3722295531801256,2.3930275298746078,2.51289241584188,2.7303758068497004,2.6627744961815836,5.605761068896383,8.708058877094034,3.189397019426827,3.0879275592619675,3.084424928710765,3.2070272508030975,3.216957819005698,3.43462735814388,3.6016814428070463,3.365138331846453,3.5929222627171646,3.9911462095687695,3.7034641371169887,3.700222643192818,7.472940867170317,3.8059428063999263,3.8962296530720266,4.1302590120314875,4.263079925052412,4.135246553542527,4.125296222689358,4.6973654716960676,4.6973654716960676,4.74221603786142,4.688631791727313,4.751432692966343,4.979216623837056,4.944927550358424,5.129498826886393,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149,5.999576715605417,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.547428266012339E-5,6.503277426550843E-5,6.553834207347645E-5,6.515966083477255E-5,6.516072840245374E-5,6.50696467257487E-5,6.526317297221232E-5,6.50421385600658E-5,6.518837699822055E-5,7.232294578623692E-5,0.747868268986156,6.493714620822229E-5,6.614916584005796E-5,0.1176118310555635,6.498449769781952E-5,6.480490858435345E-5,6.642138596470092E-5,6.526928763889273E-5,6.506678992825313E-5,6.51207187284254E-5,6.575079987619237E-5,6.533395298671182E-5,6.540834560376782E-5,6.547881576001382E-5,6.59813320314336E-5,6.563626824007575E-5,6.839549226630598E-5,6.495645142638365E-5,6.495818916357936E-5,6.512276036848571E-5,6.650692939471466E-5,6.526550584102566E-5,7.005699176701738E-5,6.544908807794826E-5,6.502715360259294E-5,6.532729678280991E-5,6.496199476966645E-5,6.500038252901687E-5,6.480458299925303E-5,6.48213962978944E-5,6.496730138302204E-5,6.565256875087681E-5,6.531896045976741E-5,6.506070754930818E-5,0.06160224069940357,6.508567820438819E-5,6.724815208825054E-5,0.06793517951630816,6.483750795852694E-5,6.498080281620103E-5,6.495826502562154E-5,6.678643478430194E-5,6.498176960666654E-5,6.4815

{"value":"This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting. Granted the script was terribly cliché, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","great","stori","and","be","just","the","begin","of","equal","in","the","unit","state","we","be","still","work","on","it","too","howev","despit","the","fact","thi","be","true","it","still","a","movi","and","thi","be","a","movi","site","i","realiz","independ","film","have","a","hard","time","get","good","actor","but","wow","the","onli","on","even","mediocr","be","the","excel","ossi","davi","but","even","he","can","not","make","up","for","all","the","actor","includ","the","on","plai","him","a","a","young","man","absolut","atroci","act","grant","the","script","be","terribli","cliché","but","even","then","you","have","get","to","get","some","decent","actor","i","would","not","recommend","thi","to","anybodi","becaus","it","be","so","poorli","do","in","everi","categori","read","some","book","about","the","true","stori","of","the","uss","mason","becaus","thei","give","thi","man","the","respect","thei","deserv"],"filtered":["thi","great","stori","begin","equal","unit","state","still","work","howev","despit","fact","thi","true","still","movi","thi","movi","site","realiz","independ","film","hard","time","get","good","actor","wow","onli","even","mediocr","excel","ossi","davi","even","make","actor","includ","plai","young","man","absolut","atroci","act","grant","script","terribli","cliché","even","get","get","decent","actor","recommend","thi","anybodi","becaus","poorli","everi","categori","read","book","true","stori","uss","mason","becaus","thei","give","thi","man","respect","thei","deserv"],"filtered2":["great","stori","begin","equal","unit","state","still","work","howev","despit","fact","true","still","site","realiz","independ","hard","time","get","good","actor","wow","onli","even","mediocr","excel","ossi","davi","even","make","actor","includ","plai","young","man","absolut","atroci","act","grant","script","terribli","cliché","even","get","get","decent","actor","recommend","anybodi","becaus","poorli","everi","categori","read","book","true","stori","uss","mason","becaus","give","man","respect","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,8,11,17,21,22,30,40,41,45,48,51,64,77,85,97,113,135,145,147,151,171,222,298,301,304,309,391,398,405,423,498,523,580,695,787,906,1003,1066,1153,1209,1210,1219,1473,1481,1510,1771,3896],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,8,11,17,21,22,30,40,41,45,48,51,64,77,85,97,113,135,145,147,151,171,222,298,301,304,309,391,398,405,423,498,523,580,695,787,906,1003,1066,1153,1209,1210,1219,1473,1481,1510,1771,3896],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,2.389902141215977,2.7780513171783934,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,1.3364419891718522,1.6284968758320737,4.70627975028631,3.632592212924433,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,3.766857155204268,1.9463902258768238,2.011190219103739,2.0545557924622586,2.1521782565202803,2.366244071437088,2.34599021453259,2.2844323215331563,2.8002454868101863,2.373087554090762,2.5771019354959765,2.7819920465008363,2.8309760279012264,5.742239652793686,2.848772527704847,3.109204957709252,3.143848349181566,3.109204957709252,3.164467636384302,3.386191741044285,3.4986697244709752,3.5039747767006686,3.6284289511740746,3.760240652919071,3.9081109809587793,4.035401218572811,4.3095999406873045,4.213208095012239,4.3095999406873045,4.364659717870332,4.246178114249808,4.535724120139652,4.597282013139085,4.581533656170946,5.102830579804232,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.934213988474706E-5,7.88071172868261E-5,7.941976747727183E-5,7.896087921470105E-5,7.896217289980695E-5,7.88517995617502E-5,7.90863158618064E-5,7.881846499677427E-5,7.899567763882538E-5,8.764139213614369E-5,0.9214173507826381,7.869123461671743E-5,8.015996748808547E-5,8.130346703833592E-5,7.874861544410089E-5,7.853098824784172E-5,8.048984551547805E-5,7.90937256526341E-5,7.884833767691074E-5,7.891368892984918E-5,7.96772251540546E-5,7.917208752028513E-5,7.926223695284157E-5,7.934763312317602E-5,7.995658544279622E-5,0.028395770436062184,8.28820797174528E-5,7.871462879925192E-5,7.871673459991231E-5,7.891616300187682E-5,8.0593507572008E-5,7.908914284663467E-5,8.489549506845702E-5,7.931160893454705E-5,7.880030613281008E-5,7.916402149130963E-5,7.872134625685975E-5,7.876786478059911E-5,7.853059370180726E-5,7.855096816088538E-5,0.044065949484748096,7.955818807003978E-5,7.91539194835886E-5,7.884096701256017E-5,7.979896743156533E-5,7.887122660652404E-5,8.149172580742657E-5,8.029336622595291E-5,7.857049237069336E-5,7.874413796374796E-5,7.87168265300033E-5,8.09322139284303E-5,7.874530952640184E-5,7.854399462988847E-5,7.940612737606768E-5,7.876559222772812E-5,8.470373787842639E-5,7.870067914513099E-5,7.856958374802355E-5,7.894473045024797E-5,7

I often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud, stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself, before I returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture.<br /><br />Dean Morgan, Rochester,

{"value":"From the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the Fiend. It's all tiresome, slow moving, unimaginative drivel. It was OK seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around. Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this. I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic. And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned.

{"value":"this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life, and i've seen some pretty bad movies. i didn't like the way this movie was filmed. all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely horrible. i've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming. the story is too weird. i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. there was no point in even filming this movie. if you're considering watching this movie, don't. you're just wasting your

{"value":"Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie. Now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse.<br /><br />Got that?<br /><br />OK, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie. That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the single worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs...very few. But it was lame. Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it.

{"value":"The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11 around, the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of Eleanor Powell. The late Miss Powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton here. The two of them also starred in \"I Dood It.\"<br /><br />Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later, was superb as the interrogating police officer in \"Mildred Pierce\" again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item.

This ain't magic. I don't know what it is. It's just awful. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late '70s. Gandolfini. Applegate.

{"value":"First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say that I was scared out of mind. Not because it was scary but because the content.Cmon...I was 7. Anyway, the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy. That's very bad considering that I was only 7 and I remember that. The one thing that still haunts me is that dreadful song \"I wish we all were ready\" where the chorus ends with \"...you were left behind\". I wouldn't suggest seeing this one. I probably will, just for nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this movie though, has to be when everyone \"dissapears\"; vacant cars crashing, lawnmowers running on their own...pretty hilarious.","finished_norm":["of","all","i","see","thi","movi","when","i","be","year","old","at","a","christian","scholl","i","attend","needless","to","sai","that","i","be","scare","out","of","mind","not","becaus","it","be","scari","but","becaus","the","contentcmoni","be","anywai","the","cinematographi","be","pretti","bad","and","the","act","be","cheesi","that","veri","bad","consid","that","i","be","onli","and","i","rememb","that","the","on","thing","that","still","haunt","me","be","that","dread","song","i","wish","we","all","be","readi","where","the","choru","end","with","you","be","leav","behind","i","would","not","suggest","see","thi","on","i","probabl","will","just","for","nostalg","reason","besid","i","be","sure","the","remak","be","much","well","the","well","part","of","thi","movi","though","have","to","be","when","everyon","dissapear","vacant","car","crash","lawnmow","run","on","their","ownpretti","hilari"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","year","old","christian","scholl","attend","needless","sai","scare","mind","becaus","scari","becaus","contentcmoni","anywai","cinematographi","pretti","bad","act","cheesi","veri","bad","consid","onli","rememb","thing","still","haunt","dread","song","wish","readi","choru","end","leav","behind","suggest","see","thi","probabl","nostalg","reason","besid","sure","remak","much","well","well","part","thi","movi","though","everyon","dissapear","vacant","car","crash","lawnmow","run","ownpretti","hilari"],"filtered2":["see","year","old","christian","scholl","attend","needless","scare","mind","becaus","scari","becaus","contentcmoni","anywai","cinematographi","pretti","bad","act","cheesi","veri","bad","consid","onli","rememb","thing","still","haunt","dread","song","wish","readi","choru","end","leav","behind","suggest","see","probabl","nostalg","reason","besid","sure","remak","well","well","part","though","everyon","dissapear","vacant","car","crash","lawnmow","run","ownpretti","hilari"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,11,15,20,21,22,24,29,57,61,64,67,74,78,86,95,119,137,148,238,246,284,290,317,328,386,393,396,399,483,543,623,629,632,646,684,972,995,1183,1262,1334,1876,2205,3134,4233,7711],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,11,15,20,21,22,24,29,57,61,64,67,74,78,86,95,119,137,148,238,246,284,290,317,328,386,393,396,399,483,543,623,629,632,646,684,972,995,1183,1262,1334,1876,2205,3134,4233,7711],"values":[1.3114004109387893,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,1.9486336368009016,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,2.0323326556775485,2.1653408989309972,2.2939035841256437,2.3018654096236517,2.597304642813496,2.673149229007135,3.110998680163279,2.8612813773965557,2.8529247828056143,3.1550424959247185,3.0433232530252132,3.120015873813468,3.291526514503207,3.129115117668582,3.613480989738201,3.477726550625732,3.607563812710113,3.488143311483988,3.541919708264792,3.5900195030592035,4.1302590120314875,3.9911462095687695,4.030886538218284,4.315570107673808,4.528289141652134,4.383707912841026,4.890269137820559,5.0768550934009715,6.032366538428407,5.878215858601149,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.644460568762445E-5,8.586168950237373E-5,8.652918226491404E-5,8.602921572796112E-5,8.603062521980274E-5,8.591037159794932E-5,8.616588108023863E-5,8.587405302462499E-5,8.606712920062961E-5,0.06530249793595691,0.7828532731466566,8.573543336990587E-5,8.733564271780461E-5,8.858150485196138E-5,8.579795075353576E-5,8.556084223598312E-5,0.11273360974437176,8.61739541728885E-5,8.590659981576246E-5,8.597780111307637E-5,8.68096867658396E-5,8.625933075536887E-5,8.63575500895288E-5,8.645059066396402E-5,8.711405453358736E-5,8.665847255285993E-5,9.030143011208129E-5,8.576092172814167E-5,8.576321603363946E-5,8.598049665646835E-5,8.780799198464947E-5,8.616896112810624E-5,9.249508025002555E-5,8.641134170009977E-5,8.585426863467281E-5,8.625054268013841E-5,8.576824051201838E-5,8.58189232317895E-5,8.556041237139384E-5,8.558261068976117E-5,8.577524674531218E-5,8.667999384597618E-5,8.623953637156939E-5,8.589856935207233E-5,8.694232703985056E-5,0.0325384426487816,8.878661597052863E-5,8.748098290286803E-5,8.560388264714301E-5,8.579307246282991E-5,8.576331619303115E-5,8.817701829862776E-5,8.579434890019094E-5,8.557501290958844E-5,8.65143211435497E-5,8.5816447246933E-5,9.228615754257094E-5,8.574572334362981E-5,8.560289268734959E-5,8.601162137548316E-5,8.686478437195451E-5,8.600593121748697E-5,8.558705596082653E-5,8.578633231234825E-5,8.556144723972705E-5,8.754116178638471E-5,8.629851894339155E-5,8.611469046282705E-5,8.603937927402277E-5,8.635300648821226E-5,8.555832582243566E-5,8.6041

{"value":"I see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. The main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it. The camera work, ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateur which I could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn't. The sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well. I see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything, keep your expectations low and you'll get more out of it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me.

It now looks like a disaster area. They don't even live there any more... they live \"in town\" and come out only for the weekend. It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result.

named Azar.FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff's daughters,Dominique and Mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon.\"The Legend of Diablo\" is an absolute garbage.The film lacks scares and gore,the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad.The animation is the only one aspect of the film I enjoyed.I'm a big fan of indie horror flicks,for example I loved \"Torched\",\"Live Feed\",\"Bone Sickness\" or \"Neighborhood Watch\",unfortunately \"The Legend of Diablo\" is a huge misfire.Definitely one to avoid.","finished_norm":["the","small","california","town","of","diablo","be","plagu","with","mysteri","death","after","sheriff","robert","lopez","unearth","a","ancient","boxlegend","have","it","that","the","box","hold","the","sixteenthcenturi","mexican","demon","name","azarfbi","agent","gil","vega","be","send","to","investig","the","murder","and","join","forc","with","the","sheriff","daughtersdominiqu","and","mari","to","fight","with","evil","and","bloodthirsti","demonth","legend","of","diablo","be","a","absolut","garbageth","film","lack","scare","and","goreth","act","be","amateurish","and","the","direct","be","badth","anim","be","the","onli","on","aspect","of","the","film","i","enjoyedim","a","big","fan","of","indi","horror","flicksfor","exampl","i","love","torchedl","feedbon","sick","or","neighborhood","watchunfortun","the","legend","of","diablo","be","a","huge","misfiredefinit","on","to","avoid"],"filtered":["small","california","town","diablo","plagu","mysteri","death","sheriff","robert","lopez","unearth","ancient","boxlegend","box","hold","sixteenthcenturi","mexican","demon","name","azarfbi","agent","gil","vega","send","investig","murder","join","forc","sheriff","daughtersdominiqu","mari","fight","evil","bloodthirsti","demonth","legend","diablo","absolut","garbageth","film","lack","scare","goreth","act","amateurish","direct","badth","anim","onli","aspect","film","enjoyedim","big","fan","indi","horror","flicksfor","exampl","love","torchedl","feedbon","sick","neighborhood","watchunfortun","legend","diablo","huge","misfiredefinit","avoid"],"filtered2":["small","california","town","diablo","plagu","mysteri","death","sheriff","robert","lopez","unearth","ancient","boxlegend","box","hold","sixteenthcenturi","mexican","demon","name","azarfbi","agent","gil","vega","send","investig","murder","join","forc","sheriff","daughtersdominiqu","mari","fight","evil","bloodthirsti","demonth","legend","diablo","absolut","garbageth","lack","scare","goreth","act","amateurish","direct","badth","anim","onli","aspect","enjoyedim","big","fan","indi","horror","flicksfor","exampl","love","torchedl","feedbon","sick","neighborhood","watchunfortun","legend","diablo","huge","misfiredefinit","avoid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,21,54,82,83,102,140,143,183,222,232,245,273,277,307,321,335,338,363,403,414,444,450,539,623,645,654,721,778,923,1069,1073,1113,1188,1319,1377,1644,1722,1924,2010,2072,2545,2546,2786,5294,6432],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,21,54,82,83,102,140,143,183,222,232,245,273,277,307,321,335,338,363,403,414,444,450,539,623,645,654,721,778,923,1069,1073,1113,1188,1319,1377,1644,1722,1924,2010,2072,2545,2546,2786,5294,6432],"values":[0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.8113893252729412,2.020196584395323,2.292318797740072,2.087553710177271,2.317169775997098,2.3409902041158843,2.4885128563647294,2.5771019354959765,2.8377834061292515,2.7502029743242886,2.9674191958529437,3.1163992333432793,2.8767855639325206,3.09496984188738,2.908534262247101,2.9720957437368454,3.0349689855553557,3.189397019426827,3.1254654785810323,3.2535472664379905,3.469984576472117,3.6105180246075443,3.607563812710113,3.558633189238533,3.634471265630037,3.6841709341823097,3.8059428063999263,4.3521595551061,4.2860694432771105,4.535724120139652,4.268777946167049,4.213208095012239,4.403125998698128,9.116733193778822,9.780538275641119,4.85885294158718,4.8184434032493035,5.143104478942172,5.064116067623542,5.214056214914456,5.3064295350454715,5.695894301807195,6.255510089742618,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.992263463574558E-5,6.94511299638192E-5,6.999104627422228E-5,6.958663726321024E-5,6.958777736191599E-5,6.949050755545905E-5,6.969718206145014E-5,6.946113047272672E-5,6.961730441561475E-5,7.723659899021411E-5,0.5421763295803138,6.934900489365608E-5,7.064336968002755E-5,7.165111287140665E-5,6.939957346458267E-5,6.920778298662309E-5,7.09340845613912E-5,6.970371216131289E-5,6.948745666586705E-5,6.954504941278362E-5,7.021793855484388E-5,6.977277090171361E-5,6.985221778636305E-5,6.992747571646504E-5,7.046413316756534E-5,7.009562558827061E-5,7.304231252588515E-5,6.936962171695245E-5,6.937147751678853E-5,6.954722976278053E-5,7.102543985020573E-5,6.969967342641148E-5,7.481669504396158E-5,6.989572832241677E-5,6.944512743055754E-5,6.97656624723489E-5,6.937554167745108E-5,6.941653751829866E-5,6.920743528112568E-5,6.922539088277809E-5,6.938120882448562E-5,0.03809982052837543,6.975675977579961E-5,6.948096104738289E-5,7.032522757934551E-5,6.950762821990982E-5,0.14124114940284616,7.076093130897182E-5,6.924259717682231E-5,6.939562755105852E-5,6.937155853293171E-5,0.07057846190365319,6.93966600256996E-5,6.921924524994381E-5,6.997902552693365E-5,6.941453476308787E-5,7.46477032830037E-5,6.935732816689431E-5,6.9241

{"value":"What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too. don't be fooled by the positive comments; It wasn't scary. It wasn't funny. It wasn't clever. It won't even hold your attention. I just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap-fest. the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times. after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained. the dialogue was terrible, must be a translation thing. another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans. 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character, intelligence and judgment.

{"value":"A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50's and that he now has the power to... burst into flames! <br /><br />I was really geared up for this film, what with being directed by the great Toby Hooper and staring wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately it didn't rise above the average individual-with-violent-powers movie. Spontaneous Combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much. The special effects aren't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale.<br /><br />The cast isn't bad, Dourif does steal the show.<br /><br />All around, no classic but it's not the worst of

{"value":"This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, itself brilliant, but not this. Nowhere did I see Mel Brook's name on here and I can guess why, he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. My gawd, who would find this funny. Sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny, well cause it's simply not funny. It's like the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they didn't care. It was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out. I guess it's useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can

{"value":"This is one of the dumbest films, I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all.<br /><br />There's not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes, there's nothing good to say so Ill say nothing. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released, does somebody somewhere not at some stage think, 'Oh my god this really is a load of shite' and call it a day. Its crap like this that has people downloading illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different film, at least if you have download it, you haven't wasted your time or money Don't waste your time, this is

{"value":"It's getting worse, the series is on a serious down fall. The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really, really terrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast can't act. The story is Alice, having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again. This time, the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be \"born again\" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son?

{"value":"There's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland, and Robot Wars does deliver. Sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable.

{"value":"Sadly I don't remember the book anymore, but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there's hope ... I've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. So in conclusion I must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy

{"value":"Gods, I haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it is that astoundingly awful. Mira Sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by Freddie. The movie staging was awkward (like a play, rather, and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the dvd player off, it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film.","finished_norm":["god","i","have","not","watch","a","movi","thi","aw","in","a","long","while","mayb","not","sinc","the","new","gui","or","variou","freddi","prinz","jr","movi","ye","it","be","that","astoundingli","aw","mira","sorvino","blank","and","wooden","act","sure","must","have","be","inspir","by","freddi","the","movi","stage","be","awkward","like","a","plai","rather","and","that","feel","of","confin","doe","not","work","good","on","film","the","actor","have","no","idea","what","thei","be","do","especi","sorvino","her","accent","be","aw","and","her","sex","appeal","nonexist","here","so","it","be","pain","to","see","her","seduc","other","charact","and","thei","fall","for","it","and","what","be","with","the","occaision","shot","of","a","live","audienc","in","lawn","chair","nonsens","i","have","to","turn","the","dvd","player","off","it","would","have","be","selfinflict","pain","to","finish","thi","film"],"filtered":["god","watch","movi","thi","aw","long","mayb","sinc","new","gui","variou","freddi","prinz","jr","movi","ye","astoundingli","aw","mira","sorvino","blank","wooden","act","sure","must","inspir","freddi","movi","stage","awkward","like","plai","rather","feel","confin","doe","work","good","film","actor","idea","thei","especi","sorvino","accent","aw","sex","appeal","nonexist","pain","see","seduc","charact","thei","fall","occaision","shot","live","audienc","lawn","chair","nonsens","turn","dvd","player","selfinflict","pain","finish","thi","film"],"filtered2":["god","watch","aw","long","mayb","sinc","new","gui","variou","freddi","prinz","jr","ye","astoundingli","aw","mira","sorvino","blank","wooden","act","sure","must","inspir","freddi","stage","awkward","like","plai","rather","feel","confin","doe","work","good","actor","idea","especi","sorvino","accent","aw","sex","appeal","nonexist","pain","see","seduc","charact","fall","occaision","shot","live","audienc","lawn","chair","nonsens","turn","dvd","player","selfinflict","pain","finish"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,10,18,21,40,41,43,48,55,87,96,99,116,119,123,138,141,160,162,163,168,170,209,247,254,267,352,441,459,559,573,669,689,890,905,909,942,999,1136,1484,1516,1845,2033,2040,2660,3864,4323,4423,6365,8552],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,10,18,21,40,41,43,48,55,87,96,99,116,119,123,138,141,160,162,163,168,170,209,247,254,267,352,441,459,559,573,669,689,890,905,909,942,999,1136,1484,1516,1845,2033,2040,2660,3864,4323,4423,6365,8552],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.9536997889255368,2.115024371522662,2.0390708128715254,2.056430207256609,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.2619070973220485,6.872209556786827,2.2657547357741192,2.3722295531801256,2.3586007221245198,2.4000574358028657,2.4894767118610357,2.4071371113909277,2.6026896854443837,2.7303758068497004,2.889652074525771,2.7085302779237206,3.1236456418640466,3.293679367864308,6.565922303288567,3.5727776966246974,3.4623020803001006,3.7099788181381825,3.634471265630037,3.8767358583910254,3.9121030022283168,3.9612932464190886,3.9739784059464043,4.1302590120314875,10.153710186801943,4.484804029712395,4.535724120139652,4.9227044135737135,4.956227105612356,5.089758498236879,5.3064295350454715,5.7959777603641776,12.275454108172468,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.66784035755768E-5,6.622877551212845E-5,6.674364108934296E-5,6.635799562008491E-5,6.635908282113239E-5,6.6266326084427E-5,6.646341142297362E-5,6.623831202305041E-5,6.63872398952069E-5,7.365301872709632E-5,0.3206049347587962,6.613138878351053E-5,6.736569836079255E-5,6.832668485058028E-5,6.617961110233545E-5,6.599671921106218E-5,6.764292481666013E-5,6.646963854293709E-5,6.626341674829372E-5,6.631833733934318E-5,6.696000614958821E-5,6.653549313475627E-5,6.661125388755219E-5,6.668302004255685E-5,6.719477796318893E-5,6.684336819121917E-5,6.965333640624262E-5,6.615104903903956E-5,6.615281873451901E-5,6.632041652668768E-5,6.773004145418488E-5,6.646578719498524E-5,0.46775625852539626,6.66527456462351E-5,6.622305148102777E-5,6.65287145182977E-5,6.615669432854181E-5,6.619578806743188E-5,6.59963876382088E-5,6.601351014595839E-5,6.616209853447684E-5,6.685996848057741E-5,6.652022488405384E-5,6.625722250986127E-5,6.706231723829671E-5,6.628265239392146E-5,6.848489578616006E-5,6.747780543142258E-5,6.602991811205258E-5,6.617584826908685E-5,6.615289599172074E-5,6.80146871564554E-5,6.617683283955046E-5,6.600764965473854E-5,6.67321780739236E-5,6.619387823493052E-5,7.118424114627838E-5,6.613932587820011E-5,6.602915451392978E-5,6.634442434717731E-5,6
