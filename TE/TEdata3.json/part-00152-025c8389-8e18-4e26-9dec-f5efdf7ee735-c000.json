{"value":"John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory, and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah, USA.<br /><br />An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting, with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It's based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third, where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right, and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey, stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma, particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget, it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts.

{"value":"Overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned to love - big deal. There is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations, but the kind which is bad for the movie, causing it to often seem absurd.<br /><br />Summer Phoenix, playing the lead, talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point. We are told early on (in that \"Barry Lyndon\"-like narration) that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone-face, but the movie suffers for it. She basically walks around like a zombie, and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions. Occasionally, the movie had that dull, sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie.

{"value":"After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned this also, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character? Has he raped other victims before? Is he completely psychotic or an \"average\" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character at all credible, or is it just a matter of more background being necessary? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character, and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young, vulnerable girls. This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terrifyingly convincing.The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject, without quite settling into either mode.

{"value":"I saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema. I had some hopes for the movie because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book it's based on. The movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller. Quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines, characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for (like Marjoke) and terrible editing. The movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long, a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped. After suffering through the story you'll get treated to one of the worst endings I've seen in a very long. It should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you're probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies. It's hard to mention any good things about this movie. About a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and I didn't hear a kind word after the movie was over. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any faith I had left in the dutch movie

{"value":"Amelia and Michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other. Amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute that doesn't satisfy him. The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot to this particular short. The direction is straight-forward and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little bit to be desired. Why, exactly, do we care about these two people? It's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it's much more pared down and doesn't search for meaning in it (a welcoming change of pace if anything).<br /><br />I don't know, it's possible I don't connect to these stories because I've never experienced them. But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same, i.e., a couple talking together while avoiding eye-contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. The nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different, and I'd like to see a different take.<br /><br

{"value":"this movie is not good.the first one almost sucked,but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching.this one has nothing.there's zero scare,zero tension or suspense.this isn't really a horror movie.most of the kills don't show anything.there's no gore to speak of.this could almost be a TV,except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence.the acting is not very good,either.and don't get me started on the dialogue.as for the surprise ending,surprise,there isn't one.i suppose it could have been worse,although i don't see how.but then again,it is less than 80 minutes long,so i guess that's a good thing.although it felt a lot longer. apparently this is the cut version of the film.i found it for a very cheap price,but it still not worth it.if you want the uncut more graphic version,check out the Anchor Bay edition.anyway,this version of Sleepaway Camp II:Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1/10 from me. p.s.if you watch this movie,you will probably be a bored and unhappy

{"value":"This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever watched. It is excruciatingly boring I would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1.<br /><br />The reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is \"unintentionally funny\" are absurd and just plain WRONG. Not one thing is funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so UNINTERESTING. Honestly though, I didn't watch it to the ending, but that should say something about how horrible it is. WORST MOVIE EVER.<br /><br />Immediately after ejecting this filth from my DVD player I started scraping it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie. Then Zach peed his pants.

{"value":"I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less.<br /><br />Scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism. In their lab(a run down warehouse in L.A.), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase.<br /><br />Of course the T-Rex(a rubber puppet)gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast. It has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off.<br /><br />One cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city. She is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio. She never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost.<br /><br />The T-Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are blazing gun battles and buildings(cardboard mock-ups)blowing up, but a single police car, or the army, nor anyone else ever shows up.

{"value":"I refused to watch this when it originally aired, treasuring the memory of the late, lamented 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. Not quite a remake, and more of a parody than a homage, this show didn't quite know how to play it, and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters. The three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a straight role).

{"value":"When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought that it sounded really interesting... so... I had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the \"4 for 20 dollars\" section at Blockbuster. When we got home and popped in the movie... twenty minutes into it, we found ourselves turning to each other going \"this sucks. Let's put in something else.\" I'll admit, a few of the lines from the friends at the café made us smile a little bit. But come ON, at least get some decent actors! Every once in a while in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting, I can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over(or under)doing their lines. But I can only take so much. Crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines... amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film.<br /><br />Anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie.

{"value":"Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.<br /><br />When she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /><br />The film progresses from there, as Diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />The picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. <br /><br />This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power.

most of them have given their comments I thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors(though having read worst critics against this movie) I thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick., Well it all started well with some ahem., comedies.... then it all started going pathetic... man you can believe your self, you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless...Huh~~ Well how much can a person digest a sick all POSSESSIVE witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing.<br /><br />The next worst thing about the movie is, the \"ZOMBIE\" Hero, yes as he looses his fiancé he roams around like a Goat, with

{"value":"I came at this film with high expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and 'The Tempest' and was interested in an adaptation. I first wanted to switch off after ten minutes, but felt that it would be unfair. There was a representation of a storm, but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat? It is symbolic of what? I continued another ten minutes my finger twitching over the 'off' button, somewhere something would capture my interest. This is not Shakespeare, it is not cinema. There is a time and place for it, but I will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of Shakespeare. After twenty five minutes I gave up and that was the end. I then read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendants. 'Its a painting.....then put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet.....keep it on the stage then'. Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the plays were performed to mass audiences, they were accessible, and this version helps put a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population at large

{"value":"A few years back the same persons who created Paris,J'TAIME., which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7), created this piece of garbage about New York City.<br /><br />In Paris, I Love You (J'taime)created a feeling for Paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful Paris.<br /><br />In this current film, I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth.<br /><br />New York does have 5 boroughs,I saw no scenes in The Bronx, or Queens ,There is one scene in Brooklyn,(Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village/ No scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres. It does have a large cast,most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest sort.<br /><br />The very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine New Yorkers that we all know & love.. <br /><br />A few of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were far better.<br /><br />Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out

{"value":"Knowing how old a film is, ought to prepare the viewer for a few things, and, with those things in mind, perhaps the movie'll be more tolerable. So it was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies. The heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected, as should the primitiveness (or absence) of special effects in those days. A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker - maybe too much, in this case. And the plot isn't easy to follow: Some zombiefied southeast Asian soldiers in WWI performed very admirably. Although skeptical as to why, if true, the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands, so, off goes a group to archaeologically investigate. The key to long-distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition, who uses it to, among other purposes, temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots. To prove his love for her, he gives up his hold on everybody, which he shouldn't have done 'cause, once they're all unzombiefied, many want to kill him so that he'll never control them again. Below average, even with precautionary forethought.

{"value":"I love Seth Green. His appearances on THat 70s' Show is always worth watching but last night, I felt the show needed to overhauled. Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for. The grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out. Anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. I would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I am only watching it because it falls before My Name is Earl on a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back, scrap this series, and start over. We need more family involved series. How about Seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. THey could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional siblings.

{"value":"During the first 3 seasons Fairly Odd Parents was as tasty as hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs. Cosmo, once one of the more endearing Nick characters, has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of Family Guy wouldn't even want to know. Timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would happily beat the snot out of (and given Timmy's snottiness, that would take a lot of beating). And poor Wanda...a real charmer who's become the victim of her husband and godchild, she's now labeled a \"nag\" for caring about the well-being of others. Plus Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never punished for it, nor does he learn any lessons. Which pretty much sums up Butch Hartman's attitude towards kids: they're crude, vulgar and not too bright. Thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled, along with Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom.

{"value":"I am a lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man, which the movie barely touched on. In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back to the science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development, terrible story, and I'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this

{"value":"The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers. With the horrible notoriety after the trial, the two women team up and leave N.Y. for California in order to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls.<br /><br />From the beginning, it becomes apparent that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker. <br /><br />To make matters worse, the women who live together, are receiving menacing phone calls. Reynolds, who puts on a blond wig, is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students, nicely played by Dennis Weaver.<br /><br />Agnes Moorehead, in one of her last films, briefly is seen as Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener of.<br /><br />The film really belongs to Shelley Winters.

{"value":"When I saw this \"documentary\", I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again. Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup, it is not mentioned in this \"documentary\", which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective. It is one in the set of lies pushed by Milosevic regime. Everyone else is guilty only Serbians were right and victims, even though most of the War Criminals tried in Hague are Serbs, even though Serbs are one who have committed genocide against Bosnians , and attacked Slovenia, Croatia,and Bosnia all independent nations recognized by the UN.Breakup of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because Serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on Federal Yugoslav government, so SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests.If you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of Yugoslavia, and fact led documentary this is not it . You should watch \"Yugoslavia:Death of a Nation\", Made by Discovery channel and BBC.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","thi","documentari","i","be","disappoint","to","see","serbian","propaganda","in","action","onc","again","even","though","serbia","and","it","nationalist","polit","be","main","reason","of","yugoslavian","breakup","it","be","not","mention","in","thi","documentari","which","be","make","by","bogdanovich","whose","name","tell","u","that","he","be","serbian","and","hi","movi","that","he","be","far","from","be","object","it","be","on","in","the","set","of","lie","push","by","milosev","regim","everyon","els","be","guilti","onli","serbian","be","right","and","victim","even","though","much","of","the","war","crimin","try","in","hagu","be","serb","even","though","serb","be","on","who","have","commit","genocid","against","bosnian","and","attack","slovenia","croatiaand","bosnia","all","independ","nation","recogn","by","the","unbreakup","of","yugoslavia","be","not","avoid","becaus","serbian","do","not","want","to","releas","the","grip","their","nation","have","put","on","feder","yugoslav","govern","so","slovenia","croatia","macedonia","and","bosnia","be","forc","to","becom","independ","nation","in","order","to","protect","their","interestsif","you","be","interest","in","a","object","documentari","about","breakup","of","yugoslavia","and","fact","lead","documentari","thi","be","not","it","you","should","watch","yugoslaviadeath","of","a","nation","make","by","discoveri","channel","and","bbc"],"filtered":["see","thi","documentari","disappoint","see","serbian","propaganda","action","onc","even","though","serbia","nationalist","polit","main","reason","yugoslavian","breakup","mention","thi","documentari","make","bogdanovich","whose","name","tell","u","serbian","hi","movi","far","object","set","lie","push","milosev","regim","everyon","els","guilti","onli","serbian","right","victim","even","though","much","war","crimin","try","hagu","serb","even","though","serb","commit","genocid","bosnian","attack","slovenia","croatiaand","bosnia","independ","nation","recogn","unbreakup","yugoslavia","avoid","becaus","serbian","want","releas","grip","nation","put","feder","yugoslav","govern","slovenia","croatia","macedonia","bosnia","forc","becom","independ","nation","order","protect","interestsif","interest","object","documentari","breakup","yugoslavia","fact","lead","documentari","thi","watch","yugoslaviadeath","nation","make","discoveri","channel","bbc"],"filtered2":["see","documentari","disappoint","see","serbian","propaganda","action","onc","even","though","serbia","nationalist","polit","main","reason","yugoslavian","breakup","mention","documentari","make","bogdanovich","whose","name","tell","u","serbian","far","object","set","lie","push","milosev","regim","everyon","els","guilti","onli","serbian","right","victim","even","though","war","crimin","try","hagu","serb","even","though","serb","commit","genocid","bosnian","attack","slovenia","croatiaand","bosnia","independ","nation","recogn","unbreakup","yugoslavia","avoid","becaus","serbian","want","releas","grip","nation","put","feder","yugoslav","govern","slovenia","croatia","macedonia","bosnia","forc","becom","independ","nation","order","protect","interestsif","interest","object","documentari","breakup","yugoslavia","fact","lead","documentari","watch","yugoslaviadeath","nation","make","discoveri","channel","bbc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,11,22,36,37,60,86,90,95,97,101,109,112,115,121,129,143,157,159,179,187,196,236,246,285,314,327,335,338,439,495,535,575,598,624,650,728,969,1033,1055,1103,1211,1256,1261,1568,1570,1657,2038,2212,3243,3568,5250,5669,5705],"values":[2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,11,22,36,37,60,86,90,95,97,101,109,112,115,121,129,143,157,159,179,187,196,236,246,285,314,327,335,338,439,495,535,575,598,624,650,728,969,1033,1055,1103,1211,1256,1261,1568,1570,1657,2038,2212,3243,3568,5250,5669,5705],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,2.7780513171783934,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2979240167361772,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.838176641236591,6.0933371978169575,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.125691139326857,2.2466628996789315,2.201553588425805,2.2190595059394194,2.4106958340079214,2.3409902041158843,2.3360150694757706,2.300267965194495,2.507968722980095,2.4732161909892554,2.478925055209576,2.617923930016232,2.673149229007135,2.808171552082607,3.189397019426827,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,2.9720957437368454,3.2872346624216657,3.5173618574831282,3.4986697244709752,3.6314455447135003,3.5642670069567886,15.696702333850343,3.6621227969605474,3.7740817043309423,4.0536665665501035,4.2574141875167335,16.984712456999233,4.3095999406873045,8.729319435740663,4.3215761317340196,8.7674158256820

{"value":"When converting a book to film, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author's intended tone or conveyed concepts, rather than ignoring the author altogether. While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good, enriching, strengthening experiences of homesteading her land. The book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast Wyoming frontier; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart. The film, however, takes a standard stance for the time it was made, portraying this woman's experience as harsh, unforgiving, and nearly pointless. Perhaps the director was bringing some of his Vietnam War experiences with him to this movie (as some film aficionados have said), but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak, odious landscape devoid of friends or hope.

{"value":"This might be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. The writers and producers should study the German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even soviet-style clunky leader as god-like father-figure were better done. Disappointing. The loss of faith, regained in church at last second just in time for daddy to be \"saved\" by the Hoover/God was not too bad. Unfortunately, it seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough. A few misty heavenlier shots of the angelical Hoover up in the corner of the screen-beaming and nodding- would have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover only saving the deserving family and children WHO had \"proven\" their worth. Unfortunately, other poor homeless were portrayed as likable and even good- yet the Hoover-God doesn't help them. A better approach would have been shots of them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition. Finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from the depression) should have rolled at the end. We could see then how Hoover-God had saved not just THIS deserving family, but all the truly deserving.

{"value":"Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. <br /><br />Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the Best Actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /><br />This movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from Forrest's service in Vietnam all the way through to the \"resolution\" with Jenny at the end.<br /><br />With that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.<br /><br />Watch this film and ask yourself \"What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?\" <br /><br />Forrest seems to have made the \"right\" choices and been at the \"right place at the right time\" for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price.

{"value":"Ugh! Another one of those \"fooled by the cover\" DVDs. I expected some kind of action at least with bears, cats, & such on the cover. I got NOTHING! Bad movie!.<br /><br />I forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually SOMETHING would happen...no luck.<br /><br />Now the reason I gave this a 2 is because of the scenery; otherwise it sucked.<br /><br />The kid was terrible, talking to himself (although I suppose they couldn't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all), doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump, threatening a raccoon, munching on worms, and (what a dumbass) kicking a porcupine. And he wouldn't be pulling those quills out that easily either...they stick like fishhooks. At least he fought the bear (weakly) a couple of times.<br /><br />What was up with the flashback thing? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival movie, not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce.<br /><br />What else can I say?

{"value":"The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.<br /><br />From start to finish \"The Tooth Fairy\" was just downright terrible. It seemed like a badly-acted children's movie which got confused, with a \"Wizard of Oz\" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.<br /><br />Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered. The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least TRY and have a slight plot for them. The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.<br /><br />Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure.

{"value":"This movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared...as in, \"was it as stupid as Revolver?\" I too was in the Toronto International Film Festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose. Within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame) which makes NO SENSE AT ALL! Then there's some shooting and then there's Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then there's some animation, Ray Liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, teeth gnashing, art house wanna be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing...which I'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for...not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's Yogi Bear incarnate. The story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna herself was in it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","now","my","gaug","against","which","all","other","movi","will","be","compareda","in","be","it","a","stupid","a","revolv","i","too","be","in","the","toronto","intern","film","festiv","audienc","last","night","where","a","room","fill","with","over","peopl","walk","out","in","a","eeri","silenc","after","be","absolut","dumbstruck","by","hour","of","sheer","nonsens","jason","stratham","would","have","be","amaz","if","onli","he","have","a","purpos","within","the","minut","he","give","a","proposit","by","andr","and","big","pussi","of","soprano","fame","which","make","no","sens","at","all","then","there","some","shoot","and","then","there","rai","liotta","wear","embarrass","bikini","brief","then","there","some","anim","rai","liotta","nake","butt","lot","of","shoot","tooth","gnash","art","hous","wanna","be","pretens","and","much","of","liotta","embarrass","bodi","that","elicit","laugh","at","everi","showingwhich","i","be","not","quit","sure","be","the","reaction","he","be","look","fornot","time","anywai","everyon","in","thi","movi","think","thei","re","smart","than","the","averag","bear","and","gui","ritchi","think","he","yogi","bear","incarn","the","stori","line","mai","have","go","nowher","but","the","postur","be","outta","sight","the","onli","wai","thi","movi","can","have","be","wrong","be","if","madonna","herself","be","in","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","gaug","movi","compareda","stupid","revolv","toronto","intern","film","festiv","audienc","last","night","room","fill","peopl","walk","eeri","silenc","absolut","dumbstruck","hour","sheer","nonsens","jason","stratham","amaz","onli","purpos","within","minut","give","proposit","andr","big","pussi","soprano","fame","make","sens","shoot","rai","liotta","wear","embarrass","bikini","brief","anim","rai","liotta","nake","butt","lot","shoot","tooth","gnash","art","hous","wanna","pretens","much","liotta","embarrass","bodi","elicit","laugh","everi","showingwhich","quit","sure","reaction","look","fornot","time","anywai","everyon","thi","movi","think","thei","re","smart","averag","bear","gui","ritchi","think","yogi","bear","incarn","stori","line","mai","go","nowher","postur","outta","sight","onli","wai","thi","movi","wrong","madonna"],"filtered2":["gaug","compareda","stupid","revolv","toronto","intern","festiv","audienc","last","night","room","fill","peopl","walk","eeri","silenc","absolut","dumbstruck","hour","sheer","nonsens","jason","stratham","amaz","onli","purpos","within","minut","give","proposit","andr","big","pussi","soprano","fame","make","sens","shoot","rai","liotta","wear","embarrass","bikini","brief","anim","rai","liotta","nake","butt","lot","shoot","tooth","gnash","art","hous","wanna","pretens","liotta","embarrass","bodi","elicit","laugh","everi","showingwhich","quit","sure","reaction","look","fornot","time","anywai","everyon","think","re","smart","averag","bear","gui","ritchi","think","yogi","bear","incarn","stori","line","mai","go","nowher","postur","outta","sight","onli","wai","wrong","madonna"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,11,12,16,17,23,25,30,33,46,55,59,68,72,82,85,107,117,119,120,133,136,144,168,173,174,210,213,222,246,277,294,376,382,386,513,514,525,553,556,643,672,685,794,799,893,905,1119,1186,1212,1217,1280,1336,1339,1381,1463,1500,1626,1972,2017,2436,2854,3011,3428,3621,3748,3825,4720,4973,5610,5729,5854,6308,7054,7434,7694,8067,8539],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,11,12,16,17,23,25,30,33,46,55,59,68,72,82,85,107,117,119,120,133,136,144,168,173,174,210,213,222,246,277,294,376,382,386,513,514,525,553,556,643,672,685,794,799,893,905,1119,1186,1212,1217,1280,1336,1339,1381,1463,1500,1626,1972,2017,2436,2854,3011,3428,3621,3748,3825,4720,4973,5610,5729,5854,6308,7054,7434,7694,8067,8539],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.655771293751733,1.9536997889255368,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.1439533986393955,4.5594602370234405,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985579986,2.2931108769894046,2.4894767118610357,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.5771019354959765,2.673149229007135,3.1163992333432793,2.886778509330039,3.1569204307489187,3.235085203598255,3.0433232530252132,3.454678155189441,3.405285399859865,6.829941411188657,3.454678155189441,6.86925471628776,3.5813614403160887,3.616452760127359,3.607563812710113,3.7465885637507435,3.7636829971100

{"value":"Like most of the festivals entries Hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution. Although impressive for it's obvious low budget the film falters in it's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it's drawn out and obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died. They kidnap people , drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement. There's some nice darkly humorous performances from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so-so. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter. But for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment. The next half isn't so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap. It's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative. too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level.<br /><br

{"value":"Typically terrible trash from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter(Teagan)commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict Ross Hagen who has charted course for earth. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating Richard Wiley who ran over Hagen with his RV on a camping trip gone awry. Soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic Doctor(Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire fame)proving that no one will stand in it's way of retrieving the hide of the convict, whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin.<br /><br />Perhaps intentionally made awful, this features what fans of \"rancid cinema\" yearn for..dreadful special effects, acting, and premise. At least, the film has PJ Soles for some eye candy..even in '89, she was quite smokin'. That laser gun sure is funny..it can incinerate some houses yet when the Cyborg shoots at Law it barely leaves a mark on the location

{"value":"This movie was laughably bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me watch it. There are so many gaffes and goofs that it's impossible to even bother getting to know the characters and the plot. How about these for example...<br /><br />The \"Vermont Airport\" surrounded by palm trees<br /><br />Ben's miraculously appearing shirt during a phone conversation<br /><br />The priest's palatial office... complete with a folding card table desk<br /><br />There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look past the technical flaws, you'll find horrid acting and casting. I was most tickled by the casting of a flamboyantly gay actor to play the right-wing religious zealot brother. His opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, stroking his kitty cat, was hilarious.<br /><br />I applaud the writer/director/producer/editor/star/caterer/cast dentist/composer (and whatever else he did on this move) for actually getting a movie like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game but don't rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","laughabl","bad","a","friend","rent","it","from","netflix","and","make","me","watch","it","there","be","so","mani","gaff","and","goof","that","it","imposs","to","even","bother","get","to","know","the","charact","and","the","plot","how","about","thi","for","examplebr","br","the","vermont","airport","surround","by","palm","treesbr","br","ben","miracul","appear","shirt","dure","a","phone","conversationbr","br","the","priest","palati","offic","complet","with","a","fold","card","tabl","deskbr","br","there","be","a","decent","stori","hide","behind","a","veri","bad","movi","but","even","if","you","look","past","the","technic","flaw","you","will","find","horrid","act","and","cast","i","be","much","tickl","by","the","cast","of","a","flamboyantli","gai","actor","to","plai","the","rightw","religi","zealot","brother","hi","open","scene","sit","in","hi","immacul","apart","stroke","hi","kitti","cat","be","hilariousbr","br","i","applaud","the","writerdirectorproducereditorstarcaterercast","dentistcompos","and","whatev","els","he","do","on","thi","move","for","actual","get","a","movi","like","thi","distribut","if","you","have","noth","well","to","do","it","can","be","a","fun","group","movi","or","even","the","basi","of","a","drink","game","but","do","not","rend","it","for","a","power","stori","about","homophobia","and","gai","marriag"],"filtered":["thi","movi","laughabl","bad","friend","rent","netflix","make","watch","mani","gaff","goof","imposs","even","bother","get","know","charact","plot","thi","examplebr","br","vermont","airport","surround","palm","treesbr","br","ben","miracul","appear","shirt","dure","phone","conversationbr","br","priest","palati","offic","complet","fold","card","tabl","deskbr","br","decent","stori","hide","behind","veri","bad","movi","even","look","past","technic","flaw","find","horrid","act","cast","much","tickl","cast","flamboyantli","gai","actor","plai","rightw","religi","zealot","brother","hi","open","scene","sit","hi","immacul","apart","stroke","hi","kitti","cat","hilariousbr","br","applaud","writerdirectorproducereditorstarcaterercast","dentistcompos","whatev","els","thi","move","actual","get","movi","like","thi","distribut","noth","well","fun","group","movi","even","basi","drink","game","rend","power","stori","homophobia","gai","marriag"],"filtered2":["laughabl","bad","friend","rent","netflix","make","watch","mani","gaff","goof","imposs","even","bother","get","know","charact","plot","examplebr","vermont","airport","surround","palm","treesbr","ben","miracul","appear","shirt","dure","phone","conversationbr","priest","palati","offic","complet","fold","card","tabl","deskbr","decent","stori","hide","behind","veri","bad","even","look","past","technic","flaw","find","horrid","act","cast","tickl","cast","flamboyantli","gai","actor","plai","rightw","religi","zealot","brother","open","scene","sit","immacul","apart","stroke","kitti","cat","hilariousbr","applaud","writerdirectorproducereditorstarcaterercast","dentistcompos","whatev","els","move","actual","get","like","distribut","noth","well","fun","group","even","basi","drink","game","rend","power","stori","homophobia","gai","marriag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,9,10,15,16,17,19,20,21,26,32,38,40,41,49,50,52,92,103,161,170,196,239,242,244,259,275,309,365,374,381,393,410,440,496,533,552,557,572,587,640,661,667,707,792,854,901,923,944,983,1252,1275,1316,1478,1577,1898,2005,2032,2470,2665,2843,3367,4023,4054,4103,4254,4399,6435,6572,7477,7970,8251,8343],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,9,10,15,16,17,19,20,21,26,32,38,40,41,49,50,52,92,103,161,170,196,239,242,244,259,275,309,365,374,381,393,410,440,496,533,552,557,572,587,640,661,667,707,792,854,901,923,944,983,1252,1275,1316,1478,1577,1898,2005,2032,2470,2665,2843,3367,4023,4054,4103,4254,4399,6435,6572,7477,7970,8251,8343],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,2.7780513171783934,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,4.0979070738271774,2.098582041218749,2.4323182980210873,2.4214486257841834,2.478925055209576,2.6593400337329487,2.689504733779216,2.634508058031767,2.7464553122240485,2.7832848715031413,2.848772527704847,3.185521045582134,3.4572130107926293,3.24941502915308,3.120015873813468,3.2070272508030975,3.212973749990824,3.293679367864308,3.424750734647968,3.424750734647968,3.4471119148061256

{"value":"If you're looking to be either offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess.<br /><br />Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing. And once the \"ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO!!\" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.<br /><br />Unless you're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really don't see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies.

{"value":"The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn't fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what. It's very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister's sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies.
