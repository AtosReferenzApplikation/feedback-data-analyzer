{"value":"You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and \"The Incubus\" is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills. Actually, observing the hammy script and John Hough's 'baroque' art direction, one can hardly blame him. The movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in. Somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly P.O.'ed at times. The Incubus itself, which doesn't show up until the last scene, is a well-done creation, but it's not worth waiting for.<br /><br

{"value":"Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.<br /><br />But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him.

How? i don't know,this is way up there in the \"so bad it'Good \" charts Kidman ,Baldwin,and Pullman must cringe when they see it now.I think Woody Allen would have worked wonders with the outlandish plot, and Baldwin's part could have been played with gusto by Leslie Nelson.it was on again tonight i tried to watch it again but life's too short. the few minutes i watched was for the lovely Nicole she was so hot around 93, has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman played his stock in trade \"nice but dim\" character the F-word coming out of his mouth when the lady from \"frasier\" miscast ed as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong. stay

{"value":"I watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. It's just plain awful! It is no where near in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made.

{"value":"I don't like this film, but then I didn't think much of the book either which, although lauded by many as a \"masterpiece\", I found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot, although it was far more readable than Fante's dreadful first effort \"Road to Los Angeles\" not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s.<br /><br />I was intrigued to see what sort of soup Towne would make with such meager ingredients.

{"value":"Despite much style, flash, and glitter, this French musical fails to speak. The tunes are repetitive, predictable, and tedious. The story is uninteresting, as are the many characters. <br /><br />People break into song and dance, without motivation or reason. Most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio bound.<br /><br />To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so negative an effect it had on me. Certainly a shame, to have such a multi-talented cast in so feeble a final effort. <br /><br />Goes to show, I guess, where followups (in this case, to the great classic, \"Umbrellas\") often do go awry. One cannot recapture, only recreate.","finished_norm":["despit","much","styl","flash","and","glitter","thi","french","music","fail","to","speak","the","tune","be","repetit","predict","and","tediou","the","stori","be","uninterest","a","be","the","mani","charact","br","br","peopl","break","into","song","and","danc","without","motiv","or","reason","much","of","the","cast","wear","phoni","look","wig","and","hairpiec","and","the","set","look","hopelessli","studio","boundbr","br","to","be","honest","thi","video","of","the","restor","version","be","stop","befor","the","end","so","neg","a","effect","it","have","on","me","certainli","a","shame","to","have","such","a","multital","cast","in","so","feebl","a","final","effort","br","br","go","to","show","i","guess","where","followup","in","thi","case","to","the","great","classic","umbrella","often","do","go","awri","on","cannot","recaptur","onli","recreat"],"filtered":["despit","much","styl","flash","glitter","thi","french","music","fail","speak","tune","repetit","predict","tediou","stori","uninterest","mani","charact","br","br","peopl","break","song","danc","without","motiv","reason","much","cast","wear","phoni","look","wig","hairpiec","set","look","hopelessli","studio","boundbr","br","honest","thi","video","restor","version","stop","befor","end","neg","effect","certainli","shame","multital","cast","feebl","final","effort","br","br","go","show","guess","followup","thi","case","great","classic","umbrella","often","go","awri","recaptur","onli","recreat"],"filtered2":["despit","styl","flash","glitter","french","music","fail","speak","tune","repetit","predict","tediou","stori","uninterest","mani","charact","peopl","break","song","danc","without","motiv","reason","cast","wear","phoni","look","wig","hairpiec","set","look","hopelessli","studio","boundbr","honest","video","restor","version","stop","befor","end","neg","effect","certainli","shame","multital","cast","feebl","final","effort","go","show","guess","followup","case","great","classic","umbrella","often","go","awri","recaptur","onli","recreat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,10,11,16,17,23,24,28,50,51,79,92,95,106,109,118,125,156,215,220,240,243,288,315,328,332,337,344,360,380,389,391,400,401,492,514,574,899,902,932,1102,1147,1240,1247,1389,1452,1835,2679,2866,2989,3036,3755,3970,5264,5269,6485],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,10,11,16,17,23,24,28,50,51,79,92,95,106,109,118,125,156,215,220,240,243,288,315,328,332,337,344,360,380,389,391,400,401,492,514,574,899,902,932,1102,1147,1240,1247,1389,1452,1835,2679,2866,2989,3036,3755,3970,5264,5269,6485],"values":[1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.9469506069506084,4.0979070738271774,2.0323326556775485,2.159084361316692,2.125691139326857,2.354379525480895,2.2242236634876535,2.3451551414151686,2.605934685587711,2.8336934208777267,2.7666071276613566,2.627841366673578,2.8015621426949333,2.854312708080462,3.1550424959247185,2.9705344631698933,2.973659465713028,2.983093497946387,3.028335462059722,3.102062070196872,3.0914425013694116,3.109204957709252,3.130944944345658,3.0879275592619675,3.6016814428070463,3.405285399859865,3.5039747767006686,4.197121957260614,3.9201351739255808,4.058285512406398,4.160564361526816,4.246178114249808,4.297765483040301,4.327618446189983,4.449957298382227,4.499089986959872,4.828393734102471,5.290429193699031,5.426230734858092,5.408212229355414,5.482320201509136,5.695894301807195,5.907203395474402,6.214688095222362,6.214688095222362,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745164E-4,2.0463497070976426E-4,2.0468549666480043E-4,2.0464434833267016E-4,2.046637154928046E-4,2.046338424142705E-4,2.0469748638025687E-4,2.0460339623606924E-4,2.0463501395727335E-4,2.0484648206987093E-4,2.0647187928241848E-4,2.0463535196139926E-4,2.0482915457133762E-4,2.0485049423537855E-4,2.0475743600462706E-4,2.0464515439713905E-4,2.0471556024485957E-4,2.0481190008348819E-4,2.0465571934409401E-4,2.0465497110247884E-4,2.048390893597217E-4,2.046754754412128E-4,2.0467578519980714E-4,2.0480690269923535E-4,2.0465579316856524E-4,2.048529427044048E-4,2.0470700748843513E-4,2.04634512080334E-4,2.0472728462307034E-4,2.0478977034141515E-4,2.0467647940754585E-4,2.0478609967276772E-4,2.0488664453525892E-4,2.0507681111083879E-4,2.0470665374897106E-4,2.046450302766088E-4,2.047188163671431E-4,2.04665813890498E-4,2.0460361461226807E-4,2.0465565596554814E-4,2.048607559064068E-4,2.0474837688640204E-4,2.0478656634500503E-4,2.0461379771132918E-4,2.0465570800429697E-4,2.0464495332226388E-4,2.0471422378351452E-4,2.0474972148579017E-4,2.0470808678692276E-4,2.0467564019349915E-4,2.046454

{"value":"This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. There's an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. At times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the \"cub,\" who nearly gets lost early on. All in all, disappointment.<br /><br />That said, there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.","finished_norm":["thi","seri","have","it","up","and","occasion","down","and","the","latter","be","the","case","here","there","a","agreeabl","amount","of","spatter","with","a","invent","implement","of","the","babi","cart","weapon","but","the","edit","film","be","a","serious","disjoint","the","filmmak","itself","rough","than","usual","at","time","the","action","slow","to","a","crawl","a","the","camera","follow","the","wordless","wander","of","the","cub","who","nearli","get","lose","earli","on","all","in","all","disappointmentbr","br","that","sai","there","a","spaghetti","eastern","qualiti","to","the","music","and","action","that","mai","win","the","approv","of","dedic","viewer","thi","instal","spend","much","of","it","time","follow","the","minor","misadventur","of","the","littl","boi","who","begin","to","stare","into","the","abyss","of","death","hi","father","open","for","him"],"filtered":["thi","seri","occasion","latter","case","agreeabl","amount","spatter","invent","implement","babi","cart","weapon","edit","film","serious","disjoint","filmmak","rough","usual","time","action","slow","crawl","camera","follow","wordless","wander","cub","nearli","get","lose","earli","disappointmentbr","br","sai","spaghetti","eastern","qualiti","music","action","mai","win","approv","dedic","viewer","thi","instal","spend","much","time","follow","minor","misadventur","littl","boi","begin","stare","abyss","death","hi","father","open"],"filtered2":["occasion","latter","case","agreeabl","amount","spatter","invent","implement","babi","cart","weapon","edit","serious","disjoint","filmmak","rough","usual","time","action","slow","crawl","camera","follow","wordless","wander","cub","nearli","get","lose","earli","disappointmentbr","spaghetti","eastern","qualiti","music","action","mai","win","approv","dedic","viewer","instal","spend","time","follow","minor","misadventur","littl","boi","begin","stare","abyss","death","father","open"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,14,46,118,129,147,221,231,242,245,260,265,266,279,282,283,288,319,323,343,348,371,390,489,611,698,771,1097,1099,1242,1279,1460,1558,1636,2163,2247,2644,2870,2927,4016,4170,4252,5311,7493],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,14,46,118,129,147,221,231,242,245,260,265,266,279,282,283,288,319,323,343,348,371,390,489,611,698,771,1097,1099,1242,1279,1460,1558,1636,2163,2247,2644,2870,2927,4016,4170,4252,5311,7493],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.1175081997259209,1.655771293751733,2.354379525480895,4.821391668015843,2.2844323215331563,2.6423424573643777,2.7049353070058615,2.689504733779216,2.7502029743242886,5.3509388313256645,2.73529586597515,2.747702973022204,2.7910771187233068,2.918851229218033,2.7678802023081546,2.8015621426949333,2.9056060024680126,3.0433232530252132,3.112795625839981,3.0103169565570433,3.0466846007279185,3.132778125427319,3.3956930001684253,3.520060914452293,3.90413483257914,3.7398317812878634,4.186539847930077,4.135246553542527,4.364659717870332,4.470719289830655,4.4919214974812585,4.573751515728891,4.679973728984199,5.089758498236879,5.064116067623542,5.243909178064138,5.390512652256013,5.408212229355414,6.0662680901040895,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278305E-4,2.5058620691581333E-4,2.5064807858603375E-4,2.505976903047264E-4,2.5062140640359255E-4,2.505848252590658E-4,2.506627606186687E-4,2.505475423240715E-4,2.5058625987464645E-4,2.508452136206053E-4,2.528355973796069E-4,2.505866737783479E-4,2.5082399519387334E-4,2.508501267267698E-4,2.507361720640578E-4,2.505986773727583E-4,2.5068489300962516E-4,2.5080286617253615E-4,2.506116147019671E-4,2.506106984410389E-4,2.5083616086100756E-4,2.5063580707447943E-4,2.5063618639005263E-4,2.507967466145736E-4,2.50611705103887E-4,2.508531250049425E-4,2.5067441971279007E-4,2.5058564530012806E-4,2.506992501229479E-4,2.5077576714783436E-4,2.5063703648367763E-4,2.5077127222240684E-4,2.508943946566084E-4,2.511272635582015E-4,2.506739865403454E-4,2.5059852538068784E-4,2.5068888030138403E-4,2.506239760011387E-4,2.505478097371298E-4,2.5061153709162826E-4,2.5086269267877043E-4,2.507250787007576E-4,2.5077184368692935E-4,2.5056027947365384E-4,2.506116008157935E-4,2.5059843114607423E-4,2.506832564429231E-4,2.5072672523291837E-4,2.506757413701452E-4,2.506360088222568E-4,2.5059905085673826E-4,2.5111248761528865E-4,2.506621087966182E-4,2.5061154337593277E-4,2.506607664081856E-4,2.5058590168330826E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867716E-4,2.5059940266573117E-4,2.505857586424852E-4,2.5078623326048414E-4,2.506855613798028E-4,2.5058565389105843E-4,2.5056017738973017E-4,2.5053498079616153E-4,2.5076150407809313E-4,2.505979299011485E-4,2.507118423993321E-4,2.507854199692586E-4,2.5067164350437744E-4,2.50611875302

Rent the original \"War Games\" if you are feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />I didn't like the bending of the plot to beat-the-terrorist-threat idea either. In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat. Politics aside, one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end. No such insight is offered in this film.","finished_norm":["i","wonder","why","john","wood","be","not","plai","dr","falken","until","i","watch","the","film","bad","plot","bad","scienc","bad","act","and","overal","a","bad","film","pleas","do","not","watch","thi","film","rend","the","origin","war","game","if","you","be","feel","nostalgicbr","br","i","do","not","like","the","bend","of","the","plot","to","beattheterroristthreat","idea","either","in","the","film","wopr","be","build","becaus","russia","have","of","warhead","point","at","the","usa","in","thi","film","the","idea","behind","the","comput","be","to","kill","terrorist","in","train","befor","thei","be","a","threat","polit","asid","on","of","the","good","thing","about","the","film","be","the","highlight","that","even","a","stupid","comput","can","grasp","the","idea","of","the","pointless","of","war","in","the","end","no","such","insight","be","offer","in","thi","film"],"filtered":["wonder","john","wood","plai","dr","falken","watch","film","bad","plot","bad","scienc","bad","act","overal","bad","film","pleas","watch","thi","film","rend","origin","war","game","feel","nostalgicbr","br","like","bend","plot","beattheterroristthreat","idea","either","film","wopr","build","becaus","russia","warhead","point","usa","thi","film","idea","behind","comput","kill","terrorist","train","befor","thei","threat","polit","asid","good","thing","film","highlight","even","stupid","comput","grasp","idea","pointless","war","end","insight","offer","thi","film"],"filtered2":["wonder","john","wood","plai","dr","falken","watch","bad","plot","bad","scienc","bad","act","overal","bad","pleas","watch","rend","origin","war","game","feel","nostalgicbr","like","bend","plot","beattheterroristthreat","idea","either","wopr","build","becaus","russia","warhead","point","usa","idea","behind","comput","kill","terrorist","train","befor","threat","polit","asid","good","thing","highlight","even","stupid","comput","grasp","idea","pointless","war","end","insight","offer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,9,21,22,24,29,32,40,43,66,69,76,79,123,136,175,207,291,314,346,374,393,412,477,507,531,533,575,655,713,739,765,910,936,1385,1578,1812,2515,2850,3038,3110,3785],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,9,21,22,24,29,32,40,43,66,69,76,79,123,136,175,207,291,314,346,374,393,412,477,507,531,533,575,655,713,739,765,910,936,1385,1578,1812,2515,2850,3038,3110,3785],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,4.273428342688829,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,2.742262257014735,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.929723173391612,2.127032521151058,2.1337665533324026,1.9469506069506084,6.785721291966146,2.346825985579986,2.3791142619576227,2.5531798379045583,3.016831637578237,6.378794038853654,3.023389038124396,3.4572130107926293,3.120015873813468,3.107414446935464,3.351345009714117,3.365138331846453,3.4272107604888307,3.424750734647968,3.6314455447135003,3.7297814454343623,3.865219416329466,4.004218291136122,7.931007557910864,4.096025840389245,3.965503778955432,4.403125998698128,4.613282354485526,5.014723312293965,5.259176650194926,5.408212229355414,5.408212229355414,5.521540914662417,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164663E-4,2.2324275812784215E-4,2.2329787848933365E-4,2.2325298847310004E-4,2.2327411672029318E-4,2.2324152723462223E-4,2.2331095844892402E-4,2.232083125364085E-4,2.232428053079169E-4,2.234735025565281E-4,2.2524670023350634E-4,2.2324317404730226E-4,2.2345459944065002E-4,2.2347787955470625E-4,2.2337635938917736E-4,2.2325386783430913E-4,2.2333067579914006E-4,2.2343577597443487E-4,2.2326539346890383E-4,2.2326457718847367E-4,2.2346543761534024E-4,2.2328694601974762E-4,2.2328728394518975E-4,2.2343032416998447E-4,2.2326547400635313E-4,2.2348055066696393E-4,2.2332134532680113E-4,2.2324225779449928E-4,2.2334346629394175E-4,2.2341163393927878E-4,2.2328804127835607E-4,2.2340762949082024E-4,2.2351731705956896E-4,2.237247757880987E-4,2.2332095942123795E-4,2.2325373242729917E-4,2.233342280058663E-4,2.2327640592866797E-4,2.2320855076990675E-4,2.2326532432724472E-4,2.2348907433600586E-4,2.2336647651074386E-4,2.2340813859831558E-4,2.232196598345637E-4,2.232653810979608E-4,2.2325364847537173E-4,2.2332921781121278E-4,2.2336794337671963E-4,2.233225227676383E-4,2.232871257532247E-4,2.2325420056448946E-4,2.2371161216552584E-4,2.2331037775234793E-4,2.232653299258189E-4,2.233091818425656E-4,2.2324248620167694E-4,0.9823555967085611,2.2327731575760422E-4,2.232545139848124E-4,2.2324235876917275E-4,2.234209580113559E-4,2.2333127123814586E-4,2.232422654480051E-4,2.232195688898267E-4,2.231971216964519E-4,2.2339892722621747E-4,2.2325320192525597E-4,2.2335468452716264E-4,2.234202334647873E-4,2.2331887205251038E-4,2.2326

{"value":"This movie was the worst movie I have seen since \"Date Movie.\" I was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example, the eye, the tongue, the butt, the breast. If we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite. For each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person. I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior. I cant believe I wasted my money on this movie.So I don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","see","sinc","date","movi","i","be","laugh","through","out","the","whole","movi","instead","of","be","scare","it","be","funni","how","the","snake","would","search","for","particular","section","of","the","passeng","bodi","to","attack","for","exampl","the","ey","the","tongu","the","butt","the","breast","if","we","have","see","nation","geograph","channel","we","know","snake","wont","stai","clinch","on","the","bodi","onc","thei","bite","for","each","particular","scene","the","snake","would","bite","the","passeng","and","would","stai","on","the","bodi","bite","the","person","i","believ","the","produc","do","not","studi","hi","inform","on","snake","and","their","behavior","i","cant","believ","i","wast","my","monei","on","thi","movieso","i","do","not","recommend","thi","movi","trust","just","wait","until","it","be","at","the","dollar","theatr","or","rend","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","wrong","movi","see","sinc","date","movi","laugh","whole","movi","instead","scare","funni","snake","search","particular","section","passeng","bodi","attack","exampl","ey","tongu","butt","breast","see","nation","geograph","channel","know","snake","wont","stai","clinch","bodi","onc","thei","bite","particular","scene","snake","bite","passeng","stai","bodi","bite","person","believ","produc","studi","hi","inform","snake","behavior","cant","believ","wast","monei","thi","movieso","recommend","thi","movi","trust","wait","dollar","theatr","rend"],"filtered2":["wrong","see","sinc","date","laugh","whole","instead","scare","funni","snake","search","particular","section","passeng","bodi","attack","exampl","ey","tongu","butt","breast","see","nation","geograph","channel","know","snake","wont","stai","clinch","bodi","onc","bite","particular","scene","snake","bite","passeng","stai","bodi","bite","person","believ","produc","studi","inform","snake","behavior","cant","believ","wast","monei","movieso","recommend","trust","wait","dollar","theatr","rend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,19,25,26,62,89,91,111,126,133,152,153,154,162,236,261,281,298,307,331,366,376,495,533,623,647,728,832,1038,1043,1055,1089,1118,1171,1290,1455,1494,1646,1669,1876,2436,3129,3547,3583,7666],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,19,25,26,62,89,91,111,126,133,152,153,154,162,236,261,281,298,307,331,366,376,495,533,623,647,728,832,1038,1043,1055,1089,1118,1171,1290,1455,1494,1646,1669,1876,2436,3129,3547,3583,7666],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.0226120445069267,1.9940046109572438,4.021185338082285,2.1183455303375887,2.2391270689902285,2.3212364753796515,2.3131195476980753,2.3409902041158843,7.0454988784140475,2.3586007221245198,2.617923930016232,2.7085302779237206,2.832333801361687,2.7819920465008363,2.8767855639325206,2.932274249550174,6.01738979237035,9.470761292246756,3.5173618574831282,3.424750734647968,3.607563812710113,3.6746621462132825,3.7740817043309423,7.597548633842627,4.145296889396028,4.125296222689358,4.246178114249808,4.2078172463773615,4.34596758485818,4.297765483040301,4.3336974922663645,4.637773374493822,4.558366596889411,20.57241791576869,4.74221603786142,4.869215728622727,5.116075806554253,5.482320201509136,11.814406790948803,5.672363804397,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613003E-4,2.1169300653874453E-4,2.1174527517734895E-4,2.1170270760391562E-4,2.1172274275403077E-4,2.116918393273705E-4,2.1175767842838522E-4,2.1166034303434357E-4,2.1169305127789737E-4,2.1191181310725423E-4,2.135932716651461E-4,2.1169340094007576E-4,2.1189388796841998E-4,2.1191596365579486E-4,2.1181969576676966E-4,2.117035414702401E-4,2.1177637567609538E-4,2.118760383584708E-4,2.1171447081128606E-4,2.1171369676217518E-4,2.1190416541618494E-4,2.1173490831315607E-4,2.1173522875559027E-4,2.118708686101446E-4,2.1171454718202668E-4,2.1191849657461995E-4,2.117675279277589E-4,2.1169253209079152E-4,2.117885044381766E-4,2.1185314534259418E-4,2.117359469071499E-4,2.1184934806943367E-4,2.119533608105549E-4,2.1215008639459388E-4,2.1176716198751704E-4,2.1170341306868618E-4,2.1177974410483202E-4,2.1172491352726219E-4,2.1166056894252497E-4,2.1171440524675973E-4,2.11926579260667E-4,2.1181032419177934E-4,2.118498308375971E-4,2.1167110326541537E-4,2.117144590803697E-4,2.1170333346011983E-4,2.1177499311905113E-4,2.1181171516755477E-4,2.1176864445217802E-4,2.117350787478902E-4,2.1170385698619605E-4,2.1213760380898726E-4,2.1175712777489434E-4,2.1171441055568445E-4,2.1175599373704471E-4,2.116927486810297E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502675E-4,2.1170415419131497E-4,2.116926278414102E-4,2.1186198702179463E-4,2.1177694030929739E-4,2.1169253934833333E-4,2.1167101702582145E-4,2.1164973116690394E-4,2.1184109602769713E-4,2.11702910012

{"value":"This film was on late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole. I am no Tyson fan. In fact I don't like boxing at all.

Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I don't know how reliable the flick is. I haven't read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about the man, but it was quite entertaining.<br /><br />As the movie went on I felt it lost a little of it's charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","on","late","at","night","when","i","see","it","it","be","interest","at","start","but","it","do","not","convinc","me","a","a","whole","i","be","no","tyson","fan","in","fact","i","do","not","like","box","at","all","it","barbar","obscen","and","doubl","face","by","societi","that","some","get","monei","for","beat","each","other","upbr","br","nevertheless","i","feel","the","start","of","the","film","be","okai","actor","alright","especi","georg","c","scott","a","cu","have","amato","i","do","not","know","how","reliabl","the","flick","be","i","have","not","read","book","and","book","about","box","or","tyson","i","do","not","know","anyth","about","the","man","but","it","be","quit","entertainingbr","br","a","the","movi","go","on","i","feel","it","lose","a","littl","of","it","charm","and","i","conjur","lose","interest","i","manag","to","stai","awak","though","but","the","last","hour","be","just","not","good","enough"],"filtered":["thi","film","late","night","see","interest","start","convinc","whole","tyson","fan","fact","like","box","barbar","obscen","doubl","face","societi","get","monei","beat","upbr","br","nevertheless","feel","start","film","okai","actor","alright","especi","georg","c","scott","cu","amato","know","reliabl","flick","read","book","book","box","tyson","know","anyth","man","quit","entertainingbr","br","movi","go","feel","lose","littl","charm","conjur","lose","interest","manag","stai","awak","though","last","hour","good","enough"],"filtered2":["late","night","see","interest","start","convinc","whole","tyson","fan","fact","like","box","barbar","obscen","doubl","face","societi","get","monei","beat","upbr","nevertheless","feel","start","okai","actor","alright","especi","georg","c","scott","cu","amato","know","reliabl","flick","read","book","book","box","tyson","know","anyth","man","quit","entertainingbr","go","feel","lose","littl","charm","conjur","lose","interest","manag","stai","awak","though","last","hour","good","enough"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,14,26,39,41,43,45,60,71,86,93,97,104,111,120,126,140,144,145,150,151,174,191,210,221,251,257,267,345,366,478,654,678,680,797,930,1049,1115,1307,1551,2150,2464,2795,4235,4671,5596,7282,7312],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,14,26,39,41,43,45,60,71,86,93,97,104,111,120,126,140,144,145,150,151,174,191,210,221,251,257,267,345,366,478,654,678,680,797,930,1049,1115,1307,1551,2150,2464,2795,4235,4671,5596,7282,7312],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1175081997259209,2.6649848339420377,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.8162961064622165,3.676353282473182,3.8429853485101932,2.031112399272319,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.332712011146513,5.6004909736203725,2.456282578459816,2.5460113484259455,2.687151791517189,5.284684914728755,2.6942272927333892,2.7602659523229094,2.7085302779237206,3.0022328381570844,3.008694896185175,3.3243163373261977,7.268942531260074,3.6715125373103863,3.8095464139032247,3.7987743169213135,4.3095999406873045,4.176068548062782,4.2078172463773615,4.436351646326448,4.573751515728891,5.064116067623542,5.156897801074508,5.322690055917252,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.2980697041614135,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374515E-4,2.0463497070976412E-4,2.0468549666480032E-4,2.0464434833267003E-4,2.046637154928045E-4,2.0463384241427038E-4,2.0469748638025673E-4,2.0460339623606914E-4,2.0463501395727324E-4,2.0484648206987082E-4,2.0647187928241834E-4,2.0463535196139912E-4,2.048291545713375E-4,2.0485049423537842E-4,2.0475743600462695E-4,2.0464515439713894E-4,2.0471556024485944E-4,2.0481190008348808E-4,2.046557193440939E-4,2.046549711024787E-4,2.048390893597216E-4,2.046754754412127E-4,2.0467578519980703E-4,2.0480690269923524E-4,2.0465579316856513E-4,2.048529427044047E-4,2.04707007488435E-4,2.046345120803339E-4,2.047272846230702E-4,2.0478977034141504E-4,2.0467647940754574E-4,2.047860996727676E-4,2.048866445352588E-4,2.0507681111083865E-4,2.0470665374897095E-4,2.0464503027660868E-4,2.04718816367143E-4,2.046658138904979E-4,2.0460361461226796E-4,2.04655655965548E-4,2.0486075590640666E-4,2.047483768864019E-4,2.0478656634500492E-4,2.0461379771132904E-4,2.0465570800429686E-4,2.0464495332226374E-4,2.0471422378351442E-4,2.0474972148579003E-4,2.0470808678692265E-4,2.0467564019349904E-4,2.0464545939350825E-4,2.0506474470589802E-4,2.0469695408605003E-4,2.046556610974684E-4,2.0469585785804547E-4,2.0463472144925814E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788314017E-4,2.04645746689

{"value":"Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also make a habit of collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a manner of speaking. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /><br />Interesting Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) vehicle where he plays the mad scientist. I was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping.<br /><br />Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really appealing as a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter< who was to be a victim, but woman-power trumps evil scientist every time.<br /><br />2'11\" Angelo Rossitto and creepy Frank Moran , who liked to stoke the women's hair added to the film.<br

There is no plot, no dramatic content at all. This is way waay worse then the other pie-films and they arnt that great either:) If you're really drunk or maybe a 13 year old buy who are really obsessed with tits this might be acceptable,

{"value":"I know John Singleton's a smart guy 'coz he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and direct this? It's like the pilot of a bad \"going away to college for the first time\" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition, I guess. Who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? The angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of Neo-Nazis (and would be roomed-up with a black AND a Jew - just for laughs!) Even Laurence Fishburne's creepy reactionary history Professor just irritated me and I love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course.

{"value":"One of my sisters friends lent me this game, and it is too damn hard! It carries the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions, and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your 'score'! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE!!!!! Maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise keep away!

{"value":"Another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by Poverty Row in the 1930's, resurrected by the magic of DVD.<br /><br />Starring stock Universal player Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket. One kills the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and asks witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and is proved \"innocent\" because he could not have spoken to witnesses.<br /><br />Of course, where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? Oh, well.<br /><br />Atwill does a pretty good job here, faking being deaf and mute.

{"value":"I won't describe the story, as that has been done elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen fans, and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /><br />No wonder we had never heard of this \"movie\", because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992. Hence, the poor production values, grainy image , jerky camera work and poor sound.<br /><br />But, you don't really mind the mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. It's an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there is hardly any ending. You don't really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time more

{"value":"I've always been a great fan of Woody Allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how dull, meaningless, pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is. A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed \"actor Allen-clone\", that is putting into Will Farrell's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell's place had he been 30 years younger. The outcome was obviously ludicrous. And not to speak of the dialogues... what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering, unaware of its comic effect.

I've never seen the first one and will never after watching this. its terrible acting with a terrible plot. hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out. and the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever. so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk.","finished_norm":["wow","thi","be","the","wrong","movi","ever","the","onli","reason","i","sign","up","for","imdb","be","so","i","can","complain","about","thi","movi","i","have","never","walk","out","of","a","theater","or","stope","a","dvd","but","i","almost","stop","thi","on","and","i","should","have","but","i","watch","it","all","the","wai","to","the","end","just","to","get","let","down","again","with","a","absolut","terribl","end","wow","if","thi","be","all","that","we","craven","can","produc","hi","time","be","long","up","i","have","never","see","the","on","and","will","never","after","watch","thi","it","terribl","act","with","a","terribl","plot","hei","look","someon","be","shin","a","mirror","at","u","let","go","check","it","out","and","the","sad","part","be","that","when","thi","movi","come","to","dvd","it","be","complet","check","out","at","blockbust","forev","so","i","feel","bad","for","all","the","peopl","that","see","thi","junk"],"filtered":["wow","thi","wrong","movi","ever","onli","reason","sign","imdb","complain","thi","movi","never","walk","theater","stope","dvd","almost","stop","thi","watch","wai","end","get","let","absolut","terribl","end","wow","thi","craven","produc","hi","time","long","never","see","never","watch","thi","terribl","act","terribl","plot","hei","look","someon","shin","mirror","u","let","go","check","sad","part","thi","movi","come","dvd","complet","check","blockbust","forev","feel","bad","peopl","see","thi","junk"],"filtered2":["wow","wrong","ever","onli","reason","sign","imdb","complain","never","walk","theater","stope","dvd","almost","stop","watch","wai","end","get","let","absolut","terribl","end","wow","craven","produc","time","long","never","see","never","watch","terribl","act","terribl","plot","hei","look","someon","shin","mirror","u","let","go","check","sad","part","come","dvd","complet","check","blockbust","forev","feel","bad","peopl","see","junk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,8,9,11,16,21,23,24,25,32,33,34,42,43,44,61,95,99,103,112,124,131,139,166,222,247,261,294,315,424,455,505,591,876,974,1003,1324,1482,1680,1823,1854,2984],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,7,8,9,11,16,21,23,24,25,32,33,34,42,43,44,61,95,99,103,112,124,131,139,166,222,247,261,294,315,424,455,505,591,876,974,1003,1324,1482,1680,1823,1854,2984],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,4.865986292236151,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.8818517047392527,2.0323326556775485,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,4.464786073617769,2.2512118082053005,2.2939035841256437,7.327161098908061,2.5771019354959765,5.460751613699401,2.7085302779237206,2.886778509330039,2.854312708080462,3.212973749990824,3.2787058260741455,6.83481352078442,3.509308122676031,3.8844878351953436,4.030886538218284,8.070802437145622,4.364659717870332,4.506310234933358,4.671389985292807,4.798834931860927,5.051537285416681,5.770002273960917]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247376E-4,2.1540780663324003E-4,2.1546099248468393E-4,2.154176779332167E-4,2.1543806466120757E-4,2.1540661893957897E-4,2.1547361338862653E-4,2.1537456994793325E-4,2.1540785215747786E-4,2.1563045283100655E-4,2.17341417712758E-4,2.1540820795554668E-4,2.1561221314088635E-4,2.1563467621359285E-4,2.1553671901055067E-4,2.1541852643227163E-4,2.154926387366301E-4,2.155940503050361E-4,2.154296475619733E-4,2.154288599298076E-4,2.156226709378492E-4,2.1545044370220893E-4,2.1545076976778394E-4,2.1558878983769236E-4,2.1542972527287174E-4,2.156372535802117E-4,2.1548363572753703E-4,2.1540732385964917E-4,2.1550498033487091E-4,2.1557075556130398E-4,2.1545150052150518E-4,2.1556689165339285E-4,2.15672729615606E-4,2.1587290735061644E-4,2.154832633657564E-4,2.1541839577752045E-4,2.1549606627473266E-4,2.1544027352728265E-4,2.153747998203634E-4,2.154295808469172E-4,2.1564547810166174E-4,2.155271829826659E-4,2.155673828931976E-4,2.1538551900011002E-4,2.1542963562520218E-4,2.1541831477197874E-4,2.1549123191840158E-4,2.1552859836735796E-4,2.154847718447858E-4,2.1545061712774082E-4,2.1541884748491828E-4,2.1586020571993624E-4,2.15473053072239E-4,2.154295862490032E-4,2.1547189913423312E-4,2.1540754425062434E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476617E-4,2.1541914990540838E-4,2.154074212905048E-4,2.1557975239475946E-4,2.1549321327804543E-4,2.1540733124454672E-4,2.1538543124717912E-4,2.153637718628816E-4,2.155584948043907E-4,2.1541788389403316E-4,2.1551580485178995E-4,2.1557905327695403E-4,2.154812492555429E-4,2.154298715783537E-4,2.1538571360312696E-4,2.1544081324819346E-4,2.1538559

{"value":"Pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films, it's got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second. By concentrating on the guys who 'run' the cube, it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube, as we simply don't care about the characters inside. Much of the film is simply boring, and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the green-eyed crazy marine. After that, though, it just descends into over-the-top unintentional hilarity. The ending is fitting though, tying it back into the first one in an indirect way.

{"value":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face for taking this role. I was physically ill after watching this film. I really don't understand Hollywood sometimes. There are so many people trying to break in that I'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best. That way the worst movie you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. The gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film. Glad I avoided this film and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid January releases at all

The characters were stereotypical without meaning to (I think...) and wooden, most of them seemed like they were on autopilot. The so-called \"hilarious\" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed, I weeped for the writers.<br /><br />I'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time, seriously.

{"value":"there is no suspense in this serial! When one episode ends the acting is so shoddy, the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode! This show is so boring that I can't see how it ever got made, let alone released on DVD! Obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary Batman films, but even the script is awful. An incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that, I am not quite sure, because it is too awful to follow. Watch the 60s version, or the 90's versions, or even Batman Begins, just anything over this version!","finished_norm":["there","be","no","suspens","in","thi","serial","when","on","episod","end","the","act","be","so","shoddi","the","effect","be","so","poor","and","the","script","be","so","aw","that","the","last","thing","on","your","mind","be","how","batman","and","robin","will","save","the","dai","no","in","fact","the","last","thing","on","your","mind","be","watch","the","next","episod","thi","show","be","so","bore","that","i","ca","not","see","how","it","ever","get","make","let","alon","releas","on","dvd","obvious","the","effect","be","not","up","to","par","with","contemporari","batman","film","but","even","the","script","be","aw","a","incoher","babbl","mess","about","some","evil","professor","and","a","rai","gun","or","someth","like","that","i","be","not","quit","sure","becaus","it","be","too","aw","to","follow","watch","the","version","or","the","version","or","even","batman","begin","just","anyth","over","thi","version"],"filtered":["suspens","thi","serial","episod","end","act","shoddi","effect","poor","script","aw","last","thing","mind","batman","robin","save","dai","fact","last","thing","mind","watch","next","episod","thi","show","bore","ca","see","ever","get","make","let","alon","releas","dvd","obvious","effect","par","contemporari","batman","film","even","script","aw","incoher","babbl","mess","evil","professor","rai","gun","someth","like","quit","sure","becaus","aw","follow","watch","version","version","even","batman","begin","anyth","thi","version"],"filtered2":["suspens","serial","end","act","shoddi","effect","poor","script","aw","last","thing","mind","batman","robin","save","dai","fact","last","thing","mind","watch","next","show","bore","ca","see","ever","get","make","let","alon","releas","dvd","obvious","effect","par","contemporari","batman","even","script","aw","incoher","babbl","mess","evil","professor","rai","gun","someth","like","quit","sure","becaus","aw","follow","watch","version","version","even","batman","begin","anyth","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,21,22,24,28,29,44,53,77,81,97,104,106,108,119,120,124,132,138,144,146,147,189,220,238,247,260,297,321,327,341,407,457,501,529,1086,1134,1463,1538,1627,1751,2135,2232,2561,5672],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,21,22,24,28,29,44,53,77,81,97,104,106,108,119,120,124,132,138,144,146,147,189,220,238,247,260,297,321,327,341,407,457,501,529,1086,1134,1463,1538,1627,1751,2135,2232,2561,5672],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,2.6390769554676132,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,3.8927804517536475,1.949757232424728,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,4.318168722633384,2.138507503627933,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2323930368088845,2.253494045787767,6.872209556786827,4.586221753978809,2.326138445979858,2.2844323215331563,2.498193474075453,8.501080262633181,5.194609285626992,2.7303758068497004,2.6754694156628323,2.813490713560207,3.09496984188738,2.9674191958529437,2.933776879434709,3.120015873813468,3.3243163373261977,3.5119855004467477,3.4648563601051974,15.34822741966276,4.403125998698128,4.724033718778229,4.550761997504193,4.944927550358424,5.0768550934009715,4.956227105612356,5.064116067623542,5.1994574154933035,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378616E-4,1.9184256248006742E-4,1.9188992989069268E-4,1.918513538767774E-4,1.9186951033173358E-4,1.918415047180534E-4,1.9190117008941623E-4,1.9181296183106008E-4,1.9184260302403182E-4,1.9204085156612036E-4,1.935646398278312E-4,1.9184291989840288E-4,1.9202460726677861E-4,1.92044612917904E-4,1.9195737206466516E-4,1.9185210955149272E-4,1.9191811409701804E-4,1.9200843141398163E-4,1.9186201404870195E-4,1.9186131258214266E-4,1.9203392099871158E-4,1.9188053512690637E-4,1.9188082552146736E-4,1.9200374643273216E-4,1.9186208325816154E-4,1.9204690832504053E-4,1.9191009600166002E-4,1.918421325210784E-4,1.9192910554560397E-4,1.919876850752127E-4,1.9188147633198636E-4,1.9198424387219205E-4,1.920785033430812E-4,1.9225678197762132E-4,1.919097643756188E-4,1.9185199319014695E-4,1.9192116666833786E-4,1.9187147755165307E-4,1.918131665558411E-4,1.918619546321584E-4,1.9205423309796686E-4,1.9194887926185598E-4,1.919846813712057E-4,1.918227130757301E-4,1.918620034177931E-4,1.9185192104647242E-4,0.02551623586562555,1.9195013980589318E-4,1.919111078296327E-4,1.9188068957998286E-4,1.9185239548153113E-4,1.9224546988352666E-4,1.9190067107067933E-4,1.918619594432655E-4,1.9189964337150978E-4,1.9184232880165933E-4,0.9595130501037131,1.9187225940865937E-4,1.9185266481773892E-4,1.9184221929316572E-4,1.919956976705373E-4,1.9191862578458912E-4,1.918

I had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me I. Couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie, bunnies being brutally murdered! It's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated G. I recommend being over 8 to see this. But don't get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I wasn't scarred mentally as a child. I cannot believe a parent would allow a, let's say, 4 year old child to watch this. It's just to intense and complicated, not to forget gory, for young kids.

{"value":"This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I generally like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures. When they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them. He doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents, and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either... Not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience. It would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the \"cross

{"value":"I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was all about. I thought \"hmmm, a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore\". It wasn't funny alright. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm... The quality of the images were terrible. The acting...there was no acting. Just some fcked-up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes.

BeLyt must be out of his mind, I've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about.

{"value":"what kind of sh*t is this? Power rangers vs Freddy? It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams, it started to become childish. This sh*t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film. The rest are for little kids. Plus it's focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why does it always have to be Christianity? This is total Orientalism and filled with white men/westerner's superiority. Don't' watch this, show it to little kids who loves power rangers.","finished_norm":["what","kind","of","sht","be","thi","power","ranger","v","freddi","it","be","watchabl","and","a","good","a","the","film","in","the","begin","but","from","the","part","where","the","protagonist","get","super","power","in","their","dream","it","start","to","becom","childish","thi","sht","should","have","be","rate","pg","or","pg","rather","than","r","i","expect","to","see","some","veri","matur","stuff","but","it","be","onli","for","the","of","the","film","the","rest","be","for","littl","kid","plu","it","focu","too","much","on","christian","i","know","freddi","a","demon","but","there","be","mani","religion","that","have","differ","wai","to","fight","demon","why","doe","it","alwai","have","to","be","christian","thi","be","total","orient","and","fill","with","white","menwestern","superior","do","not","watch","thi","show","it","to","littl","kid","who","love","power","ranger"],"filtered":["kind","sht","thi","power","ranger","v","freddi","watchabl","good","film","begin","part","protagonist","get","super","power","dream","start","becom","childish","thi","sht","rate","pg","pg","rather","r","expect","see","veri","matur","stuff","onli","film","rest","littl","kid","plu","focu","much","christian","know","freddi","demon","mani","religion","differ","wai","fight","demon","doe","alwai","christian","thi","total","orient","fill","white","menwestern","superior","watch","thi","show","littl","kid","love","power","ranger"],"filtered2":["kind","sht","power","ranger","v","freddi","watchabl","good","begin","part","protagonist","get","super","power","dream","start","becom","childish","sht","rate","pg","pg","rather","r","expect","see","veri","matur","stuff","onli","rest","littl","kid","plu","focu","christian","know","freddi","demon","mani","religion","differ","wai","fight","demon","doe","alwai","christian","total","orient","fill","white","menwestern","superior","watch","show","littl","kid","love","power","ranger"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,11,14,15,18,26,28,33,50,54,61,71,114,115,122,130,147,160,184,197,202,204,226,233,359,361,365,553,607,619,684,749,1073,1137,1178,1281,1342,1417,1471,1602,1641,2019,2030,2572,2937,3094,3511],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,11,14,15,18,26,28,33,50,54,61,71,114,115,122,130,147,160,184,197,202,204,226,233,359,361,365,553,607,619,684,749,1073,1137,1178,1281,1342,1417,1471,1602,1641,2019,2030,2572,2937,3094,3511],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,1.8818517047392527,1.9214926742550966,4.886614839193365,2.201553588425805,2.2489347673732487,2.2642139034199635,2.2844323215331563,2.3722295531801256,2.496249838866882,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.624524614047584,2.5940874818617203,2.8377834061292515,3.2189558216683714,3.0399731661399314,9.556563136746401,3.454678155189441,3.68099128126493,3.5929222627171646,8.260518024062975,3.7165362186843414,9.071448240279304,10.153710186801943,4.229557233013768,4.34596758485818,4.484804029712395,4.733083554298147,4.9227044135737135,4.724033718778229,4.6295428753573065,10.153710186801943,10.645380111834504,5.1994574154933035,5.463272006538442,11.003476574732474,5.695894301807195]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875904E-4,2.0127954981638384E-4,2.0132924729208146E-4,2.0128877367343187E-4,2.0130782326822772E-4,2.0127844002166864E-4,2.013410404109268E-4,2.0124849307261725E-4,2.0127959235475906E-4,2.014875930027252E-4,2.0308633840816415E-4,2.0127992481659614E-4,2.014705496249871E-4,2.0149153938033777E-4,2.0140000703507244E-4,2.0128956652077786E-4,2.0135881791649222E-4,2.014535780607691E-4,2.01299958233199E-4,2.0129922226057938E-4,2.01480321511613E-4,2.0131939038753902E-4,2.0131969506698947E-4,2.0144866261914552E-4,2.013000308471627E-4,2.014939477015628E-4,2.0135040540050422E-4,2.0127909870714807E-4,2.0137035004885433E-4,2.0143181118237796E-4,2.0132037789173172E-4,2.0142820070206605E-4,2.0152709691999198E-4,2.0171414531445787E-4,2.0135005746134294E-4,2.012894444354648E-4,2.013620206478001E-4,2.0130988725827593E-4,2.0124870786807883E-4,2.0129989589387772E-4,2.0150163278967912E-4,2.0139109646015094E-4,2.0142865972223016E-4,2.0125872399380575E-4,2.012999470793418E-4,2.012893687429483E-4,2.0135750336924284E-4,2.0139241901200307E-4,2.0135146700162233E-4,2.01319552438365E-4,2.0128986651608998E-4,2.0170227676361376E-4,2.0134051684480355E-4,2.012999009416495E-4,2.0133943859176355E-4,2.012793046430283E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585415E-4,2.0129014910129917E-4,2.0127918974766822E-4,2.014402179277787E-4,2.0135935477464626E-4,2.012791056076819E-4,2.012586419964

{"value":"The premise is ridiculous, the characters unbelievable, the dialogue trite, and the ending absurd. <br /><br />Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed Frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds.<br /><br />For her part, Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth. She also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being.<br /><br />This movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to vacation in Paris and the south of France while being well-paid for it.
