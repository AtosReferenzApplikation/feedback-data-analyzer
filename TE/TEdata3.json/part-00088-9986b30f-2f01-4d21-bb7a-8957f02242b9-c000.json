{"value":"This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. But the acting was awful. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who I believe was a true likeness of the Emma in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the \"gentleman\" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, had no feeling whatsoever, and throughout the entire film you could not see his love \"growing\" for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to \"resque\" her leading role as well as her partner's. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are also too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here. The ending is also too long. It is good that it resembles the book's ending, but it is a killer ending for a film. And again, I can see no feeling of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. To conclude, I believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see the \"lighter\" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it is clear that it was made to be a \"blockbuster\", than to watch these actors (excepting the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) ruin the entire script.","finished_norm":["thi","be","ind","a","god","adapt","of","jane","austen","novel","compar","with","the","american","version","with","guinneth","paltrow","the","script","be","write","to","resembl","a","much","a","possibl","the","book","but","the","act","be","aw","besid","kate","beckinsal","who","i","believ","be","a","true","like","of","the","emma","in","the","book","all","the","other","actor","be","try","too","hard","mark","strong","be","not","the","gentleman","he","be","suppos","to","be","he","be","often","rude","and","offens","have","no","feel","whatsoev","and","throughout","the","entir","film","you","can","not","see","hi","love","grow","for","emma","at","all","thi","have","a","terribl","effect","on","kate","beckinsal","who","seem","to","be","try","to","resqu","her","lead","role","a","good","a","her","partner","moreov","there","be","no","chemistri","between","the","entir","cast","hariett","smith","plai","by","samantha","morton","seem","to","have","no","real","attach","to","mr","elton","plai","by","domin","rowan","therefor","she","do","not","seem","a","heartbroken","a","she","be","portrai","in","the","book","the","set","of","the","film","be","conjur","too","poor","the","costum","be","even","much","so","i","would","have","imagin","emma","woodhous","to","dress","in","a","much","fashion","and","eleg","wai","that","she","doe","here","the","end","be","conjur","too","long","it","be","good","that","it","resembl","the","book","end","but","it","be","a","killer","end","for","a","film","and","again","i","can","see","no","feel","of","happi","in","the","face","of","mrknightlei","to","conclud","i","believ","thi","adapt","to","be","loyal","to","the","book","but","with","poor","actor","it","seem","a","if","the","film","be","make","without","ani","budget","at","all","i","would","prefer","to","see","the","light","version","with","paltrow","and","northam","even","if","it","be","clear","that","it","be","make","to","be","a","blockbust","than","to","watch","thi","actor","except","the","good","olivia","william","and","the","well","kate","beckinsal","ruin","the","entir","script"],"filtered":["thi","ind","god","adapt","jane","austen","novel","compar","american","version","guinneth","paltrow","script","write","resembl","much","possibl","book","act","aw","besid","kate","beckinsal","believ","true","like","emma","book","actor","try","hard","mark","strong","gentleman","suppos","often","rude","offens","feel","whatsoev","throughout","entir","film","see","hi","love","grow","emma","thi","terribl","effect","kate","beckinsal","seem","try","resqu","lead","role","good","partner","moreov","chemistri","entir","cast","hariett","smith","plai","samantha","morton","seem","real","attach","mr","elton","plai","domin","rowan","therefor","seem","heartbroken","portrai","book","set","film","conjur","poor","costum","even","much","imagin","emma","woodhous","dress","much","fashion","eleg","wai","doe","end","conjur","long","good","resembl","book","end","killer","end","film","see","feel","happi","face","mrknightlei","conclud","believ","thi","adapt","loyal","book","poor","actor","seem","film","make","without","ani","budget","prefer","see","light","version","paltrow","northam","even","clear","make","blockbust","watch","thi","actor","except","good","olivia","william","well","kate","beckinsal","ruin","entir","script"],"filtered2":["ind","god","adapt","jane","austen","novel","compar","american","version","guinneth","paltrow","script","write","resembl","possibl","book","act","aw","besid","kate","beckinsal","believ","true","like","emma","book","actor","try","hard","mark","strong","gentleman","suppos","often","rude","offens","feel","whatsoev","throughout","entir","see","love","grow","emma","terribl","effect","kate","beckinsal","seem","try","resqu","lead","role","good","partner","moreov","chemistri","entir","cast","hariett","smith","plai","samantha","morton","seem","real","attach","mr","elton","plai","domin","rowan","therefor","seem","heartbroken","portrai","book","set","conjur","poor","costum","even","imagin","emma","woodhous","dress","fashion","eleg","wai","doe","end","conjur","long","good","resembl","book","end","killer","end","see","feel","happi","face","mrknightlei","conclud","believ","adapt","loyal","book","poor","actor","seem","make","without","ani","budget","prefer","see","light","version","paltrow","northam","even","clear","make","blockbust","watch","actor","except","good","olivia","william","well","kate","beckinsal","ruin","entir","script"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,18,20,21,24,27,33,35,36,39,40,41,43,54,65,77,80,91,92,99,106,109,125,128,138,146,149,151,157,166,171,198,220,223,233,251,252,256,304,340,352,353,357,400,402,438,469,474,482,561,590,605,631,701,710,717,719,776,829,873,972,992,1037,1053,1067,1132,1145,1228,1268,1513,1528,1593,1682,1949,2264,2347,3318,3345,3367,4042,4190,4789,5004,5029,5451,6029],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are rather fun. \"Criminally Insane 1\" was one of those flicks. So bad that it was enjoyable and had re-watch value to it. \"Criminally Insane 2\" has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me, that's saying a lot because I am not the type of person to say anything is the worst. But trust me, this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long.<br /><br />The movie has a rather incoherent storyline, but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn't being fed. Well, you don't see that in this movie, except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one. The new storyline could have been really funny with Ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is just atrocious. This literally reminds me of something I shot with friends of mine back when I was 15. The sound quality is something else as you can't understand a word most of the characters are saying. To give an example of how bad it is, go into a New York Subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers, that is what this movie sounds like. Not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood.<br /><br />Now I know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can't describe just how bad this movie is.

{"value":"Antonioni's movies have aged not well. What always surprised me about them is that, besides an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic \"psychology\" of the characters and situations. Remember, for instance, the conversations between Mastroianni and the \"wicked capitalistic\" that wants sing up him in \"La notte\", or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in \"La aventura\", or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /><br />I have reviewed yesterday \"Zabriskie Point\". In this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of L.A., the publicity advertisements, the deserts,etc., that show the fascination of the author in his American journey, in the same way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too a lot of hippie-leftist clichés that spoil the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find \"something different\". - The executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the \"object women\" in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them. - The couple of fat middle-class in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of the nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - Last but not the least, a lot of couples making love in the desert. What a hippie platitude!<br /><br />Sorry, today, half a century after the \"revolution\" of \"La Aventura\" we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except \"Le amiche\" and perhaps \"Il grido\") are only a handful of aestheticism and

{"value":"W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a English language classic. If so, much must have been missing from the film version here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) attraction to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post-breakup retelling of a relationship from the man's point of view. Being a family lawyer I've heard many such accounts; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man.<br /><br />Indeed, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period didn't occur here. In fact, by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later.<br /><br />I note how Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed. It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability. Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the movie, a student; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger, and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as it will. And balanced that by allowing Mildred a modicum of charm.","finished_norm":["w","somerset","maugham","of","human","bondag","be","suppos","to","be","a","english","languag","classic","if","so","much","must","have","be","miss","from","the","film","version","here","phillip","lesli","howard","attract","to","mildr","bett","davi","be","so","utterli","inexplic","a","to","make","the","scenario","seem","like","the","postbreakup","retel","of","a","relationship","from","the","man","point","of","view","be","a","famili","lawyer","i","have","hear","mani","such","account","the","man","depict","himself","a","nobl","and","alwai","correct","and","the","woman","be","a","hellion","who","have","have","no","other","object","than","to","exploit","the","manbr","br","ind","unless","on","be","will","to","laugh","at","the","social","assumpt","of","the","film","maker","thi","be","a","uncomfort","movi","to","watch","phillip","even","indulg","mildr","when","she","bring","over","a","babi","of","indetermin","patern","but","the","real","high","point","come","when","phillip","allow","mildr","enrag","and","now","of","dubiou","saniti","the","free","run","of","hi","flat","with","predict","result","bett","davi","be","attract","for","about","five","year","of","her","life","but","that","period","do","not","occur","here","in","fact","by","the","end","of","the","movi","she","look","a","lot","like","the","babi","jane","charact","she","would","plai","thirti","year","laterbr","br","i","note","how","howard","charact","be","alwai","impecc","dress","and","groom","it","tell","me","that","phillip","crave","middl","class","respect","someon","like","that","can","not","run","from","a","woman","with","a","cours","cocknei","accent","fast","enough","phillip","be","for","much","of","the","movi","a","student","such","a","person","would","have","be","much","believ","if","he","have","be","young","and","have","the","dishevel","look","that","bespeak","the","low","incom","and","the","low","self","esteem","that","often","accompani","student","statu","a","english","raskolnikov","a","it","will","and","balanc","that","by","allow","mildr","a","modicum","of","charm"],"filtered":["w","somerset","maugham","human","bondag","suppos","english","languag","classic","much","must","miss","film","version","phillip","lesli","howard","attract","mildr","bett","davi","utterli","inexplic","make","scenario","seem","like","postbreakup","retel","relationship","man","point","view","famili","lawyer","hear","mani","account","man","depict","nobl","alwai","correct","woman","hellion","object","exploit","manbr","br","ind","unless","laugh","social","assumpt","film","maker","thi","uncomfort","movi","watch","phillip","even","indulg","mildr","bring","babi","indetermin","patern","real","high","point","come","phillip","allow","mildr","enrag","dubiou","saniti","free","run","hi","flat","predict","result","bett","davi","attract","five","year","life","period","occur","fact","end","movi","look","lot","like","babi","jane","charact","plai","thirti","year","laterbr","br","note","howard","charact","alwai","impecc","dress","groom","tell","phillip","crave","middl","class","respect","someon","like","run","woman","cours","cocknei","accent","fast","enough","phillip","much","movi","student","person","much","believ","young","dishevel","look","bespeak","low","incom","low","self","esteem","often","accompani","student","statu","english","raskolnikov","balanc","allow","mildr","modicum","charm"],"filtered2":["w","somerset","maugham","human","bondag","suppos","english","languag","classic","must","miss","version","phillip","lesli","howard","attract","mildr","bett","davi","utterli","inexplic","make","scenario","seem","like","postbreakup","retel","relationship","man","point","view","famili","lawyer","hear","mani","account","man","depict","nobl","alwai","correct","woman","hellion","object","exploit","manbr","ind","unless","laugh","social","assumpt","maker","uncomfort","watch","phillip","even","indulg","mildr","bring","babi","indetermin","patern","real","high","point","come","phillip","allow","mildr","enrag","dubiou","saniti","free","run","flat","predict","result","bett","davi","attract","five","year","life","period","occur","fact","end","look","lot","like","babi","jane","charact","plai","thirti","year","laterbr","note","howard","charact","alwai","impecc","dress","groom","tell","phillip","crave","middl","class","respect","someon","like","run","woman","cours","cocknei","accent","fast","enough","phillip","student","person","believ","young","dishevel","look","bespeak","low","incom","low","self","esteem","often","accompani","student","statu","english","raskolnikov","balanc","allow","mildr","modicum","charm"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,10,16,24,34,35,40,45,50,57,66,70,72,75,80,90,91,93,97,133,135,137,139,141,149,153,182,197,199,211,216,217,220,250,255,292,312,332,337,400,447,460,505,521,542,554,559,560,577,588,594,626,628,648,686,695,698,743,762,797,816,829,873,918,975,1011,1067,1094,1109,1253,1261,1465,1501,1569,1681,1771,1872,1971,2052,2058,2066,2316,2707,2854,

{"value":"Going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac. So right away you're guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly who you'd expect them to be, so no points for plot twists there.<br /><br />And if you're not sure if this is a B-movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story, William Devane plays a part: instant B-movie status.<br /><br />The movie is promising in the beginning. At the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. Same thing when they make Bacon invisible.<br /><br />There are a couple of bare breasts, a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an R-rating that it really didn't need.<br /><br />For a thriller there weren't really any surprises, except when Shue makes like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a 'Whaaaa?' OK, there is one surprise. That's when Caine (Bacon) comes back one last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise but only because you're yelling at TV, 'Noooo! You're dead already! End the movie!' Speaking of yelling at the TV,that's all I did for the last 25 minutes or so. 'Put on your f#@%ing goggles!' Instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems...).<br /><br />The story really lost it at the end.

{"value":"Letting the class watch this in English was a bad idea. Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it appears this one didn't have any effect whatsoever on the class - whenever the teacher left, conversations quickly started - and I didn't hear the words \"Shakespeare\" or \"Tempest\" being used at all. And when you look at this, it is easy to see why. The acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to bits, just reading from the page without a care in the world. Shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death, but I just couldn't understand a word anyone was saying. The costumes aren't too bad and neither are the special effects - the class may not have loved the film, but they weren't exactly taking the p*ss either. But it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the start of the film weren't too badly done - though the rain looked a bit unrealistic, everything else was done well and good. But where were the severed heads and exploding masts? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes - but as all was on show, he was just another excuse for a joke. This film is not in any way appealing to either sex. The women and girls won't have any romance or comedy to enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off. The Tempest wasn't badly done, but this felt like something the producers HAD to make, not something they wanted to make. And the general boredom and lack of inspiration show.

{"value":"I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6(?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as of today.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction Oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and I wonder why? Did the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb disposal-man storyline mean anything to somebody that I failed see? Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the Wild Wild West infected with 'evil' Red Indians; but just that it was set in a different background this time? Was it given the Oscars because the director being ex of James Cameron, and made it a nice underdog (gossipy) story for day time TV shows to munch on? Or was it some sort of Emperor's Clothes syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but just couldn't say so because others didn't seem to be saying it out aloud?<br /><br />And finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high-resolution-super-slow-mo as if to convey a 'deep message' or something? Something in the lines of 'EOD guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time'? Was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason? And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing for that??<br /><br />If you haven't seen this yet, don't waste your money on tickets. Wait till they run it on TV in a few years.

{"value":"Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie! My grandma could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one. The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it. Clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, Robin is trying to act like Lemercier (because she's replacing her) but that's grotesque'. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act. I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role (Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier playing her role'! As for the story, it's just too much! Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode.

{"value":"Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie! My grandma could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one. The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it. Clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, Robin is trying to act like Lemercier (because she's replacing her) but that's grotesque'. Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act. I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role (Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier playing her role'! As for the story, it's just too much! Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there's no more than 3 funny parts in this. The only good things might be the costumes and some special effects.

{"value":"I loved the first season. The quality went down a little bit in the second season, which however had a great middle (Pegasus!). Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK. Fourth season started going downhill fast, because they never even began giving us any explanations, when by now we were really starting to need them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth-1? What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere.<br /><br />And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But destroying the fleet?! Giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life, and spreading a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet?! That's not only anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive A.I. that ruins everything. It is without vision, without hope for a grander future for humanity, and it is antithetical to proper science fiction. And don't even get me started on the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The ultimate disappointment!!<br /><br />The whole \"all this has happened before and will happen again\" thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to Earth as we know it. Making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius.

{"value":"Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie. He really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more screen presence, and sadly he is not really the main character. Most of the screen time goes to the brick-faced Rooker.<br /><br />Danielle Harris (from the Halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays his daughter, and she is cute and entertaining but she is written as not being too smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the main characters killed. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /><br />Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliare to the local Mafia Godfather, and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. He seems to be in every extremely low budget direct-to-video action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a spoof. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It is hard to tell at some points. There is certainly very little Yakuza action. <br /><br />The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is menacing and well cast. Some of these kinds of movies have Thugs that look like they work at the local Comic Book Store or as stock boys at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall this movie is very uneven. At some points it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then at other points it works as a good action movie. Then it sputters to an end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi this movie would rate a Zero in my humble opinion.","finished_norm":["michael","rooker","be","a","decent","actor","but","he","have","no","busi","be","the","lead","except","in","a","low","budget","movi","he","realli","doe","not","have","much","charisma","ryo","ishibashi","have","a","lot","much","screen","presenc","and","sadli","he","be","not","realli","the","main","charact","much","of","the","screen","time","go","to","the","brickfac","rookerbr","br","daniel","harri","from","the","halloween","and","movi","plai","hi","daughter","and","she","be","cute","and","entertain","but","she","be","write","a","not","be","too","smart","and","on","of","her","dumb","mistak","get","on","of","the","main","charact","kill","comedian","fred","willard","bobcat","goldthwait","and","stephen","furst","be","here","in","interest","role","just","watch","what","happen","to","thi","charact","be","priceless","br","br","vincent","schiavelli","plai","the","consigliar","to","the","local","mafia","godfath","and","it","be","hard","to","tell","whether","or","not","he","be","work","the","movi","a","a","comedi","tim","thomerson","be","conjur","in","thi","movi","he","seem","to","be","in","everi","extrem","low","budget","directtovideo","action","movi","thomerson","be","conjur","in","some","lowbudget","comedi","see","so","mani","comedian","and","comic","actor","in","thi","film","make","it","feel","like","a","spoof","be","it","a","parodi","of","a","yakuza","movi","it","be","hard","to","tell","at","some","point","there","be","certainli","veri","littl","yakuza","action","br","br","the","support","cast","of","thug","and","goon","be","menac","and","good","cast","some","of","thi","kind","of","movi","have","thug","that","look","like","thei","work","at","the","local","comic","book","store","or","a","stock","boi","at","pigglywiggli","overal","thi","movi","be","veri","uneven","at","some","point","it","seem","like","a","comedi","or","a","parodi","then","at","other","point","it","work","a","a","good","action","movi","then","it","sputter","to","a","end","without","the","contribut","of","daniel","harri","and","ryo","ishibashi","thi","movi","would","rate","a","zero","in","my","humbl","opinion"],"filtered":["michael","rooker","decent","actor","busi","lead","except","low","budget","movi","realli","doe","much","charisma","ryo","ishibashi","lot","much","screen","presenc","sadli","realli","main","charact","much","screen","time","go","brickfac","rookerbr","br","daniel","harri","halloween","movi","plai","hi","daughter","cute","entertain","write","smart","dumb","mistak","get","main","charact","kill","comedian","fred","willard","bobcat","goldthwait","stephen","furst","interest","role","watch","happen","thi","charact","priceless","br","br","vincent","schiavelli","plai","consigliar","local","mafia","godfath","hard","tell","whether","work","movi","comedi","tim","thomerson","conjur","thi","movi","seem","everi","extrem","low","budget","directtovideo","action","movi","thomerson","conjur","lowbudget","comedi","see","mani","comedian","comic","actor","thi","film","make","feel","like","spoof","parodi","yakuza","movi","hard","tell","point","certainli","veri","littl","yakuza","action","br","br","support","cast","thug","goon","menac","good","cast","thi","kind","movi","thug","look","like","thei","work","local","comic","book","store","stock","boi","pigglywiggli","overal","thi","movi","veri","uneven","point","seem","like","comedi","parodi","point","work","good","action","movi","sputter","end","without","contribut","daniel","harri","ryo","ishibashi","thi","movi","rate","zero","humbl","opinion"],"filtered2":["michael","rooker","decent","actor","busi","lead","except","low","budget","realli","doe","charisma","ryo","ishibashi","lot","screen","presenc","sadli","realli","main","charact","screen","time","go","brickfac","rookerbr","daniel","harri","halloween","plai","daughter","cute","entertain","write","smart","dumb","mistak","get","main","charact","kill","comedian","fred","willard","bobcat","goldthwait","stephen","furst","interest","role","watch","happen","charact","priceless","vincent","schiavelli","plai","consigliar","local","mafia","godfath","hard","tell","whether","work","comedi","tim","thomerson","conjur","seem","everi","extrem","low","budget","directtovideo","action","thomerson","conjur","lowbudget","comedi","see","mani","comedian","comic","actor","make","feel","like","spoof","parodi","yakuza","hard","tell","point","certainli","veri","littl","yakuza","action","support","cast","thug","goon","menac","good","cast","kind","thug","look","like","work","local","comic","book","store","stock","boi","pigglywiggli","overal","veri","uneven","point","seem","like","comedi","parodi","point","work","good","action","sputter","end","without","contribut","daniel","harri","ryo","ishibashi","rate","zero","humbl","opinion"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10,13,14,15,16,18,24,35,39,40,41,43,48,50,60,65,66,72,76,85,90,92,94,122,125,127,128,129,151,157,171,179,192,195,202,217,233,256,282,309,329,389,412,420,426,458,466,475,480,

{"value":"I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that \"It is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback\".<br /><br />After watching it, I understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show. The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story-line. There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who. Also the action was daft & unrealistic e.g. 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns.<br /><br />While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 films:<br /><br />Sin City: During the opening credits.<br /><br />Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla.<br /><br />Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny.<br /><br />I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money went to. Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.<br /><br />The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film?

{"value":"I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so had they not revealed this in the preview, it might have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it's not.<br /><br />In fact, there's not a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you saw even one preview, you saw the whole movie, so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save yourself $3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film, other than how terrible the soundtrack is.<br /><br />I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this) they both had less talent and musical ability.<br /><br />The acting is at best poor, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities.","finished_norm":["i","actual","intend","to","see","thi","movi","in","the","theatr","it","be","actual","sell","out","i","actual","go","to","see","solari","instead","which","actual","be","the","wrong","movi","to","be","releas","in","br","br","victor","rosa","john","leguizamo","a","tough","streetwis","street","pharmacist","freak","out","when","he","see","a","kid","get","shoot","so","he","decid","to","go","clean","and","invest","all","of","hi","monei","with","jack","peter","sarsgaard","thing","seem","to","be","go","pretti","good","until","jack","skip","town","with","hi","girlfriend","trish","denis","richard","thi","happen","veri","late","in","the","movi","so","have","thei","not","reveal","thi","in","the","preview","it","mai","have","be","a","interest","twist","but","thei","do","so","it","notbr","br","in","fact","there","not","a","singl","interest","thing","about","thi","movi","everyth","be","give","awai","in","the","preview","if","you","see","even","on","preview","you","see","the","whole","movi","so","you","mai","just","want","to","think","realli","hard","to","fill","in","the","gap","go","to","the","websit","download","the","preview","save","yourself","there","be","not","a","singl","surpris","or","twist","in","the","entir","film","other","than","how","terribl","the","soundtrack","isbr","br","i","hope","that","whoever","be","in","charg","of","write","the","soundtrack","be","fire","twice","much","of","it","be","what","music","would","be","like","if","the","onli","song","allow","to","be","releas","be","ricki","martin","and","gloria","estefan","duet","and","i","mai","shatter","the","fabric","of","the","spacetim","continuum","with","a","concept","a","mindnumb","a","thi","thei","both","have","littl","talent","and","music","abilitybr","br","the","act","be","at","well","poor","the","script","be","at","well","a","crime","against","human","and","denis","richard","be","at","well","styrofoam","and","ziploc","bag","you","know","thing","be","bad","when","john","leguizamo","he","be","in","the","pest","upstag","the","rest","of","the","cast","with","hi","act","abil"],"filtered":["actual","intend","see","thi","movi","theatr","actual","sell","actual","go","see","solari","instead","actual","wrong","movi","releas","br","br","victor","rosa","john","leguizamo","tough","streetwis","street","pharmacist","freak","see","kid","get","shoot","decid","go","clean","invest","hi","monei","jack","peter","sarsgaard","thing","seem","go","pretti","good","jack","skip","town","hi","girlfriend","trish","denis","richard","thi","happen","veri","late","movi","thei","reveal","thi","preview","mai","interest","twist","thei","notbr","br","fact","singl","interest","thing","thi","movi","everyth","give","awai","preview","see","even","preview","see","whole","movi","mai","want","think","realli","hard","fill","gap","go","websit","download","preview","save","singl","surpris","twist","entir","film","terribl","soundtrack","isbr","br","hope","whoever","charg","write","soundtrack","fire","twice","much","music","like","onli","song","allow","releas","ricki","martin","gloria","estefan","duet","mai","shatter","fabric","spacetim","continuum","concept","mindnumb","thi","thei","littl","talent","music","abilitybr","br","act","well","poor","script","well","crime","human","denis","richard","well","styrofoam","ziploc","bag","know","thing","bad","john","leguizamo","pest","upstag","rest","cast","hi","act","abil"],"filtered2":["actual","intend","see","theatr","actual","sell","actual","go","see","solari","instead","actual","wrong","releas","victor","rosa","john","leguizamo","tough","streetwis","street","pharmacist","freak","see","kid","get","shoot","decid","go","clean","invest","monei","jack","peter","sarsgaard","thing","seem","go","pretti","good","jack","skip","town","girlfriend","trish","denis","richard","happen","veri","late","reveal","preview","mai","interest","twist","notbr","fact","singl","interest","thing","everyth","give","awai","preview","see","even","preview","see","whole","mai","want","think","realli","hard","fill","gap","go","websit","download","preview","save","singl","surpris","twist","entir","terribl","soundtrack","isbr","hope","whoever","charg","write","soundtrack","fire","twice","music","like","onli","song","allow","releas","ricki","martin","gloria","estefan","duet","mai","shatter","fabric","spacetim","continuum","concept","mindnumb","littl","talent","music","abilitybr","act","well","poor","script","well","crime","human","denis","richard","well","styrofoam","ziploc","bag","know","thing","bad","john","leguizamo","pest","upstag","rest","cast","act","abil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,9,11,12,13,14,15,20,21,25,26,29,30,35,37,46,52,60,65,77,78,92,94,97,111,114,117,118,126,146,150,152,155,166,171,181,189,193,198,226,249,276,291,292,326,327,328,435,443,450,521,551,553,641,664,726,730,753,760,777,796,833,847,861,926,931,1108,1118,1232,1256,1314,1495,1522,1609,1897,1932,1974,2155,2287,2515,2831,3082,4281,4325,4517,4788,5674,5696,7335,7

{"value":"The hysterical thing about this movie is that, according to the director, it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them that viewed it couldn't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst. The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable.<br /><br />Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone \"Godspeed\" this makes it a \"Christian\" movie? One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the \"Land of Plenty\" with all of its material excess, the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse. Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe? Plenty of useless homeless missions? How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets? As a pill-popping delusional survivor of agent \"pink\" are we to think America is a \"Land of Plenty\" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients? Certainly we don't have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film. Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the \"Continent of Plenty\" when it comes to sophistication.<br /><br />Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the \"Land of Plenty\" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur acting and dispassionately directed films. Life is too short and one, even an American, doesn't have \"plenty\" of time to waste watching this piece.","finished_norm":["the","hyster","thing","about","thi","movi","be","that","accord","to","the","director","it","have","difficulti","find","a","distributor","in","the","u","becaus","much","of","them","that","view","it","can","not","reconcil","the","seemingli","conflict","messag","of","christian","and","american","angst","the","think","of","anyon","see","thi","a","a","religi","film","in","anywai","be","laughablebr","br","becaus","a","minist","at","a","mission","prai","with","the","homeless","or","wish","someon","godsp","thi","make","it","a","christian","movi","on","can","interpret","that","it","be","actual","mock","religion","for","in","the","land","of","plenti","with","all","of","it","materi","excess","the","well","a","organ","mission","can","do","be","hand","out","a","bowl","of","soup","and","a","bibl","vers","plenti","of","unfortun","or","downtrodden","mayb","plenti","of","useless","homeless","mission","how","about","plenti","of","psycho","vietnam","vet","a","a","pillpop","delusion","survivor","of","agent","pink","be","we","to","think","america","be","a","land","of","plenti","of","paranoid","patriot","mayb","we","have","plenti","of","psychiatr","patient","certainli","we","do","not","have","plenti","of","peopl","concern","about","palestin","polit","base","on","the","main","charact","phone","convers","in","the","film","of","cours","if","you","work","in","a","german","homeless","shelter","the","unfortun","there","would","be","much","much","concern","about","peac","in","a","distant","land","than","their","own","person","surviv","a","the","world","know","how","europ","be","the","contin","of","plenti","when","it","come","to","sophisticationbr","br","ind","i","agre","with","the","titl","in","the","end","a","the","unit","state","be","the","land","of","plenti","and","in","thi","particular","case","it","refer","to","the","abund","of","poor","script","amateur","act","and","dispassion","direct","film","life","be","too","short","and","on","even","a","american","doe","not","have","plenti","of","time","to","wast","watch","thi","piec"],"filtered":["hyster","thing","thi","movi","accord","director","difficulti","find","distributor","u","becaus","much","view","reconcil","seemingli","conflict","messag","christian","american","angst","think","anyon","see","thi","religi","film","anywai","laughablebr","br","becaus","minist","mission","prai","homeless","wish","someon","godsp","thi","make","christian","movi","interpret","actual","mock","religion","land","plenti","materi","excess","well","organ","mission","hand","bowl","soup","bibl","vers","plenti","unfortun","downtrodden","mayb","plenti","useless","homeless","mission","plenti","psycho","vietnam","vet","pillpop","delusion","survivor","agent","pink","think","america","land","plenti","paranoid","patriot","mayb","plenti","psychiatr","patient","certainli","plenti","peopl","concern","palestin","polit","base","main","charact","phone","convers","film","cours","work","german","homeless","shelter","unfortun","much","much","concern","peac","distant","land","person","surviv","world","know","europ","contin","plenti","come","sophisticationbr","br","ind","agre","titl","end","unit","state","land","plenti","thi","particular","case","refer","abund","poor","script","amateur","act","dispassion","direct","film","life","short","even","american","doe","plenti","time","wast","watch","thi","piec"],"filtered2":["hyster","thing","accord","director","difficulti","find","distributor","u","becaus","view","reconcil","seemingli","conflict","messag","christian","american","angst","think","anyon","see","religi","anywai","laughablebr","becaus","minist","mission","prai","homeless","wish","someon","godsp","make","christian","interpret","actual","mock","religion","land","plenti","materi","excess","well","organ","mission","hand","bowl","soup","bibl","vers","plenti","unfortun","downtrodden","mayb","plenti","useless","homeless","mission","plenti","psycho","vietnam","vet","pillpop","delusion","survivor","agent","pink","think","america","land","plenti","paranoid","patriot","mayb","plenti","psychiatr","patient","certainli","plenti","peopl","concern","palestin","polit","base","main","charact","phone","convers","cours","work","german","homeless","shelter","unfortun","concern","peac","distant","land","person","surviv","world","know","europ","contin","plenti","come","sophisticationbr","ind","agre","titl","end","unit","state","land","plenti","particular","case","refer","abund","poor","script","amateur","act","dispassion","direct","life","short","even","american","doe","plenti","time","wast","watch","piec"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,8,10,12,18,20,21,22,23,24,26,29,34,38,48,52,58,75,77,89,102,112,139,146,153,158,163,165,179,199,218,223,227,235,264,272,288,312,334,386,389,399,498,537,569,575,622,684,715,809,829,832,870,874,885,887,925,983,1069,1158,1207,1305,1317,1331,1379,1471,1481,1599,1633,1725,1906,1915,1953,1961,2051,2075,2101,2122,2159,2422,2493,2705,2713,3183,3438,3676,3760,3798,4089,4146,4227

{"value":"The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease is established right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young Maxwell Caulfield who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St. John's foreign speech pattern is not explained, it's explained here Caulfield is her cousin. What's Conn still doing in school, I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now she's a beautician.<br /><br />Caulfield's a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed have him labeled as a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girl friend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it.<br /><br />That's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act. He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted.<br /><br />Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed. If you saw the first Grease film, a much better film, than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.<br /><br />In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles. The music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.<br /><br />It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not all that great.","finished_norm":["the","tenuou","connect","between","thi","film","and","the","greas","be","establish","right","at","the","begin","of","the","film","when","didi","conn","on","of","four","cast","member","repeat","their","role","approach","young","maxwel","caulfield","who","be","a","british","exchang","student","although","in","the","previou","film","olivia","newton","st","john","foreign","speech","pattern","be","not","explain","it","explain","here","caulfield","be","her","cousin","what","conn","still","do","in","school","i","guess","she","just","like","hang","around","rydel","high","even","though","now","she","a","beauticianbr","br","caulfield","a","smart","kid","so","of","cours","the","hood","typ","lead","by","adrian","zmed","have","him","label","a","a","nerd","and","that","especi","bad","when","zmed","girl","friend","decid","she","like","caulfield","but","be","a","nerd","just","be","not","go","to","cut","itbr","br","that","when","caulfield","decid","to","put","on","a","modern","dai","zorro","act","he","get","a","junk","bicycl","and","put","it","back","togeth","and","teach","himself","to","ride","he","get","himself","a","leather","biker","outfit","with","a","set","of","goggl","to","hide","hi","face","if","get","michel","pheiffer","be","not","in","the","card","caulfield","wo","not","have","ani","troubl","make","friend","at","ani","gai","male","leather","bar","the","wai","he","outfittedbr","br","greas","introduc","michel","pheiffer","and","maxwel","caulfield","and","start","them","on","the","success","career","path","both","have","enjoi","if","you","see","the","greas","film","a","much","well","film","than","you","definit","have","a","idea","how","thi","film","will","turn","outbr","br","in","addit","to","conn","ev","arden","sid","caesar","and","dodi","goodman","all","faculti","member","from","the","origin","greas","return","in","their","role","the","music","score","be","not","remot","a","good","a","the","song","that","come","from","the","originalbr","br","it","not","that","greas","be","bad","it","just","not","all","that","great"],"filtered":["tenuou","connect","thi","film","greas","establish","right","begin","film","didi","conn","four","cast","member","repeat","role","approach","young","maxwel","caulfield","british","exchang","student","although","previou","film","olivia","newton","st","john","foreign","speech","pattern","explain","explain","caulfield","cousin","conn","still","school","guess","like","hang","around","rydel","high","even","though","beauticianbr","br","caulfield","smart","kid","cours","hood","typ","lead","adrian","zmed","label","nerd","especi","bad","zmed","girl","friend","decid","like","caulfield","nerd","go","cut","itbr","br","caulfield","decid","put","modern","dai","zorro","act","get","junk","bicycl","put","back","togeth","teach","ride","get","leather","biker","outfit","set","goggl","hide","hi","face","get","michel","pheiffer","card","caulfield","wo","ani","troubl","make","friend","ani","gai","male","leather","bar","wai","outfittedbr","br","greas","introduc","michel","pheiffer","maxwel","caulfield","start","success","career","path","enjoi","see","greas","film","much","well","film","definit","idea","thi","film","turn","outbr","br","addit","conn","ev","arden","sid","caesar","dodi","goodman","faculti","member","origin","greas","return","role","music","score","remot","good","song","come","originalbr","br","greas","bad","great"],"filtered2":["tenuou","connect","greas","establish","right","begin","didi","conn","four","cast","member","repeat","role","approach","young","maxwel","caulfield","british","exchang","student","although","previou","olivia","newton","st","john","foreign","speech","pattern","explain","explain","caulfield","cousin","conn","still","school","guess","like","hang","around","rydel","high","even","though","beauticianbr","caulfield","smart","kid","cours","hood","typ","lead","adrian","zmed","label","nerd","especi","bad","zmed","girl","friend","decid","like","caulfield","nerd","go","cut","itbr","caulfield","decid","put","modern","dai","zorro","act","get","junk","bicycl","put","back","togeth","teach","ride","get","leather","biker","outfit","set","goggl","hide","face","get","michel","pheiffer","card","caulfield","wo","ani","troubl","make","friend","ani","gai","male","leather","bar","wai","outfittedbr","greas","introduc","michel","pheiffer","maxwel","caulfield","start","success","career","path","enjoi","see","greas","well","definit","idea","turn","outbr","addit","conn","ev","arden","sid","caesar","dodi","goodman","faculti","member","origin","greas","return","role","music","score","remot","good","song","come","originalbr","greas","bad","great"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9,20,21,27,33,34,51,63,64,69,71,84,86,92,96,98,109,114,118,121,123,128,132,135,147,157,159,161,199,200,211,237,243,249,251,267,270,291,296,303,328,384,392,395,406,431,488,511,518,532,606,618,626,640,649,696,707,729,752,767,784,848,883,929,988,1002,1070,1079,1111,1119,1127,1185,1482,1524,

{"value":"For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion . Someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world`s oceans are awash with giant Squids , killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk . A man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell . Then when a major Hollywood company produces a big budget FX laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon , the fact that they don`t have the budget to pull it off doesn`t stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point . What struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks . Everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like \" Oh my gawd it`s heading this way \" and \" Run for your lives \" then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget . Unfortunately NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been upped to include better actors . The cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven . Where`s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them ?<br /><br />And the last word on this being a TWISTER clone ..... Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding

{"value":"\"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies\" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless \"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\" The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. The only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. But their glamorous displays are, alas, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T&A needs a credible story to surround it, and there's none in sight.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. Maybe all will end happily after all. But alas, this movie heads straight for the toilet, with no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind.<br /><br />Before \"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,\" I thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn out.

{"value":"Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why.<br /><br />It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones I have.<br /><br />I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen worse films, but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom--poor script, poor acting, bad lighting, and cheesy special effects.<br /><br />The storyline, which never completely makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy, and little girl--that I assume the viewer is supposed to be \"identifying\" with, all three of them were tedious and annoying. You just want the dark side to get every one of them.<br /><br />Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the \"mysterious\" Orient. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as \"The Darkling\". <br /><br />During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />The Darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.<br /><br />And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long, tedious movie.<br /><br

{"value":"Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. What makes him the \"rational\" person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing.

{"value":"This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. \"A Secret Affair\" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's earlier books turned into film.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","typic","steel","novel","product","in","that","two","peopl","who","have","undergo","some","sort","of","tragedi","manag","to","get","togeth","despit","the","odd","i","would","not","call","thi","a","spoiler","becaus","anyon","who","have","read","a","steel","novel","know","how","thei","all","end","if","you","do","not","want","to","know","much","about","the","plot","do","not","keep","readingbr","br","gilbert","charact","ophelia","be","a","woman","of","french","decent","who","have","lose","her","husband","and","son","in","a","accid","gilbert","ne","to","stop","do","film","where","she","be","requir","to","have","a","accent","becaus","she","otherwis","a","good","actress","cannot","realist","pull","off","ani","kind","of","accent","brad","johnson","conjur","a","excel","actor","be","matt","who","be","recov","from","a","rather","nasti","divorc","he","be","gentl","convinc","and","compel","in","thi","rolebr","br","the","two","meet","on","the","beach","through","her","daughter","pip","and","initi","ophelia","accus","matt","of","be","a","child","molest","just","becaus","he","talk","art","with","the","kid","all","of","them","becom","friend","after","thi","episod","and","then","the","coupl","fall","in","lovebr","br","the","chemistri","between","the","two","lead","be","not","great","even","though","the","talent","of","thi","two","peopl","be","not","in","my","opinion","a","question","thei","do","the","well","thei","can","with","a","predict","plot","and","a","script","that","border","on","stereotyp","two","peopl","meet","tragedi","big","tragedi","a","secret","be","reveal","anoth","tragedi","and","then","thei","get","togeth","i","wish","there","be","much","to","it","than","that","but","there","it","be","in","a","nutshellbr","br","i","want","mindless","entertain","and","i","get","it","with","thi","in","regard","to","the","genr","of","romant","film","thi","on","fail","to","be","memor","a","secret","affair","with","janin","turner","be","far","superior","not","a","steel","book","a","be","some","of","steel","earli","book","turn","into","film"],"filtered":["thi","typic","steel","novel","product","two","peopl","undergo","sort","tragedi","manag","get","togeth","despit","odd","call","thi","spoiler","becaus","anyon","read","steel","novel","know","thei","end","want","know","much","plot","keep","readingbr","br","gilbert","charact","ophelia","woman","french","decent","lose","husband","son","accid","gilbert","ne","stop","film","requir","accent","becaus","otherwis","good","actress","realist","pull","ani","kind","accent","brad","johnson","conjur","excel","actor","matt","recov","rather","nasti","divorc","gentl","convinc","compel","thi","rolebr","br","two","meet","beach","daughter","pip","initi","ophelia","accus","matt","child","molest","becaus","talk","art","kid","becom","friend","thi","episod","coupl","fall","lovebr","br","chemistri","two","lead","great","even","though","talent","thi","two","peopl","opinion","question","thei","well","thei","predict","plot","script","border","stereotyp","two","peopl","meet","tragedi","big","tragedi","secret","reveal","anoth","tragedi","thei","get","togeth","wish","much","nutshellbr","br","want","mindless","entertain","get","thi","regard","genr","romant","film","thi","fail","memor","secret","affair","janin","turner","far","superior","steel","book","steel","earli","book","turn","film"],"filtered2":["typic","steel","novel","product","two","peopl","undergo","sort","tragedi","manag","get","togeth","despit","odd","call","spoiler","becaus","anyon","read","steel","novel","know","end","want","know","plot","keep","readingbr","gilbert","charact","ophelia","woman","french","decent","lose","husband","son","accid","gilbert","ne","stop","requir","accent","becaus","otherwis","good","actress","realist","pull","ani","kind","accent","brad","johnson","conjur","excel","actor","matt","recov","rather","nasti","divorc","gentl","convinc","compel","rolebr","two","meet","beach","daughter","pip","initi","ophelia","accus","matt","child","molest","becaus","talk","art","kid","becom","friend","coupl","fall","lovebr","chemistri","two","lead","great","even","though","talent","two","peopl","opinion","question","well","predict","plot","script","border","stereotyp","two","peopl","meet","tragedi","big","tragedi","secret","reveal","anoth","tragedi","get","togeth","wish","nutshellbr","want","mindless","entertain","get","regard","genr","romant","fail","memor","secret","affair","janin","turner","far","superior","steel","book","steel","earli","book","turn"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,10,20,22,23,24,26,27,32,37,39,41,47,51,70,73,77,82,86,96,101,110,114,115,122,134,142,145,151,157,158,160,161,170,180,186,190,195,215,221,253,266,269,270,276,309,315,337,345,350,354,378,382,391,399,408,426,434,467,474,478,490,536,538,544,559,580,604,613,627,768,798,833,864,899,958,989,1019,1052,1074,1132,1201,1226,1254,1325,1642,1817,1874,1880,2053,2144,2188,2708,2785,3035,3308,3424,4189,4887,5001,5162,5401,7221],

{"value":"This inferior sequel based by the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard(also producer) concern on a matrimony named Gene(Michael Woods) and Karen York(Faye Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from a convent. Gene York about re-elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen. She creates wreak havoc when goes a metaphysical fair, as stores of numerology, therapy, counselling heal,yoga, tarots, among others are destroyed. Karen York hires an eye private(Michael Lerner) to investigate the weird and bizarre events.<br /><br />This TV sequel displays thrills, chills, creepy events and gory killing. Delia such as Damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film, happening horrible killings . The chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects. Furthermore, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, however nice cast secondary, such as Michael Lerner,Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S Davis, he was an Army captain turned into acting. As always , excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The movie is exclusively for hardcore followers Omen saga. The motion picture is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard.

{"value":"Unspeakably discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie whodunit spoof with one big, big problem: it's deadly unfunny. Besides the single-digit I.Q. plot and dialog, the most amazing aspect of \"Lady...\" is the berserk casting. Gene Wilder (star AND co-writer) tries hard at it all: he plays a romantic lead (with his looks!! and his age!! he and Woody Allen should start a club for clueless, mirrorless ageing comedians), and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart, and tries to sing and dance, and succeeds in NONE!! A looong shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks.<br /><br />For a while I thought I was having a myopia fit, because everybody in the movie keeps saying Cherry Jones is this pretty hot chick, and that Michael Cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion!! The guy who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies!! Mike Starr's over-the-top acting as the most incompetent, phoniest cop you EVER saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history. The saddest note is to see wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted. At least I hope both stars payed their bills back home (and subsequently fired their agents) with this flop.

{"value":"I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.<br /><br />What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. <br /><br />When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it

{"value":"The subject this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut (ad)venture is quite an age-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance (pun intended).<br /><br />However, the exploration (and exploitation for Desi auds) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to 'pepper, spice and sugar' up the usual masala mix of b/g score, dialog, dance, drama, etc creates a nice-looking package with not much inside.<br /><br />In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repeats follow thru-out the movie (after all the lead character's a cook). But therein lies les problemos -- no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script.<br /><br />Amitabh puts in a Cheeni Jyada (more) amount of over-acting. Really when is this guy ever gonna stop?? How many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something??? Timeless mind yes, but surely what about the not-so-ageless bod? And sole? Sorry, soul?! Reasonably good acting by Paresh Rawal who has the only sensible role in the film. The director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery of a hot new idea. Nowhere are we presented with any real-life problems or issues such a pair might face, other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle. The sub-plot of a little kid with cancer (the bachelor boy's first love) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl's character.<br /><br />Anyway, nice try but not quite there

{"value":"I am a huge fan of Ted V Mikels and the original \"Corpse Grinders\" is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay (\"Desperate Living\") could not save this worthless piece of garbage. This film should serve as a lesson to all past, present and future film makers...when you have a film as successful as the original \"Corpse Grinders\" was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later (unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with \"Blood Feast 2: All U can Eat\") Even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for god's sake...NEVER film a movie onto video...why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous...I personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that's even worth the powder to blow it to hell...if you can't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can...and what was Ted V Mikels thinking about (or smoking) when he wrote this god-awful script? I mean come on, dog and cat \"aliens\" from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding up human bodies...bones and clothes and all? If any of these actors, aside from Liz Renay, were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid!

{"value":"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like \"the killer will turn us into coleslaw.\" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.","finished_norm":["sweet","sixteen","minut","director","jim","soto","cast","bo","hopkin","susan","strasberg","aleisa","shirlei","patrick","macne","dana","kimmellbr","br","fifteen","year","old","bad","girl","melissa","be","new","in","a","desert","town","and","it","be","not","long","befor","folk","around","her","start","dye","off","the","detect","have","to","put","togeth","the","clue","with","the","help","of","hi","nanci","draw","good","girl","daughter","plai","by","fridai","the","th","alumnu","dana","kimmel","the","local","nativ","american","be","prime","suspect","sinc","thei","seem","to","upset","the","prejudic","townsfolk","thi","event","all","lead","up","to","the","reveal","of","the","killer","at","melissa","birthdai","partybr","br","thi","below","averag","slasher","be","not","too","memor","it","have","a","make","for","tv","feel","without","much","score","besid","the","titl","charact","own","corni","theme","song","which","plai","a","coupl","time","throughout","line","like","the","killer","will","turn","u","into","coleslaw","fit","into","standard","eighti","slasher","screenplai","marci","call","melissa","a","bad","name","then","somehow","immedi","thei","develop","a","friendship","appar","marci","see","how","hard","it","be","to","fit","in","becaus","melissa","know","how","to","wear","makeup","thi","movi","would","be","hardpress","to","be","make","todai","with","the","main","charact","be","fifteen","and","the","director","insert","multipl","gratuit","closeup","of","her","the","social","commentari","on","indian","be","not","develop","enough","to","be","take","serious","i","be","too","surpris","at","the","fairli","high","rate","thi","movi","get","both","sweet","sixteen","and","ed","hunt","bloodi","birthdai","have","the","potenti","to","capit","on","that","time","honor","tradit","of","the","birthdai","parti","to","creat","a","intens","sequenc","of","carnag","but","i","feel","fail","to","deliv","but","on","the","bright","side","releas","obscur","movi","like","thi","on","dvd","give","hope","that","other","will","follow"],"filtered":["sweet","sixteen","minut","director","jim","soto","cast","bo","hopkin","susan","strasberg","aleisa","shirlei","patrick","macne","dana","kimmellbr","br","fifteen","year","old","bad","girl","melissa","new","desert","town","long","befor","folk","around","start","dye","detect","put","togeth","clue","help","hi","nanci","draw","good","girl","daughter","plai","fridai","th","alumnu","dana","kimmel","local","nativ","american","prime","suspect","sinc","thei","seem","upset","prejudic","townsfolk","thi","event","lead","reveal","killer","melissa","birthdai","partybr","br","thi","averag","slasher","memor","make","tv","feel","without","much","score","besid","titl","charact","corni","theme","song","plai","coupl","time","throughout","line","like","killer","turn","u","coleslaw","fit","standard","eighti","slasher","screenplai","marci","call","melissa","bad","name","somehow","immedi","thei","develop","friendship","appar","marci","see","hard","fit","becaus","melissa","know","wear","makeup","thi","movi","hardpress","make","todai","main","charact","fifteen","director","insert","multipl","gratuit","closeup","social","commentari","indian","develop","enough","take","serious","surpris","fairli","high","rate","thi","movi","get","sweet","sixteen","ed","hunt","bloodi","birthdai","potenti","capit","time","honor","tradit","birthdai","parti","creat","intens","sequenc","carnag","feel","fail","deliv","bright","side","releas","obscur","movi","like","thi","dvd","give","hope","follow"],"filtered2":["sweet","sixteen","minut","director","jim","soto","cast","bo","hopkin","susan","strasberg","aleisa","shirlei","patrick","macne","dana","kimmellbr","fifteen","year","old","bad","girl","melissa","new","desert","town","long","befor","folk","around","start","dye","detect","put","togeth","clue","help","nanci","draw","good","girl","daughter","plai","fridai","th","alumnu","dana","kimmel","local","nativ","american","prime","suspect","sinc","seem","upset","prejudic","townsfolk","event","lead","reveal","killer","melissa","birthdai","partybr","averag","slasher","memor","make","tv","feel","without","score","besid","titl","charact","corni","theme","song","plai","coupl","time","throughout","line","like","killer","turn","u","coleslaw","fit","standard","eighti","slasher","screenplai","marci","call","melissa","bad","name","somehow","immedi","develop","friendship","appar","marci","see","hard","fit","becaus","melissa","know","wear","makeup","hardpress","make","todai","main","charact","fifteen","director","insert","multipl","gratuit","closeup","social","commentari","indian","develop","enough","take","serious","surpris","fairli","high","rate","get","sweet","sixteen","ed","hunt","bloodi","birthdai","potenti","capit","time","honor","tradit","birthdai","parti","creat","intens","sequenc","carnag","feel","fail","deliv","bright","side","releas","obscur","like","dvd","give","hope","follow"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,8,9

{"value":"In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life. The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small, and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. That said, \"Casanova\" left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski: <br /><br />\"Casanova died too, just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all. to say that he lived well is true; to say I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true. the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find; that is why the human race stands where it does today: we have bred the clever and lasting Casanovas, all hollow inside, like the Easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children.\" <br /><br />As far as I could make it out, this is the position Fellini takes regarding his subject; granted, with more empathy, but disgusted nonetheless.<br /><br />Casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior, themes Fellini dealt with more pointedly in \"Satyricon\". The succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn, just without the coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction.<br /><br />Yet, there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini couldn't. More than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro, for sure, but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else. I find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film.

{"value":"I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is among the worst directors of all time--right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of awfulness. However, I was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad, it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies. Because of that, this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans.<br /><br />Now I was wary about watching this film, as the title \"Naughty Stewardesses\" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something I wouldn't be reviewing on IMDb. However, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. But, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion.<br /><br />Sadly, none of the many parts are even good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Sure, for a 71 year-old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good--but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inappropriate.<br /><br />Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like \"Naughty

{"value":"Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing-games of all time. I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen, trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in. Now, mind you - I am weary of \"computer-game-generated\" movies. I don't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, although some are entertaining enough to be watchable. And yet, I am such a big fan of the game that I couldn't resist. My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's, it would be OK. <br /><br />Man, those were 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that I'll never get back. If I had that chance, I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead. This isn't even in the \"so bad it's funny\" category. You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene, - which I totally understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body on press conferences.<br /><br />There is no plot to speak of. Won't waste your time pitching it to you. The credibility of the story sinks below 'I did not have sex with Ms. Lewinski'. The acting is but a few notches above 'Street Fighter', which, by the way, being one of the worst movies I've seen, I would recommend OVER this one.<br /><br />Kids, I recommend the Video Game. It has far better story, acting and much more thrills. As for the movie, here's a spoiler - it STINKS!

{"value":"Christ, oh Christ... One watches stunned, incredulous, and possibly deranged, as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist, or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company, sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of films, and a lot of bad films, but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering, snivelling wreck, tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog, clawing at the walls, howling till my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately, frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made, I don't know), and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Weeping Jesus, the memories... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable, when I'm least able to handle them. I shudder, I break down in tears, I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood, but I can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell of a man.<br /><br />The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal, or at least have not been left traumatised by it. Perhaps they're part of the operation. God damn them, the maniacs!

{"value":"Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror. The result, \"Dead Above Ground\", is an abysmal piece of junk. Now, had I noticed his name in association with THIS particular film I'd have put it back but no, I didn't have my glasses on and therefore I missed it, damn, I really do need to bring those with me while video shopping. First question would be, who the heck is the target audience for this? It's almost like a \"scary\" kids movie, but then again there's topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with farm implements of SOME kind. Seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a child-murdering witch that collected children's teeth lived there. Probably something the real estate agent failed to mention. Of course now in the modern day there's a little girls ghost around to warn the real-live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen. It does, and there's also two Bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they're out for revenge too. This whole thing has the feel of some made-for-cable junk that's for the kids at Halloween except for, of course, the things that aren't suitable for little kids, so not only is this mediocre, it's confused, too. A big boo and hiss to Anchor Bay for putting this out too, considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low. The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get \"The Tooth Fairy\".

{"value":"Ahh this film had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors, the thighs of Jessica Simpson and... that is about it!<br /><br />I believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea. Basically, lets do a kind of Legally Blond film, but do it in New York. That big bright city of chances, power and money and where everyone is a heartless, power/money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, small town bimbo, that brother of Owen Wilson and for some no apparent reason Andy Dick (only because of him you should ignore this film).<br /><br />Basic story line:<br /><br />Boy leaves girl for NY, girl follows, boy cheats, girl stays in NY with cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, is courted by other boy (Brother Wilson) and together save the day and kiss.<br /><br />a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film, i.e. dire, awful, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic<br /><br />Just don't watch this film, you will be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him. This film induces shock. And I know what you are thinking... at least at some point will I see Simpson naked or close too. It's not gonna happen, spare yourself the time and YouTube her. You will have better sexy time!<br /><br />The films editing is flimsy, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens?<br /><br />In conclusion; this is cinematic treason which should be
