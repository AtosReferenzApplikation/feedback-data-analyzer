{"value":"This is the kind of movie that my enemies content I watch all the time, but it's not bloody true.

(That, at least, is an improvement over having Boeing hijack a good part of the Pentagon.) The airplane goes down in the Bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms, a kind of post-facto submarine.<br /><br />It has one of those all-star casts, the stars either falling or barely above the horizon.<br /><br />\"We're on our own!\", says pilot Jack Lemon.

{"value":"Watch the Original with the same title from 1944! This made for TV movie, is just god-awful! Although it does use (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialog, it just doesn't work! Is it the acting, the poor directing? OK so it's made for TV, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? Especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much, as if you've watched it first! <br /><br />There are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but all are for the worse! The actors playing the parts here, just don't fit the bill! You just don't believe them and who could top Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original? If you want, only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave, if you watch it through!

{"value":"...for the Lt to have chosen this one. First, the film wasn't horrible, it was just Hollywood. Worst case I-need-this-to-happen-or-we-have-no-movie scenario: if Willis' mission was to save the doctor, but she was adamant that her \"people\" make it out of the missionary, he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her. He would not have compromised his package for the refugees. That's not how it works. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have drama. This is why we make movies, because reality isn't quite so complicated. However, I did think that Willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry. That said, there are also some well done battle scenes in the film. It's not a waste of time, \"Tears of the Sun\" is worth the dvd rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day and you'll be satisfied.","finished_norm":["for","the","lt","to","have","choos","thi","on","the","film","be","not","horribl","it","be","just","hollywood","wrong","case","ineedthistohappenorwehavenomovi","scenario","if","willi","mission","be","to","save","the","doctor","but","she","be","adam","that","her","peopl","make","it","out","of","the","missionari","he","would","have","put","her","on","that","chopper","and","march","that","refuge","to","the","border","without","her","he","would","not","have","compromis","hi","packag","for","the","refuge","that","not","how","it","work","but","a","i","point","out","thi","be","hollywood","we","must","have","drama","thi","be","why","we","make","movi","becaus","realiti","be","not","quit","so","complic","howev","i","do","think","that","willi","and","the","good","doctor","have","workabl","chemistri","that","sai","there","be","conjur","some","good","do","battl","scene","in","the","film","it","not","a","wast","of","time","tear","of","the","sun","be","worth","the","dvd","rental","fee","check","it","out","on","a","raini","dai","and","you","will","be","satisfi"],"filtered":["lt","choos","thi","film","horribl","hollywood","wrong","case","ineedthistohappenorwehavenomovi","scenario","willi","mission","save","doctor","adam","peopl","make","missionari","put","chopper","march","refuge","border","without","compromis","hi","packag","refuge","work","point","thi","hollywood","must","drama","thi","make","movi","becaus","realiti","quit","complic","howev","think","willi","good","doctor","workabl","chemistri","sai","conjur","good","battl","scene","film","wast","time","tear","sun","worth","dvd","rental","fee","check","raini","dai","satisfi"],"filtered2":["lt","choos","horribl","hollywood","wrong","case","ineedthistohappenorwehavenomovi","scenario","willi","mission","save","doctor","adam","peopl","make","missionari","put","chopper","march","refuge","border","without","compromis","packag","refuge","work","point","hollywood","must","drama","make","becaus","realiti","quit","complic","howev","think","willi","good","doctor","workabl","chemistri","conjur","good","battl","scene","wast","time","tear","sun","worth","dvd","rental","fee","check","raini","dai","satisfi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,12,19,22,23,25,39,48,66,89,113,120,125,132,141,159,189,219,230,247,288,300,463,505,584,656,692,786,1120,1132,1248,1505,1569,1643,1685,2101,2185,2254,2529,2733,2783,2996,4335,5617,6511,6526,6617],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,12,19,22,23,25,39,48,66,89,113,120,125,132,141,159,189,219,230,247,288,300,463,505,584,656,692,786,1120,1132,1248,1505,1569,1643,1685,2101,2185,2254,2529,2733,2783,2996,4335,5617,6511,6526,6617],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.357228929984541,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.5538940054862738,1.6955116224012472,1.929723173391612,1.9940046109572438,2.1521782565202803,2.2044500422972613,2.2242236634876535,2.253494045787767,2.2657547357741192,2.300267965194495,2.498193474075453,2.5792094178355414,2.7121382192999195,2.7303758068497004,2.8015621426949333,5.864548499100348,3.3467891931782563,3.41740676039221,3.5146700658174166,3.68099128126493,7.692630523380627,3.900174431363043,4.186539847930077,4.218628162481577,4.637773374493822,4.535724120139652,4.597282013139085,4.770124825978496,4.662879295624898,4.9676558014359795,5.089758498236879,5.274680836730892,5.3064295350454715,5.339219357868463,10.964640403018272,5.482320201509136,5.9370563586240825,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026,13.321950395701563]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780537E-4,2.1925531043720615E-4,2.193094462670605E-4,2.1926535805328207E-4,2.1928610891855615E-4,2.1925410152956982E-4,2.1932229259911867E-4,2.1922148009526665E-4,2.1925535677457458E-4,2.19481933427208E-4,2.2122345868647725E-4,2.192557189277261E-4,2.1946336794909422E-4,2.1948623224568876E-4,2.1938652538130784E-4,2.192662217077921E-4,2.193416577681341E-4,2.1944488069798197E-4,2.1927754147741077E-4,2.1927673977696315E-4,2.1947401253786478E-4,2.1929870906764123E-4,2.1929904095723237E-4,2.1943952627086755E-4,2.1927762057634143E-4,2.1948885564790875E-4,2.1933249395190844E-4,2.1925481904056093E-4,2.1935421980567526E-4,2.1942116987548035E-4,2.1929978476330192E-4,2.1941723695242712E-4,2.1952496533805894E-4,2.1972871854514237E-4,2.1933211493919258E-4,2.1926608871935272E-4,2.1934514652716502E-4,2.192883572382646E-4,2.1922171407356029E-4,2.1927747357072453E-4,2.1949722707154427E-4,2.1937681902578203E-4,2.1941773696650542E-4,2.1923262471379987E-4,2.1927752932743115E-4,2.1926600626693158E-4,2.193402258220397E-4,2.1937825969134978E-4,2.1933365036190102E-4,2.1929888559081107E-4,2.192665484949165E-4,2.19715790044447E-4,2.193217222746471

There's the licker a guy who licks everything, a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways...offbeat in the extreme, this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color. The monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time-not always- but enough for it not to be fun.(Though I didn't see the cleansing coming). Worth a shot if you've nothing else to watch and you're waiting for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix.","finished_norm":["the","strang","peopl","live","in","a","town","go","about","their","live","there","the","licker","a","gui","who","lick","everyth","a","dumpster","diver","that","find","a","bodi","which","he","take","home","to","live","with","him","a","crazi","girl","with","a","doll","dress","like","her","a","gui","who","want","to","cleans","girl","of","their","wick","waysoffbeat","in","the","extrem","thi","shoot","in","black","and","white","movi","be","well","with","out","the","color","the","monochrom","take","the","edg","off","the","two","step","up","from","home","movi","feel","like","a","troma","movi","thi","movi","be","fun","in","fit","and","start","but","mostli","it","weird","for","weird","sake","and","soon","becom","a","crash","bear","sinc","on","you","see","the","set","up","you","can","kind","of","guess","where","it","go","a","lot","of","the","timenot","alwai","but","enough","for","it","not","to","be","funthough","i","do","not","see","the","cleans","come","worth","a","shoot","if","you","have","noth","els","to","watch","and","you","re","wait","for","the","next","set","of","golden","girl","to","come","from","netflix"],"filtered":["strang","peopl","live","town","go","live","licker","gui","lick","everyth","dumpster","diver","find","bodi","take","home","live","crazi","girl","doll","dress","like","gui","want","cleans","girl","wick","waysoffbeat","extrem","thi","shoot","black","white","movi","well","color","monochrom","take","edg","two","step","home","movi","feel","like","troma","movi","thi","movi","fun","fit","start","mostli","weird","weird","sake","soon","becom","crash","bear","sinc","see","set","kind","guess","go","lot","timenot","alwai","enough","funthough","see","cleans","come","worth","shoot","noth","els","watch","re","wait","next","set","golden","girl","come","netflix"],"filtered2":["strang","peopl","live","town","go","live","licker","gui","lick","everyth","dumpster","diver","find","bodi","take","home","live","crazi","girl","doll","dress","like","gui","want","cleans","girl","wick","waysoffbeat","extrem","shoot","black","white","well","color","monochrom","take","edg","two","step","home","feel","like","troma","fun","fit","start","mostli","weird","weird","sake","soon","becom","crash","bear","sinc","see","set","kind","guess","go","lot","timenot","alwai","enough","funthough","see","cleans","come","worth","shoot","noth","els","watch","re","wait","next","set","golden","girl","come","netflix"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,20,23,31,34,37,38,43,47,49,55,68,71,72,84,93,109,115,116,117,122,162,193,196,197,219,229,243,259,297,302,329,331,359,376,417,449,450,510,525,625,676,712,873,875,1060,1183,1270,1552,1757,2261,3246,3781,4254,4810,7329,7787],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,20,23,31,34,37,38,43,47,49,55,68,71,72,84,93,109,115,116,117,122,162,193,196,197,219,229,243,259,297,302,329,331,359,376,417,449,450,510,525,625,676,712,873,875,1060,1183,1270,1552,1757,2261,3246,3781,4254,4810,7329,7787],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,2.814133962290301,2.7965700178917925,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,3.9073995778510735,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,6.6638083547706675,2.035389827120098,4.251382278653714,2.201553588425805,6.739988699036795,4.5594602370234405,2.2489347673732487,2.3586007221245198,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.5792094178355414,2.8432628718938773,2.627841366673578,2.7464553122240485,2.813490713560207,5.805372584729356,2.951986790814132,2.932274249550174,3.2189558216683714,3.1569204307489187,3.1932880749197934,3.2597778161886266,3.469984576472117,3.374440724508766,3.4149707055943286,7.238866776530993,3.6105180246075443,3.7165362186843414,3.892300374932137,3.9282323841582003,4.160564361526816,4.315570107673808,4.3521595551061,4.597282013139085,4.944927550358424,5.089758498236879,5.583416318380505,5.999576715605417,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,7.0356686472921925,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6168948300964646E-4,1.6154620178448822E-4,1.6158608878962387E-4,1.6155360481710267E-4,1.6156889394949397E-4,1.6154531106746722E-4,1.615955539019932E-4,1.615212757599623E-4,1.6154623592562652E-4,1.6171317645524464E-4,1.6299632344213264E-4,1.6154650275823355E-4,1.616994975050399E-4,1.6171634380291955E-4,1.616428802904488E-4,1.615542411533696E-4,1.616098220604023E-4,1.6168587619209352E-4,1.6156258150226845E-4,1.6156199081344077E-4,1.6170734038411093E-4,1.6157817767549612E-4,1.615784222100652E-4,1.6168193107732597E-4,1.6156263978195977E-4,1.617182767123827E-4,1.616030702070394E-4,1.6154

{"value":"This is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, pointless piece of trash I've ever seen, an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. If you think that Ed Wood's \"Plan 9\" is bad, well... let me tell you, looks like \"Citizen Kane\" compared to that one. ¿Special effects?...again, \"Plan 9\" is \"Star Wars\". ¿Acting?...Thor Johnson is Al Pacino... so it's beyond bad, really. But if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies, it's for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with \"Star Creatures\" they descend right down to the Z level. Of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an Indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy... if you can.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","wrong","brain","damag","ultra","cheap","super","stupid","silli","pointless","piec","of","trash","i","have","ever","see","a","unbeliev","garbag","of","instant","cult","statu","among","fan","of","the","bizarr","if","you","think","that","ed","wood","plan","be","bad","good","let","me","tell","you","look","like","citizen","kane","compar","to","that","on","special","effectsagain","plan","be","star","war","actingthor","johnson","be","al","pacino","so","it","beyond","bad","realli","but","if","you","be","look","for","that","kind","of","incred","movi","it","for","you","i","be","a","fan","of","american","intern","for","so","mani","gloriou","horror","movi","the","pricecormanpo","saga","and","some","great","blaxploit","stuff","but","with","star","creatur","thei","descend","right","down","to","the","z","level","of","cours","my","out","of","work","in","revers","if","you","like","to","watch","bad","movi","for","fun","the","gui","plai","a","indian","chief","be","great","so","have","fun","and","enjoi","if","you","can"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","brain","damag","ultra","cheap","super","stupid","silli","pointless","piec","trash","ever","see","unbeliev","garbag","instant","cult","statu","among","fan","bizarr","think","ed","wood","plan","bad","good","let","tell","look","like","citizen","kane","compar","special","effectsagain","plan","star","war","actingthor","johnson","al","pacino","beyond","bad","realli","look","kind","incred","movi","fan","american","intern","mani","gloriou","horror","movi","pricecormanpo","saga","great","blaxploit","stuff","star","creatur","thei","descend","right","z","level","cours","work","revers","like","watch","bad","movi","fun","gui","plai","indian","chief","great","fun","enjoi"],"filtered2":["wrong","brain","damag","ultra","cheap","super","stupid","silli","pointless","piec","trash","ever","see","unbeliev","garbag","instant","cult","statu","among","fan","bizarr","think","ed","wood","plan","bad","good","let","tell","look","like","citizen","kane","compar","special","effectsagain","plan","star","war","actingthor","johnson","al","pacino","beyond","bad","realli","look","kind","incred","fan","american","intern","mani","gloriou","horror","pricecormanpo","saga","great","blaxploit","stuff","star","creatur","descend","right","z","level","cours","work","revers","like","watch","bad","fun","gui","plai","indian","chief","great","fun","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,12,13,16,25,40,44,48,50,51,55,83,90,100,121,122,124,136,140,199,200,203,218,223,259,314,351,361,385,445,482,502,531,571,581,655,671,673,702,761,823,826,933,1025,1317,1342,1376,1381,1418,1690,1779,2092,2143,2298,2371,2672,2782,2833,4067,4192,4195,4315,5156,6628],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,12,13,16,25,40,44,48,50,51,55,83,90,100,121,122,124,136,140,199,200,203,218,223,259,314,351,361,385,445,482,502,531,571,581,655,671,673,702,761,823,826,933,1025,1317,1342,1376,1381,1418,1690,1779,2092,2143,2298,2371,2672,2782,2833,4067,4192,4195,4315,5156,6628],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,3.205071257016622,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.393227744058217,1.2796387880827016,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,3.4279798616619646,1.9536997889255368,2.292318797740072,2.0477128419653545,4.281092480635563,2.2190595059394194,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,2.346825985579986,4.634339551994196,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,2.5940874818617203,2.825563294794476,5.492910624448097,3.189397019426827,3.0135689919434205,3.0399731661399314,3.09496984188738,3.241201430615691,3.3154667220492153,3.3132665011396125,3.4272107604888307,3.467417180966871,7.061861173378394,3.7297814454343623,3.6466665387238555,3.7297814454343623,3.6466665387238555,3.9405024767500145,3.850067611308864,3.8204358137024927,4.091229668125752,4.436351646326448,4.646072177308517,4.484804029712395,4.535724120139652,4.449957298382227,4.550761997504193,4.74221603786142,4.8085911068062925,5.129498826886393,5.3064295350454715,5.521540914662417,5.089758498236879,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,5.373120909544144,5.967828017290836,5.9370563586240825,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.575428747215113E-4,1.5740326801559032E-4,1.57442132098375E-4,1.57410481193702E-4,1.5742537822858695E-4,1.5740240014145625E-4,1.574513544731669E-4,1.5737898123152684E-4,1.574033012811619E-4,1.575659605367549E-4,1.5881620057241956E-4,1.5740356127071222E-4,1.5755263239012278E-4,1.5756904665620227E-4,1.5749746715253667E-4,1.5741110121080462E-4,1.574652567174620

{"value":"I saw the MST3K version of \"Deathstalker III\" and loved the movie so much -- even \"unmystied\" -- that I decided to watch the entire series of \"Deathstalker\" films. I bought I and II and settled down for a laugh.<br /><br />Nothing about \"Deathstalker I\" was funny on any level and when the credits rolled I was embarrassed and regretful that I had bought it! Too much ugliness and nudity. I guess either \"DS 3\" was a much cleaner production or MST3K really edited a lot because I expected something similar, i.e. stupid and carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even at $6.99 it seemed a waste of money. I didn't even open \"DS 2\" as I will return it tomorrow. Now I'll probably just throw away this DVD as I can't return it and no one wants it -- including myself! So really, don't bother with this one.

{"value":"Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all.<br /><br />The film shows promise for Ustinov is released from prison for embezzling. He convinces Robert Morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for films.<br /><br />Morley sounds just as he did in 1938's \"Marie Antoinette.\" Perhaps, he needed to return to that genre.<br /><br />This film is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering Oscar performance in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.\"<br /><br />Ms. Smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb-red head, but by film's end, she is the brains of the outfit.

{"value":"The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as MST3k Commentary states it...\"Sanata has the dirt on every! Santa's Tentacles reach far and wide! There is no hiding from the Klaus Organization\")<br /><br />From telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. Its amazing that the CIA doesn't have Santa on the payroll. <br /><br />Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch...he is so useless.<br /><br />The cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous. Very low budget but so fun to watch. I recommend watching the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.<br /><br />You even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.<br /><br />I give this a 1 for production

{"value":"Wow, could have been such a good movie,Starts of with Brittany Daniels tied up, Im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back, but nothing, movie starts anew with the kid filming. This movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting. I mean the acting was mostly horrible.. Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could..Still it really ruin the movie for me.. The twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills.. The movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion.. All in all I have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for I was very disappointed.. By the way, were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff. Did I see the same movie..

{"value":"ba ba ba boring...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this stinker and a few others decent actors. You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie. The music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story. Even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated. All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue. I could go on and on on how this is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g.

{"value":"If you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie, then I highly recommend this one. If you aren't, stay away. This is an astonishingly cheap-looking movie, and at times you may find yourself wondering if it isn't just a prank someone is pulling on you. The most positive comment I can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was super-low-budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here.<br /><br />But this is as amateurish as it gets. Their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads. It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with that disclaimer you'll find yourself shaking your head at the awesome cheesiness of it all.

{"value":"If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, don't bother with Gawi. The film scarcely deserves mention alongside A-list work such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure, and Ju-On (or even such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). Those films brim with subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a decidedly non-Western take on what's frightening. Gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made American horror lousy for the past twenty-five years.<br /><br />The film tries to blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher flick, but it's a bad fit. One aesthetic is bound to smother the other; guess which? Having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot Ringu for an evil-child subplot, but the situation is hopeless.

{"value":"This movie is AWESOME. I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was alright, but i think it RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made a movie totally unlike those terrible Hollywood films, like the Matrix and STop or my Mom will Shoot. It could have been better, though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big talon that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy since that Domino Pizza claymation guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like those out-of-focus movies my dad made of my birthday when I turned 6. BUt it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated, but they all meet up in the end. It's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up. I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a sequel. But it needs more aliens.

{"value":"Despite its stereotypes, virtually 'no-name' cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).<br /><br />The cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn't help thinking, though, that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like. Maybe it's just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.<br /><br />While it's not a 'must see' or a great film

{"value":"In the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, I'd like to offer some advice (free of charge!), from a viewer's perspective. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it. If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead. DO NOT try to make both at the same time, it doesn't work. For example, having a goofy \"comic relief\" character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head just makes you look like you had NO IDEA what kind of movie you wanted to make. This one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture. A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble.

{"value":"As if the storyline wasn't depressing enough, this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher. Weird stuff. Then there's the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have? Just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly. He tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did, but it's really really so hard to empathize. Such sad and unusual self destruction. Was it supposed to be funny?

{"value":"I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. It moved very slowly and was just boring. If it had been on TV, it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation. If this is loosely based on the life of the director, why didn't he get someone to see that the writing itself was \"loose\". Then he directed it at a snail's pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie. The music soars, but for a different film, not this one....for soap opera saga possibly. There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl was speaking. I was not alone, because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom. Why can't Hollywood make better movies?

{"value":"Well, you'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish, bland, and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like. Set in Tunis, mom piddles around the flat, gets antsy, and decides, albeit reluctantly (she just can't help herself), to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking (they walk everywhere) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring, uneventful, low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits.

{"value":"It's hard to believe an \"action\" packed Jet Li movie could be so boring, but this was transcendant trash. The plot is an amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks. The martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent. <br /><br />It's a comic book story about a group of super-human soldiers who are to be killed because they're mentally unstable, one of their number (Li) who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian. The saved killers resurface with an Austin Powers quality plot to take over the world, and Li sheds his new life to save the world.<br /><br />The version I saw was dubbed, and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer-thin plot and comic-book 25 cent special effects.

{"value":"I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous.

{"value":"Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing (but then, I guess my expectations were sky-high). Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film.","finished_norm":["have","read","dure","mani","year","about","how","great","thi","film","be","how","it","establish","ruiz","among","the","french","critic","special","the","snobbish","cahier","crowd","when","i","final","watch","it","about","a","year","ago","i","find","it","pretti","disappoint","but","then","i","guess","my","expect","be","skyhigh","shoot","in","satur","black","and","white","thi","deliber","cerebr","film","make","for","tv","and","mercifulli","onli","a","hour","long","be","tell","in","the","form","of","a","convers","between","a","art","connoisseur","and","a","offscreen","narrat","a","thei","ponder","through","a","seri","of","paint","which","be","show","in","the","styl","of","tableau","vivant","and","try","to","find","if","thei","hold","some","clue","about","a","hide","polit","crime","the","aw","kate","beckinsal","film","uncov","have","a","similar","argum","borgesian","be","a","word","i","read","a","lot","in","review","about","thi","movi","but","i","would","sai","almost","ani","borg","stori","be","much","interest","than","thi","film"],"filtered":["read","dure","mani","year","great","thi","film","establish","ruiz","among","french","critic","special","snobbish","cahier","crowd","final","watch","year","ago","find","pretti","disappoint","guess","expect","skyhigh","shoot","satur","black","white","thi","deliber","cerebr","film","make","tv","mercifulli","onli","hour","long","tell","form","convers","art","connoisseur","offscreen","narrat","thei","ponder","seri","paint","show","styl","tableau","vivant","try","find","thei","hold","clue","hide","polit","crime","aw","kate","beckinsal","film","uncov","similar","argum","borgesian","word","read","lot","review","thi","movi","sai","almost","ani","borg","stori","much","interest","thi","film"],"filtered2":["read","dure","mani","year","great","establish","ruiz","among","french","critic","special","snobbish","cahier","crowd","final","watch","year","ago","find","pretti","disappoint","guess","expect","skyhigh","shoot","satur","black","white","deliber","cerebr","make","tv","mercifulli","onli","hour","long","tell","form","convers","art","connoisseur","offscreen","narrat","ponder","paint","show","styl","tableau","vivant","try","find","hold","clue","hide","polit","crime","aw","kate","beckinsal","uncov","similar","argum","borgesian","word","read","lot","review","almost","ani","borg","stori","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,11,17,27,28,36,38,50,51,57,60,72,78,90,99,117,130,131,138,145,156,172,174,176,187,203,229,239,243,258,359,380,382,414,575,579,589,610,689,707,753,826,868,899,1045,1214,1304,1523,1594,1720,1993,2666,3391,3774,3977,4198,6837,7432,8357],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,11,17,27,28,36,38,50,51,57,60,72,78,90,99,117,130,131,138,145,156,172,174,176,187,203,229,239,243,258,359,380,382,414,575,579,589,610,689,707,753,826,868,899,1045,1214,1304,1523,1594,1720,1993,2666,3391,3774,3977,4198,6837,7432,8357],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4680183469605717,3.038623282696244,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,3.668325173349496,1.838176641236591,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,2.0477128419653545,2.056430207256609,2.2797301185117202,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.2907365189289424,4.69198042906518,2.3451551414151686,2.5001408943598484,2.456282578459816,2.5040471493269134,2.4732161909892554,2.569760528637609,2.8432628718938773,2.6593400337329487,2.627841366673578,2.7061321952397077,3.2189558216683714,3.102062070196872,3.235085203598255,3.1254654785810323,3.6314455447135003,3.5642670069567886,3.530930586689197,3.477726550625732,3.607563812710113,3.6375061693251913,3.8690435127678695,3.8204358137024927,3.944626193933877,4.197121957260614,4.165705761027235,4.456830177669989,4.456830177669989,4.605250182788262,5.00274712124725,4.724033718778229,4.979216623837056,5.3064295350454715,5.583416318380505,5.770002273960917,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378643E-4,1.918425624800677E-4,1.9188992989069292E-4,1.9185135387677764E-4,1.9186951033173385E-4,1.9184150471805367E-4,1.9190117008941647E-4,1.9181296183106033E-4,1.918426030240321E-4,1.9204085156612064E-4,1.9356463982783144E-4,1.9184291989840315E-4,1.9202460726677886E-4,1.9204461291790428E-4,1.9195737206466543E-4,1.91852109551493E-4,1.9191811409701828E-4,1.920084314139819E-4,1.918620140487022E-4,1.9186131258214293E-4,1.9203392099871182E-4,1.918805351269066E-4,1.9188082552146763E-4,1.9200374643273243E-4,1.9186208325816179E-4,1.920469083250408E-4,1.9191009600166029E-4,1.9184213252107865E-4,1.919291055456042E-4,1.91987

{"value":"Can only be described as awful. It is bad to start with and then gets even more bad. When you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but fear not because it does. Another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both. As for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it. And in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete - doesn't even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies. This is a really ridiculous movie.

{"value":"Like all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows EVER. While several of them are indeed wonderful classics, the truth is for every great episode, there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank. However, like die-hard Trekkies, these Zone lovers insist that all of them are gold. In fact, this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies I usually watch.<br /><br />While this isn't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. A widow watches a long procession of Civil War soldiers going past her home.

Not to mention a lack of snakes. This film had no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not yours ether so think about what I have said before you find yourself watching this film.<br /><br />Unless of course you resemble a female have weight issues man issues

{"value":"Utterly pretentious nonsense. The material is dull, dull, dull, and most of the cast wouldn't even have made understudies in Allen's earlier films. And to have to listen to the unfunny Will Ferrell do his Woody Allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. It appears that the morose 70-year old Allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century.<br /><br />I truly tried to get involved in the film, but it was just impossible; my snyapses couldn't fire that slowly. So, rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater, and went out to the car where I had a really good book to re-read

{"value":"Well.......in contrast to other comments previously written I have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like Jason Donavon which reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how it won any awards, and although I'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90's foreign soap operas. The plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a-level performance. It was unfortunately long and the sub-plots were incredibly unrealistic....for example....if your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends. It was all fantasy. That's all!

{"value":"This is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief. As such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters. However, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, disjointed effect. Most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (It also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met). The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. In sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing.

{"value":"Unfortunately, this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, fairly wooden as far as actors go, imbues the screen with a range of skill from, non-plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better.<br /><br />The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold. It turns out it's just a bill of poor goods. Disbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a befit of a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whomever scouted the location should be commended.<br /><br />There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos, literally, at the end.<br /><br />Disappointed!

{"value":"I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. He is a fine actor by most accounts, but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent. I mean, it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why U.S. actors were not cast in this film. I second that notion. It's wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained. Maybe it was Altman, but he's a such a great director...<br /><br />Well, I really don't want to bash Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much. Everybody deserves to screw up here and there.

{"value":"I watched the movie \"The Flock\" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the WORST movies I've seen in a long while (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so. I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it's unbelievable. The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it's nauseating. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As for the Gere/Danes on screen matchup, because of the horrible writing, one doesn't believe either character for a single minute. I'll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative, were such a thing possible. It's a shame to see talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back. (I know what you're thinking.

{"value":"I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was TOTALLY disappointed. The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters. This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was absolute garbage. There was no cinematic quality to it.
