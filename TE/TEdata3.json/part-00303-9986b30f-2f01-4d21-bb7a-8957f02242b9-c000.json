{"value":"I've been going through the AFI's list of the top 100 comedies, and I must say that this is truly one of the worst. Not just of the 90 movies on the list I've seen, but of any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are funny sometimes, Dudley isn't. Liza almost made it worthwhile, but alas... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFI's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this. If you want to see a funnier \"drunk\", try The Thin Man. Funnier movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).","finished_norm":["i","have","be","go","through","the","afi","list","of","the","top","comedi","and","i","must","sai","that","thi","be","truli","on","of","the","wrong","not","just","of","the","movi","on","the","list","i","have","see","but","of","ani","movi","i","have","ever","see","drunk","be","funni","sometim","dudlei","be","not","liza","almost","make","it","worthwhil","but","ala","just","go","watch","arrest","develop","if","you","want","to","see","her","in","someth","good","serious","dudlei","laugh","and","drink","be","suppos","to","be","funni","i","would","highli","recommend","almost","ani","other","movi","on","the","afi","top","comedi","for","much","laugh","than","thi","if","you","want","to","see","a","funni","drink","try","the","thin","man","funni","movi","in","gener","ani","marx","brother","movi","will","kill","especi","if","you","re","a","drink","a","arthur"],"filtered":["go","afi","list","top","comedi","must","sai","thi","truli","wrong","movi","list","see","ani","movi","ever","see","drunk","funni","sometim","dudlei","liza","almost","make","worthwhil","ala","go","watch","arrest","develop","want","see","someth","good","serious","dudlei","laugh","drink","suppos","funni","highli","recommend","almost","ani","movi","afi","top","comedi","much","laugh","thi","want","see","funni","drink","try","thin","man","funni","movi","gener","ani","marx","brother","movi","kill","especi","re","drink","arthur"],"filtered2":["go","afi","list","top","comedi","must","truli","wrong","list","see","ani","ever","see","drunk","funni","sometim","dudlei","liza","almost","make","worthwhil","ala","go","watch","arrest","develop","want","see","someth","good","serious","dudlei","laugh","drink","suppos","funni","highli","recommend","almost","ani","afi","top","comedi","laugh","want","see","funni","drink","try","thin","man","funni","gener","ani","marx","brother","kill","especi","re","drink","arthur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,25,27,36,37,44,45,53,62,68,76,127,131,133,141,149,225,267,298,320,343,364,371,381,500,602,667,896,980,1558,1892,1994,2016,6298,6798,8076],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,25,27,36,37,44,45,53,62,68,76,127,131,133,141,149,225,267,298,320,343,364,371,381,500,602,667,896,980,1558,1892,1994,2016,6298,6798,8076],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.2796387880827016,3.9008101766037884,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.7003182735607676,8.090448178027707,2.0064197866819473,2.1337665533324026,4.871935874217273,4.502423616410601,4.642472950759303,2.2657547357741192,2.3253197803590226,2.641219492619754,2.7085302779237206,2.7819920465008363,2.938298364153555,2.9705344631698933,5.9756882014099695,3.0466846007279185,3.24941502915308,3.3814747511661465,7.111656276621848,10.995728772890372,3.8844878351953436,4.081705786614497,4.573751515728891,5.373120909544144,5.051537285416681,4.900964426937307,13.086384324388797,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.937966166569085E-5,7.884438604962912E-5,7.945732596916805E-5,7.899822069323096E-5,7.899951499013495E-5,7.888908945529831E-5,7.912371666072272E-5,7.885573912603562E-5,7.903303557391733E-5,0.1663175200466524,0.6967761315327723,7.872844857731612E-5,8.019787602880443E-5,8.13419163527181E-5,7.878585654073141E-5,7.856812642614918E-5,8.052791005918735E-5,7.913112995572297E-5,7.888562593329497E-5,7.895100809156821E-5,7.971490540055138E-5,7.920952888157328E-5,7.929972094679964E-5,7.938515750193341E-5,7.999439780188253E-5,0.07017176160008896,8.292127557533919E-5,0.06069843255281452,7.875396061973683E-5,7.895348333361204E-5,8.063162113865748E-5,7.912654498246355E-5,8.493564309287004E-5,7.934911627706472E-5,7.883757167454257E-5,7.920145903808291E-5,7.875857445758817E-5,7.88051149804551E-5,7.856773169352952E-5,7.858811578791608E-5,7.876500808550501E-5,7.959581202257479E-5,7.919135225301E-5,7.887825178327519E-5,7.983670525134E-5,7.890852568733781E-5,8.153026415147577E-5,8.033133785241958E-5,7.860764923094016E-5,7.878137694292821E-5,7.875405259330258E-5,8.097048767308516E-5,7.87825490596271E-5,7.858113895905876E-5,7.944367941740823E-5,7.880284135286857E-5,8.474379521873019E-5,7.873789757215227E-5,7.860674017857258E-5,7.898206429184746E-5,7.976549998996735E-5,7.897683917903713E-5,7.859219775590441E-5,7.87751876514096E-5,7.856868198415212E-5,8.038659843663967E-5,7.924551429768788E-5,7.907670974966948E-5,7.900755359308377E-5,7.929554868489409E-5,7.856581567402742E-5,7.900920994943414E-5,8.029068688497626E-5,7.870660997972523E-5,8.065455756797832E-5,7.891470226032946E-5,7.953232829051222E-5,7.90462616874671E-5,7.854118297686825E-5,7.863854016742223E-5]}}

If u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was UNREALISTIC. come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with.

{"value":"I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming \"Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc\". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco.<br /><br />And yes... \"Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR\" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history.

{"value":"A boring movie about a boring town in the 50's. How can anyone think this is a classic? The producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several movies that were way above her acting ability. I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitch's future movies were going to be. Cybil Shepard's career took a dive after being in several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced. It wasn't until \"Moonlighting\" that her career started to come back. I thought the acting was poor rendition of the, \"Graduate\". I have noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the US. The only place I have watched it was overseas in Europe late at night.","finished_norm":["a","bore","movi","about","a","bore","town","in","the","how","can","anyon","think","thi","be","a","classic","the","produc","pretti","much","end","hi","career","by","push","hi","girlfriend","cybil","shepard","into","sever","movi","that","be","wai","abov","her","act","abil","i","think","thi","movi","give","a","insight","to","how","bad","peter","bogdonovitch","futur","movi","be","go","to","be","cybil","shepard","career","take","a","diva","after","be","in","sever","movi","that","peter","bogdonovich","produc","it","be","not","until","moonlight","that","her","career","start","to","come","back","i","think","the","act","be","poor","rendit","of","the","graduat","i","have","notic","that","thi","movi","have","not","be","show","in","the","u","the","onli","place","i","have","watch","it","be","oversea","in","europ","late","at","night"],"filtered":["bore","movi","bore","town","anyon","think","thi","classic","produc","pretti","much","end","hi","career","push","hi","girlfriend","cybil","shepard","sever","movi","wai","abov","act","abil","think","thi","movi","give","insight","bad","peter","bogdonovitch","futur","movi","go","cybil","shepard","career","take","diva","sever","movi","peter","bogdonovich","produc","moonlight","career","start","come","back","think","act","poor","rendit","graduat","notic","thi","movi","show","u","onli","place","watch","oversea","europ","late","night"],"filtered2":["bore","bore","town","anyon","think","classic","produc","pretti","end","career","push","girlfriend","cybil","shepard","sever","wai","abov","act","abil","think","give","insight","bad","peter","bogdonovitch","futur","go","cybil","shepard","career","take","diva","sever","peter","bogdonovich","produc","moonlight","career","start","come","back","think","act","poor","rendit","graduat","notic","show","u","onli","place","watch","oversea","europ","late","night"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,9,11,12,21,24,28,30,31,33,34,63,71,78,108,112,146,150,158,164,210,261,316,332,450,511,688,704,730,760,844,847,1257,1577,2422,3181,4181,4453,4457,6623,6718,7330],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,9,11,12,21,24,28,30,31,33,34,63,71,78,108,112,146,150,158,164,210,261,316,332,450,511,688,704,730,760,844,847,1257,1577,2422,3181,4181,4453,4457,6623,6718,7330],"values":[0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,3.200185830788664,2.324031090670098,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,4.277015007255866,2.2466628996789315,2.326138445979858,2.332712011146513,2.3106972614914807,2.3930275298746078,2.687151791517189,5.417060555847441,5.756414056559796,2.9705344631698933,3.469984576472117,10.172793259224544,3.6016814428070463,3.5900195030592035,3.767137231978131,7.700135222617728,3.8690435127678695,3.900174431363043,4.3215761317340196,4.613282354485526,5.259176650194926,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149,5.967828017290836,12.596139408322827,6.660975197850782,6.543192162194399,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.324352640496162E-5,7.274962818347429E-5,7.331518717225503E-5,7.28915712397209E-5,7.289276548604892E-5,7.279087596665726E-5,0.034483269125127745,7.276010365457241E-5,7.29236948917916E-5,0.20347549697996506,0.3216556193182111,7.264265280544302E-5,7.399849189677764E-5,7.50540966438199E-5,7.269562307006788E-5,7.249472373311024E-5,7.430301393317396E-5,7.301420646986077E-5,7.278768017871886E-5,7.284800822415784E-5,7.355285542994243E-5,7.308654507240888E-5,7.316976519167251E-5,7.324859740701054E-5,7.381074276086982E-5,7.342473335554481E-5,0.043106434839922735,7.266424880006423E-5,7.26661927388904E-5,7.285029212726592E-5,7.4398708031993E-5,7.300997592008334E-5,7.837002434949696E-5,0.11231684793779666,7.274334056708603E-5,7.307909903670693E-5,7.267044992199501E-5,7.271339281119327E-5,7.249435951375676E-5,7.25131678952E-5,7.267638622338908E-5,7.344296810123068E-5,7.306977351724989E-5,7.278087605861612E-5,0.2795430892392528,7.280880975655666E-5,7.522788495032243E-5,7.412163697445736E-5,7.253119138156782E-5,7.269148975010786E-5,7.266627760279824E-5,7.471137981014495E-5,7.269257126089518E-5,7.250673038289633E-5,7.330259551397401E-5,7.271129493752292E-5,7.819300652729363E-5,7.265137138257298E-5,7.253035259994932E-5,7.2876663745956E-5,7.359953900188109E-5,7.287184254011987E-5,7.25169343225677E-5,7.268577889763938E-5,7.249523634586777E-5,7.417262585466351E-5,7.311974877623019E-5,7.29639930056635E-5,7.290018269613757E-5,7.31659154502068E-5,7.249259160467212E-5,7.290171101431805E-5,7.40841283715628E-5,7.262250235549487E-5,7.441987145006942E-5,7.281450887365433E-5,7.338439173156571E-5,7.293589861219918E-5,7.246986304212923E-5,7.25596944146423E-5]}}
{"value":"I knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing, but I thought I would give it a chance. I am a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought it had potential. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy. I think that Aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout. There is a shot where the Aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you can't help but notice it. Maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop Aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I didn't spend $9.50 to see it in the theater.","finished_norm":["i","know","thi","movi","be","not","go","to","be","amaz","but","i","think","i","would","give","it","a","chanc","i","be","a","fan","of","luke","wilson","so","i","think","it","have","potenti","unfortun","a","lot","of","the","movi","dialog","be","veri","fake","sound","and","cheesi","i","think","that","aquafresh","give","some","monei","toward","the","product","of","the","film","becaus","thei","be","serious","drop","some","hint","throughout","there","be","a","shoot","where","the","aquafresh","sign","stick","out","at","you","that","you","ca","not","help","but","notic","it","mayb","thei","should","have","focu","on","write","and","act","much","than","how","mani","time","can","we","drop","aquafresh","product","in","the","movi","without","peopl","get","annoi","the","movi","have","it","moment","but","i","be","glad","i","do","not","spend","to","see","it","in","the","theater"],"filtered":["know","thi","movi","go","amaz","think","give","chanc","fan","luke","wilson","think","potenti","unfortun","lot","movi","dialog","veri","fake","sound","cheesi","think","aquafresh","give","monei","toward","product","film","becaus","thei","serious","drop","hint","throughout","shoot","aquafresh","sign","stick","ca","help","notic","mayb","thei","focu","write","act","much","mani","time","drop","aquafresh","product","movi","without","peopl","get","annoi","movi","moment","glad","spend","see","theater"],"filtered2":["know","go","amaz","think","give","chanc","fan","luke","wilson","think","potenti","unfortun","lot","dialog","veri","fake","sound","cheesi","think","aquafresh","give","monei","toward","product","becaus","serious","drop","hint","throughout","shoot","aquafresh","sign","stick","ca","help","notic","mayb","focu","write","act","mani","time","drop","aquafresh","product","without","peopl","get","annoi","moment","glad","spend","see","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,8,12,15,21,22,23,26,30,50,65,72,81,117,125,126,140,163,178,185,188,190,227,271,283,371,416,424,432,438,486,543,547,563,619,639,685,688,876,904,1227,1300,2141,2326],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,8,12,15,21,22,23,26,30,50,65,72,81,117,125,126,140,163,178,185,188,190,227,271,283,371,416,424,432,438,486,543,547,563,619,639,685,688,876,904,1227,1300,2141,2326],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,3.200185830788664,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,2.6728839783437044,1.717994385570355,1.9073850067444174,1.9209463754160525,1.949757232424728,2.2797301185117202,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,2.4000574358028657,2.532833256045391,2.518833027372001,2.5378812223426954,5.116663665627972,2.6005321873043625,2.757740698455715,2.7678802023081546,3.0466846007279185,3.1401446412440817,3.212973749990824,3.235085203598255,3.1797351085150902,3.3066947359763783,3.477726550625732,3.432149042129413,3.459754308221302,3.5929222627171646,3.616452760127359,3.607563812710113,3.6016814428070463,3.8844878351953436,7.8242060044566335,4.246178114249808,4.370968887063596,5.373120909544144,5.444579873526289]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.403935258173033E-5,9.340522324266577E-5,9.413135978690671E-5,9.358746778724301E-5,9.358900111253497E-5,9.345818239163562E-5,9.373614012077151E-5,9.341867298448471E-5,9.362871221649927E-5,1.0387594521418899E-4,0.8728763226999252,9.326787464974541E-5,9.500867327881677E-5,9.636399287996764E-5,9.333588461097888E-5,9.30779444965565E-5,9.539965739106782E-5,9.374492248955077E-5,9.345407923271542E-5,9.353153604854698E-5,9.443650851716551E-5,9.383779998581823E-5,9.394464855689953E-5,9.404586337897108E-5,9.476761706463433E-5,9.427200910651228E-5,9.82350252788556E-5,9.329560233370903E-5,9.329809820955832E-5,9.353446841377003E-5,9.552252164324865E-5,9.373949077180505E-5,0.02649879210167812,9.400316612652905E-5,0.09337655998288494,9.382823981837299E-5,9.330356412255608E-5,9.335869966417196E-5,9.307747686543768E-5,9.310162545714055E-5,9.331118590112449E-5,9.42954211916884E-5,9.381626653069457E-5,9.344534323814011E-5,9.458080214190974E-5,9.348120807150461E-5,9.658712440615076E-5,9.516678258822657E-5,9.312476630074118E-5,9.333057772923613E-5,9.329820716863419E-5,9.59239694302574E-5,9.33319663103059E-5,9.309336016027423E-5,9.411519301489561E-5,9.335600614719589E-5,1.003941245208476E-4,9.32790686676877E-5,9.312368936624289E-5,9.35683276511644E-5,9.449644682293524E-5,9.356213757406481E-5,9.310646127552056E-5,9.332324541066567E-5,9.307860265399659E-5,9.523224859619762E-5,9.388043112284743E-5,9.368045205925105E-5,9.35985242699925E-5,9.393970576928661E-5,9.307520699895387E-5,9.360048651920804E-5,9.511862427437168E-5,9.324200293984334E-5,9.554969393043921E-5,9.348852532271379E-5,9.42202133999522

{"value":"I gave this a four purely out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties.<br /><br />Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory. I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy. Even the Stooge's seem to be going through the motions. Overall there's nothing much really to recommend here.<br /><br />If you're not a Stooge fan then don't bother.

{"value":"This was a fairly creepy movie; I found the music to be effective for this. The photographs Mario took of the village were also unnerving. However, I had three problems with this film. One is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on, but this may have just been my copy. The second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and I'm still not sure what was going on there. The third problem is that I didn't understand the ending, but apparently some people do. Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male lead is very 70s. All in all, watchable but not even close to being a favorite.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","fairli","creepi","movi","i","find","the","music","to","be","effect","for","thi","the","photograph","mario","take","of","the","villag","be","conjur","unnerv","howev","i","have","three","problem","with","thi","film","on","be","that","the","light","be","veri","dark","so","some","of","the","time","it","be","hard","to","tell","what","be","go","on","but","thi","mai","have","just","be","my","copi","the","be","that","the","veri","begin","be","not","explain","veri","good","and","i","be","still","not","sure","what","be","go","on","there","the","problem","be","that","i","do","not","understand","the","end","but","appar","some","peopl","do","of","cours","there","be","conjur","the","usual","problem","of","peopl","do","stupid","thing","and","the","male","lead","be","veri","all","in","all","watchabl","but","not","even","close","to","be","a","favorit"],"filtered":["thi","fairli","creepi","movi","find","music","effect","thi","photograph","mario","take","villag","conjur","unnerv","howev","three","problem","thi","film","light","veri","dark","time","hard","tell","go","thi","mai","copi","veri","begin","explain","veri","good","still","sure","go","problem","understand","end","appar","peopl","cours","conjur","usual","problem","peopl","stupid","thing","male","lead","veri","watchabl","even","close","favorit"],"filtered2":["fairli","creepi","find","music","effect","photograph","mario","take","villag","conjur","unnerv","howev","three","problem","light","veri","dark","time","hard","tell","go","mai","copi","veri","begin","explain","veri","good","still","sure","go","problem","understand","end","appar","peopl","cours","conjur","usual","problem","peopl","stupid","thing","male","lead","veri","watchabl","even","close","favorit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,6,8,15,23,24,29,31,38,39,46,64,90,106,113,118,119,136,147,157,167,171,199,212,224,265,295,308,353,368,395,649,747,755,819,822,1178,1313,1689,3979,8316],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,6,8,15,23,24,29,31,38,39,46,64,90,106,113,118,119,136,147,157,167,171,199,212,224,265,295,308,353,368,395,649,747,755,819,822,1178,1313,1689,3979,8316],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,4.800243119426277,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.519311641348122,3.1077880109725475,1.655771293751733,1.883428577602134,2.0477128419653545,2.159084361316692,2.1521782565202803,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.346825985579986,2.2844323215331563,2.3360150694757706,7.382873006366429,2.373087554090762,2.558331832813986,2.5983793339432615,2.689504733779216,2.73529586597515,2.7910771187233068,2.8753661172782943,3.0266839340212486,3.1346146732346205,3.153168081130368,3.6375061693251913,3.7465885637507435,3.79165684915245,3.835141961092188,3.813163054373413,4.229557233013768,4.4919214974812585,4.838444069955973,6.101359409915359,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.981648398281243E-5,9.914339809612731E-5,0.05325774107501145,9.9336838492784E-5,9.933846601504191E-5,9.919961069117147E-5,9.949464423251874E-5,9.915767409763078E-5,9.938061669626174E-5,1.1025737236726725E-4,0.8700433023234341,9.899761174978489E-5,1.0084535308046862E-4,1.022839342015189E-4,9.906979977553967E-5,9.879601359355389E-5,1.0126035656897225E-4,9.950396612966626E-5,9.91952554623721E-5,9.927747069253431E-5,1.0023803844889184E-4,9.960254938086938E-5,9.971596199368648E-5,9.982339475868078E-5,1.0058948802949448E-4,1.0006343332520832E-4,1.0426990996961671E-4,9.902704283205259E-5,9.902969203735754E-5,9.928058320211973E-5,1.0139076875624471E-4,9.949820072451958E-5,1.0680288981394904E-4,9.977807448054736E-5,9.913482931481222E-5,9.959240190245239E-5,9.90354937384775E-5,9.909401642877145E-5,9.87955172343936E-5,9.882114934957456E-5,9.904358374672946E-5,1.0008828368796423E-4,0.06899890022369604,9.918598278834087E-5,1.0039119648207361E-4,9.92240509105343E-5,1.0252077339487638E-4,1.0101317553901352E-4,9.884571180753706E-5,9.906416687546187E-5,9.902980769013006E-5,1.0181687873575639E-4,9.906564076140754E-5,9.881237628968397E-5,9.989698353086826E-5,9.909115744062747E-5,1.0656164942750263E-4,9.900949345124247E-5,9.8844568713586E-5,9.9316522518313E-5,1.003016589521553E-4,9.930995216542668E-5,9.882628224739466E-5,9.90563841096404E-5,9.879671218366296E-5,1.0108266332850443E-4,9.964779948191347E-5,9.943553507929524E-5,9.934857420983194E-5,9.971071555517908E-5,9.879310792291597E-5,9.93506570061509E-5,1.0096205870939309E-4,9.89701506598672E-5,1.0141961032197938E-4,9.923181768335939E-5,1.0000845564647824E-4,9.939724796078961E-5,9.876213337389613E-5,9.888455582125386E-5]}}
{"value":"This was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen. I am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies. They are always good for a laugh, believe i know, i have seen many. But this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle. I was considering turning it off in the first five minutes... which i probably should have. There is nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d A$$. The intro was stupid just like the ending. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please I'm begging you, do NOT watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.","finished_norm":["thi","be","by","far","the","wrong","low","budget","horror","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","be","a","open","mind","gui","and","i","alwai","love","a","good","horror","movi","in","fact","when","i","be","rent","movi","i","specif","look","for","some","good","underr","horror","movi","thei","be","alwai","good","for","a","laugh","believ","i","know","i","have","see","mani","but","thi","movi","be","just","so","terribl","it","be","not","worth","a","chuckl","i","be","consid","turn","it","off","in","the","five","minut","which","i","probabl","should","have","there","be","noth","good","about","it","and","foremost","the","camera","crow","suckd","a","the","intro","be","stupid","just","like","the","end","act","and","special","effect","be","terribl","pleas","i","be","beg","you","do","not","watch","thi","movi","you","will","absolut","hate","it"],"filtered":["thi","far","wrong","low","budget","horror","movi","ever","see","open","mind","gui","alwai","love","good","horror","movi","fact","rent","movi","specif","look","good","underr","horror","movi","thei","alwai","good","laugh","believ","know","see","mani","thi","movi","terribl","worth","chuckl","consid","turn","five","minut","probabl","noth","good","foremost","camera","crow","suckd","intro","stupid","like","end","act","special","effect","terribl","pleas","beg","watch","thi","movi","absolut","hate"],"filtered2":["far","wrong","low","budget","horror","ever","see","open","mind","gui","alwai","love","good","horror","fact","rent","specif","look","good","underr","horror","alwai","good","laugh","believ","know","see","mani","terribl","worth","chuckl","consid","turn","five","minut","probabl","noth","good","foremost","camera","crow","suckd","intro","stupid","like","end","act","special","effect","terribl","pleas","beg","watch","absolut","hate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,16,21,24,25,26,44,49,50,54,55,59,83,91,96,97,101,106,133,136,148,166,197,203,217,219,222,231,238,242,256,317,339,346,505,661,769,1666,1968,2050,3893,4459,7040],"values":[1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,16,21,24,25,26,44,49,50,54,55,59,83,91,96,97,101,106,133,136,148,166,197,203,217,219,222,231,238,242,256,317,339,346,505,661,769,1666,1968,2050,3893,4459,7040],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,2.714457859969082,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,1.8693254449200722,6.876956393220216,2.0105926690411424,2.0390708128715254,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985579986,2.3018654096236517,4.884774065938707,5.116663665627972,2.569760528637609,2.6113665294700725,2.5792094178355414,2.5771019354959765,2.7049353070058615,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.748952192422636,2.8529247828056143,3.003844442051426,3.023389038124396,3.3956930001684253,3.5727776966246974,3.857614816944247,4.688631791727313,4.85885294158718,4.944927550358424,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.395871323224878E-5,9.332512766316973E-5,9.405064154065515E-5,9.35072159318782E-5,9.350874794233388E-5,9.337804139932882E-5,9.36557607779248E-5,9.333856587174857E-5,9.354842499377119E-5,0.09386381115635059,0.8237742658539322,9.31878968475509E-5,9.492720273060506E-5,9.628136013648367E-5,9.325584848980534E-5,9.299812956068954E-5,9.531785157146594E-5,9.366453561576637E-5,9.337394175889377E-5,9.345133215500773E-5,9.435552860391575E-5,9.375733346898359E-5,9.386409041672819E-5,9.396521844643905E-5,9.468635322367619E-5,9.419117025256483E-5,0.075127898737964,9.321560075484723E-5,9.321809449046694E-5,9.345426200570874E-5,9.544061046676056E-5,9.365910855575353E-5,1.0053511901032556E-4,9.39225578071655E-5,9.331706174425323E-5,9.374778149944341E-5,9.322355571640917E-5,9.32786439789436E-5,9.299766233056742E-5,9.302179021469763E-5,9.323117095925346E-5,9.421456226172737E-5,9.373581847893615E-5,9.336521325548998E-5,9.4499698495949E-5,9.340104733452928E-5,9.650430032594842E-5,9.508517646026544E-5,9.304491121487608E-5,9.325054615874779E-5,9.32182033561097E-5,9.584171400971076E-5,9.325193354910037E-5,9.30135320053765E-5,9.4034488631755E-5,9.327595277167566E-5,1.0030803591356913E-4,9.319908126655083E-5,9.304383520385605E-5,9.348809220858935E-5,9.441541551220289E-5,9.348190743952068E-5,9.302662188633228E-5,9.324322012768765E-5,9.299878715375539E-5,9.515058633071373E-5,9.379992804953868E-5,9.360012046927514E-5,9.351826293362265E-5,9.385915186758743E-5,9.29953944105087E-5,9.352022350019688E-5,9.503705944247432E-5,9.316204732280641E-5,9.546775945354013E-5,9.34083583111485E-5,9.413941896115624E-5,9.356408024581085E-5,9.29662376154311E-5,9.308147565193

{"value":"... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater (I don't rate movies that I see only on TV).

{"value":"What's with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? It's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens.<br /><br />The violence and nudity might turn some people off but, that, along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie I suppose.<br /><br />My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, \"Alas, your breed is dumb.\" Okay, no one should ever say \"alas\" in a movie line unless they're English and living in the 18th century.<br /><br />The acting by the Van Helsing character and bad girl \"Rally\" isn't bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Wicked martial arts!

{"value":"I too was intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this film, and was very disappointed. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row, but it was not to be. I went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much of a plot, if any. I don't necessarily need that in a movie, but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in. The best I could say would be that it aspires to be an Altman-esque film, albeit with an extremely small ensemble. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments easily get thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this film. I give it a 3.<br /><br />","finished_norm":["i","too","be","intrigu","by","the","high","rate","for","thi","film","and","be","veri","disappoint","i","have","just","see","a","coupl","of","good","foreign","film","and","be","look","forward","to","make","it","three","in","a","row","but","it","be","not","to","be","i","go","with","a","spanish","speak","friend","who","feel","the","same","wai","there","be","not","much","of","a","plot","if","ani","i","do","not","necessarili","ne","that","in","a","movi","but","it","ne","to","somehow","entertain","or","bring","me","in","the","well","i","can","sai","would","be","that","it","aspir","to","be","a","altmanesqu","film","albeit","with","a","extrem","small","ensembl","sure","there","be","moment","but","a","few","moment","easili","get","thin","out","by","slow","minut","of","noth","i","do","not","understand","the","high","rate","for","thi","film","i","give","it","a","br","br"],"filtered":["intrigu","high","rate","thi","film","veri","disappoint","see","coupl","good","foreign","film","look","forward","make","three","row","go","spanish","speak","friend","feel","wai","much","plot","ani","necessarili","ne","movi","ne","somehow","entertain","bring","well","sai","aspir","altmanesqu","film","albeit","extrem","small","ensembl","sure","moment","moment","easili","get","thin","slow","minut","noth","understand","high","rate","thi","film","give","br","br"],"filtered2":["intrigu","high","rate","veri","disappoint","see","coupl","good","foreign","look","forward","make","three","row","go","spanish","speak","friend","feel","wai","plot","ani","necessarili","ne","ne","somehow","entertain","bring","well","aspir","altmanesqu","albeit","extrem","small","ensembl","sure","moment","moment","easili","get","thin","slow","minut","noth","understand","high","rate","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,15,16,20,27,30,32,33,43,49,59,110,119,161,187,188,195,202,211,212,224,250,253,329,344,363,390,549,583,699,980,1017,1668,1770,2267,2602,2615,3148,4491],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,15,16,20,27,30,32,33,43,49,59,110,119,161,187,188,195,202,211,212,224,250,253,329,344,363,390,549,583,699,980,1017,1668,1770,2267,2602,2615,3148,4491],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.8693254449200722,4.2580959472608155,2.1653408989309972,2.4323182980210873,2.4732161909892554,5.075762444685391,2.51289241584188,5.194609285626992,5.137432284239405,2.5983793339432615,2.689504733779216,2.6812935439488212,2.7073305177318163,2.951986790814132,2.983093497946387,3.0349689855553557,3.132778125427319,3.4471119148061256,3.4986697244709752,3.5813614403160887,4.081705786614497,4.0536665665501035,4.9676558014359795,4.789173020949191,5.051537285416681,5.259176650194926,5.290429193699031,5.482320201509136,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.769931444833574E-5,9.704050513077543E-5,9.779490252527648E-5,9.722984253664145E-5,9.723143553814283E-5,9.709552542181394E-5,9.738430111876052E-5,9.70544783294326E-5,9.727269217727086E-5,1.0791874206363673E-4,0.9922680041482328,9.689781100326004E-5,9.870636059429493E-5,1.0011442851751621E-4,9.696846787621536E-5,9.670048886895995E-5,9.911256160140967E-5,9.739342529268782E-5,9.709126257011867E-5,9.717173396425676E-5,9.811192748272878E-5,9.748991753198861E-5,9.760092459294593E-5,9.770607864236165E-5,9.845592259974719E-5,9.794102584201397E-5,1.0205828050781045E-4,9.692661783401878E-5,9.692921084803611E-5,9.71747804555834E-5,9.92402076653045E-5,9.738778217536017E-5,1.0453753427861382E-4,9.766171963543645E-5,9.703211809862664E-5,9.747998528788262E-5,9.693488949147691E-5,9.699217087921218E-5,9.670000303788532E-5,9.672509148000548E-5,9.694280790563618E-5,9.796534911316287E-5,9.746754600618023E-5,9.708218657525482E-5,9.826183693903353E-5,9.711944724896554E-5,1.0034624420468777E-4,9.887062343440552E-5,9.674913295300022E-5,9.69629544534419E-5,9.692932404774158E-5,9.965727958786445E-5,9.696439707735251E-5,9.671650450215648E-5,9.777810655104906E-5,9.698937253197998E-5,1.0430141076082476E-4,9.690944068646031E-5,9.674801410478084E-5,9.720995747658956E-5,9.817419855565868E-5,9.72035264849631E-5,9.673011550587924E-5,9.695533676491062E-5,9.670117264153954E-5,9.89386373447829E-5,9.753420785032407E-5,9.732644570733818E-5,9.724132933185196E-5,9.759578943465327E-5,9.669764482939845E-5,9.724336795076918E-5,9.882059082444554E-5,9.687093238009168E-5,9.926843748354154E-5,9.71270492837218E-5,9.788721427394857E-5,9.728897068236288E-5,9.666732726977468E-5,9.678715306109386E-5]}}
{"value":"I've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because I have a baby girl who likes to watch TV. I began to watch this movie to see if I would like my little one to watch it... and no. At the beginning I thought it was such a cute movie like the Bambi movie, but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual. The info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports, but that was not the case. It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay. It was also very sad, as far as the ducky's dad and all. I don't know, I guess if you're gay you'd like it, but I don't think I'm going to watch it again with my little one.","finished_norm":["i","have","be","watch","a","lot","of","cartoon","or","anim","movi","becaus","i","have","a","babi","girl","who","like","to","watch","tv","i","begin","to","watch","thi","movi","to","see","if","i","would","like","my","littl","on","to","watch","it","and","no","at","the","begin","i","think","it","be","such","a","cute","movi","like","the","bambi","movi","but","all","the","wai","it","be","like","insinu","the","ducki","be","a","homosexu","the","info","sai","that","thei","be","make","fun","of","him","becaus","he","be","not","good","at","sport","but","that","be","not","the","case","it","just","seem","like","a","movi","make","for","kid","to","learn","to","be","okai","be","gai","it","be","conjur","veri","sad","a","far","a","the","ducki","dad","and","all","i","do","not","know","i","guess","if","you","re","gai","you","have","like","it","but","i","do","not","think","i","be","go","to","watch","it","again","with","my","littl","on"],"filtered":["watch","lot","cartoon","anim","movi","becaus","babi","girl","like","watch","tv","begin","watch","thi","movi","see","like","littl","watch","begin","think","cute","movi","like","bambi","movi","wai","like","insinu","ducki","homosexu","info","sai","thei","make","fun","becaus","good","sport","case","seem","like","movi","make","kid","learn","okai","gai","conjur","veri","sad","far","ducki","dad","know","guess","re","gai","like","think","go","watch","littl"],"filtered2":["watch","lot","cartoon","anim","becaus","babi","girl","like","watch","tv","begin","watch","see","like","littl","watch","begin","think","cute","like","bambi","wai","like","insinu","ducki","homosexu","info","make","fun","becaus","good","sport","case","seem","like","make","kid","learn","okai","gai","conjur","veri","sad","far","ducki","dad","know","guess","re","gai","like","think","go","watch","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,12,14,15,22,26,33,35,39,68,72,84,101,114,147,172,191,243,259,277,288,430,455,640,653,698,855,1016,1676,2479,4276,8277],"values":[2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,12,14,15,22,26,33,35,39,68,72,84,101,114,147,172,191,243,259,277,288,430,455,640,653,698,855,1016,1676,2479,4276,8277],"values":[1.2399534312410465,3.876229767345947,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,4.804748860361466,2.133457220525776,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,2.5958480334723544,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,2.0064197866819473,1.9209463754160525,2.2212694515902225,2.098582041218749,2.4433074195966826,4.568864643066313,2.5001408943598484,2.5460113484259455,2.627841366673578,2.7464553122240485,3.1163992333432793,2.8015621426949333,3.2189558216683714,3.2787058260741455,7.9996838330726465,3.9911462095687695,3.90413483257914,3.9201351739255808,4.34596758485818,4.770124825978496,5.3560264761848435,5.907203395474402,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0998693290062777E-4,1.0924526529923296E-4,1.1009454306620514E-4,1.0945841562349216E-4,1.0946020897639573E-4,1.0930720547857605E-4,1.0963230042302616E-4,1.092609959036061E-4,1.0950665445275454E-4,1.2149165538259886E-4,0.7815153693673033,1.0908462456682896E-4,1.1112063498962268E-4,1.1270579526495667E-4,1.0916416793710323E-4,1.0886248527682865E-4,1.1157792379626342E-4,1.0964257214203648E-4,1.0930240648908445E-4,1.0939299875042694E-4,1.1045144017362108E-4,1.097512001862488E-4,1.0987616857762341E-4,1.0999454782565213E-4,1.1083869947085653E-4,1.1025904427610588E-4,1.1489412503607603E-4,1.091170544255197E-4,1.0911997356226437E-4,1.093964283982092E-4,1.1172162387383207E-4,1.0963621929124761E-4,1.1768519393633097E-4,1.0994460979747075E-4,1.0923582343213909E-4,1.097400187662746E-4,1.0912636640727682E-4,1.0919085206088522E-4,1.0886193834290072E-4,1.0889018215213961E-4,1.0913528071841331E-4,1.10286426679011E-4,1.0972601499920973E-4,1.0929218900860638E-4,1.1062020370491973E-4,1.0933413594797227E-4,1.1296676635338466E-4,0.045558305398248795,1.089172473152069E-4,1.0915796109252032E-4,1.0912010099906862E-4,1.1219115082824683E-4,1.0915958515488097E-4,1.088805151922246E-4,1.1007563466648112E-4,1.0918770176621837E-4,0.16445060311992044,1.090977169123897E-4,1.0891598774972554E-4,1.0943602962438868E-4,1.1052154306388867E-4,1.0942878980854659E-4,1.0889583804849661E-4,1.0914938532919915E-4,1.088632550473153E-4,1.113821251291856E-4,1.0980106088689359E-4,1.0956716855091448E-4,1.0947134711007625E-4,1.0987038757175086E-4,1.0885928354311962E-4,1.0947364212558709E-4,1.1124923192737748E-4,1.0905436542591716E-4,1.117534041492799E-4,1.0934269408874703E-4,1.1019846484052328E-4,1.0952498030137883E-4,1.0882515295157064E-4,1.0896004920282896E-4]}}
{"value":"I have walked out of very few movies before they end, but I couldn't finish this piece of garbage. This was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since \"Birth of a Nation\". The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film. Lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do.... like watching paint dry. I wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically. There is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like Lee.","finished_norm":["i","have","walk","out","of","veri","few","movi","befor","thei","end","but","i","can","not","finish","thi","piec","of","garbag","thi","be","the","big","load","of","racism","try","to","pass","a","legitim","film","sinc","birth","of","a","nation","the","charact","be","littl","much","than","cardboard","cutout","i","do","not","see","how","ani","actor","would","want","their","name","associ","with","thi","film","lee","must","have","well","thing","to","do","that","put","out","garbag","like","thi","i","know","that","i","and","anyon","with","a","brain","have","well","thing","to","do","like","watch","paint","spindri","i","wish","that","someon","would","make","a","film","about","interraci","relationship","that","deal","with","the","topic","realist","there","be","a","lot","much","depth","to","thi","subject","the","shallow","rant","of","a","bitter","director","like","lee"],"filtered":["walk","veri","movi","befor","thei","end","finish","thi","piec","garbag","thi","big","load","racism","try","pass","legitim","film","sinc","birth","nation","charact","littl","much","cardboard","cutout","see","ani","actor","want","name","associ","thi","film","lee","must","well","thing","put","garbag","like","thi","know","anyon","brain","well","thing","like","watch","paint","spindri","wish","someon","make","film","interraci","relationship","deal","topic","realist","lot","much","depth","thi","subject","shallow","rant","bitter","director","like","lee"],"filtered2":["walk","veri","befor","end","finish","piec","garbag","big","load","racism","try","pass","legitim","sinc","birth","nation","charact","littl","cardboard","cutout","see","ani","actor","want","name","associ","lee","must","well","thing","put","garbag","like","know","anyon","brain","well","thing","like","watch","paint","spindri","wish","someon","make","interraci","relationship","deal","topic","realist","lot","depth","subject","shallow","rant","bitter","director","like","lee"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,10,14,15,20,24,26,27,29,36,37,41,58,72,79,82,139,141,143,158,159,162,218,294,399,468,487,550,570,573,577,673,702,868,914,958,1055,1150,1296,1447,1742,1814,1870,2513,2741,2886,3002,4077,4873],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,10,14,15,20,24,26,27,29,36,37,41,58,72,79,82,139,141,143,158,159,162,218,294,399,468,487,550,570,573,577,673,702,868,914,958,1055,1150,1296,1447,1742,1814,1870,2513,2741,2886,3002,4077,4873],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,2.6390769554676132,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.865701314626681,1.9209463754160525,1.9469506069506084,2.020196584395323,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.300267965194495,2.3586007221245198,2.5940874818617203,2.886778509330039,3.129115117668582,3.304513710030018,3.3220965805878846,3.4751392270607813,7.889252387867754,3.4623020803001006,3.604618302480356,3.7297814454343623,7.293333077447711,3.944626193933877,3.9612932464190886,4.067587905068712,4.246178114249808,4.246178114249808,4.370968887063596,4.477736862489302,4.724033718778229,4.869215728622727,4.848596441419991,5.259176650194926,5.521540914662417,5.390512652256013,5.482320201509136,5.822646007446338,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.458769911221901E-5,7.408473681992473E-5,7.466067500526217E-5,7.422928482969496E-5,7.423050099295404E-5,7.412674158665436E-5,7.434720490225074E-5,7.409540453794263E-5,7.426199801832254E-5,0.08161353709093702,0.8414127899616479,7.397579821878616E-5,7.535651980815792E-5,7.643149712176369E-5,7.402974059913919E-5,7.382515433694872E-5,7.566663046419305E-5,7.435417067415385E-5,7.412348714928801E-5,7.418492234120318E-5,7.490270497518608E-5,7.44278368421538E-5,7.451258422557987E-5,0.03273652884974467,7.516532508085539E-5,7.477223159134098E-5,7.7915514161079E-5,7.39977905453152E-5,7.399977015950604E-5,7.418724815873529E-5,7.576408075092644E-5,7.434986248489309E-5,7.980827907272332E-5,7.455899767650735E-5,7.407833381255574E-5,7.442025415604111E-5,7.400410547087153E-5,7.40478364523759E-5,7.382478343340431E-5,7.384393698819247E-5,7.401015071587751E-5,7.479080098294954E-5,7.441075749369471E-5,7.411655815927544E-5,7.501715205686797E-5,7.414500449930501E-5,7.660847480908807E-5,7.548192485693098E-5,7.386229124343032E-5,7.402553142406741E-5,7.399985658084501E-5,7.608249071361362E-5,7.40266327828516E-5,7.383738133400289E-5,7.464785226357718E-5,7.404570007831283E-5,7.962801260129484E-5,7.398467680013764E-5,7.386143706840553E-5,7.421410375207581E-5,7.495024528882406E-5,7.42091940669758E-5,7.384777253742146E-5,7.4019715765448

{"value":"Half the reviews were good so i took a chance for $10. Sure Priscilla Barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much. The whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother & the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it. Its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry. It could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger & better decades ago in the early 1970s.","finished_norm":["half","the","review","be","good","so","i","take","a","chanc","for","sure","priscilla","barn","have","some","sex","talk","but","it","be","not","much","the","whole","plot","late","that","she","mai","be","the","other","actress","mother","the","documentari","maker","fall","for","the","young","woman","be","stretch","it","it","not","funni","it","not","that","raunchi","it","not","much","of","anyth","but","a","wast","of","time","boogi","night","be","base","on","real","peopl","that","be","in","the","adult","industri","thi","be","base","on","noth","that","ever","happen","in","the","industri","it","can","have","shock","with","what","popular","todai","in","adult","film","mock","todai","gonzo","video","and","that","big","orgi","that","thei","have","minut","to","shoot","what","a","joke","a","big","orgi","have","be","do","big","well","decad","ago","in","the","earli"],"filtered":["half","review","good","take","chanc","sure","priscilla","barn","sex","talk","much","whole","plot","late","mai","actress","mother","documentari","maker","fall","young","woman","stretch","funni","raunchi","much","anyth","wast","time","boogi","night","base","real","peopl","adult","industri","thi","base","noth","ever","happen","industri","shock","popular","todai","adult","film","mock","todai","gonzo","video","big","orgi","thei","minut","shoot","joke","big","orgi","big","well","decad","ago","earli"],"filtered2":["half","review","good","take","chanc","sure","priscilla","barn","sex","talk","whole","plot","late","mai","actress","mother","documentari","maker","fall","young","woman","stretch","funni","raunchi","anyth","wast","time","boogi","night","base","real","peopl","adult","industri","base","noth","ever","happen","industri","shock","popular","todai","adult","mock","todai","gonzo","video","big","orgi","minut","shoot","joke","big","orgi","big","well","decad","ago","earli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,20,23,31,32,44,46,49,59,62,70,80,82,89,94,104,111,117,119,135,150,170,176,186,206,210,214,240,254,266,334,354,397,486,508,610,624,734,762,789,951,1083,1196,1220,2713,4321,4523,5770,6834],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,20,23,31,32,44,46,49,59,62,70,80,82,89,94,104,111,117,119,135,150,170,176,186,206,210,214,240,254,266,334,354,397,486,508,610,624,734,762,789,951,1083,1196,1220,2713,4321,4523,5770,6834],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.8693254449200722,2.0226120445069267,2.094675786251684,1.9951803900462557,6.060589753185969,1.9940046109572438,2.08112281984698,2.0728240170322856,2.1183455303375887,2.2797301185117202,2.1653408989309972,2.366244071437088,2.332712011146513,2.4071371113909277,2.5040471493269134,2.571852579609833,2.597304642813496,2.687151791517189,2.7303758068497004,2.7666071276613566,2.889652074525771,2.747702973022204,5.885680771176112,3.0316467233633775,3.3176717946075294,3.3066947359763783,3.4149707055943286,3.477726550625732,3.9241755834625858,7.5833136983049,3.749984152751882,7.611885612799853,4.004218291136122,8.383633810061841,4.291900363587903,4.30366520516749,5.426230734858092,12.064733076856815,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.208114185613981E-5,7.159508186540852E-5,0.03765456107720631,7.173477226638997E-5,7.173594755986922E-5,7.163567504076198E-5,7.184872957542013E-5,7.160539108938085E-5,7.176638611181084E-5,7.962088781839626E-5,0.7864836067753646,7.14898042009177E-5,7.28241259447431E-5,7.386297810342908E-5,7.154193382036653E-5,7.134422278272503E-5,7.312381517573999E-5,7.18554612590444E-5,7.163252997040508E-5,7.16919006017036E-5,7.238556178817019E-5,7.19266518383062E-5,7.200855124315954E-5,7.208613238070876E-5,7.263935641270398E-5,7.225947302820939E-5,0.034205191331931256,7.15110574642192E-5,7.151297055247651E-5,7.169414825896424E-5,7.321799059642676E-5,7.185129784865712E-5,7.712628159343444E-5,7.20534049466543E-5,7.15888940343323E-5,7.191932397218557E-5,7.151716017351651E-5,7.155942155332637E-5,7.134386434358135E-5,7.136237423349842E-5,7.152300226501442E-5,7.22774183860452E-5,7.191014644996813E-5,7.162583383259736E-5,7.24961628179368E-5,7.165332421901986E-5,7.403400836629061E-5,7.29453166935888E-5,7.138011168472978E-5,7.153786609674645E-5,7.151305406958279E-5,7.352570023168889E-5,7.153893044381309E-5,7.135603888537501E-5,7.213927353050099E-5,7.155735697319142E-5,7.69520730677177E-5,7.149838441306385E-5,7.137928621468762E-5,7.172010135654265E-5,7.24315044855856E-5,7.171535666388723E-5,7.136608088716064E-5,7.153224587626957E-5,7.134472726024961E-5,7.299549637345434E-5,7.19593285949121E-5,7.180604468923206E-5,7.174324705784289E-5,7.200476259760519E-5,7.1342

{"value":"Kol, space prisoner on space death row, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of America where he, along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'Alienator\" a female cyborg killing machine. Made one year after the best movie of Fred Olen Ray's career, \"Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers\", this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown. Just as low-budget as that earlier film, but not nearly as fun as I had with it. None of the actors really stood out at me. The film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's pretty much all it's good for.<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />Where i saw it: Showtime

{"value":"Okay, I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller, although I am lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting. It sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script. This movie only had one good thing about it, and that's that Ben Stiller was in it. This plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous. How many movies have this same type of plot?? Can we say \"Forces of Nature??\" Not only is the plot so old, but the outcome is so predictable, it's boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. It was a bore, but watching Stiller is always a

{"value":"Some things need to be clarified. The picture of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris who starred in this movie. I know that because he was my dad. Please remove that picture. Also, Mark Ferris was the writer, at least one of them. I have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy, that would be great. The movie wasn't all that bad, and trying to compare it to todays world of Star Wars and other high tech sci fi's it futile. If you watch it, just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses. Lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films.","finished_norm":["some","thing","ne","to","be","clarifi","the","pictur","of","mark","ferri","be","not","the","mark","ferri","who","star","in","thi","movi","i","know","that","becaus","he","be","my","dad","pleas","remov","that","pictur","conjur","mark","ferri","be","the","writer","at","littl","on","of","them","i","have","be","try","to","find","a","copi","or","a","wai","to","see","thi","movi","again","it","have","be","year","and","if","someon","can","point","me","in","the","direct","of","obtain","a","copi","that","would","be","great","the","movi","be","not","all","that","bad","and","try","to","compar","it","to","todai","world","of","star","war","and","other","high","tech","sci","fi","it","futil","if","you","watch","it","just","enjoi","it","for","the","redicul","and","humor","it","possess","lighten","up","on","be","movi","snob","and","enjoi","some","littl","creativ","and","innov","film"],"filtered":["thing","ne","clarifi","pictur","mark","ferri","mark","ferri","star","thi","movi","know","becaus","dad","pleas","remov","pictur","conjur","mark","ferri","writer","littl","try","find","copi","wai","see","thi","movi","year","someon","point","direct","obtain","copi","great","movi","bad","try","compar","todai","world","star","war","high","tech","sci","fi","futil","watch","enjoi","redicul","humor","possess","lighten","movi","snob","enjoi","littl","creativ","innov","film"],"filtered2":["thing","ne","clarifi","pictur","mark","ferri","mark","ferri","star","know","becaus","dad","pleas","remov","pictur","conjur","mark","ferri","writer","littl","try","find","copi","wai","see","year","someon","point","direct","obtain","copi","great","bad","try","compar","todai","world","star","war","high","tech","sci","fi","futil","watch","enjoi","redicul","humor","possess","lighten","snob","enjoi","littl","creativ","innov"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,14,22,26,29,33,36,38,39,51,57,66,100,102,110,139,165,200,211,287,311,314,346,369,482,717,747,789,1016,1128,1304,1518,2729,3921,4408,4594,4682,5360,5691,5716,7310,8535],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,14,22,26,29,33,36,38,39,51,57,66,100,102,110,139,165,200,211,287,311,314,346,369,482,717,747,789,1016,1128,1304,1518,2729,3921,4408,4594,4682,5360,5691,5716,7310,8535],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,2.2350163994518417,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,2.9360366939211433,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.929723173391612,4.281092480635563,2.087553710177271,2.1290479736304078,2.2939035841256437,2.448847599972298,5.061642365863941,2.5687161421197025,2.841890188081905,5.8406676183565125,3.189397019426827,3.023389038124396,3.121829110937649,3.3154667220492153,11.21949534386359,7.493177127501487,3.8059428063999263,4.34596758485818,4.251780369798478,4.4637506205145625,4.5432147918688095,5.3560264761848435,5.822646007446338,6.214688095222362,18.644064285667085,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.863456503181687E-5,6.817174611435588E-5,6.870171643528476E-5,6.830475718581779E-5,6.83058762823617E-5,6.821039831744119E-5,6.841326559919852E-5,6.818156240034882E-5,6.833485940775227E-5,7.581379625990527E-5,0.5724750783997892,6.807150232626059E-5,6.934202316072142E-5,7.03312023580499E-5,6.812113935564182E-5,6.793288191796697E-5,6.962738268034783E-5,0.0821388948596143,6.820740362936633E-5,6.82639354399052E-5,6.892442905288941E-5,6.848746199067846E-5,6.856544535614307E-5,6.863931693327474E-5,6.916608842750163E-5,6.880436925676988E-5,7.169677423123461E-5,6.809173935975705E-5,6.809356097324744E-5,6.8266075624903E-5,6.971705508104905E-5,6.841571106984401E-5,7.343847022084736E-5,6.860815436921024E-5,6.816585415588421E-5,6.848048450820733E-5,6.809755026656778E-5,6.813779090851936E-5,6.793254061767561E-5,6.795016545283404E-5,6.810311301708073E-5,6.882145655308186E-5,6.847174581138256E-5,6.82010276689696E-5,6.902974166829239E-5,6.822720359607172E-5,7.049405476849321E-5,6.945741914528427E-5,6.796705478364495E-5,6.811726613118748E-5,6.809364049696356E-5,7.001005150741623E-5,0.20192294575507821,6.794413303087764E-5,6.868991712643706E-5,6.813582504677124E-5,7.327259151693801E-5,6.807967227353623E-5,6.796626878364785E-5,6.829078776899026E-5,6.896817498937567E-5,6.828626994493491E-5,0.12341907133060291,6.811191464288027E-5,6.793336227377955E-5,0.014886216372359097,6.851857630044859E-5,6.837262170092624E-5,6.831282675311552E-5,6.856183786557083E-5,6.793088395698496E-5,6.831425889952759E-5,6.942227082882577E-5,6.805261987431883E-5,6.973688675854409E-5,6.823254408747434E-5,6.876656619142901E-5,6.834629519031293E-5,6.790958562414247E-5,6.799376421959345E-5]}}
{"value":"This movie makes several mistakes. a few American actors in Spain , and the Spanish actors speaking English. the 'spaniards' English is OK, but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying. the dialog through the whole script is very weak; it may have been a Spanish script but translated incorrectly, who knows and who cares. i can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language , they may be good, but not in this flop. you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes, thats how pathetic it is. then the rest is just bad . lots of waste of time, lots of UN-necessary plots. Oh did i mention one of the Baldwins' is in this.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","make","sever","mistak","a","few","american","actor","in","spain","and","the","spanish","actor","speak","english","the","spaniard","english","be","okai","but","the","wai","the","act","be","perform","it","make","it","all","quit","annoi","the","dialog","through","the","whole","script","be","veri","weak","it","mai","have","be","a","spanish","script","but","translat","incorrectli","who","know","and","who","care","i","can","onli","assum","that","thi","be","famou","spanish","actor","forc","into","the","english","languag","thei","mai","be","good","but","not","in","thi","flop","you","will","figur","out","the","movi","within","the","minut","that","how","pathet","it","be","then","the","rest","be","just","bad","lot","of","wast","of","time","lot","of","unnecessari","plot","oh","do","i","mention","on","of","the","baldwin","be","in","thi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","make","sever","mistak","american","actor","spain","spanish","actor","speak","english","spaniard","english","okai","wai","act","perform","make","quit","annoi","dialog","whole","script","veri","weak","mai","spanish","script","translat","incorrectli","know","care","onli","assum","thi","famou","spanish","actor","forc","english","languag","thei","mai","good","thi","flop","figur","movi","within","minut","pathet","rest","bad","lot","wast","time","lot","unnecessari","plot","oh","mention","baldwin","thi"],"filtered2":["make","sever","mistak","american","actor","spain","spanish","actor","speak","english","spaniard","english","okai","wai","act","perform","make","quit","annoi","dialog","whole","script","veri","weak","mai","spanish","script","translat","incorrectli","know","care","onli","assum","famou","spanish","actor","forc","english","languag","mai","good","flop","figur","within","minut","pathet","rest","bad","lot","wast","time","lot","unnecessari","plot","oh","mention","baldwin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,11,15,21,26,32,33,41,46,59,72,77,89,105,111,120,191,205,223,226,234,271,285,316,338,344,379,415,432,588,593,601,672,865,920,1081,1094,1430,1668,1952,2528,4300],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,11,15,21,26,32,33,41,46,59,72,77,89,105,111,120,191,205,223,226,234,271,285,316,338,344,379,415,432,588,593,601,672,865,920,1081,1094,1430,1668,1952,2528,4300],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,4.70627975028631,3.311542587503466,1.8693254449200722,3.841892750832105,3.8927804517536475,1.9940046109572438,2.1765612129984904,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.5460113484259455,2.571852579609833,2.825563294794476,2.5940874818617203,2.673149229007135,2.757740698455715,2.808171552082607,2.878207028279898,2.9720957437368454,2.983093497946387,3.1272886331425473,3.1588018988486244,3.235085203598255,10.912518507975573,3.5227672760500357,3.506637894120152,3.616452760127359,3.9201351739255808,3.952924996748572,4.1302590120314875,4.218628162481577,4.558366596889411,14.902967404307939,4.85885294158718,5.501738287366237,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.27467651322924E-5,8.218878435039084E-5,8.282772377767005E-5,8.234914430728939E-5,8.235049350530408E-5,8.223538397215668E-5,8.247996352633347E-5,8.22006189982997E-5,8.23854359554876E-5,9.140214394886482E-5,0.9041604178290753,8.206792907600181E-5,8.359968627495948E-5,8.479225416953484E-5,8.212777215375963E-5,8.19008064263238E-5,8.394371959312569E-5,8.248769127633102E-5,8.223177353548151E-5,8.229992905518205E-5,8.309622913866984E-5,8.256941570508056E-5,8.266343351117191E-5,8.275249408932278E-5,8.338757696762139E-5,8.295148341548024E-5,8.643860619361045E-5,8.209232711883824E-5,8.209452328083884E-5,8.230250929132503E-5,8.405182985908618E-5,8.248291181900565E-5,8.853841856828684E-5,8.271492407823039E-5,8.218168092511819E-5,8.256100355730946E-5,8.209933282712604E-5,8.214784749239412E-5,8.190039495005036E-5,8.192164369104075E-5,8.210603935480596E-5,0.08937391419175977,8.255046806555852E-5,8.222408659090487E-5,8.322319546020444E-5,8.22556446446499E-5,8.4988591250595E-5,8.373880924350173E-5,8.194200569798587E-5,8.212310254167598E-5,8.209461915571263E-5,8.44050703358921E-5,8.212432437688107E-5,8.191437092108039E-5,8.28134983704355E-5,8.214547742273201E-5,8.833843294666204E-5,8.207777887556049E-5,8.194105808569861E-5,8.233230258835773E-5,8.314896983470604E-5,8.232685583822762E-5,8.192589880676334E-5,8.211665071458479E-5,8.190138554982498E-5,8.379641385515643E-5,8.26069275401393E-5,8.243096268976027E-5,8.235887308738139E-5,8.26590842714709E-5,8.18983976573887E-5,8.236059970257505E-5,8.369643395511111E-5,8.204516413511201E-5,8.407573919921387E-5,8.226208321372334E-5,8.290590752572859E-5,8.23992

{"value":"I don't really know where to start. The acting in this movie was really terrible, I can't remember seeing so many 'actors' in one film that weren't able to act. Not only the acting was bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well.<br /><br />Then there's the action. I believe that even children know that when someone gets shot, there's blood involved. But when someone gets shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there's no blood at all. Well, I guess that's just me.<br /><br />To make a long story short (because believe me, I can go on for hours about this film), this is without a doubt the worst film I ever saw.

{"value":"I myself am a big fan of low-budget 80's horror films. This isn't the worst but still not to spectacular. The plot line is decent but drags out way too long. You're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action. The kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty. I truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick. It's watchable but I feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life. I'll give the film credit for being somewhat original. If you are really into B horror movies it's worth a viewing but if you're not, don't bother.

{"value":"This film is so unbelievable; - the whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is laughable. The vampire himself would not look out of place in a Bela Lugosi film. Most of the acting is so wooden the actors should be treated for dry rot. I await the day when someone makes a decent film from a Steven King novel (with the exception, possibly, of Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most Stephen King films do - lack of money used for the \"special\" effects, poor actors, appalling characterisation and dialogue. This film is cheap, tacky and fails in everything it tries to do.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","so","unbeliev","the","whole","premis","be","bunkum","the","fact","that","a","serial","killer","vampir","or","otherwis","can","fly","around","untrac","and","kill","a","mani","peopl","a","the","film","impli","be","laughabl","the","vampir","himself","would","not","look","out","of","place","in","a","bela","lugosi","film","much","of","the","act","be","so","wooden","the","actor","should","be","treat","for","spindri","rot","i","await","the","dai","when","someon","make","a","decent","film","from","a","steven","king","novel","with","the","except","possibli","of","stand","by","me","thi","film","suffer","from","what","much","stephen","king","film","do","lack","of","monei","us","for","the","special","effect","poor","actor","appal","characteris","and","dialogu","thi","film","be","cheap","tacki","and","fail","in","everyth","it","try","to","do"],"filtered":["thi","film","unbeliev","whole","premis","bunkum","fact","serial","killer","vampir","otherwis","fly","around","untrac","kill","mani","peopl","film","impli","laughabl","vampir","look","place","bela","lugosi","film","much","act","wooden","actor","treat","spindri","rot","await","dai","someon","make","decent","film","steven","king","novel","except","possibli","stand","thi","film","suffer","much","stephen","king","film","lack","monei","us","special","effect","poor","actor","appal","characteris","dialogu","thi","film","cheap","tacki","fail","everyth","try"],"filtered2":["unbeliev","whole","premis","bunkum","fact","serial","killer","vampir","otherwis","fly","around","untrac","kill","mani","peopl","impli","laughabl","vampir","look","place","bela","lugosi","act","wooden","actor","treat","spindri","rot","await","dai","someon","make","decent","steven","king","novel","except","possibli","stand","suffer","stephen","king","lack","monei","us","special","effect","poor","actor","appal","characteris","dialogu","cheap","tacki","fail","everyth","try"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,16,21,23,36,41,50,56,76,97,98,106,111,126,132,139,146,164,183,193,203,215,233,248,252,309,351,377,474,484,485,541,552,558,571,627,633,652,849,890,1133,1194,1347,1447,1561,2169,2203,3032,3163,3585,3742,3772],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,16,21,23,36,41,50,56,76,97,98,106,111,126,132,139,146,164,183,193,203,215,233,248,252,309,351,377,474,484,485,541,552,558,571,627,633,652,849,890,1133,1194,1347,1447,1561,2169,2203,3032,3163,3585,3742,3772],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.4680183469605717,3.1375198335242067,1.717994385570355,1.8610609350701788,2.1337665533324026,2.0545557924622586,2.0881990796736947,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.2391270689902285,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.326138445979858,2.3930275298746078,2.4885128563647294,2.517840471459249,2.569760528637609,2.605934685587711,2.6102777977348763,2.689504733779216,3.0433232530252132,2.848772527704847,3.0135689919434205,3.0602441305135506,3.6466665387238555,3.291526514503207,8.321128723053633,7.604704276538395,3.424750734647968,3.4572130107926293,3.467417180966871,3.477726550625732,3.550241531602284,3.7810747398219124,3.880604335168946,3.8767358583910254,4.403125998698128,4.499089986959872,4.566029469634981,4.477736862489302,4.550761997504193,5.719991853386255,5.02684467282631,5.463272006538442,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149,5.719991853386255,5.7446844659766265]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.008204443820123E-5,6.960946482870992E-5,7.015061204170746E-5,6.974528105799097E-5,6.974642375589668E-5,6.964893219348456E-5,6.98560778765465E-5,6.96194881368034E-5,6.97760181254485E-5,7.741268318743459E-5,0.5639502659471863,6.950710693354893E-5,7.080442261609267E-5,7.181446326299386E-5,6.95577907908337E-5,6.936556306844872E-5,7.109580026999128E-5,6.986262286374774E-5,6.964587434846662E-5,6.970359839547589E-5,7.037802159193455E-5,6.99318390444426E-5,7.00114670523042E-5,7.008689655562898E-5,7.06247774797679E-5,7.025542977594519E-5,7.320883457802623E-5,6.952777075913212E-5,6.952963078982546E-5,6.970578371624033E-5,7.118736383082843E-5,6.98585749213281E-5,7.498726233793544E-5,7.005507678379004E-5,6.960344861085749E-5,6.992471440926232E-5,6.953370421597194E-5,6.957479351924303E-5,6.936521457025142E-5,6.93832111071307E-5,6.953938428298288E-5,7.027287743746835E-5,6.991579141632252E-5,6.963936392125472E-5,7.048555521423044E-5,6.966609188967022E-5,7.198075017484748E-5,7.092225226234125E-5,6.940045662812838E-5,6.955383588140575E-5,6.952971199066944E-5,7.148653945120834E-5,6.955487070988518E-5,6.937705146346687E-5,7.013856388948822E-5,6.957278619814576E-5,0.3399876994656175,6.951544918220693E-5,6.939965405166125E-5,6.973101703095985E-5,7.042269011519829E-5,6.972640392754667E-5,6.938681496051014E-5,6.954837

{"value":"The annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story...It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school. Very sad. Additionally, the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason...there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team didn't really know what they were doing, or just that it should have been shorter...which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week...I'd have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one.","finished_norm":["the","annoi","mous","and","lullabi","realli","get","to","me","and","realli","have","noth","to","do","with","the","storyit","someth","i","would","have","do","my","st","year","in","film","school","veri","sad","addition","the","stori","just","seem","to","drag","on","for","no","appar","reasonther","be","too","mani","thing","just","throw","in","there","that","have","noth","to","do","with","the","stori","which","make","me","feel","that","the","creativ","team","do","not","realli","know","what","thei","be","do","or","just","that","it","should","have","be","shorterwhich","would","have","be","a","bless","not","a","crime","a","i","have","just","watch","all","of","the","episod","up","to","thi","point","over","the","past","weekid","have","to","sai","that","thi","be","by","far","the","wrong","and","i","just","want","to","warn","other","not","to","start","with","thi","on"],"filtered":["annoi","mous","lullabi","realli","get","realli","noth","storyit","someth","st","year","film","school","veri","sad","addition","stori","seem","drag","appar","reasonther","mani","thing","throw","noth","stori","make","feel","creativ","team","realli","know","thei","shorterwhich","bless","crime","watch","episod","thi","point","past","weekid","sai","thi","far","wrong","want","warn","start","thi"],"filtered2":["annoi","mous","lullabi","realli","get","realli","noth","storyit","someth","st","year","school","veri","sad","addition","stori","seem","drag","appar","reasonther","mani","thing","throw","noth","stori","make","feel","creativ","team","realli","know","shorterwhich","bless","crime","watch","point","past","weekid","far","wrong","want","warn","start"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,13,15,17,25,26,29,35,37,43,49,50,53,57,66,71,101,271,296,308,310,440,455,527,723,753,764,1127,1128,2787,3410,4430],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,13,15,17,25,26,29,35,37,43,49,50,53,57,66,71,101,271,296,308,310,440,455,527,723,753,764,1127,1128,2787,3410,4430],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,3.3953824709201923,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,3.3840606616174704,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,2.098582041218749,2.757740698455715,2.9504565686333644,2.8753661172782943,2.854312708080462,3.212973749990824,3.2787058260741455,3.439602492783994,3.865219416329466,3.8690435127678695,3.7465885637507435,4.315570107673808,4.251780369798478,5.521540914662417,5.626901430320244,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.3407602171678682E-4,1.331719157579354E-4,1.342072004169869E-4,1.3343174978322036E-4,1.3343393591221318E-4,1.3324742193500326E-4,1.3364371843752951E-4,1.331910916436332E-4,1.3349055377155975E-4,1.4810048244733563E-4,0.7777478047469683,1.329760918563283E-4,1.354580246683718E-4,0.21177871030362314,1.3307305663531668E-4,1.3270530012239438E-4,1.3601546783323758E-4,1.3365623984516202E-4,1.332415718817076E-4,1.3335200545484946E-4,1.3464226432014883E-4,1.337886593574692E-4,1.339409980427473E-4,1.3408530444543478E-4,1.3511434027114457E-4,1.3440773030912433E-4,1.4005797595416196E-4,1.3301562442918422E-4,1.33019182908644E-4,1.3335618625631747E-4,1.3619064077617443E-4,1.3364849560738878E-4,1.4346033844045593E-4,1.3402442910347948E-4,1.3316040595450567E-4,1.337750290082291E-4,1.3302697590008504E-4,1.3310558505542382E-4,1.327046334002369E-4,1.327390631045755E-4,1.3303784260344702E-4,1.3444110994386587E-4,1.3375795816783387E-4,1.332291165918078E-4,1.3484799005765845E-4,1.3328025065478284E-4,1.377084915401358E-4,1.3568344803231543E-4,1.3277205601832878E-4,1.330654903816978E-4,1.3301933825636834E-4,1.3676300246020834E-4,1.3306747014251658E-4,1.3272727890900501E-4,1.341841507424013E-4,1.3310174479035753E-4,1.4313629826190463E-4,1.329920516577468E-4,1.3277052058566986E-4,1.3340446085331937E-4,1.3472772098659138E-4,1.333956353894168E-4,1.3274595774253649E-4,1.3305503637412648E-4,1.3270623848626875E-4,1.3577678578577143E-4,1.3384944043578608E-4,1.335643215303752E-4,1.3344751349469365E-4,1.339339508940682E-4,1.3270139715222345E-4,1.3345031115930122E-4,1.356147866160361E-4,1.3293920542694048E-4,1.362293814955375E-4,1.3329068318015757E-4,1.3433388290283197E-4,1.3351289330602382E-4,1.3265979135585254E-4,1.3282423227838977E-4]}}

{"value":"I rented this movie roughly 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed.<br /><br />I wanted to see a b-movie slasher flick, but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes. The acting was similar to watching grass dry. I've seen better acting in a softcore film...<br /><br />The idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me. How was this a horror movie?<br /><br />this movie's production value, was laughable at best. There were no scares. It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was all over the place, if existent. If you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one.

{"value":"The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire immensely. The leads had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second could I believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them. The story just didn't ring true. Add to that stilted conversation, tons of stereotypes, and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere, and you've got yourself a real stinker. Kay Lenz's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare, but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time. My thoughts as I watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled

{"value":"Predictable, hackneyed & poorly written. Foolishly I reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit. I guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days (and will only get worse) that one cannot pick and choose much any more. Early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since. The movie lacked intrigue, giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Some of the discourse was, frankly, embarrassing! It's hard to believe anyone would even consider, let alone commit to, the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe.","finished_norm":["predict","hacknei","poorli","write","foolishli","i","reason","such","a","promin","cast","would","not","be","involv","unless","it","have","merit","i","guess","competit","amongst","actor","be","so","intens","thi","dai","and","will","onli","get","wrong","that","on","cannot","pick","and","choos","much","ani","much","earli","on","we","be","give","a","inkl","who","be","be","instrument","in","the","assassin","and","we","have","it","ram","down","our","throat","ever","sinc","the","movi","lack","intrigu","give","u","littl","insight","into","the","victim","and","onli","on","possibl","motiv","for","the","murder","some","of","the","discours","be","frankli","embarrass","it","hard","to","believ","anyon","would","even","consid","let","alon","commit","to","the","spend","of","ten","of","million","of","dollar","to","make","thi","tripe"],"filtered":["predict","hacknei","poorli","write","foolishli","reason","promin","cast","involv","unless","merit","guess","competit","amongst","actor","intens","thi","dai","onli","get","wrong","pick","choos","much","ani","much","earli","give","inkl","instrument","assassin","ram","throat","ever","sinc","movi","lack","intrigu","give","u","littl","insight","victim","onli","possibl","motiv","murder","discours","frankli","embarrass","hard","believ","anyon","even","consid","let","alon","commit","spend","ten","million","dollar","make","thi","tripe"],"filtered2":["predict","hacknei","poorli","write","foolishli","reason","promin","cast","involv","unless","merit","guess","competit","amongst","actor","intens","dai","onli","get","wrong","pick","choos","ani","earli","give","inkl","instrument","assassin","ram","throat","ever","sinc","lack","intrigu","give","u","littl","insight","victim","onli","possibl","motiv","murder","discours","frankli","embarrass","hard","believ","anyon","even","consid","let","alon","commit","spend","ten","million","dollar","make","tripe"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,11,14,25,27,30,41,44,65,91,92,95,112,124,132,158,162,171,183,241,243,266,273,283,317,337,398,402,446,457,460,535,545,557,584,807,902,969,1017,1039,1332,1350,1577,1693,1809,1933,2196,2665,2754,2842,3445,4479,6939,8452],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,11,14,25,27,30,41,44,65,91,92,95,112,124,132,158,162,171,183,241,243,266,273,283,317,337,398,402,446,457,460,535,545,557,584,807,902,969,1017,1039,1332,1350,1577,1693,1809,1933,2196,2665,2754,2842,3445,4479,6939,8452],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.982619630677639,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,2.6728839783437044,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.9073850067444174,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.2323930368088845,2.253494045787767,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,2.4885128563647294,2.6627744961815836,2.627841366673578,2.747702973022204,2.9674191958529437,2.7678802023081546,2.8529247828056143,2.973659465713028,3.143848349181566,3.084424928710765,3.233054746047873,3.3243163373261977,3.216957819005698,3.4986697244709752,3.442099372982581,3.43462735814388,3.5146700658174166,3.900174431363043,3.9201351739255808,4.0536665665501035,4.0536665665501035,4.145296889396028,4.383707912841026,4.470719289830655,4.613282354485526,4.715065048795469,5.014723312293965,4.869215728622727,5.039114765418124,5.274680836730892,5.3064295350454715,5.339219357868463,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.600350576034347,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.748439246255705E-5,6.702932942761896E-5,6.755041854815892E-5,6.716011151014895E-5,6.716121185296219E-5,6.706733390016632E-5,6.726680154818853E-5,6.703898121307378E-5,0.056714881719733906,7.454331470605301E-5,0.8640404588879828,6.693076551693315E-5,6.817999506453592E-5,6.915259767573287E-5,6.697957073293307E-5,6.67944680983909E-5,6.846057255208129E-5,6.727310393974248E-5,6.706438939683548E-5,6.711997385180006E-5,6.776939896547239E-5,6.733975456245497E-5,6.741643108889796E-5,6.74890647320291E-5,6.800700863154993E-5,6.765135112184507E-5,7.049528540433007E-5,6.695066341983557E-5,6.69524545068723E-5,6.712207817174828E-5,6.854874222984022E-5,6.726920603783189E-5,7.220779419139678E-5,6.74584243877289E-5,6.702353620611766E-5,6.733289400807886E-5,6.695637694793321E-5,6.699594324041494E-5,6.679413251758261E-5,6.68114619971585E-5,6.696184647831653E-5,6.766815207060766E-5,6.732430175363882E-5,6.705812028427478E-5,6.787294676046196E-5,6.708385755727727E-5,6.931272101846457E-5,6.829345725238883E-5,6.682806829791011E-5,6.697576241566535E-5,6.695253269793632E-5,0.07403992130432645,6.697675888732649E-5,6.680553066604834E-5,6.753881697118824E-5,6.699401032242128E-5,7.20446952695837E-5,6.693879855288365E-5,6.68272954

{"value":"I am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2/10 For what affects me, it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I still keep wondering why I watched it until the end. First of all, the plot is totally hopeless, and the acting truly awful. I think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci; concerning Mr. Kamar Del's Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his \"Valley of the Dolls\". To sum up, it is total waste of time(and i'm trying to stay polite...) to avoid at any cost.
