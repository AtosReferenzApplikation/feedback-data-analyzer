{"value":"When you're making a thriller about witchcraft, I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work. Some pictures (\"Rosemary's Baby\", for example) have accomplished this; others (like \"Necromancy\") haven't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy. This film does have some atmospheric moments, but about half the dialogue is hard to make out (sometimes it's poorly recorded, at other times just incomprehensible) and Orson Welles, who gets top billing, has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work.

{"value":"Anemic comedy-drama, an unhappy, seemingly rushed affair featuring Cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit-man who's been hired to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear. An air of gloom hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky can't get Cher out of her perpetual funk (she's listless). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), \"Faithful\" is fraudulent, with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life. *1/2 from

{"value":"Throw this lame dog a bone. Sooo bad...you may watch anyway. Kol(Ross Hagen)is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship commander(Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive. John Phillip Law plays a forest/park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far, far away. Costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence. Vincent surely took the money and ran. Law shows the only sign of effort.So bad it is almost comical.

{"value":"I happen to be the director's nephew. It's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. My uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore (I asked). I'm looking forward to bringing him a copy.<br /><br />Currently the film's average rating is 1.9/10. As far as I can tell, that should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the IMDb \"bottom 100,\" however with only 206 votes, it hasn't yet placed.<br /><br />It's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts.

crazy) says in a deadpan voice \"There is no skull there, there's no skull.\"<br /><br />When the real ghost-skulls have the husband caught in a pickle, as if trapped between first and second base.","finished_norm":["warn","possibl","spoiler","belowbr","br","the","film","be","much","bore","then","anyth","els","there","seem","to","be","some","attempt","to","build","tension","through","badli","light","shot","of","empti","room","and","empti","lawn","but","none","of","it","worksbr","br","mstk","do","a","fairli","good","job","with","it","but","on","it","own","the","movi","be","mostli","tediousbr","br","funni","momentsbr","br","when","the","fake","skull","roll","out","of","a","pile","of","ash","the","wife","becom","hyster","and","woozi","while","the","husband","who","be","try","to","drive","the","wife","crazi","sai","in","a","deadpan","voic","there","be","no","skull","there","there","no","skullbr","br","when","the","real","ghostskul","have","the","husband","catch","in","a","pickl","a","if","trap","between","and","base"],"filtered":["warn","possibl","spoiler","belowbr","br","film","much","bore","anyth","els","seem","attempt","build","tension","badli","light","shot","empti","room","empti","lawn","none","worksbr","br","mstk","fairli","good","job","movi","mostli","tediousbr","br","funni","momentsbr","br","fake","skull","roll","pile","ash","wife","becom","hyster","woozi","husband","try","drive","wife","crazi","sai","deadpan","voic","skull","skullbr","br","real","ghostskul","husband","catch","pickl","trap","base"],"filtered2":["warn","possibl","spoiler","belowbr","bore","anyth","els","seem","attempt","build","tension","badli","light","shot","empti","room","empti","lawn","none","worksbr","mstk","fairli","good","job","mostli","tediousbr","funni","momentsbr","fake","skull","roll","pile","ash","wife","becom","hyster","woozi","husband","try","drive","wife","crazi","deadpan","voic","skull","skullbr","real","ghostskul","husband","catch","pickl","trap","base"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,35,36,62,80,104,108,115,177,196,263,289,334,353,370,402,428,441,448,461,477,490,510,512,513,527,536,639,712,795,819,887,1133,1144,1155,1548,2097,2499,4387,6162,6210,6318,8096,8393],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,35,36,62,80,104,108,115,177,196,263,289,334,353,370,402,428,441,448,461,477,490,510,512,513,527,536,639,712,795,819,887,1133,1144,1155,1548,2097,2499,4387,6162,6210,6318,8096,8393],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,2.0226120445069267,1.9951803900462557,2.0728240170322856,2.138507503627933,2.201553588425805,2.458149992634611,2.478925055209576,5.805372584729356,2.8282659991423613,2.942840385588056,3.0266839340212486,2.9958122703541616,3.084424928710765,3.3721070011625462,3.293679367864308,3.2681460658591432,3.358217889001879,3.351345009714117,3.3490645070153917,3.374440724508766,3.369778711402955,3.454678155189441,3.439602492783994,7.250842860220239,3.616452760127359,3.7165362186843414,3.784589681929357,3.835141961092188,3.944626193933877,4.197121957260614,8.459114466027536,4.291900363587903,4.77960356993304,4.9676558014359795,11.083487243959873,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727828E-4,2.5058620691581306E-4,2.506480785860335E-4,2.5059769030472617E-4,2.506214064035923E-4,2.5058482525906555E-4,2.506627606186685E-4,2.5054754232407123E-4,2.505862598746462E-4,2.5084521362060507E-4,2.528355973796034E-4,2.505866737783477E-4,2.5082399519387306E-4,2.508501267267696E-4,2.5073617206405755E-4,2.50598677372758E-4,2.506848930096249E-4,2.508028661725359E-4,2.506116147019668E-4,2.5061069844103863E-4,2.508361608610073E-4,2.5063580707447916E-4,2.5063618639005236E-4,2.5079674661457335E-4,2.506117051038867E-4,2.508531250049422E-4,2.5067441971278985E-4,2.505856453001278E-4,2.506992501229477E-4,2.507757671478341E-4,2.506370364836774E-4,2.507712722224066E-4,2.508943946566081E-4,2.511272635582012E-4,2.5067398654034516E-4,2.505985253806876E-4,2.5068888030138376E-4,2.506239760011384E-4,2.505478097371295E-4,2.5061153709162804E-4,2.5086269267877016E-4,2.507250787007573E-4,2.507718436869291E-4,2.505602794736536E-4,2.5061160081579325E-4,2.5059843114607396E-4,2.506832564429228E-4,2.507267252329181E-4,2.506757413701449E-4,2.5063600882225655E-4,2.5059905085673804E-4,2.511124876152884E-4,2.5066210879661795E-4,2.506115433759325E-4,2.506607664081854E-4,2.50585901683308E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867695E-4,2.505994026657309E-4,2.5058575864248493E-4,2.507862332604839E-4,2.506855613798025E-4,2.5058565389105816E-4,2.505601773897299E-4,2.5053498079616126E-4,2.507615040780929E-4,2.505979299011483E-4,2.5071184239933186E-4,2.507854199692583E-4,2.5067164350437717E-4,2.5061187530261975E-4,2.50560505857426E-4,2.506246038642505E-4,2.505603709024343E-4,2.5057351990548154E-4,2.505605129489128E-4,2.5072316173520927E-4,2.506485384985987E-4,2.505859883584061E-4,2.5061026230912794E-4]}}

It is totally bases on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity. More could have been done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it.

{"value":"This is one strange hacked together film, you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one, I'm not surprised there's no credits on it, who would want to be associated with this film. The Acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over, it all makes very little sense. As I said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be, and all the music was very ill-fitting library music (cheap I guess).

{"value":"The motion picture was, in all likelihood, made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. I would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. Nevertheless, this particular Zane Grey plot appears to be very weak. Also, Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, not acceptable. Some of the actors performed well. Sadly, the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns. They were living on the land long before the white man came, but according to twisted history, they had no right to defend themselves.","finished_norm":["the","motion","pictur","be","in","all","likelihood","make","in","the","year","and","releas","in","i","would","surmis","that","talk","motion","pictur","have","great","difficulti","in","make","the","transit","from","the","silent","era","nevertheless","thi","particular","zane","grei","plot","appear","to","be","veri","weak","conjur","gari","cooper","be","probabl","just","learn","to","act","the","result","be","someth","that","would","not","be","accept","by","todai","standard","for","mayb","for","not","accept","some","of","the","actor","perform","good","sadli","the","indian","alwai","get","the","short","end","in","thi","earli","western","thei","be","live","on","the","land","long","befor","the","white","man","come","but","accord","to","twist","histori","thei","have","no","right","to","defend","themselv"],"filtered":["motion","pictur","likelihood","make","year","releas","surmis","talk","motion","pictur","great","difficulti","make","transit","silent","era","nevertheless","thi","particular","zane","grei","plot","appear","veri","weak","conjur","gari","cooper","probabl","learn","act","result","someth","accept","todai","standard","mayb","accept","actor","perform","good","sadli","indian","alwai","get","short","end","thi","earli","western","thei","live","land","long","befor","white","man","come","accord","twist","histori","thei","right","defend","themselv"],"filtered2":["motion","pictur","likelihood","make","year","releas","surmis","talk","motion","pictur","great","difficulti","make","transit","silent","era","nevertheless","particular","zane","grei","plot","appear","veri","weak","conjur","gari","cooper","probabl","learn","act","result","someth","accept","todai","standard","mayb","accept","actor","perform","good","sadli","indian","alwai","get","short","end","earli","western","live","land","long","befor","white","man","come","accord","twist","histori","right","defend","themselv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,15,21,24,32,34,39,41,45,51,53,57,79,99,105,116,121,148,163,170,186,197,266,272,311,327,359,379,431,435,436,447,499,616,706,741,769,789,832,870,1021,1025,1204,1225,1379,1726,2160,2285,2464,2938,3022,3680,5096],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,15,21,24,32,34,39,41,45,51,53,57,79,99,105,116,121,148,163,170,186,197,266,272,311,327,359,379,431,435,436,447,499,616,706,741,769,789,832,870,1021,1025,1204,1225,1379,1726,2160,2285,2464,2938,3022,3680,5096],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.9469506069506084,2.056430207256609,2.1765612129984904,2.2466628996789315,2.2190595059394194,2.3018654096236517,2.4000574358028657,2.4214486257841834,2.571852579609833,2.558331832813986,2.747702973022204,2.8028805344481915,5.8406676183565125,2.9674191958529437,3.2189558216683714,3.1272886331425473,3.2189558216683714,3.2829611516442836,3.2070272508030975,3.2070272508030975,3.3814747511661465,3.5173618574831282,3.6284289511740746,7.433072437368683,4.0536665665501035,3.8059428063999263,3.7987743169213135,3.944626193933877,8.153955290837102,4.436351646326448,4.3215761317340196,4.470719289830655,4.403125998698128,4.911775343041523,5.014723312293965,5.390512652256013,5.156897801074508,5.695894301807195,5.444579873526289,5.695894301807195,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374516E-4,2.0463497070976423E-4,2.046854966648004E-4,2.0464434833267014E-4,2.0466371549280457E-4,2.0463384241427047E-4,2.0469748638025684E-4,2.0460339623606922E-4,2.0463501395727332E-4,2.048464820698709E-4,2.0647187928241845E-4,2.0463535196139923E-4,2.048291545713376E-4,2.0485049423537853E-4,2.0475743600462703E-4,2.0464515439713903E-4,2.0471556024485955E-4,2.0481190008348816E-4,2.04655719344094E-4,2.046549711024788E-4,2.0483908935972167E-4,2.0467547544121277E-4,2.046757851998071E-4,2.0480690269923535E-4,2.0465579316856524E-4,2.048529427044048E-4,2.047070074884351E-4,2.0463451208033398E-4,2.0472728462307032E-4,2.0478977034141512E-4,2.0467647940754582E-4,2.047860996727677E-4,2.048866445352589E-4,2.0507681111083876E-4,2.0470665374897106E-4,2.0464503027660877E-4,2.0471881636714308E-4,2.0466581389049797E-4,2.0460361461226804E-4,2.046556559655481E-4,2.0486075590640676E-4,2.04748376886402E-4,2.0478656634500503E-4,2.0461379771132915E-4,2.0465570800429694E-4,2.0464495332226385E-4,2.047142237835145E-4,2.0474972148579014E-4,2.0470808678692273E-4,2.0467564019349913E-4,2.0464545939350833E-4,2.0506474470589813E-4,2.0469695408605013E-4,2.046556610974685E-4,2.0469585785804555E-4,2.0463472144925822E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664

{"value":"This was an atrocious waste of my time. No plot. The acting was so far below par, it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what NOT to do. It is merely a commercial rip-off of the earlier Universal Soldier, which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel. Its sad that VD needs to assert his ego every few years, and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it. This kind of schlock gives Martial Arts movies a bad name. By comparison, it makes Segall, Norris, and Arnold look almost talented.<br /><br />Perhaps VD should take the Leslie Nielson track and do send-ups of his genre. At least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","atroci","wast","of","my","time","no","plot","the","act","be","so","far","below","par","it","should","be","us","a","a","exemplar","in","act","class","of","what","not","to","do","it","be","mere","a","commerci","ripoff","of","the","earli","univers","soldier","which","conjur","scrape","the","bottom","of","the","act","barrel","it","sad","that","vd","ne","to","assert","hi","ego","everi","few","year","and","sad","still","that","peopl","will","pai","good","monei","to","sit","thru","it","thi","kind","of","schlock","give","martial","art","movi","a","bad","name","by","comparison","it","make","segal","norri","and","arnold","look","almost","talentedbr","br","perhap","vd","should","take","the","lesli","nielson","track","and","do","sendup","of","hi","genr","at","littl","then","we","can","be","laugh","with","him","instead","of","at","him"],"filtered":["thi","atroci","wast","time","plot","act","far","par","us","exemplar","act","class","mere","commerci","ripoff","earli","univers","soldier","conjur","scrape","bottom","act","barrel","sad","vd","ne","assert","hi","ego","everi","year","sad","still","peopl","pai","good","monei","sit","thru","thi","kind","schlock","give","martial","art","movi","bad","name","comparison","make","segal","norri","arnold","look","almost","talentedbr","br","perhap","vd","take","lesli","nielson","track","sendup","hi","genr","littl","laugh","instead"],"filtered2":["atroci","wast","time","plot","act","far","par","us","exemplar","act","class","mere","commerci","ripoff","earli","univers","soldier","conjur","scrape","bottom","act","barrel","sad","vd","ne","assert","ego","everi","year","sad","still","peopl","pai","good","monei","sit","thru","kind","schlock","give","martial","art","bad","name","comparison","make","segal","norri","arnold","look","almost","talentedbr","perhap","vd","take","lesli","nielson","track","sendup","genr","littl","laugh","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,14,16,21,23,30,31,32,39,56,57,64,85,89,101,110,122,126,131,133,143,152,244,266,318,322,382,455,467,628,657,837,860,867,913,1126,1219,1386,1414,1526,2135,2677,2761,2893,3150,3496,3606,3625,4485,4604,4938,8238],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,9,14,16,21,23,30,31,32,39,56,57,64,85,89,101,110,122,126,131,133,143,152,244,266,318,322,382,455,467,628,657,837,860,867,913,1126,1219,1386,1414,1526,2135,2677,2761,2893,3150,3496,3606,3625,4485,4604,4938,8238],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,3.4860466360051467,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.883428577602134,2.011190219103739,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.2489347673732487,2.2391270689902285,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.3409902041158843,2.3131195476980753,2.634508058031767,2.747702973022204,2.902686292364678,2.885344817328191,3.235085203598255,6.557411652148291,3.342254038012865,3.607563812710113,4.00861390260916,3.8463152616903136,3.8538340941043407,3.8844878351953436,4.067587905068712,4.240607069200353,4.246178114249808,4.715065048795469,4.484804029712395,4.535724120139652,4.956227105612356,5.3560264761848435,5.770002273960917,5.390512652256013,5.649374286172302,5.649374286172302,5.719991853386255,6.255510089742618,5.967828017290836,6.1754673820690815,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852434E-4,2.0810416094933738E-4,2.081555434742426E-4,2.081136975517068E-4,2.0813339304459236E-4,2.0810301352577526E-4,2.0816773645214088E-4,2.080720511914943E-4,2.081042049300244E-4,2.0831925807556946E-4,2.0997222639531553E-4,2.0810454866435665E-4,2.0830163682280354E-4,2.083233382595852E-4,2.0822870240647174E-4,2.0811451728144014E-4,2.081861167241697E-4,2.0828408981847645E-4,2.0812526133664197E-4,2.0812450041003704E-4,2.0831174003631443E-4,2.081453523601864E-4,2.0814566737013875E-4,2.0827900771323672E-4,2.0812533641266439E-4,2.0832582823766937E-4,2.0817741897229797E-4,2.0810369454473199E-4,2.081980398665424E-4,2.0826158490941735E-4,2.081463733468273E-4,2.0825785201168074E-4,2.0836010141789867E-4,2.0855349190005521E-4,2.081770592358653E-4,2.0811439105668627E-4,2.0818942804771043E-4,2.0813552701656111E-4,2.0807227326983933E-4,2.081251968836354E-4,2.0833377389740344E-4,2.082194897084142E-4,2.0825832659544346E-4,2.0808262900365464E-4,2.0812524980460062E-4,2.0811431279772923E-4,2.081847576057068E-4,2.08220857102885E-4,2.0817851656820452E-4,2.0814551990552918E-4,2.0811482744843312E-4,2.085412209325508E-4,2.0816719513391517E-4,2.081252021025576E-4,2.0816608032148446E-4,2.081039074631015E-4,0.9835521036534322,2.08136375147936E-4,2

{"value":"Man, this movie sucked big time! I didn't even manage to see the hole thing (my girlfriend did though). Really bad acting, computer animations so bad you just laugh (woman to werewolf), strange clips, the list goes on and on. Don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie? And I don't mean all the naked ladys... It's something about the light or something... This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women, but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist. My final words are: Don't see it! It's not worth the time. If you wanna see it because the nakedness there's lots of better ones to see!","finished_norm":["man","thi","movi","suck","big","time","i","do","not","even","manag","to","see","the","hole","thing","my","girlfriend","do","though","realli","bad","act","comput","anim","so","bad","you","just","laugh","woman","to","werewolf","strang","clip","the","list","go","on","and","on","do","not","know","if","it","just","me","or","doe","thi","movi","remind","you","of","a","porn","movi","and","i","do","not","mean","all","the","nake","ladi","it","someth","about","the","light","or","someth","thi","can","maybe","becom","a","classic","just","becaus","of","the","bad","act","and","all","the","nake","woman","but","not","becaus","it","a","origin","movi","white","a","nice","plot","twist","my","final","word","be","do","not","see","it","it","not","worth","the","time","if","you","wanna","see","it","becaus","the","naked","there","lot","of","well","on","to","see"],"filtered":["man","thi","movi","suck","big","time","even","manag","see","hole","thing","girlfriend","though","realli","bad","act","comput","anim","bad","laugh","woman","werewolf","strang","clip","list","go","know","doe","thi","movi","remind","porn","movi","mean","nake","ladi","someth","light","someth","thi","maybe","becom","classic","becaus","bad","act","nake","woman","becaus","origin","movi","white","nice","plot","twist","final","word","see","worth","time","wanna","see","becaus","naked","lot","well","see"],"filtered2":["man","suck","big","time","even","manag","see","hole","thing","girlfriend","though","realli","bad","act","comput","anim","bad","laugh","woman","werewolf","strang","clip","list","go","know","doe","remind","porn","mean","nake","ladi","someth","light","someth","maybe","becom","classic","becaus","bad","act","nake","woman","becaus","origin","white","nice","plot","twist","final","word","see","worth","time","wanna","see","becaus","naked","lot","well","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,8,9,13,18,20,21,22,26,29,32,45,53,69,70,72,82,86,88,115,133,156,219,258,262,277,332,345,353,359,417,421,435,472,601,644,730,765,810,893,962,971,1563,2017],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,8,9,13,18,20,21,22,26,29,32,45,53,69,70,72,82,86,88,115,133,156,219,258,262,277,332,345,353,359,417,421,435,472,601,644,730,765,810,893,962,971,1563,2017],"values":[2.6228008218775787,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,3.205071257016622,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,3.893772050208532,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.8162961064622165,3.400636547121535,2.127032521151058,4.189351572503368,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,2.201553588425805,2.3212364753796515,2.3451551414151686,2.5792094178355414,2.7061321952397077,2.726701583487816,3.1163992333432793,2.9705344631698933,3.0022328381570844,3.0266839340212486,3.2189558216683714,3.1932880749197934,3.2597778161886266,3.2829611516442836,3.4222967456864013,3.555828138310924,3.5670958631572662,3.767137231978131,3.965503778955432,3.8425769395797067,8.034927035772286,5.039114765418124,4.181290492043933,4.74221603786142,5.00274712124725]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.082887361285245E-4,2.0810416094933754E-4,2.0815554347424276E-4,2.0811369755170694E-4,2.081333930445925E-4,2.081030135257754E-4,2.0816773645214104E-4,2.0807205119149447E-4,2.0810420493002453E-4,2.0831925807556962E-4,2.0997221075493518E-4,2.081045486643568E-4,2.0830163682280367E-4,2.0832333825958536E-4,2.082287024064719E-4,2.0811451728144028E-4,2.0818611672416987E-4,2.082840898184766E-4,2.0812526133664214E-4,2.0812450041003718E-4,2.083117400363146E-4,2.0814535236018654E-4,2.0814566737013888E-4,2.0827900771323686E-4,2.0812533641266452E-4,2.083258282376695E-4,2.0817741897229814E-4,2.0810369454473215E-4,2.0819803986654256E-4,2.082615849094175E-4,2.0814637334682748E-4,2.0825785201168087E-4,2.083601014178988E-4,2.0855349190005538E-4,2.0817705923586546E-4,2.0811439105668643E-4,2.081894280477106E-4,2.0813552701656125E-4,2.080722732698395E-4,2.0812519688363557E-4,2.0833377389740357E-4,2.0821948970841436E-4,2.082583265954436E-4,2.0808262900365478E-4,2.0812524980460076E-4,2.081143127977294E-4,2.0818475760570694E-4,2.0822085710288515E-4,2.0817851656820466E-4,2.0814551990552935E-4,2.0811482744843328E-4,2.0854122093255098E-4,2.081671951339153E-4,2.0812520210255773E-4,2.0816608032148462E-4,2.0810390746310163E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793617E-4,2.081151196150141E-4,2.0810378867208422E-4,2.0827027669504365E-4,2.081866717851077E-4,2.0810370167923637E-4,2.0808254422608643E-4,2.0806161922774785E-4,2.0824973986735556E-4,2.0811389652918862E-4,2.0820849736595415E-4,2.0826960128161932E-4,2.0817511341634018E-4,2.081254777574934E-4,2.08082817008436E-4,2.0813604843762323E-4,2.080827049324536E-4,2.0809362477628758E-4,2.0808

{"value":"What a disappointment!<br /><br />This film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition. Jack Black's acting/role was self-indulgent and self-regarding... and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We are ( WERE) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration. Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake?<br /><br />We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first!!<br /><br />Was he drunk when he read the script before

{"value":"1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and un-spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated `101 Dalmatians.' Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first one, but the problem is that it plays out much like the original. One of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story, which this one doesn't have. The animation is also very un-spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again. When is Disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re-do's etc.. etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out.","finished_norm":["st","watch","out","of","dirjim","kammerud","brian","smith","drab","and","unspectacular","suppos","sequel","to","the","origin","classic","anim","dalmatian","ye","the","movi","continu","where","it","end","in","the","on","but","the","problem","be","that","it","plai","out","much","like","the","origin","on","of","the","great","thing","about","the","origin","be","the","pace","of","the","stori","which","thi","on","doe","not","have","the","anim","be","conjur","veri","unspectacular","for","disnei","and","all","we","get","be","the","same","charact","go","thru","the","same","kind","of","stori","all","over","again","when","be","disnei","go","to","stop","bore","u","with","sequel","and","redo","etc","etc","probabl","when","we","stop","rent","or","bui","thi","mediocr","fare","that","thei","have","put","out"],"filtered":["st","watch","dirjim","kammerud","brian","smith","drab","unspectacular","suppos","sequel","origin","classic","anim","dalmatian","ye","movi","continu","end","problem","plai","much","like","origin","great","thing","origin","pace","stori","thi","doe","anim","conjur","veri","unspectacular","disnei","get","charact","go","thru","kind","stori","disnei","go","stop","bore","u","sequel","redo","etc","etc","probabl","stop","rent","bui","thi","mediocr","fare","thei","put"],"filtered2":["st","watch","dirjim","kammerud","brian","smith","drab","unspectacular","suppos","sequel","origin","classic","anim","dalmatian","ye","continu","end","problem","plai","like","origin","great","thing","origin","pace","stori","doe","anim","conjur","veri","unspectacular","disnei","get","charact","go","thru","kind","stori","disnei","go","stop","bore","u","sequel","redo","etc","etc","probabl","stop","rent","bui","mediocr","fare","put"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,10,15,17,18,24,29,39,40,51,69,108,112,122,148,149,159,167,209,277,315,332,347,387,429,433,546,661,787,841,1128,1528,1692,1776,3606,4018,6564],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,10,15,17,18,24,29,39,40,51,69,108,112,122,148,149,159,167,209,277,315,332,347,387,429,433,546,661,787,841,1128,1528,1692,1776,3606,4018,6564],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.7139899308309823,6.381097563453174,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.3018654096236517,2.3253197803590226,2.300267965194495,2.4609576687888097,2.6026896854443837,6.232798466686559,5.708625416160924,2.9705344631698933,3.0151989841543516,6.721038771980316,6.5744693248433315,3.164467636384302,3.4572130107926293,3.5727776966246974,3.760240652919071,8.60733041033498,4.315570107673808,4.848596441419991,4.956227105612356,4.760735085628657,5.719991853386255,5.7959777603641776,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815675E-4,2.455731171235748E-4,2.4563375102320027E-4,2.4558437078212703E-4,2.4560761242976696E-4,2.45571763107492E-4,2.456481393351679E-4,2.455352260343835E-4,2.4557316902294263E-4,2.4582694228272666E-4,2.4777750751927847E-4,2.455735746463144E-4,2.458061483401663E-4,2.4583175709999225E-4,2.457200821515688E-4,2.455853381034189E-4,2.456698289576873E-4,2.4578544201440554E-4,2.455980166155372E-4,2.4559711868482105E-4,2.4581807062765696E-4,2.456217250087548E-4,2.4562209673594936E-4,2.457794448809529E-4,2.45598105208926E-4,2.4583469539626136E-4,2.456595651838667E-4,2.455725667432639E-4,2.456838988504997E-4,2.4575888511788307E-4,2.45622929823069E-4,2.457544801154607E-4,2.4587513942998107E-4,2.461033496844448E-4,2.456591406772316E-4,2.455851891520182E-4,2.4567373648188087E-4,2.456101306213583E-4,2.455354880977232E-4,2.4559794055782814E-4,2.458440716644705E-4,2.457092107159916E-4,2.457550401475784E-4,2.455477083715588E-4,2.4559800300716274E-4,2.455850968026104E-4,2.4566822513123824E-4,2.457108243085359E-4,2.4566086040087184E-4,2.4562192272047713E-4,2.455857041156839E-4,2.460888693409167E-4,2.456475005531107E-4,2.4559794671641226E-4,2.4564618501976256E-4,2.455728179973833E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798026E-4,2.455860488865796E-4,2.455726778181562E-4,2.4576914185124127E-4,2.4567048395681887E-4,2.455725751623289E-4,2.4554760832986997E-4,2.4552291580549E-4,2.457449073872681E-4,2.4558460558531494E-4,2.4569623921273035E-4,2.457683448302725E-4,2.4565684451475215E-4,2.4559827200275683E-4,2.45547930226422E-4,2.4561074592378634E-4,2.455477979712656E-4,2.4556068392259204E-4,2.455479371760405E-4,2.457073321002017E-4,2.4563420173500777E-4,2.4557290293850706E-4,2.4559669127792536E-4]}}
{"value":"This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself...<br /><br />Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool. The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment.<br /><br />If you have never seen Rio, or the inside of a British bank, this film is for you. 2 out of

Worest movie since Open water. Don't be to surprised if you completely miss this movie upon release date as I'm sure it wont do very good at all at the box office. This movie had a lot of Potential but fell to little to short. No enough character development, awkward actors and The upside of this movie was nudity. Boobs. Amazing. If I had to see this movie again, I myself would go POSTAl. <<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<","finished_norm":["with","their","no","hold","bar","cruel","offens","humor","sure","enough","to","offend","anyon","you","would","sure","think","thi","would","be","a","laugh","riot","wrong","worest","movi","sinc","open","water","do","not","be","to","surpris","if","you","complet","miss","thi","movi","upon","releas","date","a","i","be","sure","it","wont","do","veri","good","at","all","at","the","box","offic","thi","movi","have","a","lot","of","potenti","but","fall","to","littl","to","short","no","enough","charact","develop","awkward","actor","and","the","upsid","of","thi","movi","be","nuditi","boob","amaz","if","i","have","to","see","thi","movi","again","i","myself","would","go","postal"],"filtered":["hold","bar","cruel","offens","humor","sure","enough","offend","anyon","sure","think","thi","laugh","riot","wrong","worest","movi","sinc","open","water","surpris","complet","miss","thi","movi","upon","releas","date","sure","wont","veri","good","box","offic","thi","movi","lot","potenti","fall","littl","short","enough","charact","develop","awkward","actor","upsid","thi","movi","nuditi","boob","amaz","see","thi","movi","go","postal"],"filtered2":["hold","bar","cruel","offens","humor","sure","enough","offend","anyon","sure","think","laugh","riot","wrong","worest","sinc","open","water","surpris","complet","miss","upon","releas","date","sure","wont","veri","good","box","offic","lot","potenti","fall","littl","short","enough","charact","develop","awkward","actor","upsid","nuditi","boob","amaz","see","go","postal"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,10,12,14,15,25,41,72,93,103,119,133,158,162,169,242,255,272,320,326,327,369,414,547,587,612,630,647,654,685,830,1070,1145,1516,1630,1984,3129,3566,4390,4803,7122],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,10,12,14,15,25,41,72,93,103,119,133,158,162,169,242,255,272,320,326,327,369,414,547,587,612,630,647,654,685,830,1070,1145,1516,1630,1984,3129,3566,4390,4803,7122],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2796387880827016,1.5687599167621034,1.9209463754160525,4.070779654240196,2.098582041218749,6.496022696792991,2.3212364753796515,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.4071371113909277,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.8028805344481915,2.938298364153555,2.942840385588056,2.9674191958529437,3.121829110937649,3.1254654785810323,3.432149042129413,3.6105180246075443,3.5929222627171646,3.558633189238533,3.6746621462132825,3.634471265630037,3.607563812710113,3.9571003681590526,4.176068548062782,4.2574141875167335,4.535724120139652,4.679973728984199,5.014723312293965,5.482320201509136,5.770002273960917,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859354E-4,2.612525409305092E-4,2.6131704620099334E-4,2.612645131159258E-4,2.612892387030441E-4,2.612511004628138E-4,2.613323531820883E-4,2.6121223056003464E-4,2.6125259614356297E-4,2.6152257239224757E-4,2.635976793511528E-4,2.6125302766529375E-4,2.615004507919947E-4,2.615276946273663E-4,2.614088894243553E-4,2.612655421990289E-4,2.613554276499347E-4,2.6147842240272434E-4,2.6127903021247646E-4,2.6127807495041874E-4,2.6151313429716464E-4,2.6130425234607976E-4,2.6130464780742035E-4,2.614720423625507E-4,2.612791244624017E-4,2.615308205288302E-4,2.61344508551698E-4,2.612519554093562E-4,2.613703958813556E-4,2.6145016989374863E-4,2.613055340857287E-4,2.6144548363945044E-4,2.6157384684497796E-4,2.618166279341436E-4,2.613440569410398E-4,2.6126538373733585E-4,2.613595846628695E-4,2.6129191767686454E-4,2.6121250935567074E-4,2.6127894929861263E-4,2.6154079545573903E-4,2.6139732386619744E-4,2.6144607942866165E-4,2.612255098731044E-4,2.6127901573523056E-4,2.612652854915762E-4,2.6135372142190814E-4,2.613990404838677E-4,2.6134588646609526E-4,2.6130446268135765E-4,2.612659315805514E-4,2.6180122304543025E-4,2.6133167361488854E-4,2.612789558504119E-4,2.6133027408698455E-4,2.6125222270562164E-4,0.9793514233924062,2.6129298241519427E-4,2.612662983644795E-4,2.612520735761905E-4,2.6146108150200143E-4,2.613561244696413E-4,2.612519643659641E-4,2.612254034439247E-4,2.611991343440663E-4,2.6143529970892393E-4,2.6126476291089595E-4,2.6138352415462315E-4,2.6146023359260607E-4,2.6134161417251054E-4,2.6127930190573354E-4,2.6122574589302147E-4,2.61292572265301E-4,2.6122560519359936E-4,2.6123931389089393E-4,2.6122575328636115E-4,2.6139532530400014E-4,2.613175256899794E-4,2.6125231307009097E-4,2.612776202543233E-4]}}
{"value":"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but after watching it I was really disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others. A few of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was was not as I imagined it, after reading the book which was awesome, I imagined it darker and a lot scarier. If i was Stephen, I would be really mad!<br /><br />I don't know why they changed the ending, I thought the ending of the book was very good.

{"value":"This was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this.

It was torture enough having to see him imitate Popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on Full House.

{"value":"Fot the most part, this movie feels like a \"made-for-TV\" effort. The direction is ham-fisted, the acting (with the exception of Fred Gwynne) is overwrought and soapy. Denise Crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card. Only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once Gage comes back from the \"Semetary.\" There is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone, and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason. It is absolutely bone-chilling. This film only does one thing right, but it knocks that one thing right out of the park. Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.","finished_norm":["fot","the","much","part","thi","movi","feel","like","a","madefortv","effort","the","direct","be","hamfist","the","act","with","the","except","of","fred","gwynn","be","overwrought","and","soapi","denis","crosbi","particularli","deliv","her","line","like","she","cold","read","them","off","a","cue","card","onli","on","thing","make","thi","film","worth","watch","and","that","be","onc","gage","come","back","from","the","semetari","there","be","someth","disturb","about","watch","a","small","child","murder","someon","and","thi","movi","mai","be","much","than","some","can","handl","just","for","that","reason","it","be","absolut","bonechil","thi","film","onli","doe","on","thing","right","but","it","knock","that","on","thing","right","out","of","the","park","worth","see","just","for","the","last","minut","or","so"],"filtered":["fot","much","part","thi","movi","feel","like","madefortv","effort","direct","hamfist","act","except","fred","gwynn","overwrought","soapi","denis","crosbi","particularli","deliv","line","like","cold","read","cue","card","onli","thing","make","thi","film","worth","watch","onc","gage","come","back","semetari","someth","disturb","watch","small","child","murder","someon","thi","movi","mai","much","handl","reason","absolut","bonechil","thi","film","onli","doe","thing","right","knock","thing","right","park","worth","see","last","minut"],"filtered2":["fot","part","feel","like","madefortv","effort","direct","hamfist","act","except","fred","gwynn","overwrought","soapi","denis","crosbi","particularli","deliv","line","like","cold","read","cue","card","onli","thing","make","worth","watch","onc","gage","come","back","semetari","someth","disturb","watch","small","child","murder","someon","mai","handl","reason","absolut","bonechil","onli","doe","thing","right","knock","thing","right","park","worth","see","last","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,11,18,21,29,34,43,46,53,59,61,63,95,102,107,121,139,144,145,180,219,222,232,236,273,363,401,497,517,839,935,945,1106,1410,1496,1577,2558,2645,4332,4902,5061,6695],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,11,18,21,29,34,43,46,53,59,61,63,95,102,107,121,139,144,145,180,219,222,232,236,273,363,401,497,517,839,935,945,1106,1410,1496,1577,2558,2645,4332,4902,5061,6695],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.9218995441445863,1.982619630677639,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,3.9586154332014196,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.1439533986393955,4.438119011878839,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.7097314792693545,5.158418835671083,2.5771019354959765,2.6102777977348763,2.617923930016232,2.9674191958529437,3.0349689855553557,3.0879275592619675,3.342254038012865,3.4198487640477615,3.965503778955432,4.135246553542527,3.9782428047328615,4.213208095012239,4.443131333311827,4.9676558014359795,4.6973654716960676,5.214056214914456,5.3064295350454715,6.0662680901040895,6.137727054086234,6.600350576034347,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.31874654576517E-4,2.3166917872259965E-4,2.3172637963242854E-4,2.3167979521786165E-4,2.3170172096235672E-4,2.3166790136863865E-4,2.3173995330228212E-4,2.3163343296338682E-4,2.3166922768351226E-4,2.319086327265583E-4,2.337487602278492E-4,2.3166961034116836E-4,2.318890161021827E-4,2.319131749369382E-4,2.318078228369682E-4,2.3168070777104287E-4,2.317604148947183E-4,2.3186948213389032E-4,2.316926684470496E-4,2.3169182135566598E-4,2.31900263369733E-4,2.3171503451076977E-4,2.3171538519139344E-4,2.3186382454808472E-4,2.3169275202442917E-4,2.3191594687179605E-4,2.317507322385731E-4,2.316686595038998E-4,2.3177368817377565E-4,2.318444288443493E-4,2.3171617111051633E-4,2.3184027324578294E-4,2.3195410103209592E-4,2.3216939040434872E-4,2.3175033176679237E-4,2.316805672530209E-4,2.3176410118143964E-4,2.3170409657815972E-4,2.3163368018913938E-4,2.3169259669560054E-4,2.3192479227141037E-4,2.3179756692385685E-4,2.318408015698205E-4,2.316452085715471E-4,2.316926556091585E-4,2.3168048013228184E-4,2.317589018742354E-4,2.31799089157495E-4,2.3175195412256176E-4,2.317152210283857E-4,2.316810530603067E-4,2.321557299136074E-4,2.3173935068699462E-4,2.31692602505496E-4,2.317381096369403E-4,2.316688965324319E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.317050407490892E-4,2.31681378310852E-4,2.316687642899178E-4,2.3185410485865128E-4,2.3176103280889658E-4,2.3166866744629138E-4,2.31645114194051E-4,2.316218197190258E-4,2.3183124250942018E-4,2.3168001672688654E-4,2.3178532984537473E-4,2.3185335296367428E-4,2.31748165609185E-4,2.3169290937467276E-4,2.316454178653597E-4,2.3170467704319533E-4,2.3164529309826863E-4,2.3165744946862304E-4,2.31

I kept waiting for it to pick-up, but unfortunately it never did. The acting is fair, but the script needs A LOT of work. And if you're looking for the nudity, don't waste your time with these not so hot actors. Due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen over five gay films, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you may find this film interesting, otherwise it's your run-of-the-mill low budget movie. It ranks as one of the worst gay films I have ever seen.","finished_norm":["thi","be","yet","anoth","depress","and","bore","film","about","aid","and","tragedi","it","begin","veri","unev","and","predict","and","continu","throughout","the","movi","i","keep","wait","for","it","to","pickup","but","unfortun","it","never","do","the","act","be","fair","but","the","script","ne","a","lot","of","work","and","if","you","re","look","for","the","nuditi","do","not","wast","your","time","with","thi","not","so","hot","actor","due","to","the","poor","sound","qualiti","and","lack","of","caption","i","miss","of","the","movi","if","you","have","never","see","over","five","gai","film","or","have","recent","come","to","term","with","be","gai","you","mai","find","thi","film","interest","otherwis","it","your","runofthemil","low","budget","movi","it","rank","a","on","of","the","wrong","gai","film","i","have","ever","see"],"filtered":["thi","yet","anoth","depress","bore","film","aid","tragedi","begin","veri","unev","predict","continu","throughout","movi","keep","wait","pickup","unfortun","never","act","fair","script","ne","lot","work","re","look","nuditi","wast","time","thi","hot","actor","due","poor","sound","qualiti","lack","caption","miss","movi","never","see","five","gai","film","recent","come","term","gai","mai","find","thi","film","interest","otherwis","runofthemil","low","budget","movi","rank","wrong","gai","film","ever","see"],"filtered2":["yet","anoth","depress","bore","aid","tragedi","begin","veri","unev","predict","continu","throughout","keep","wait","pickup","unfortun","never","act","fair","script","ne","lot","work","re","look","nuditi","wast","time","hot","actor","due","poor","sound","qualiti","lack","caption","miss","never","see","five","gai","recent","come","term","gai","mai","find","interest","otherwis","runofthemil","low","budget","rank","wrong","gai","ever","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,15,16,21,25,34,38,41,42,44,46,48,60,68,72,73,77,89,108,110,134,146,147,178,183,194,217,227,255,256,319,331,337,433,438,504,562,568,612,627,640,666,858,877,1075,1655,1875,1951,6451,6573,7047,7278],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,15,16,21,25,34,38,41,42,44,46,48,60,68,72,73,77,89,108,110,134,146,147,178,183,194,217,227,255,256,319,331,337,433,438,504,562,568,612,627,640,666,858,877,1075,1655,1875,1951,6451,6573,7047,7278],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,1.9940046109572438,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.2443961816702407,2.326138445979858,2.2844323215331563,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,2.5378812223426954,2.6113665294700725,2.6005321873043625,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.9056060024680126,2.932274249550174,2.973659465713028,3.164467636384302,3.1797351085150902,3.3956930001684253,3.432149042129413,3.4471119148061256,3.5929222627171646,3.477726550625732,11.99952574960897,3.6621227969605474,3.8767358583910254,3.865219416329466,4.202455303235976,4.637773374493822,4.911775343041523,4.900964426937307,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612997E-4,2.1169300653874447E-4,2.117452751773489E-4,2.1170270760391557E-4,2.1172274275403071E-4,2.1169183932737045E-4,2.1175767842838516E-4,2.1166034303434351E-4,2.1169305127789731E-4,2.1191181310725417E-4,2.1359327166610992E-4,2.116934009400757E-4,2.1189388796841993E-4,2.119159636557948E-4,2.118196957667696E-4,2.1170354147024005E-4,2.1177637567609532E-4,2.1187603835847075E-4,2.11714470811286E-4,2.1171369676217512E-4,2.1190416541618488E-4,2.1173490831315602E-4,2.117352287555902E-4,2.1187086861014455E-4,2.1171454718202663E-4,2.119184965746199E-4,2.1176752792775885E-4,2.1169253209079146E-4,2.1178850443817656E-4,2.1185314534259413E-4,2.1173594690714984E-4,2.118493480694336E-4,2.1195336081055485E-4,2.1215008639459382E-4,2.1176716198751698E-4,2.1170341306868612E-4,2.1177974410483197E-4,2.1172491352726213E-4,2.1166056894252492E-4,2.1171440524675968E-4,2.1192657926066694E-4,2.118103241917793E-4,2.1184983083759706E-4,2.1167110326541532E-4,2.1171445908036964E-4,2.1170333346011978E-4,2.117749931190511E-4,2.1181171516755474E-4,2.1176864445217797E-4,2.1173507874789016E-4,2.11703856986196E-4,2.121376038089872E-4,2.117571277748943E-4,2.1171441055568442E-4,2.1175599373704466E-4,2.1169274868102964E-4,0.9832684526361802,2.117257762850267E-4,2.117041541913149E-4,2.1169262784141013E-4,2.1186198702179457E-4,2.1177694030929733E-4,2.1169253934833328E-4,2.116710170258214E-4,2.1164973116690388E-4,2.1

{"value":"This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself...<br /><br />Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool. The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment.<br /><br />If you have never seen Rio, or the inside of a British bank, this film is for you. 2 out of

Two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school's basement. That is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. Though that is not fair, some people like Troma's movies and they can watch it if they want. Troma movies for me though, are the worst movies there are out there. I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity.","finished_norm":["what","to","sai","about","thi","movi","good","it","be","about","a","bunch","of","good","student","who","have","some","bad","drug","and","turn","into","delinqu","student","that","sell","much","of","the","bad","drug","to","peopl","two","of","that","peopl","have","advers","effect","a","on","turn","into","a","toxic","aveng","typ","and","hi","girlfriend","throw","up","some","creatur","that","grow","in","the","school","basem","that","be","about","all","there","be","to","it","and","thei","stretch","it","out","for","minut","thi","movi","be","pretti","bad","and","should","be","lock","awai","forev","though","that","be","not","fair","some","peopl","like","troma","movi","and","thei","can","watch","it","if","thei","want","troma","movi","for","me","though","be","the","wrong","movi","there","be","out","there","i","just","watch","thi","on","out","of","morbid","curios"],"filtered":["sai","thi","movi","good","bunch","good","student","bad","drug","turn","delinqu","student","sell","much","bad","drug","peopl","two","peopl","advers","effect","turn","toxic","aveng","typ","hi","girlfriend","throw","creatur","grow","school","basem","thei","stretch","minut","thi","movi","pretti","bad","lock","awai","forev","though","fair","peopl","like","troma","movi","thei","watch","thei","want","troma","movi","though","wrong","movi","watch","thi","morbid","curios"],"filtered2":["good","bunch","good","student","bad","drug","turn","delinqu","student","sell","bad","drug","peopl","two","peopl","advers","effect","turn","toxic","aveng","typ","girlfriend","throw","creatur","grow","school","basem","stretch","minut","pretti","bad","lock","awai","forev","though","fair","peopl","like","troma","watch","want","troma","though","wrong","watch","morbid","curios"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,9,23,25,37,47,59,78,86,96,106,155,296,310,384,419,561,626,697,730,761,861,877,1220,1318,1324,2524,2564,2961,3781,4031,4298,8156],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,9,23,25,37,47,59,78,86,96,106,155,296,310,384,419,561,626,697,730,761,861,877,1220,1318,1324,2524,2564,2961,3781,4031,4298,8156],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,1.9218995441445863,3.205071257016622,4.094543182127343,1.2796387880827016,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,4.062224798544638,4.078141625743051,2.159084361316692,2.3074766467914385,2.9504565686333644,2.854312708080462,3.109204957709252,3.1758963322079246,3.4725585804672896,7.3056408085964675,7.590418501513635,3.767137231978131,3.9405024767500145,3.892300374932137,3.865219416329466,4.30366520516749,4.436351646326448,4.364659717870332,5.170884043049248,5.339219357868463,5.501738287366237,11.999153431210834,5.822646007446338,6.255510089742618,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485937E-4,2.612525409305094E-4,2.6131704620099356E-4,2.61264513115926E-4,2.612892387030443E-4,2.6125110046281395E-4,2.613323531820885E-4,2.6121223056003486E-4,2.612525961435632E-4,2.6152257239224773E-4,2.6359767788534396E-4,2.6125302766529397E-4,2.615004507919949E-4,2.6152769462736654E-4,2.6140888942435554E-4,2.6126554219902906E-4,2.613554276499349E-4,2.6147842240272455E-4,2.612790302124766E-4,2.6127807495041896E-4,2.615131342971648E-4,2.6130425234608E-4,2.6130464780742057E-4,2.614720423625509E-4,2.612791244624019E-4,2.6153082052883037E-4,2.613445085516982E-4,2.612519554093564E-4,2.613703958813558E-4,2.6145016989374885E-4,2.613055340857289E-4,2.6144548363945066E-4,2.6157384684497817E-4,2.6181662793414376E-4,2.6134405694104E-4,2.61265383737336E-4,2.6135958466286973E-4,2.6129191767686476E-4,2.612125093556709E-4,2.6127894929861285E-4,2.615407954557392E-4,2.613973238661976E-4,2.614460794286618E-4,2.6122550987310464E-4,2.612790157352308E-4,2.612652854915764E-4,2.613537214219083E-4,2.6139904048386794E-4,2.613458864660954E-4,2.6130446268135787E-4,2.612659315805516E-4,2.6180122304543047E-4,2.613316736148887E-4,2.6127895585041205E-4,2.6133027408698476E-4,2.6125222270562186E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151945E-4,2.6126629836447973E-4,2.612520735761907E-4,2.6146108150200165E-4,2.6135612446964154E-4,2.6125196436596425E-4,2.612254034439249E-4,2.611991343440665E-4,2.6143529970892415E-4,2.6126476291089617E-4,2.6138352415462337E-4,2.614602335926063E-4,2.6134161417251076E-4,2.6127930190573376E-4,2.6122574589302163E-4,2.612925722653012E-4,2.612256051935996E-4,2.612393138908941E-4,2.6122575328636137E-4,2.6139532530400036E-4,2.6131752568997956E-4,2.612523130700912E-4,2.612776202543235E-4]}}
{"value":"I will probably always go to see a Woody Alleb movie, as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness. Just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score. Saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody, but what can one say? It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which in my opinion, he is rather quite good. Saying all of this, I'll still probably go to any new film Woody may come out with in the future.

{"value":"From the moment the film begins, already there is a discrepancy. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the middle East, and is also an international film, one would expect proper accents portrayed. This is not done as the majority of the cast sound American. Also, I find the acting to be rehearsed at best, the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery. If you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past (albeit the lack of accents) then this movie is worth a rent. If you're looking for a movie as epic as Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.","finished_norm":["from","the","moment","the","film","begin","alreadi","there","be","a","discrep","a","thi","film","take","place","on","the","border","of","normandi","and","the","middl","east","and","be","conjur","a","intern","film","on","would","expect","proper","accent","portrai","thi","be","not","do","a","the","major","of","the","cast","sound","american","conjur","i","find","the","act","to","be","rehears","at","well","the","stori","line","a","littl","difficult","to","follow","from","the","begin","who","be","who","otherwis","the","film","be","veri","accur","in","costum","and","sceneri","if","you","want","to","see","a","movi","to","get","a","feel","of","what","it","be","like","in","the","past","albeit","the","lack","of","accent","then","thi","movi","be","worth","a","rend","if","you","re","look","for","a","movi","a","epic","a","kingdom","of","heaven","then","look","elsewher"],"filtered":["moment","film","begin","alreadi","discrep","thi","film","take","place","border","normandi","middl","east","conjur","intern","film","expect","proper","accent","portrai","thi","major","cast","sound","american","conjur","find","act","rehears","well","stori","line","littl","difficult","follow","begin","otherwis","film","veri","accur","costum","sceneri","want","see","movi","get","feel","like","past","albeit","lack","accent","thi","movi","worth","rend","re","look","movi","epic","kingdom","heaven","look","elsewher"],"filtered2":["moment","begin","alreadi","discrep","take","place","border","normandi","middl","east","conjur","intern","expect","proper","accent","portrai","major","cast","sound","american","conjur","find","act","rehears","well","stori","line","littl","difficult","follow","begin","otherwis","veri","accur","costum","sceneri","want","see","get","feel","like","past","albeit","lack","accent","worth","rend","re","look","epic","kingdom","heaven","look","elsewher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,14,15,16,17,20,21,31,37,38,39,43,68,92,107,130,147,164,178,183,188,219,223,260,330,404,440,469,533,554,559,627,776,803,1138,1381,1543,1567,1601,1618,2185,2350,2580,3148,4097,5845,8225],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,14,15,16,17,20,21,31,37,38,39,43,68,92,107,130,147,164,178,183,188,219,223,260,330,404,440,469,533,554,559,627,776,803,1138,1381,1543,1567,1601,1618,2185,2350,2580,3148,4097,5845,8225],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,3.1077880109725475,1.6608112036218214,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.1439533986393955,2.2642139034199635,4.568864643066313,2.3930275298746078,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,2.5378812223426954,2.5792094178355414,2.825563294794476,2.6754694156628323,2.9292757465539174,3.1419947805322432,3.212973749990824,3.328770687675578,3.424750734647968,3.439602492783994,7.145555393249395,3.477726550625732,3.770603439954617,3.7636829971100436,4.224077767249142,4.449957298382227,4.706176101378222,4.679973728984199,4.613282354485526,4.605250182788262,5.089758498236879,5.0768550934009715,5.339219357868463,5.482320201509136,6.032366538428407,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255696E-4,2.2737792632708255E-4,2.2743406769354586E-4,2.273883461709774E-4,2.274098657807242E-4,2.2737667263379269E-4,2.2744738993572312E-4,2.2734284269338722E-4,2.2737797438108283E-4,2.2761294487884268E-4,2.2941898734736606E-4,2.273783499506982E-4,2.2759369161694284E-4,2.2761740295299313E-4,2.2751400231007003E-4,2.2738924182076194E-4,2.2746747251417893E-4,2.2757451948007183E-4,2.274009809468851E-4,2.2740014954633682E-4,2.2760473054921055E-4,2.2742293271974E-4,2.2742327690463958E-4,2.275689666908075E-4,2.2740106297614496E-4,2.2762012354277277E-4,2.2745796921172078E-4,2.2737741672596972E-4,2.2748049992975602E-4,2.275499302573927E-4,2.274240482660326E-4,2.2754585163377137E-4,2.2765757096628232E-4,2.2786887249241978E-4,2.2745757615795525E-4,2.2738910390558212E-4,2.2747109051910806E-4,2.2741219739254244E-4,2.2734308533973002E-4,2.2740091052450185E-4,2.2762880509736249E-4,2.2750393636919385E-4,2.27546370171562E-4,2.27354400179711E-4,2.2740096834679272E-4,2.273890183985971E-4,2.2746598751966312E-4,2.2750543040620793E-4,2.274591684625192E-4,2.2742311578245454E-4,2.2738958071416687E-4,2.2785546503755464E-4,2.2744679848279357E-4,2.274009162267795E-4,2.274455804209462E-4,2.2737764936397713E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441365E-4,2.2738989994003426E-4,2.2737751957101633E-4,2.2755942704103573E-4,2.27468078982615E-4,2.2737742452124288E-4,2.2735430755038726E-4,2.273314445633671E-4,2.2753698817546116E-4,2.2738856357694837E-4,2.2749192596045108E-4,

{"value":"If you have beloved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other distractions. Massive talent is totally wasted in \"Three Days to Vegas\", with the blame falling squarely on the script. My neighbor's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script, check out \"The Crew\". There really are no redeeming factors here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the shallow script cheats the audience, by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. -

WOW some demented Pokémon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this. Animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the Pokémon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film.

{"value":"Remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid \"movie\" is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty, salted spoon. Perhaps \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" (1992) was a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization I have ever heard of. A boy fighting off spies/terrorists when he's home alone in a Chicago suburb with the chickenpox? Ridiculous! Why did this film have to be made? I am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time, but rather learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all

{"value":"This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end, but it ended up more as a yawn.<br /><br />The writing was trite, the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym, Matt Damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter.<br /><br />The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business, oil and the Middle-East. I have seen documentaries provide more excitement. Watch it only if there's absolutely nothing else to do.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","supposedli","a","thriller","have","about","five","subplot","that","develop","simultan","to","climax","at","the","end","but","it","end","up","much","a","a","yawnbr","br","the","write","be","trite","the","pace","be","slow","and","disjoint","and","the","charact","be","bore","georg","cloonei","look","like","he","ne","to","get","into","a","gym","matt","damon","ham","it","up","and","the","other","seem","to","read","their","line","from","a","teleprompterbr","br","the","wrong","part","of","thi","movi","be","that","it","be","carefulli","craft","to","be","polit","correct","and","so","it","end","up","sai","noth","at","all","about","big","busi","oil","and","the","middleeast","i","have","see","documentari","provid","much","excit","watch","it","onli","if","there","absolut","noth","els","to","do"],"filtered":["thi","movi","supposedli","thriller","five","subplot","develop","simultan","climax","end","end","much","yawnbr","br","write","trite","pace","slow","disjoint","charact","bore","georg","cloonei","look","like","ne","get","gym","matt","damon","ham","seem","read","line","teleprompterbr","br","wrong","part","thi","movi","carefulli","craft","polit","correct","end","sai","noth","big","busi","oil","middleeast","see","documentari","provid","much","excit","watch","onli","absolut","noth","els"],"filtered2":["supposedli","thriller","five","subplot","develop","simultan","climax","end","end","yawnbr","write","trite","pace","slow","disjoint","charact","bore","georg","cloonei","look","like","ne","get","gym","matt","damon","ham","seem","read","line","teleprompterbr","wrong","part","carefulli","craft","polit","correct","end","noth","big","busi","oil","middleeast","see","documentari","provid","excit","watch","onli","absolut","noth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,10,11,16,24,25,35,49,61,65,82,107,108,110,145,196,222,320,390,408,504,524,546,575,624,680,695,714,790,946,1136,1408,1466,1752,2198,2223,2247,2744,3669,4075,5203,5882,7737],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,10,11,16,24,25,35,49,61,65,82,107,108,110,145,196,222,320,390,408,504,524,546,575,624,680,695,714,790,946,1136,1408,1466,1752,2198,2223,2247,2744,3669,4075,5203,5882,7737],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,3.9631084698357775,1.2796387880827016,1.463169012899134,3.3840606616174704,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.020196584395323,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.34599021453259,2.478925055209576,2.5771019354959765,2.938298364153555,3.132778125427319,3.130944944345658,3.3956930001684253,3.4028786598293,3.4572130107926293,3.6314455447135003,3.9241755834625858,3.8095464139032247,3.6715125373103863,3.7297814454343623,3.749984152751882,3.9612932464190886,4.181290492043933,4.484804029712395,4.484804029712395,4.715065048795469,5.02684467282631,5.051537285416681,5.064116067623542,5.5623629091826725,5.672363804397,5.822646007446338,6.342521466732247,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815675E-4,2.4557311712357474E-4,2.4563375102320027E-4,2.45584370782127E-4,2.4560761242976696E-4,2.45571763107492E-4,2.4564813933516786E-4,2.455352260343835E-4,2.455731690229426E-4,2.458269422827266E-4,2.4777750751927847E-4,2.455735746463143E-4,2.4580614834016627E-4,2.4583175709999225E-4,2.457200821515688E-4,2.4558533810341884E-4,2.456698289576872E-4,2.4578544201440554E-4,2.4559801661553715E-4,2.45597118684821E-4,2.458180706276569E-4,2.4562172500875476E-4,2.456220967359493E-4,2.4577944488095283E-4,2.4559810520892596E-4,2.458346953962613E-4,2.456595651838666E-4,2.455725667432639E-4,2.4568389885049963E-4,2.4575888511788307E-4,2.4562292982306894E-4,2.457544801154607E-4,2.45875139429981E-4,2.4610334968444477E-4,2.4565914067723154E-4,2.4558518915201815E-4,2.456737364818808E-4,2.4561013062135824E-4,2.455354880977232E-4,2.455979405578281E-4,2.458440716644704E-4,2.4570921071599157E-4,2.4575504014757836E-4,2.455477083715588E-4,2.455980030071627E-4,2.455850968026104E-4,2.4566822513123824E-4,2.457108243085358E-4,2.4566086040087184E-4,2.4562192272047713E-4,2.455857041156838E-4,2.460888693409167E-4,2.4564750055311067E-4,2.4559794671641226E-4,2.4564618501976256E-4,2.4557281799738326E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798026E-4,2.455860488865795E-4,2.455726778181562E-4,2.457691418512412E-4,2.456704839568188E-4,2.4557257516232884E-4,2.455476083298699E-4,2.4552291580548995E-4,2.457449073872681E-4,2.455846055853149E-4,2.456962392127303E-4,2.457683448302725E-4,2.4565684451475215E-4,2.455982720027568E-4,2.4554793022642197E-4,2.4561074592378634E-4,2.455477979712656E-4,2.45560683922592E-4,2.455479371760404E-4,2.457073321002016E-4,2.456342017350077E-4,2.455729029385

{"value":"I'm not a huge Star Trek fan, but I was looking forward to this. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the Treks we are used to.<br /><br />I didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot. I found the plot to be convoluted and confusing.<br /><br />I will admit that I did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining.<br /><br />And that Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack.<br /><br />But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series.<br /><br

{"value":"This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better. It almost were. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, hero fighting almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger..., music almost like in, say, Conan... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it. Maybe apart of John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like those warriors in Hero or before-mentioned Crouching Tiger... I am really ashamed of poor old John. He is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better. So as you - so if you still have a chance just watch something else.","finished_norm":["thi","be","just","a","bad","movi","with","what","seem","to","be","quit","a","nice","budget","it","have","potenti","to","be","much","well","it","almost","be","with","the","heroin","beauti","almost","like","salma","hayek","hero","fight","almost","like","jacki","chan","battl","and","duel","almost","like","in","crouch","tiger","music","almost","like","in","sai","conan","etc","almost","but","in","the","end","it","just","dull","and","it","be","hard","to","find","anyth","interest","in","it","mayb","apart","of","john","rhysdavi","fly","in","duel","like","that","warrior","in","hero","or","beforement","crouch","tiger","i","be","realli","asham","of","poor","old","john","he","be","after","all","quit","a","good","actor","and","deserv","much","well","so","a","you","so","if","you","still","have","a","chanc","just","watch","someth","els"],"filtered":["thi","bad","movi","seem","quit","nice","budget","potenti","much","well","almost","heroin","beauti","almost","like","salma","hayek","hero","fight","almost","like","jacki","chan","battl","duel","almost","like","crouch","tiger","music","almost","like","sai","conan","etc","almost","end","dull","hard","find","anyth","interest","mayb","apart","john","rhysdavi","fly","duel","like","warrior","hero","beforement","crouch","tiger","realli","asham","poor","old","john","quit","good","actor","deserv","much","well","still","chanc","watch","someth","els"],"filtered2":["bad","seem","quit","nice","budget","potenti","well","almost","heroin","beauti","almost","like","salma","hayek","hero","fight","almost","like","jacki","chan","battl","duel","almost","like","crouch","tiger","music","almost","like","conan","etc","almost","end","dull","hard","find","anyth","interest","mayb","apart","john","rhysdavi","fly","duel","like","warrior","hero","beforement","crouch","tiger","realli","asham","poor","old","john","quit","good","actor","deserv","well","still","chanc","watch","someth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,9,13,20,24,35,38,41,53,60,64,67,104,118,120,131,146,163,171,196,233,256,262,291,325,367,375,423,429,486,547,572,652,786,1308,1584,1775,3441,3663,3676,5080,6191,6740,7050,8354],"values":[5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,9,13,20,24,35,38,41,53,60,64,67,104,118,120,131,146,163,171,196,233,256,262,291,325,367,375,423,429,486,547,572,652,786,1308,1584,1775,3441,3663,3676,5080,6191,6740,7050,8354],"values":[3.230191472788289,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,2.330690080046114,1.3210361566119257,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,2.0728240170322856,2.354379525480895,4.4089000845945225,13.507270849231803,2.326138445979858,2.4000574358028657,2.373087554090762,2.478925055209576,2.8377834061292515,2.748952192422636,2.726701583487816,6.033663275156474,2.973659465713028,3.0791938792932125,6.519555632377253,3.164467636384302,3.2872346624216657,3.3066947359763783,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.7810747398219124,3.900174431363043,4.506310234933358,4.597282013139085,5.089758498236879,5.878215858601149,11.999153431210834,5.822646007446338,6.214688095222362,12.978249881848246,13.589013180950609,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378605E-4,1.918425624800673E-4,1.9188992989069257E-4,1.918513538767773E-4,1.9186951033173347E-4,1.9184150471805332E-4,1.9190117008941612E-4,1.9181296183105997E-4,1.918426030240317E-4,1.9204085156612026E-4,1.935646398278311E-4,1.9184291989840277E-4,1.920246072667785E-4,1.920446129179039E-4,1.9195737206466505E-4,1.918521095514926E-4,1.9191811409701793E-4,1.9200843141398152E-4,1.9186201404870185E-4,1.9186131258214255E-4,1.9203392099871147E-4,1.9188053512690626E-4,1.9188082552146728E-4,1.9200374643273206E-4,1.9186208325816143E-4,1.9204690832504042E-4,1.919100960016599E-4,1.918421325210783E-4,1.9192910554560386E-4,1.9198768507521259E-4,1.9188147633198625E-4,1.9198424387219194E-4,1.920785033430811E-4,1.9225678197762122E-4,1.919097643756187E-4,1.9185199319014684E-4,1.9192116666833775E-4,1.9187147755165296E-4,1.91813166555841E-4,1.918619546321583E-4,1.9205423309796675E-4,1.9194887926185587E-4,1.919846813712056E-4,1.9182271307573E-4,1.9186200341779299E-4,1.9185192104647232E-4,1.9191686118228787E-4,1.9195013980589308E-4,1.9191110782963258E-4,1.9188068957998276E-4,1.9185239548153102E-4,1.9224546988352655E-4,1.9190067107067923E-4,1.9186195944326538E-4,1.9189964337150967E-4,1.9184232880165922E-4,0.9848373691081564,1.9187225940865926E-4,1.9185266481773882E-4,1.9184221929316561E-4,1.9199569767053718E-4,1.91918625784589E-4,1.9184213909808075E-4,1.9182263492281907E-4,1.9180334503797076E-4,1.919767656240518E-4,1.918515373058341E-4,1.9193874587895954E-4,1.919950
