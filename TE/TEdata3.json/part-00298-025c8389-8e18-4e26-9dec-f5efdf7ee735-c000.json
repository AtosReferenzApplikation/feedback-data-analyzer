{"value":"This movie portrays Ruth as a womanizing, hard drinking, gambling, overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in. Babe Ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship, good bad or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than all bad. He was an American hero, an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after. I feel that I am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored. Shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","portrai","ruth","a","a","woman","hard","drink","gambl","overeat","sport","figur","with","a","littl","basebal","throw","in","babe","ruth","earli","life","be","quit","interest","and","thi","be","for","all","intent","and","purpos","be","omit","in","thi","film","conjur","lou","gehrig","be","bare","cover","and","thi","be","a","good","know","relationship","good","bad","or","indiffer","it","should","have","be","cover","well","than","it","be","hi","life","be","much","than","all","bad","he","be","a","american","hero","a","icon","that","a","lot","of","basebal","great","pattern","their","live","after","i","feel","that","i","be","be","fair","to","the","memori","of","a","great","basebal","player","that","thi","film","complet","ignor","shame","on","the","maker","of","thi","film","for","capit","on","hi","fault","and","not","hi","great"],"filtered":["thi","movi","portrai","ruth","woman","hard","drink","gambl","overeat","sport","figur","littl","basebal","throw","babe","ruth","earli","life","quit","interest","thi","intent","purpos","omit","thi","film","conjur","lou","gehrig","bare","cover","thi","good","know","relationship","good","bad","indiffer","cover","well","hi","life","much","bad","american","hero","icon","lot","basebal","great","pattern","live","feel","fair","memori","great","basebal","player","thi","film","complet","ignor","shame","maker","thi","film","capit","hi","fault","hi","great"],"filtered2":["portrai","ruth","woman","hard","drink","gambl","overeat","sport","figur","littl","basebal","throw","babe","ruth","earli","life","quit","interest","intent","purpos","omit","conjur","lou","gehrig","bare","cover","good","know","relationship","good","bad","indiffer","cover","well","life","bad","american","hero","icon","lot","basebal","great","pattern","live","feel","fair","memori","great","basebal","player","complet","ignor","shame","maker","capit","fault","great"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,14,20,26,39,43,51,60,70,72,75,103,116,120,171,223,266,310,375,415,469,491,574,577,594,667,762,763,794,811,877,999,1068,1298,1677,2123,2425,2608,2840,2875,3508,3601,4488,5494,6217],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,14,20,26,39,43,51,60,70,72,75,103,116,120,171,223,266,310,375,415,469,491,574,577,594,667,762,763,794,811,877,999,1068,1298,1677,2123,2425,2608,2840,2875,3508,3601,4488,5494,6217],"values":[1.357228929984541,2.1367141713444147,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,5.141969792492947,1.838176641236591,2.094675786251684,1.9209463754160525,3.948450049740535,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.373087554090762,2.825563294794476,2.747702973022204,2.854312708080462,3.2597778161886266,3.1588018988486244,3.328770687675578,6.73955742280591,3.5039747767006686,3.604618302480356,3.496027715008137,3.6652429242967908,3.7465885637507435,3.749984152751882,3.7465885637507435,3.8425769395797067,3.865219416329466,4.1302590120314875,4.1554492608600455,4.3521595551061,4.770124825978496,5.00274712124725,5.907203395474402,5.390512652256013,16.687088727548016,5.390512652256013,5.604922523601468,5.672363804397,6.1754673820690815,12.778082964734281,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780534E-4,2.1925531043720582E-4,2.193094462670602E-4,2.1926535805328175E-4,2.1928610891855586E-4,2.1925410152956953E-4,2.1932229259911837E-4,2.1922148009526635E-4,2.1925535677457428E-4,2.194819334272077E-4,2.2122345868647695E-4,2.192557189277258E-4,2.1946336794909392E-4,2.1948623224568844E-4,2.193865253813075E-4,2.1926622170779177E-4,2.193416577681338E-4,2.1944488069798167E-4,2.1927754147741047E-4,2.1927673977696283E-4,2.1947401253786448E-4,2.1929870906764093E-4,2.1929904095723207E-4,2.1943952627086723E-4,2.192776205763411E-4,2.1948885564790845E-4,2.193324939519081E-4,2.192548190405606E-4,2.1935421980567496E-4,2.1942116987548006E-4,2.1929978476330163E-4,2.1941723695242683E-4,2.1952496533805862E-4,2.1972871854514207E-4,2.1933211493919229E-4,2.192660887193524E-4,2.1934514652716472E-4,2.192883572382643E-4,2.1922171407356E-4,2.192774735707242E-4,2.1949722707154394E-4,2.1937681902578173E-4,2.1941773696650512E-4,2.1923262471379958E-4,2.1927752932743085E-4,2.1926600626693125E-4,2.193402258220394E-4,2.1937825969134948E-4,2.1933365036190072E-4,2.1929888559081077E-4,2.192665484949162E-4,2.197157900444467E-4,2.193217222746468E-4,2.1927747906929954E-4,2.1932054772559186E-4,2.192550433680464E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630258E-4,2.1926685631708603E-4,2.1925491821167623E-4,2.1943032740576212E-4,2.1934224257171334E-4,2.1925482655736343E-4,2.1923253539347083E-4,2.192104891403556E-4,2.1940869012321282E-4,2.1926556769286473E-4,2.1936523766456556E-4,2.1942961580067287E-4,2.1933006485397473E-4,2.192777694950

{"value":"This movie was a great disappointment for me. I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut out half the story line, but they altered information. The statement that Lucifer is Hope's Father is untrue. He did corrupt her father, but he himself is not her father. The voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death do not watch this movie. It just did not do the comic justice at all!!","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","great","disappoint","for","me","i","have","be","wait","for","thi","movi","to","come","out","for","year","and","i","be","a","faith","follow","of","chao","comic","until","thei","go","bankrupt","not","onli","do","thei","cut","out","half","the","stori","line","but","thei","alter","inform","the","statem","that","lucif","be","hope","father","be","untru","he","do","corrupt","her","father","but","he","himself","be","not","her","father","the","voic","conjur","do","not","suit","the","charact","and","onc","you","hear","the","voic","of","a","belov","charact","the","voic","you","hear","in","your","mind","can","never","be","return","i","can","not","even","rememb","everyth","about","thi","film","that","be","wrong","the","bottom","line","be","if","you","love","ladi","death","do","not","watch","thi","movi","it","just","do","not","do","the","comic","justic","at","all"],"filtered":["thi","movi","great","disappoint","wait","thi","movi","come","year","faith","follow","chao","comic","thei","go","bankrupt","onli","thei","cut","half","stori","line","thei","alter","inform","statem","lucif","hope","father","untru","corrupt","father","father","voic","conjur","suit","charact","onc","hear","voic","belov","charact","voic","hear","mind","never","return","even","rememb","everyth","thi","film","wrong","bottom","line","love","ladi","death","watch","thi","movi","comic","justic"],"filtered2":["great","disappoint","wait","come","year","faith","follow","chao","comic","go","bankrupt","onli","cut","half","stori","line","alter","inform","statem","lucif","hope","father","untru","corrupt","father","father","voic","conjur","suit","charact","onc","hear","voic","belov","charact","voic","hear","mind","never","return","even","rememb","everyth","wrong","bottom","line","love","ladi","death","watch","comic","justic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,10,11,17,25,34,39,42,51,54,57,107,181,187,193,206,216,236,238,245,260,290,303,331,343,428,472,480,488,860,884,1043,1072,1424,1595,1783,2489,2513,3739,5337,7528],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,10,11,17,25,34,39,42,51,54,57,107,181,187,193,206,216,236,238,245,260,290,303,331,343,428,472,480,488,860,884,1043,1072,1424,1595,1783,2489,2513,3739,5337,7528],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,4.287906797278791,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,2.517840471459249,2.597304642813496,5.2140373930679385,2.617923930016232,2.597304642813496,2.7502029743242886,2.6754694156628323,2.8612813773965557,2.868298950055202,2.932274249550174,9.338386877519943,10.116321003487638,3.4222967456864013,6.86925471628776,3.3933092088131493,3.8538340941043407,3.9323057095458362,4.125296222689358,4.268777946167049,4.5432147918688095,4.646072177308517,4.869215728622727,5.185068678041204,5.322690055917252,5.7959777603641776,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918333E-4,2.3612552253122045E-4,2.3618382374676015E-4,2.3613634324334547E-4,2.3615869074724877E-4,2.361242206063241E-4,2.3619765851711896E-4,2.3608908917345165E-4,2.3612557243393576E-4,2.363695826263902E-4,2.382451064669602E-4,2.3612596245232103E-4,2.3634958866039724E-4,2.363742122098562E-4,2.362668335771337E-4,2.3613727335022432E-4,2.362185137048157E-4,2.363296789404441E-4,2.3614946409949655E-4,2.3614860071362583E-4,2.3636105227822508E-4,2.36172260392521E-4,2.3617261781876976E-4,2.36323912526405E-4,2.3614954928455453E-4,2.3637703746512035E-4,2.3620864479495732E-4,2.3612499332492944E-4,2.3623204230611863E-4,2.3630414373063927E-4,2.3617341885568189E-4,2.3629990819577733E-4,2.3641592555151677E-4,2.3663535618876816E-4,2.362082366197784E-4,2.3613713012922468E-4,2.3622227090024014E-4,2.361611120599409E-4,2.3608934115479127E-4,2.3614939096785044E-4,2.3638605301314208E-4,2.3625638038324832E-4,2.3630044668255458E-4,2.361010912949479E-4,2.3614945101465827E-4,2.3613704133264781E-4,2.3621697158016151E-4,2.3625793189828025E-4,2.3620989018287162E-4,2.3617245049795395E-4,2.3613762528140609E-4,2.366214329274517E-4,2.3619704431003958E-4,2.361493968895039E-4,2.3619577938738487E-4,2.3612523491289687E-4,0.9813373836545963,2.3616207439276096E-4,2.3613795678840838E-4,2.3612510012659113E-4,2.3631400587089318E-4,2.362191435050724E-4,2.3612500142009934E-4,2.3610099510202443E-4,2.360772525389535E-4,2.3629070374590509E-4,2.3613656901327537E-4,2.3624390791467575E-4,2.3631323951260884E-4,2.362060287943795E-4,2.361497096615572E-4,2.3610130461469605E-4,2.361617036906904E-4,2.361011774476092E-4,2.3611356765556804E-4,2.3610131129695144E-4,2.3625457404084313E-4,2.3618425711895616E-4,2.36125

{"value":"don't see this. this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen. its hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad view of Mormon life. i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward. if it was i don't think i would have made it through it. its too bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through. i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a B movie. or are there C movies? anyway...i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. i wish some Mormons would start making some quality movies.","finished_norm":["do","not","see","thi","thi","be","on","of","the","dumb","movi","i","have","ever","see","it","hard","to","be","mormon","sometim","when","there","be","movi","like","thi","out","there","what","a","sad","view","of","mormon","life","i","can","tell","you","if","you","do","see","thi","movi","that","it","be","not","all","like","thi","at","all","in","a","singl","ward","if","it","be","i","do","not","think","i","would","have","make","it","through","it","it","too","bad","that","much","mormon","movi","be","make","by","a","group","of","geek","who","have","noth","well","to","do","the","act","be","so","bad","that","my","wife","and","i","bare","make","it","through","i","guess","you","can","sai","that","it","have","all","the","sign","of","a","b","movi","or","be","there","c","movi","anywayi","just","think","thi","movi","suck","and","be","full","of","chees","i","wish","some","mormon","would","start","make","some","qualiti","movi"],"filtered":["see","thi","thi","dumb","movi","ever","see","hard","mormon","sometim","movi","like","thi","sad","view","mormon","life","tell","see","thi","movi","like","thi","singl","ward","think","make","bad","much","mormon","movi","make","group","geek","noth","well","act","bad","wife","bare","make","guess","sai","sign","b","movi","c","movi","anywayi","think","thi","movi","suck","full","chees","wish","mormon","start","make","qualiti","movi"],"filtered2":["see","dumb","ever","see","hard","mormon","sometim","like","sad","view","mormon","life","tell","see","like","singl","ward","think","make","bad","mormon","make","group","geek","noth","well","act","bad","wife","bare","make","guess","sign","b","c","anywayi","think","suck","full","chees","wish","mormon","start","make","qualiti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,9,12,20,21,44,49,71,75,90,171,243,263,312,319,336,399,410,420,421,443,455,500,594,642,876,1115,1861,3003,3242,3736],"values":[4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,9,12,20,21,44,49,71,75,90,171,243,263,312,319,336,399,410,420,421,443,455,500,594,642,876,1115,1861,3003,3242,3736],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,2.1367141713444147,2.133457220525776,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,2.0477128419653545,2.373087554090762,2.627841366673578,2.902686292364678,2.8824835850471584,2.9056060024680126,2.9233055795674137,3.129115117668582,3.2070272508030975,3.3023374306074227,3.2597778161886266,3.239158528985891,3.2787058260741455,3.3814747511661465,3.496027715008137,3.622422927113863,3.8844878351953436,4.2078172463773615,4.911775343041523,24.701869528276326,5.719991853386255,5.7959777603641776]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.731092965484183E-4,2.728672805936192E-4,2.729346536330479E-4,2.7287978503727267E-4,2.729056098721011E-4,2.7286577608575324E-4,2.7295064113039665E-4,2.7282517810867514E-4,2.7286733826132947E-4,2.731493170874149E-4,2.7531667741558354E-4,2.728677889676107E-4,2.7312621200724276E-4,2.731546670463567E-4,2.7303058001336357E-4,2.728808598712507E-4,2.729747414406557E-4,2.7310320428201775E-4,2.72894947533468E-4,2.728939498024641E-4,2.731394593944329E-4,2.729212909901961E-4,2.729217040329179E-4,2.730965405986482E-4,2.728950459735471E-4,2.7315793191883914E-4,2.7296333690222794E-4,2.728666690414246E-4,2.7299037512823086E-4,2.7307369572578827E-4,2.729226297132998E-4,2.730688011304593E-4,2.732028710947009E-4,2.734564457215513E-4,2.7296286521390776E-4,2.7288069436468335E-4,2.7297908326566104E-4,2.729084079474751E-4,2.728254692989801E-4,2.728948630223436E-4,2.7316835031006336E-4,2.7301850027476333E-4,2.730694234072084E-4,2.728390477921339E-4,2.7289493241259416E-4,2.7288059175112345E-4,2.7297295935731203E-4,2.730202932096525E-4,2.729647760758074E-4,2.72921510676539E-4,2.728812665638585E-4,2.73440355963817E-4,2.729499313510654E-4,2.7289486986542213E-4,2.729484696030881E-4,2.72866948221121E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.7290952002183635E-4,2.7288164965423025E-4,2.7286679246170837E-4,2.7308509244124314E-4,2.7297546923950403E-4,2.728666783962244E-4,2.7283893663133626E-4,2.728114996624307E-4,2.7305816444375523E-4,2.728800459376029E-4,2.730040870569748E-4,2.730842068355756E-4,2.729603138450165E-4,2.7289523130563713E-4,2.728392943050011E-4,2.729090916375396E-4,2.72839147350378E-4,2.72853465507583E-4,2.728393020270332E-4,2.7301641286068526E-4,2.729351544391079E-4,2.72867042603005E-4,2.728934748915346E-4]}}

How can you make a movie about nothing. This movie only goes to show why Hollywood is in such a shambles. I can only just look at the spiral of the \"Horror Movie\" industry and giggle.

{"value":"If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still couldn't make it through from beginning to end. I can't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! The acting is atrocious all around, the script is blah, the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened. The \"southern\" accent from the actress playing Amber's mom is laughable - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY talks like that!

{"value":"I'll keep this short; thanks to Greg for helping me to put this succinctly: Captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink, imprisons and tortures her, then poses as a captive to have sex with her.

It's not so bad it's good; it's just bad.<br /><br />It should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a \"spoiler code\" that they dare not break, even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile. Why NO ONE had the cojones to step up and say, \"this is garbage, and this is why,\" is beyond me.<br /><br />Don't give your money to these poop-peddlers.","finished_norm":["i","will","keep","thi","short","thank","to","greg","for","help","me","to","put","thi","succinctli","captiv","be","about","a","gui","who","drug","a","girl","drink","imprison","and","tortur","her","then","pose","a","a","captiv","to","have","sex","with","her","that","be","the","singl","twist","and","punchlin","of","the","film","it","tortur","a","slow","motion","date","rape","and","it","not","even","a","good","movi","it","not","so","bad","it","good","it","just","badbr","br","it","should","conjur","be","mention","that","among","critic","there","be","a","spoiler","code","that","thei","dare","not","break","even","though","some","be","tempt","to","on","thi","on","becaus","it","be","so","vile","why","no","on","have","the","cojon","to","step","up","and","sai","thi","be","garbag","and","thi","be","why","be","beyond","mebr","br","do","not","give","your","monei","to","thi","pooppeddl"],"filtered":["keep","thi","short","thank","greg","help","put","thi","succinctli","captiv","gui","drug","girl","drink","imprison","tortur","pose","captiv","sex","singl","twist","punchlin","film","tortur","slow","motion","date","rape","even","good","movi","bad","good","badbr","br","conjur","mention","among","critic","spoiler","code","thei","dare","break","even","though","tempt","thi","becaus","vile","cojon","step","sai","thi","garbag","thi","beyond","mebr","br","give","monei","thi","pooppeddl"],"filtered2":["keep","short","thank","greg","help","put","succinctli","captiv","gui","drug","girl","drink","imprison","tortur","pose","captiv","sex","singl","twist","punchlin","tortur","slow","motion","date","rape","even","good","bad","good","badbr","conjur","mention","among","critic","spoiler","code","dare","break","even","though","tempt","becaus","vile","cojon","step","garbag","beyond","mebr","give","monei","pooppeddl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,22,30,39,55,84,86,126,134,159,185,254,272,285,360,390,435,443,490,502,579,647,651,667,697,702,746,802,826,1021,1060,1629,1696,1741,1824,1939,2680,2860,3735,4649,4956,5420],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,22,30,39,55,84,86,126,134,159,185,254,272,285,360,390,435,443,490,502,579,647,651,667,697,702,746,802,826,1021,1060,1629,1696,1741,1824,1939,2680,2860,3735,4649,4956,5420],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.852034211452262,1.0683570856722073,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.5538940054862738,1.9536997889255368,2.2212694515902225,2.031112399272319,2.2391270689902285,2.2443961816702407,2.300267965194495,2.518833027372001,2.889652074525771,2.8028805344481915,2.808171552082607,3.028335462059722,3.132778125427319,3.2829611516442836,3.239158528985891,3.3490645070153917,3.3132665011396125,3.5642670069567886,3.6746621462132825,3.5474598886404074,3.6652429242967908,3.7952092507568174,3.6466665387238555,4.00861390260916,7.776772951222001,3.8204358137024927,4.076977645418551,4.160564361526816,4.613282354485526,4.637773374493822,4.751432692966343,4.979216623837056,4.848596441419991,10.612859070090943,5.322690055917252,5.719991853386255,6.137727054086234,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278305E-4,2.5058620691581333E-4,2.5064807858603375E-4,2.5059769030472644E-4,2.506214064035926E-4,2.505848252590658E-4,2.5066276061866876E-4,2.5054754232407155E-4,2.505862598746465E-4,2.5084521362060534E-4,2.528355973796037E-4,2.5058667377834796E-4,2.508239951938734E-4,2.5085012672676986E-4,2.507361720640579E-4,2.5059867737275835E-4,2.5068489300962516E-4,2.5080286617253615E-4,2.5061161470196715E-4,2.5061069844103896E-4,2.508361608610076E-4,2.5063580707447943E-4,2.506361863900527E-4,2.507967466145737E-4,2.50611705103887E-4,2.5085312500494253E-4,2.506744197127901E-4,2.505856453001281E-4,2.5069925012294797E-4,2.507757671478344E-4,2.506370364836777E-4,2.507712722224069E-4,2.508943946566084E-4,2.5112726355820155E-4,2.5067398654034543E-4,2.505985253806879E-4,2.5068888030138403E-4,2.5062397600113874E-4,2.505478097371298E-4,2.506115370916283E-4,2.508626926787705E-4,2.5072507870075764E-4,2.507718436869294E-4,2.505602794736539E-4,2.506116008157935E-4,2.505984311460743E-4,2.5068325644292313E-4,2.507267252329184E-4,2.5067574137014524E-4,2.506360088222568E-4,2.505990508567383E-4,2.511124876152887E-4,2.506621087966182E-4,2.506115433759328E-4,2.5066076640818566E-4,2.505859016833083E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686772E-4,2.5059940266573117E-4,2.505857586424852E-4,2.507862332604842E-4,2.5068556137980284E-4,2.505856538910585E-4,2.505601773897302E-4,2.5053498079616153E-4,2.507615040780932E-4,2.5059792990114857E-4,2.507118423993322E-4,2.5078541996925865E-4,2.506716435043775E-4,2.506118753026201E-4,2.505605058574263E-4,2.506246038642508E-4,2.5056037090243457E-4,2.505735199054818E-4,2.505605129489131E-4,2.507231617352096E-4,2.5064853849859

{"value":"This film has a weak plot, weak characterization, and really weak special effects that I question why I lost valuable life by watching it. It has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. The robots are sad and the main \"hero\" 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. If this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. It's sad when you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for. When all is said and done, this movie was better left on the cutting room floor, or never funded at all.","finished_norm":["thi","film","have","a","weak","plot","weak","character","and","realli","weak","special","effect","that","i","question","why","i","lose","valuabl","life","by","watch","it","it","have","random","charact","who","add","noth","to","the","stori","and","seem","like","excus","for","the","director","to","get","hi","girlfriend","in","the","film","the","robot","be","sad","and","the","main","hero","bot","be","turn","on","by","a","huge","knife","switch","if","thi","movi","be","not","so","bad","it","would","be","laughabl","but","there","noth","funni","about","it","the","main","antagonist","be","on","of","the","onli","redeem","charact","and","he","be","kill","it","sad","when","you","root","for","the","bad","gui","becaus","he","the","well","on","to","cheer","for","when","all","be","sai","and","do","thi","movi","be","well","leav","on","the","cut","room","floor","or","never","fund","at","all"],"filtered":["thi","film","weak","plot","weak","character","realli","weak","special","effect","question","lose","valuabl","life","watch","random","charact","add","noth","stori","seem","like","excus","director","get","hi","girlfriend","film","robot","sad","main","hero","bot","turn","huge","knife","switch","thi","movi","bad","laughabl","noth","funni","main","antagonist","onli","redeem","charact","kill","sad","root","bad","gui","becaus","well","cheer","sai","thi","movi","well","leav","cut","room","floor","never","fund"],"filtered2":["weak","plot","weak","character","realli","weak","special","effect","question","lose","valuabl","life","watch","random","charact","add","noth","stori","seem","like","excus","director","get","girlfriend","robot","sad","main","hero","bot","turn","huge","knife","switch","bad","laughabl","noth","funni","main","antagonist","onli","redeem","charact","kill","sad","root","bad","gui","becaus","well","cheer","well","leav","cut","room","floor","never","fund"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,9,10,11,13,17,20,22,32,35,42,49,55,58,62,74,75,76,96,106,179,203,221,299,303,375,378,379,444,455,513,552,617,634,730,859,1154,1237,1363,1579,1706,2037,2091,2183,3143,4004,6968],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,9,10,11,13,17,20,22,32,35,42,49,55,58,62,74,75,76,96,106,179,203,221,299,303,375,378,379,444,455,513,552,617,634,730,859,1154,1237,1363,1579,1706,2037,2091,2183,3143,4004,6968],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.2979240167361772,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,3.3840606616174704,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,2.1337665533324026,2.0390708128715254,2.159084361316692,5.01593744596019,2.569760528637609,2.6423424573643777,2.7949961309240425,2.868298950055202,3.2597778161886266,3.130944944345658,9.381865899427641,3.2535472664379905,6.557411652148291,3.454678155189441,3.424750734647968,3.5119855004467477,3.5119855004467477,3.767137231978131,3.9405024767500145,4.589376833631972,4.429617614145104,4.396611317676934,4.605250182788262,4.848596441419991,4.944927550358424,5.02684467282631,5.02684467282631,5.501738287366237,5.850044981634453,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612997E-4,2.1169300653874447E-4,2.117452751773489E-4,2.1170270760391557E-4,2.1172274275403071E-4,2.1169183932737045E-4,2.1175767842838516E-4,2.1166034303434351E-4,2.1169305127789731E-4,2.1191181310725417E-4,2.1359327166521077E-4,2.116934009400757E-4,2.1189388796841993E-4,2.119159636557948E-4,2.118196957667696E-4,2.1170354147024005E-4,2.1177637567609532E-4,2.1187603835847075E-4,2.11714470811286E-4,2.1171369676217512E-4,2.1190416541618488E-4,2.1173490831315602E-4,2.117352287555902E-4,2.1187086861014455E-4,2.1171454718202663E-4,2.119184965746199E-4,2.1176752792775885E-4,2.1169253209079146E-4,2.1178850443817656E-4,2.1185314534259413E-4,2.1173594690714984E-4,2.118493480694336E-4,2.1195336081055485E-4,2.1215008639459382E-4,2.1176716198751698E-4,2.1170341306868612E-4,2.1177974410483197E-4,2.1172491352726213E-4,2.1166056894252492E-4,2.1171440524675968E-4,2.1192657926066694E-4,2.118103241917793E-4,2.1184983083759706E-4,2.1167110326541532E-4,2.1171445908036964E-4,2.1170333346011978E-4,2.117749931190511E-4,2.1181171516755474E-4,2.1176864445217797E-4,2.1173507874789016E-4,2.11703856986196E-4,2.121376038089872E-4,2.117571277748943E-4,2.1171441055568442E-4,2.1175599373704466E-4,2.1169274868102964E-4,0.9832684526361811,2.117257762850267E-4,2.117041541913149E-4,2.1169262784141013E-4,2.1186198702179457E-4,2.1177694030929733E-4,2.1169253934833328E-4,2.116710170258214E-4,2.1164973116690388E-4,2.1184109602769707E-4,2.1170291001284934E-4,2.1179914228165462E-4,2.11

{"value":"Well, I like to be honest with all the audiences that I bought it because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other B movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. There is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa!!! how shocking!!! Why don't we nominate this movie for Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from UK, rated 18). Conclusion?

{"value":"This movie is a mess. I'm surprised it even has a theatrical release. WIthout Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video. It is poorly written. It is poorly directed. It's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic.Especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it. Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","mess","i","be","surpris","it","even","have","a","theatric","releas","without","robin","william","it","would","have","go","straight","to","video","it","be","poorli","write","it","be","poorli","direct","it","wrong","offens","be","that","it","have","take","a","interest","topic","and","reduc","it","to","a","ridicul","and","bore","thriller","that","have","no","thrill","and","no","suspens","and","no","inner","or","emot","logicespeci","after","the","half","hour","the","movi","dovetail","into","a","seri","of","ridicul","set","piec","that","be","so","over","the","top","that","the","audienc","i","see","it","with","be","laugh","at","it","save","your","monei","the","trailer","be","total","mislead","it","be","not","suspens","and","there","be","no","thrill","in","fact","the","movi","truli","wrong","offens","be","that","it","be","simpli","bore"],"filtered":["thi","movi","mess","surpris","even","theatric","releas","without","robin","william","go","straight","video","poorli","write","poorli","direct","wrong","offens","take","interest","topic","reduc","ridicul","bore","thriller","thrill","suspens","inner","emot","logicespeci","half","hour","movi","dovetail","seri","ridicul","set","piec","top","audienc","see","laugh","save","monei","trailer","total","mislead","suspens","thrill","fact","movi","truli","wrong","offens","simpli","bore"],"filtered2":["mess","surpris","even","theatric","releas","without","robin","william","go","straight","video","poorli","write","poorli","direct","wrong","offens","take","interest","topic","reduc","ridicul","bore","thriller","thrill","suspens","inner","emot","logicespeci","half","hour","dovetail","ridicul","set","piec","top","audienc","see","laugh","save","monei","trailer","total","mislead","suspens","thrill","fact","truli","wrong","offens","simpli","bore"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,25,31,60,65,97,102,108,109,125,126,133,168,174,184,189,201,206,218,240,274,326,327,342,364,398,407,506,529,548,714,720,950,1145,1218,1627,1883,1910,2013,2528,2757],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,25,31,60,65,97,102,108,109,125,126,133,168,174,184,189,201,206,218,240,274,326,327,342,364,398,407,506,529,548,714,720,950,1145,1218,1627,1883,1910,2013,2528,2757],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.559277576165403,1.4070669811451506,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,2.0545557924622586,2.087553710177271,4.277015007255866,2.125691139326857,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,2.3212364753796515,2.4894767118610357,2.456282578459816,2.496249838866882,2.498193474075453,2.561435818751577,2.597304642813496,2.5940874818617203,2.7666071276613566,5.497904384845272,2.942840385588056,2.9674191958529437,2.9705344631698933,2.9878441007049847,6.287696698363132,3.120015873813468,3.449627639403373,6.929712720210395,3.459754308221302,3.7297814454343623,3.857614816944247,4.125296222689358,8.514828375033467,8.595530966080602,4.944927550358424,4.848596441419991,4.933754249760298,4.9227044135737135,5.185068678041204,5.3560264761848435]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.409702074900609E-4,2.4075667160687825E-4,2.4081611628889952E-4,2.4076770454651013E-4,2.4079049035382488E-4,2.4075534414722306E-4,2.4083022240173444E-4,2.407195236787007E-4,2.407567224883396E-4,2.4100551847254208E-4,2.429178271144851E-4,2.4075712015618716E-4,2.4098513236326814E-4,2.4101023885640508E-4,2.4090075419782672E-4,2.4076865289565086E-4,2.4085148662392346E-4,2.4096483215235845E-4,2.4078108274307994E-4,2.4078020242355194E-4,2.409968208179647E-4,2.4080432614165332E-4,2.4080469057813218E-4,2.4095895264117189E-4,2.407811695988794E-4,2.4101311952363049E-4,2.408414241543335E-4,2.4075613202122122E-4,2.4086528056278396E-4,2.4093879611840715E-4,2.408055073258464E-4,2.409344775116555E-4,2.4105277032522785E-4,2.4127650467341226E-4,2.4084100797358156E-4,2.407685068656461E-4,2.408553175095273E-4,2.407929591559197E-4,2.4071978060217082E-4,2.4078100817709688E-4,2.4102231189432875E-4,2.408900959845996E-4,2.409350265598177E-4,2.407317611987819E-4,2.4078106940160764E-4,2.4076841632749476E-4,2.4084991425345304E-4,2.4089167792962202E-4,2.4084269396814224E-4,2.408045199756396E-4,2.4076901172928752E-4,2.4126230833403933E-4,2.4082959614816167E-4,2.4078101421489223E-4,2.4082830641647607E-4,2.407563783474731E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305164E-4,2.4076934973816359E-4,2.407562409175926E-4,2.4094885168561987E-4,2.4085212877650381E-4,2.4075614027516237E-4,2.407316631192188E-4,2.4070745489132754E-4,2.4092509253415939E-4,2.4076793474448404E-4,2.4087737889248663E-4,2.409480702966882E-4,2.4083875684592358E-4,2.4078133312136925E-4,2.407319787023876E-4,2.4079356239037122E-4,2.4073184904116235E-4,2.4074448225927747E-4,2.4073198551570262E-4,2.4088825421425392E-4,2.4081655816085966E-4,2.407

{"value":"I almost called HBO and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie. I can just see the movie execs sitting around going, \"Okay, we need to come up with something that's just like Home Alone, only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid, hire cut-rate actors, and oh yeah, we'll make it a lot less funny!\"<br /><br />Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you've got here.

{"value":"Okay, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie, the cinematography is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but Sam\" Peckinpah directed the film. Somehow, his direction is not enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment. Even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.<br /><br />The proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch the great Peckinpah films.

{"value":"The John Goodman program was pretty awful, but this thing just plain stinks. The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit. Everybody is unpleasant, and for no reason. The plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable, unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it.

{"value":"awful, just awful! my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this. they changed so much it is hardly recognisable. which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say \"based on a true story\" but are completely fictional. there is none of the emotion or depth of the book, just mindless

{"value":"REALLY??? <br /><br />I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here! <br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one big pathetic, grainy, cliché. I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my other response, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat-line \"good old boy\", liked it. That's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work.... Fine for the others. But Ralph, come on.<br /><br />It was a painful tease from Ralph. I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING.

{"value":"Frank Capra's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film. While it has a few charming moments, and many wonderful performers, Capra's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is downright shoddy. It is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race, which is thrilling. But he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors, then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of the last appearances of Oliver Hardy, skip this one and watch Broadway Bill instead.","finished_norm":["frank","capra","creativ","must","have","be","just","about","spend","by","the","time","he","make","thi","film","while","it","have","a","few","charm","moment","and","mani","wonder","perform","capra","outright","recycl","of","not","just","the","script","but","consider","footag","from","hi","version","of","thi","stori","broadwai","bill","be","downright","shoddi","it","be","understand","that","he","would","reus","footag","from","the","climact","hors","race","which","be","thrill","but","he","us","entir","dialogu","scene","with","minor","actor","then","bring","back","that","actor","and","appar","expect","u","not","to","notic","for","exampl","that","ward","bond","be","year","old","unless","you","want","to","see","on","of","the","last","appear","of","oliv","hardi","skip","thi","on","and","watch","broadwai","bill","instead"],"filtered":["frank","capra","creativ","must","spend","time","make","thi","film","charm","moment","mani","wonder","perform","capra","outright","recycl","script","consider","footag","hi","version","thi","stori","broadwai","bill","downright","shoddi","understand","reus","footag","climact","hors","race","thrill","us","entir","dialogu","scene","minor","actor","bring","back","actor","appar","expect","u","notic","exampl","ward","bond","year","old","unless","want","see","last","appear","oliv","hardi","skip","thi","watch","broadwai","bill","instead"],"filtered2":["frank","capra","creativ","must","spend","time","make","charm","moment","mani","wonder","perform","capra","outright","recycl","script","consider","footag","version","stori","broadwai","bill","downright","shoddi","understand","reus","footag","climact","hors","race","thrill","us","entir","dialogu","scene","minor","actor","bring","back","actor","appar","expect","u","notic","exampl","ward","bond","year","old","unless","want","see","last","appear","oliv","hardi","skip","watch","broadwai","bill","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,17,19,37,41,50,56,57,63,67,77,105,112,130,141,144,152,170,175,188,198,212,220,248,250,283,307,308,460,658,688,722,797,931,1097,1123,1125,1127,1218,1435,1557,1981,1996,2033,2267,2276,2561,2577,3242,4072,4404,6109],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,17,19,37,41,50,56,57,63,67,77,105,112,130,141,144,152,170,175,188,198,212,220,248,250,283,307,308,460,658,688,722,797,931,1097,1123,1125,1127,1218,1435,1557,1981,1996,2033,2267,2276,2561,2577,3242,4072,4404,6109],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.4876543214774305,3.1375198335242067,1.717994385570355,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,1.9463902258768238,2.1765612129984904,2.2466628996789315,2.2642139034199635,2.2657547357741192,2.2931108769894046,2.3131195476980753,2.4214486257841834,2.3791142619576227,2.5378812223426954,2.5439726117360975,2.5983793339432615,2.8336934208777267,2.689504733779216,2.6812935439488212,2.7678802023081546,2.8767855639325206,2.8753661172782943,3.216957819005698,7.626326108746826,3.6016814428070463,7.700135222617728,3.7987743169213135,3.9241755834625858,4.186539847930077,4.390138803171316,4.251780369798478,4.456830177669989,4.297765483040301,4.6973654716960676,4.550761997504193,4.838444069955973,5.672363804397,4.9909126636002465,10.746241819088288,5.214056214914456,5.1994574154933035,5.214056214914456,5.719991853386255,5.878215858601149,5.999576715605417,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374514E-4,2.0463497070976401E-4,2.0468549666480018E-4,2.0464434833266992E-4,2.0466371549280436E-4,2.0463384241427025E-4,2.0469748638025662E-4,2.04603396236069E-4,2.046350139572731E-4,2.0484648206987069E-4,2.0647187939507652E-4,2.04635351961399E-4,2.0482915457133738E-4,2.048504942353783E-4,2.0475743600462682E-4,2.046451543971388E-4,2.0471556024485933E-4,2.0481190008348794E-4,2.0465571934409377E-4,2.046549711024786E-4,2.0483908935972145E-4,2.0467547544121255E-4,2.046757851998069E-4,2.048069026992351E-4,2.0465579316856502E-4,2.0485294270440458E-4,2.0470700748843488E-4,2.0463451208033376E-4,2.047272846230701E-4,2.047897703414149E-4,2.046764794075456E-4,2.0478609967276748E-4,2.0488664453525868E-4,2.0507681111083854E-4,2.0470665374897084E-4,2.0464503027660855E-4,2.0471881636714286E-4,2.0466581389049776E-4,2.0460361461226782E-4,2.046556559655479E-4,2.0486075590640655E-4,2.047483768864018E-4,2.0478656634500482E-4,2.0461379771132893E-4,2.0465570800429672E-4,2.0464495332226363E-4,2.0471422378351428E-4,2.0474972148578992E-4,2.0470808678692252E-4,2.046756401934989E-4,2.0464545939350811E-4,2.0506474470589791E-4,2.0469695408604992E-4,2.0465566109746828E-4,2.0469585785804533E-4,2.04634721449258E-4,0.9838262975205027,2.046666

The sound and environment was good, but there was no story here. Not was there a single moment of fright. I expected it to a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing \"Wednesday\". There are lots of fragments i the movie. Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown. Might be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not for the 21st century.","finished_norm":["not","the","well","of","the","film","to","be","watch","nowadai","i","read","a","lot","of","review","about","shine","and","be","expect","it","to","be","veri","good","but","thi","movi","disappoint","me","the","sound","and","environ","be","good","but","there","be","no","stori","here","not","be","there","a","singl","moment","of","fright","i","expect","it","to","a","horror","thriller","movi","but","there","be","no","horror","no","thriller","the","onli","scene","where","i","get","scare","be","dure","the","chapter","chang","scene","show","wednesdai","there","be","lot","of","fragment","i","the","movi","much","of","the","thing","be","leav","unexplain","with","noth","to","link","it","to","anyth","the","stori","doe","not","tell","u","about","the","woman","or","other","scene","that","be","show","mai","be","a","good","movi","to","watch","in","the","but","not","for","the","st","centuri"],"filtered":["well","film","watch","nowadai","read","lot","review","shine","expect","veri","good","thi","movi","disappoint","sound","environ","good","stori","singl","moment","fright","expect","horror","thriller","movi","horror","thriller","onli","scene","get","scare","dure","chapter","chang","scene","show","wednesdai","lot","fragment","movi","much","thing","leav","unexplain","noth","link","anyth","stori","doe","tell","u","woman","scene","show","mai","good","movi","watch","st","centuri"],"filtered2":["well","watch","nowadai","read","lot","review","shine","expect","veri","good","disappoint","sound","environ","good","stori","singl","moment","fright","expect","horror","thriller","horror","thriller","onli","scene","get","scare","dure","chapter","chang","scene","show","wednesdai","lot","fragment","thing","leav","unexplain","noth","link","anyth","stori","doe","tell","u","woman","scene","show","mai","good","watch","st","centuri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,11,15,17,18,19,20,28,29,46,49,70,72,74,83,90,104,112,130,145,176,178,187,188,239,278,443,623,714,1128,1163,1709,2250,2995,3201,3533,3582,4797,5518],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,11,15,17,18,19,20,28,29,46,49,70,72,74,83,90,104,112,130,145,176,178,187,188,239,278,443,623,714,1128,1163,1709,2250,2995,3201,3533,3582,4797,5518],"values":[2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,3.9371420340352055,1.165345040023057,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,2.094675786251684,3.841892750832105,1.9486336368009016,4.584637595480144,2.0477128419653545,2.0728240170322856,2.2466628996789315,4.528427806839927,2.34599021453259,2.5040471493269134,2.532833256045391,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,2.6593400337329487,2.8336934208777267,3.239158528985891,3.607563812710113,7.459562890868725,4.315570107673808,4.2860694432771105,4.706176101378222,5.051537285416681,5.426230734858092,5.541743621979936,5.672363804397,5.695894301807195,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651695E-4,2.316691787225996E-4,2.317263796324285E-4,2.316797952178616E-4,2.3170172096235667E-4,2.316679013686386E-4,2.3173995330228204E-4,2.3163343296338674E-4,2.316692276835122E-4,2.3190863272655826E-4,2.3374876023239834E-4,2.316696103411683E-4,2.3188901610218262E-4,2.3191317493693816E-4,2.3180782283696816E-4,2.3168070777104281E-4,2.3176041489471824E-4,2.3186948213389024E-4,2.3169266844704953E-4,2.316918213556659E-4,2.3190026336973295E-4,2.3171503451076972E-4,2.317153851913934E-4,2.3186382454808466E-4,2.316927520244291E-4,2.3191594687179597E-4,2.3175073223857302E-4,2.316686595038997E-4,2.3177368817377557E-4,2.3184442884434926E-4,2.3171617111051625E-4,2.3184027324578288E-4,2.3195410103209587E-4,2.3216939040434864E-4,2.317503317667923E-4,2.3168056725302085E-4,2.3176410118143958E-4,2.3170409657815967E-4,2.316336801891393E-4,2.3169259669560049E-4,2.319247922714103E-4,2.3179756692385677E-4,2.3184080156982045E-4,2.3164520857154702E-4,2.3169265560915844E-4,2.3168048013228178E-4,2.3175890187423535E-4,2.3179908915749495E-4,2.3175195412256168E-4,2.3171522102838563E-4,2.3168105306030666E-4,2.3215572991360734E-4,2.3173935068699456E-4,2.316926025054959E-4,2.3173810963694026E-4,2.3166889653243185E-4,0.9816895990098488,2.3170504074908913E-4,2.3168137831085196E-4,2.316687642899177E-4,2.3185410485865123E-4,2.3176103280889653E-4,2.3166866744629133E-4,2.3164511419405094E-4,2.3162181971902575E-4,2.3183124250942012E-4,2.3168001672688648E-4,2.3178532984537465E-4,2.318533529636742E-4,2.3174816560918494E-4,2.316929093746727E-4,2.316454178653596E-4,2.3170467704319527E-4,2.3164529309826855E-4,2.31657449468623E-4,2.316454244215023E-4,2.31795794672145E-4,2.3172680482568865E-4,2.316689766643315E-4,2.316914181478325E-4]}}
{"value":"I cannot believe that this movie was ever created. I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse. The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup. The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies total, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished. Again to reiterate other user comments, the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all. It is never

{"value":"You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. Dont get me wrong, B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever, but if i was an exec seeing this movie, i wouldnt have ordered the series. I dont like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly, and there are tons of cliches. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle. If you are a B5 fan and havent seen this movie, see it. If you arent a B5 fan, dont...you wont want to watch the series.","finished_norm":["you","can","give","jm","and","the","boi","a","pass","on","thi","on","becaus","thei","be","at","the","begin","of","their","seri","and","on","a","small","budget","but","the","movi","be","still","subpar","do","get","me","wrong","b","the","seri","be","by","far","the","well","tv","seri","ever","but","if","i","be","a","exec","see","thi","movi","i","wouldnt","have","order","the","seri","i","do","like","o","hare","a","a","actor","the","costum","be","silli","and","there","be","ton","of","clich","the","same","can","be","sai","for","much","of","the","season","with","the","except","of","babylon","squar","and","survivor","bruce","immedi","put","a","fire","into","the","seri","and","it","go","on","to","be","a","amaz","spectacl","if","you","be","a","b","fan","and","havent","see","thi","movi","see","it","if","you","arent","a","b","fan","dontyou","wont","want","to","watch","the","seri"],"filtered":["give","jm","boi","pass","thi","becaus","thei","begin","seri","small","budget","movi","still","subpar","get","wrong","b","seri","far","well","tv","seri","ever","exec","see","thi","movi","wouldnt","order","seri","like","o","hare","actor","costum","silli","ton","clich","sai","much","season","except","babylon","squar","survivor","bruce","immedi","put","fire","seri","go","amaz","spectacl","b","fan","havent","see","thi","movi","see","arent","b","fan","dontyou","wont","want","watch","seri"],"filtered2":["give","jm","boi","pass","becaus","begin","small","budget","still","subpar","get","wrong","b","far","well","tv","ever","exec","see","wouldnt","order","like","o","hare","actor","costum","silli","ton","clich","season","except","babylon","squar","survivor","bruce","immedi","put","fire","go","amaz","spectacl","b","fan","havent","see","see","arent","b","fan","dontyou","wont","want","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,20,22,25,30,37,41,44,64,101,140,147,159,172,232,256,282,363,385,439,487,551,642,685,776,817,988,994,1335,1581,1955,1960,2471,2629,3129,5310,5738,8327],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,20,22,25,30,37,41,44,64,101,140,147,159,172,232,256,282,363,385,439,487,551,642,685,776,817,988,994,1335,1581,1955,1960,2471,2629,3129,5310,5738,8327],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.883428577602134,2.098582041218749,4.634339551994196,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.5001408943598484,2.6102777977348763,2.748952192422636,2.918851229218033,3.0349689855553557,3.09496984188738,3.2872346624216657,3.3220965805878846,3.528202072035993,10.867268781341588,3.607563812710113,3.770603439954617,4.197121957260614,4.035401218572811,4.140259095366071,4.933754249760298,4.671389985292807,4.869215728622727,4.9909126636002465,5.170884043049248,5.2288713006995975,5.482320201509136,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351967E-4,2.5580823473939296E-4,2.558713957686222E-4,2.5581995743348233E-4,2.558441677579871E-4,2.5580682428995945E-4,2.5588638376375963E-4,2.557687644066794E-4,2.5580828880184827E-4,2.560726389488424E-4,2.5810450080632436E-4,2.558087113309912E-4,2.5605097834607794E-4,2.560776544404391E-4,2.559613250483809E-4,2.558209650712686E-4,2.5590897737707457E-4,2.5602940901184936E-4,2.5583417200467437E-4,2.558332366495585E-4,2.560633975365527E-4,2.558588685280094E-4,2.5585925574823345E-4,2.5602316192690783E-4,2.5583426429050217E-4,2.5608071520047073E-4,2.558982858246214E-4,2.558076614200598E-4,2.55923633681826E-4,2.560017452638824E-4,2.558601235571694E-4,2.559971566675943E-4,2.5612284488059513E-4,2.563605665947127E-4,2.5589784362518923E-4,2.5582080991179787E-4,2.5591304776099067E-4,2.558467909040108E-4,2.557690373924244E-4,2.5583409277699456E-4,2.5609048225741537E-4,2.5595000050774447E-4,2.5599774004100704E-4,2.557817669888661E-4,2.558341578291234E-4,2.5582071371340584E-4,2.5590730670555504E-4,2.559516813523954E-4,2.558996350243204E-4,2.558590744800585E-4,2.5582134633837344E-4,2.56345482732278E-4,2.5588571835822845E-4,2.558340991922592E-4,2.5588434799543196E-4,2.558079231460724E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539956E-4,2.5582170547880075E-4,2.558077771243863E-4,2.5601242948243726E-4,2.5590965967558333E-4,2.558076701900187E-4,2.557816627775903E-4,2.557559411059885E-4,2.5598718496251E-4,2.5582020202291345E-4,2.5593648837176616E-4,2.560115992428351E-4,2.5589545176211634E-4,2.558344380360486E-4,2.5578199809030583E-4,2.5584743185131726E-4,2.5578186032295373E-4,2.5579528334132134E-4,2.557820053295739E-4,2.5594804359407815E-4,2.5587186526541896E-4,2.5580801162741426E-4,2.5583279142898723E-4]}}
{"value":"There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie. I never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince. Fiennes just can't do Irish and Fitzgerald isn't much better at Russian. When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. As the for the major problem....the plot....was there one? I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous.

{"value":"First of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the movie is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film.","finished_norm":["of","all","thi","movi","be","not","a","comedi","unless","you","realli","forc","yourself","you","can","hardli","laugh","secondli","the","movi","be","slow","and","bore","the","act","be","not","bad","but","not","special","there","be","a","lucki","luke","comic","about","two","famili","on","with","big","nose","and","on","with","big","ear","fight","each","other","in","a","small","town","you","will","laugh","much","much","if","you","read","thi","instead","of","wast","your","time","with","thi","movi","religion","and","dogma","be","not","the","well","sourc","to","make","a","good","comedi","and","thi","movi","doe","noth","much","than","confirm","thi","rule","there","be","a","similar","subject","comedi","the","home","teacher","thi","have","some","good","moment","my","final","comment","be","do","not","wast","your","time","and","monei","to","watch","thi","uninspir","and","bore","film"],"filtered":["thi","movi","comedi","unless","realli","forc","hardli","laugh","secondli","movi","slow","bore","act","bad","special","lucki","luke","comic","two","famili","big","nose","big","ear","fight","small","town","laugh","much","much","read","thi","instead","wast","time","thi","movi","religion","dogma","well","sourc","make","good","comedi","thi","movi","doe","noth","much","confirm","thi","rule","similar","subject","comedi","home","teacher","thi","good","moment","final","comment","wast","time","monei","watch","thi","uninspir","bore","film"],"filtered2":["comedi","unless","realli","forc","hardli","laugh","secondli","slow","bore","act","bad","special","lucki","luke","comic","two","famili","big","nose","big","ear","fight","small","town","laugh","read","instead","wast","time","religion","dogma","well","sourc","make","good","comedi","doe","noth","confirm","rule","similar","subject","comedi","home","teacher","good","moment","final","comment","wast","time","monei","watch","uninspir","bore"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,8,9,13,18,20,21,47,49,82,89,108,126,127,133,145,152,156,182,188,203,233,280,302,338,363,390,450,460,480,550,589,665,1114,1289,1471,1549,1588,1788,1952,2024,2321,2478,2988,5942],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,8,9,13,18,20,21,47,49,82,89,108,126,127,133,145,152,156,182,188,203,233,280,302,338,363,390,450,460,480,550,589,665,1114,1289,1471,1549,1588,1788,1952,2024,2321,2478,2988,5942],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,4.040393168790646,3.9880092219144876,4.277015007255866,2.2391270689902285,7.30790381132591,4.642472950759303,2.34599021453259,2.3131195476980753,2.3451551414151686,2.7365296724240786,2.5378812223426954,2.569760528637609,2.8377834061292515,2.8028805344481915,2.902686292364678,2.9720957437368454,3.0349689855553557,3.132778125427319,3.469984576472117,3.216957819005698,3.43462735814388,3.4751392270607813,3.530930586689197,3.5929222627171646,4.364659717870332,4.443131333311827,4.9227044135737135,4.528289141652134,4.654440426979034,4.798834931860927,4.911775343041523,4.890269137820559,5.444579873526289,5.129498826886393,5.390512652256013,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805325E-4,2.192553104372057E-4,2.1930944626706006E-4,2.192653580532816E-4,2.192861089185557E-4,2.192541015295694E-4,2.1932229259911823E-4,2.1922148009526622E-4,2.1925535677457415E-4,2.1948193342720754E-4,2.212234586864768E-4,2.1925571892772566E-4,2.1946336794909378E-4,2.194862322456883E-4,2.1938652538130738E-4,2.1926622170779164E-4,2.1934165776813367E-4,2.194448806979815E-4,2.192775414774103E-4,2.192767397769627E-4,2.1947401253786435E-4,2.192987090676408E-4,2.1929904095723194E-4,2.194395262708671E-4,2.1927762057634097E-4,2.194888556479083E-4,2.1933249395190797E-4,2.1925481904056047E-4,2.1935421980567483E-4,2.1942116987547992E-4,2.192997847633015E-4,2.194172369524267E-4,2.1952496533805848E-4,2.1972871854514193E-4,2.1933211493919215E-4,2.1926608871935226E-4,2.1934514652716458E-4,2.1928835723826416E-4,2.1922171407355985E-4,2.1927747357072407E-4,2.194972270715438E-4,2.193768190257816E-4,2.1941773696650498E-4,2.1923262471379944E-4,2.1927752932743072E-4,2.1926600626693112E-4,2.1934022582203923E-4,2.1937825969134934E-4,2.193336503619006E-4,2.1929888559081063E-4,2.1926654849491607E-4,2.1971579004444655E-4,2.1932172227464666E-4,2.1927747906929938E-4,2.1932054772559172E-4,2.1925504336804626E-4,0.9826707519944573,2.192892508163024E-4,2.192668563170859E-4,2.192549182116761E-4,2.1943032740576198E-4,2.193422425717132E-4,2.192548265573633E-4,2.192325353934707E-4,2.1921048914035545E-4,2.1940869012321266E-4,2.1926556769286457E-4,2.1936523766456542E-4,2.1942961580067273E-4,2.193300648539746E-4,2.

{"value":"Warning Spoilers following. Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, scandalous!

Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people!

{"value":"I recently bought the DVD, forgetting just how much I hated the movie version of \"A Chorus Line.\" Every change the director Attenborough made to the story failed.<br /><br />By making the Director-Cassie relationship so prominent, the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window.<br /><br />Some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed. The show's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to Cassie's character.<br /><br />The overall staging is very self-conscious.<br /><br />The only reason I give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.","finished_norm":["i","recent","bui","the","dvd","forget","just","how","much","i","hate","the","movi","version","of","a","choru","line","everi","chang","the","director","attenborough","make","to","the","stori","failedbr","br","by","make","the","directorcassi","relationship","so","promin","the","entir","ensemblepremis","of","the","music","sail","out","the","windowbr","br","some","of","the","music","number","be","spe","up","and","rush","the","show","hit","song","get","the","entir","mean","shatter","when","it","be","give","to","cassi","characterbr","br","the","overal","stage","be","veri","selfconsciousbr","br","the","onli","reason","i","give","it","a","be","becaus","a","few","of","the","great","number","be","still","abl","to","be","enjoi","despit","the","film","attempt","to","squeez","everi","bite","of","joi","and","spontan","out","of","it"],"filtered":["recent","bui","dvd","forget","much","hate","movi","version","choru","line","everi","chang","director","attenborough","make","stori","failedbr","br","make","directorcassi","relationship","promin","entir","ensemblepremis","music","sail","windowbr","br","music","number","spe","rush","show","hit","song","get","entir","mean","shatter","give","cassi","characterbr","br","overal","stage","veri","selfconsciousbr","br","onli","reason","give","becaus","great","number","still","abl","enjoi","despit","film","attempt","squeez","everi","bite","joi","spontan"],"filtered2":["recent","bui","dvd","forget","hate","version","choru","line","everi","chang","director","attenborough","make","stori","failedbr","make","directorcassi","relationship","promin","entir","ensemblepremis","music","sail","windowbr","music","number","spe","rush","show","hit","song","get","entir","mean","shatter","give","cassi","characterbr","overal","stage","veri","selfconsciousbr","onli","reason","give","becaus","great","number","still","abl","enjoi","despit","attempt","squeez","everi","bite","joi","spontan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,11,15,17,22,28,30,51,58,64,85,88,95,107,118,154,177,198,200,220,247,278,328,339,347,372,388,391,412,454,562,577,669,1364,1384,1429,2180,3134,3865,3916,3996,4511,4824,5060,5531,7194],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,11,15,17,22,28,30,51,58,64,85,88,95,107,118,154,177,198,200,220,247,278,328,339,347,372,388,391,412,454,562,577,669,1364,1384,1429,2180,3134,3865,3916,3996,4511,4824,5060,5531,7194],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.5452294193519092,2.6728839783437044,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.883428577602134,4.022380438207478,2.0317223413467334,2.0323326556775485,2.1439533986393955,4.70875905096179,2.348499626138016,2.458149992634611,5.087945223472195,2.5308211829319704,2.8336934208777267,2.7303758068497004,2.8336934208777267,3.1550424959247185,3.003844442051426,3.0151989841543516,3.0316467233633775,3.0914425013694116,3.109204957709252,3.107414446935464,3.2556198060399626,3.432149042129413,3.604618302480356,3.7099788181381825,4.436351646326448,9.041818068709022,4.535724120139652,5.0768550934009715,6.032366538428407,5.7446844659766265,6.437831646536572,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.0662680901040895,6.214688095222362,6.543192162194399,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255707E-4,2.2737792632708268E-4,2.27434067693546E-4,2.2738834617097754E-4,2.274098657807243E-4,2.2737667263379282E-4,2.2744738993572326E-4,2.2734284269338735E-4,2.2737797438108297E-4,2.2761294487884279E-4,2.294189873473662E-4,2.273783499506983E-4,2.2759369161694294E-4,2.2761740295299324E-4,2.2751400231007016E-4,2.2738924182076208E-4,2.2746747251417904E-4,2.2757451948007194E-4,2.2740098094688524E-4,2.2740014954633693E-4,2.2760473054921066E-4,2.274229327197401E-4,2.274232769046397E-4,2.275689666908076E-4,2.2740106297614506E-4,2.2762012354277287E-4,2.274579692117209E-4,2.2737741672596985E-4,2.2748049992975613E-4,2.275499302573928E-4,2.2742404826603271E-4,2.275458516337715E-4,2.2765757096628242E-4,2.278688724924199E-4,2.2745757615795536E-4,2.2738910390558223E-4,2.274710905191082E-4,2.2741219739254255E-4,2.2734308533973012E-4,2.2740091052450199E-4,2.276288050973626E-4,2.2750393636919398E-4,2.2754637017156212E-4,2.2735440017971112E-4,2.2740096834679286E-4,2.2738901839859722E-4,2.2746598751966323E-4,2.2750543040620804E-4,2.2745916846251933E-4,2.2742311578245468E-4,2.2738958071416698E-4,2.2785546503755475E-4,2.274467984827937E-4,2.274009162267796E-4,2.274455804209463E-4,2.2737764936397724E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.274131240744138E-4,2.273898999400344E-4,2.2737751957101643E-4,2.2755942704103587E-4,2.2746807898261514E-4,2.2737742452124302E-4,2.273543075503874E-4,2.2733144456336723E-4,2.2753698817546127E-4,2.2738856357694848E-4,2.2749192596045119E-

{"value":"This is one of the worse cases of film drivel I have seen in a long while. It is so awful, that I am not sure where to begin, or even if it is worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I feel sorry for 'Sly' as he puts in a decent performance for his part. But that plot ... Oh dear oh dear. I particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way. A climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes! I could go on: but it isn't worth it. Apart from the grim opening (which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is drivel. Sorry folks, but this is about as bad as film making gets.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","case","of","film","drivel","i","have","see","in","a","long","while","it","be","so","aw","that","i","be","not","sure","where","to","begin","or","even","if","it","be","worth","it","the","plot","be","the","real","problem","and","i","feel","sorri","for","sly","a","he","put","in","a","decent","perform","for","hi","part","but","that","plot","oh","dear","oh","dear","i","particularli","love","the","wai","near","the","end","he","manag","to","pop","from","the","foot","of","a","mountain","to","the","top","whilst","the","helicopt","be","on","the","wai","a","climb","of","a","dai","or","two","take","him","all","of","five","minut","i","can","go","on","but","it","be","not","worth","it","apart","from","the","grim","open","which","even","a","five","year","old","would","be","abl","to","predict","the","outcom","of","the","rest","be","drivel","sorri","folk","but","thi","be","about","a","bad","a","film","make","get"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","case","film","drivel","see","long","aw","sure","begin","even","worth","plot","real","problem","feel","sorri","sly","put","decent","perform","hi","part","plot","oh","dear","oh","dear","particularli","love","wai","near","end","manag","pop","foot","mountain","top","whilst","helicopt","wai","climb","dai","two","take","five","minut","go","worth","apart","grim","open","even","five","year","old","abl","predict","outcom","rest","drivel","sorri","folk","thi","bad","film","make","get"],"filtered2":["wrong","case","drivel","see","long","aw","sure","begin","even","worth","plot","real","problem","feel","sorri","sly","put","decent","perform","part","plot","oh","dear","oh","dear","particularli","love","wai","near","end","manag","pop","foot","mountain","top","whilst","helicopt","wai","climb","dai","two","take","five","minut","go","worth","apart","grim","open","even","five","year","old","abl","predict","outcom","rest","drivel","sorri","folk","bad","make","get"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,9,24,25,31,32,33,43,47,54,57,59,61,67,80,99,105,119,132,138,147,159,167,219,226,234,242,288,309,337,345,364,437,454,497,504,555,572,952,981,1008,1532,1667,1941,1983,2372,2964,3083,3237,6153],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,9,24,25,31,32,33,43,47,54,57,59,61,67,80,99,105,119,132,138,147,159,167,219,226,234,242,288,309,337,345,364,437,454,497,504,555,572,952,981,1008,1532,1667,1941,1983,2372,2964,3083,3237,6153],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,2.803707089537043,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,1.9570915389266579,1.9951803900462557,2.056430207256609,2.1765612129984904,2.1653408989309972,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.4609576687888097,5.158418835671083,2.5940874818617203,5.34629845801427,2.689504733779216,2.8015621426949333,2.848772527704847,2.973659465713028,3.0022328381570844,2.9878441007049847,6.390478590102111,3.2556198060399626,3.342254038012865,6.791386000336851,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.9868265484242533,4.039936373738201,4.086456389373095,4.646072177308517,4.8796870284900224,9.71770588317436,9.889855100716847,5.290429193699031,5.463272006538442,5.672363804397,5.521540914662417,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378624E-4,1.9184256248006747E-4,1.9188992989069273E-4,1.9185135387677745E-4,1.9186951033173366E-4,1.9184150471805348E-4,1.9190117008941628E-4,1.9181296183106014E-4,1.918426030240319E-4,1.9204085156612045E-4,1.9356463982783125E-4,1.9184291989840296E-4,1.9202460726677867E-4,1.9204461291790409E-4,1.9195737206466524E-4,1.9185210955149277E-4,1.919181140970181E-4,1.920084314139817E-4,1.91862014048702E-4,1.9186131258214274E-4,1.9203392099871163E-4,1.9188053512690642E-4,1.9188082552146744E-4,1.9200374643273224E-4,1.918620832581616E-4,1.9204690832504061E-4,1.919100960016601E-4,1.9184213252107846E-4,1.9192910554560402E-4,1.9198768507521278E-4,1.9188147633198642E-4,1.9198424387219213E-4,1.9207850334308126E-4,1.922567819776214E-4,1.9190976437561885E-4,1.91851993190147E-4,1.9192116666833794E-4,1.9187147755165312E-4,1.9181316655584116E-4,1.9186195463215846E-4,1.9205423309796694E-4,1.9194887926185606E-4,1.9198468137120577E-4,1.9182271307573018E-4,1.9186200341779315E-4,1.9185192104647248E-4,1.9191686118228803E-4,1.9195013980589324E-4,1.9191110782963277E-4,1.9188068957998294E-4,1.9185239548153118E-4,1.9224546988352671E-4,1.9190067107067942E-4,1.9186195944326554E-4,1.9189964337150984E-4,1.9184232880165939E-4,0.9848373691081564,1.9187225940865945E-4,1.918526648177

{"value":"That is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing British school. Oh yes it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asked to. Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Great.<br /><br />Basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in If... Nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory movie. Do you see how boring I mean?<br /><br />At least that oldie helped Kubrick cast McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self-indulgent sentimentalism.","finished_norm":["that","be","quit","a","outdat","movi","which","aim","to","showcas","the","youth","yearn","for","freedom","in","some","dehuman","british","school","oh","ye","it","like","in","the","armi","you","learn","to","obei","and","do","what","you","re","ask","to","ye","the","young","dream","of","someth","els","but","it","break","their","dream","and","sweep","awai","their","optim","on","the","threshold","of","life","greatbr","br","basic","that","how","you","can","sum","up","the","nice","intent","in","if","nice","intent","that","arous","no","cinematograph","challeng","the","result","be","a","declamatori","movi","do","you","see","how","bore","i","meanbr","br","at","littl","that","oldi","help","kubrick","cast","mcdowel","in","a","clockwork","orang","a","movi","with","a","truli","power","social","satir","and","no","selfindulg","sentiment"],"filtered":["quit","outdat","movi","aim","showcas","youth","yearn","freedom","dehuman","british","school","oh","ye","like","armi","learn","obei","re","ask","ye","young","dream","someth","els","break","dream","sweep","awai","optim","threshold","life","greatbr","br","basic","sum","nice","intent","nice","intent","arous","cinematograph","challeng","result","declamatori","movi","see","bore","meanbr","br","littl","oldi","help","kubrick","cast","mcdowel","clockwork","orang","movi","truli","power","social","satir","selfindulg","sentiment"],"filtered2":["quit","outdat","aim","showcas","youth","yearn","freedom","dehuman","british","school","oh","ye","like","armi","learn","obei","re","ask","ye","young","dream","someth","els","break","dream","sweep","awai","optim","threshold","life","greatbr","basic","sum","nice","intent","nice","intent","arous","cinematograph","challeng","result","declamatori","see","bore","meanbr","littl","oldi","help","kubrick","cast","mcdowel","clockwork","orang","truli","power","social","satir","selfindulg","sentiment"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,14,53,68,75,92,108,120,135,155,185,196,209,234,262,286,296,306,342,360,365,431,447,607,696,811,975,982,1148,1208,1278,1462,1640,2642,2901,3068,3077,3233,3245,3360,3765,4078,4272,4737,5159,5200,6272,6979,7946,8237],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,14,53,68,75,92,108,120,135,155,185,196,209,234,262,286,296,306,342,360,365,431,447,607,696,811,975,982,1148,1208,1278,1462,1640,2642,2901,3068,3077,3233,3245,3360,3765,4078,4272,4737,5159,5200,6272,6979,7946,8237],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.1175081997259209,1.7003182735607676,2.0064197866819473,1.9742250248702675,2.0489535369135887,2.138507503627933,2.2044500422972613,2.366244071437088,2.3074766467914385,2.518833027372001,2.478925055209576,5.2053793708887675,2.673149229007135,5.453403166975632,2.780700890737216,2.9504565686333644,2.8739486825973213,2.9705344631698933,3.028335462059722,3.185521045582134,3.2189558216683714,3.2070272508030975,7.36198256252986,3.8095464139032247,7.685153879159413,4.086456389373095,4.1554492608600455,4.176068548062782,4.339813719283801,4.535724120139652,4.550761997504193,4.688631791727313,5.3064295350454715,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.482320201509136,5.521540914662417,5.719991853386255,6.101359409915359,5.7959777603641776,5.878215858601149,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780534E-4,2.1925531043720582E-4,2.193094462670602E-4,2.1926535805328175E-4,2.1928610891855586E-4,2.1925410152956953E-4,2.1932229259911837E-4,2.1922148009526635E-4,2.1925535677457428E-4,2.194819334272077E-4,2.2122345868647803E-4,2.192557189277258E-4,2.1946336794909392E-4,2.1948623224568844E-4,2.193865253813075E-4,2.1926622170779177E-4,2.193416577681338E-4,2.1944488069798167E-4,2.1927754147741047E-4,2.1927673977696283E-4,2.1947401253786448E-4,2.1929870906764093E-4,2.1929904095723207E-4,2.1943952627086723E-4,2.192776205763411E-4,2.1948885564790845E-4,2.193324939519081E-4,2.192548190405606E-4,2.1935421980567496E-4,2.1942116987548006E-4,2.1929978476330163E-4,2.1941723695242683E-4,2.1952496533805862E-4,2.1972871854514207E-4,2.1933211493919229E-4,2.192660887193524E-4,2.1934514652716472E-4,2.192883572382643E-4,2.1922171407356E-4,2.192774735707242E-4,2.1949722707154394E-4,2.1937681902578173E-4,2.1941773696650512E-4,2.1923262471379958E-4,2.1927752932743085E-4,2.1926600626693125E-4,2.193402258220394E-4,2.1937825969134948E-4,2.1933365036190072E-4,2.1929888559081077E-4,2.192665484949162E-4,2.197157900444467E-4,2.193217222746468E-4,2.1927747906929954E-4,2.1932054772559186E-4,2.192550433680464E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630258E-4,2.1926685631708603E-4,2.1925491821167623E-4,2.1943032740576212E-4,2.1934224257171334E-4,2.1925482

{"value":"\"Sleeping With the Enemy\" is a predictable, 'been there before' thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try. I can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br />The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass screenplay (based upon the Nancy Price novel) does not help, nor does the stale direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance from Julia Roberts. The supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do little to help.<br /><br />There really isn't a lot to say.

{"value":"Maria Bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in. Maybe she needs those movies, to get off the sugar coated (aka \"Hollywood\") ones she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3).<br /><br />While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (I won't spoil that), Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in. It's her performance that elevates this movie. This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, like bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too

{"value":"In my life I have seen many great and awful movies. I am not an expert in professional reviews, but I have definitely something to say about this one. Firstly, these actors are the worst I have seen... Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in the quality. <br /><br />Another awful thing is about these dialogs - they are so lame. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14 year old son could act better. I feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European car...<br /><br />Please, if my message reaches you - save your time and money.","finished_norm":["in","my","life","i","have","see","mani","great","and","aw","movi","i","be","not","a","expert","in","profession","review","but","i","have","definit","someth","to","sai","about","thi","on","firstli","thi","actor","be","the","wrong","i","have","see","their","act","be","so","unreal","that","you","even","want","to","throw","awai","the","dvd","in","the","minut","i","think","that","thi","actor","be","not","interest","in","the","qualiti","br","br","anoth","aw","thing","be","about","thi","dialog","thei","be","so","lame","you","sometim","feel","uncomfort","when","you","hear","them","it","seem","that","your","year","old","son","can","act","well","i","feel","that","thi","movi","have","a","budget","similar","to","the","cost","of","my","year","old","european","carbr","br","pleas","if","my","messag","reach","you","save","your","time","and","monei"],"filtered":["life","see","mani","great","aw","movi","expert","profession","review","definit","someth","sai","thi","firstli","thi","actor","wrong","see","act","unreal","even","want","throw","awai","dvd","minut","think","thi","actor","interest","qualiti","br","br","anoth","aw","thing","thi","dialog","thei","lame","sometim","feel","uncomfort","hear","seem","year","old","son","act","well","feel","thi","movi","budget","similar","cost","year","old","european","carbr","br","pleas","messag","reach","save","time","monei"],"filtered2":["life","see","mani","great","aw","expert","profession","review","definit","someth","firstli","actor","wrong","see","act","unreal","even","want","throw","awai","dvd","minut","think","actor","interest","qualiti","anoth","aw","thing","dialog","lame","sometim","feel","uncomfort","hear","seem","year","old","son","act","well","feel","budget","similar","cost","year","old","european","carbr","pleas","messag","reach","save","time","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,12,20,21,25,29,35,37,41,43,50,51,53,57,59,60,67,73,75,126,138,155,176,189,216,247,256,310,319,346,373,392,432,434,500,569,589,836,934,1160,1406,1940,2059,2981,3035],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,12,20,21,25,29,35,37,41,43,50,51,53,57,59,60,67,73,75,126,138,155,176,189,216,247,256,310,319,346,373,392,432,434,500,569,589,836,934,1160,1406,1940,2059,2981,3035],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,3.1375198335242067,3.321622407243643,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,3.668325173349496,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,3.9141830778533158,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,2.2391270689902285,4.581473037857885,2.3074766467914385,2.5040471493269134,2.498193474075453,2.6070186965339692,2.7303758068497004,2.748952192422636,2.854312708080462,2.9056060024680126,3.023389038124396,3.070535816550098,3.0670934723591254,3.235085203598255,3.4101163271295305,3.3814747511661465,3.6436037491933098,3.530930586689197,3.7881170224473255,3.9405024767500145,4.2574141875167335,4.662879295624898,4.8796870284900224,4.956227105612356,5.373120909544144,5.482320201509136]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164676E-4,2.2324275812784228E-4,2.2329787848933378E-4,2.2325298847310018E-4,2.2327411672029335E-4,2.2324152723462236E-4,2.2331095844892415E-4,2.2320831253640864E-4,2.2324280530791705E-4,2.2347350255652823E-4,2.2524669975505137E-4,2.2324317404730243E-4,2.2345459944065016E-4,2.234778795547064E-4,2.233763593891775E-4,2.232538678343093E-4,2.2333067579914022E-4,2.2343577597443504E-4,2.23265393468904E-4,2.232645771884738E-4,2.2346543761534037E-4,2.2328694601974778E-4,2.2328728394518992E-4,2.234303241699846E-4,2.2326547400635326E-4,2.234805506669641E-4,2.2332134532680126E-4,2.2324225779449944E-4,2.2334346629394191E-4,2.234116339392789E-4,2.232880412783562E-4,2.2340762949082037E-4,2.235173170595691E-4,2.2372477578809887E-4,2.2332095942123812E-4,2.232537324272993E-4,2.2333422800586647E-4,2.2327640592866813E-4,2.232085507699069E-4,2.2326532432724485E-4,2.23489074336006E-4,2.2336647651074402E-4,2.2340813859831574E-4,2.2321965983456384E-4,2.2326538109796094E-4,2.232536484753719E-4,2.2332921781121292E-4,2.2336794337671976E-4,2.2332252276763842E-4,2.2328712575322483E-4,2.232542005644896E-4,2.23711612165526E-4,2.2331037775234807E-4,2.2326532992581903E-4,2.2330918184256573E-4,2.232424862016771E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760439E-4,2.2325451398481257E-4,2.232423587691729E-4,2.2342095801135603E-4,2.23331271238146E-4,2.2324226544800525E-4,2.2321956888982683E-4,2.2319712169645205E-4,2.233989272262176E-4,2.2325320192525614E-4,2.2335468452716278E-4,2.2342023346478746E-4,2.2331887205251054E-4,2.2326562563335247E-4,2.2321986151580705E-4,2.2327696528065555E-4,2.23219741286825E-4,2.232

{"value":"I saw this film when it first came out in 1978, when I was a sophomore in high school. I took a date to see it. I didn't \"get any,\" needless to say, because the film was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful, unfunny crap. In fact, unfunny isn't a severe enough term: this film is ANTI-FUNNY! You walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen. This isn't worth watching out of curiosity, or out of any sense of it being \"so-bad-it's-good.\" Not even the gang at MST3K could've made this worth watching! The fact that Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","when","it","come","out","in","when","i","be","a","sophomor","in","high","school","i","take","a","date","to","see","it","i","do","not","get","ani","needless","to","sai","becaus","the","film","be","so","bad","joan","river","career","never","tank","a","badli","a","it","deserv","after","make","thi","aw","unfunni","crap","in","fact","unfunni","be","not","a","sever","enough","term","thi","film","be","antifunni","you","walk","out","feel","like","ani","laughter","that","mai","have","occur","be","beat","out","of","you","befor","it","can","happen","thi","be","not","worth","watch","out","of","curios","or","out","of","ani","sens","of","it","be","sobaditsgood","not","even","the","gang","at","mstk","can","have","make","thi","worth","watch","the","fact","that","billi","crystal","career","surviv","thi","earli","suicid","attempt","be","a","miracl"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","come","sophomor","high","school","take","date","see","get","ani","needless","sai","becaus","film","bad","joan","river","career","never","tank","badli","deserv","make","thi","aw","unfunni","crap","fact","unfunni","sever","enough","term","thi","film","antifunni","walk","feel","like","ani","laughter","mai","occur","beat","befor","happen","thi","worth","watch","curios","ani","sens","sobaditsgood","even","gang","mstk","make","thi","worth","watch","fact","billi","crystal","career","surviv","thi","earli","suicid","attempt","miracl"],"filtered2":["see","come","sophomor","high","school","take","date","see","get","ani","needless","becaus","bad","joan","river","career","never","tank","badli","deserv","make","aw","unfunni","crap","fact","unfunni","sever","enough","term","antifunni","walk","feel","like","ani","laughter","mai","occur","beat","befor","happen","worth","watch","curios","ani","sens","sobaditsgood","even","gang","mstk","make","worth","watch","fact","billi","crystal","career","surviv","earli","suicid","attempt","miracl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,9,22,27,31,34,42,43,46,79,93,94,97,138,173,177,211,219,266,294,296,313,316,423,448,511,647,678,858,886,948,997,1259,1284,1373,1548,1665,1733,1935,2203,2524,2819,3164,3295,4707,7678],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,9,22,27,31,34,42,43,46,79,93,94,97,138,173,177,211,219,266,294,296,313,316,423,448,511,647,678,858,886,948,997,1259,1284,1373,1548,1665,1733,1935,2203,2524,2819,3164,3295,4707,7678],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.2979240167361772,3.9008101766037884,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.9469506069506084,2.035389827120098,2.08112281984698,4.109111584924517,2.2907365189289424,2.4368824319140248,2.458149992634611,2.5687161421197025,5.158418835671083,2.747702973022204,2.886778509330039,2.9504565686333644,2.907069060519773,2.878207028279898,3.164467636384302,3.2681460658591432,6.781862172816363,3.6746621462132825,3.6715125373103863,3.8767358583910254,3.9782428047328615,8.098137714602949,4.263079925052412,4.315570107673808,4.706176101378222,4.456830177669989,4.77960356993304,4.77960356993304,4.760735085628657,5.408212229355414,5.0768550934009715,5.170884043049248,5.444579873526289,5.5623629091826725,5.907203395474402,6.032366538428407,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875904E-4,2.0127954981638386E-4,2.0132924729208146E-4,2.0128877367343187E-4,2.0130782326822775E-4,2.0127844002166867E-4,2.013410404109268E-4,2.0124849307261728E-4,2.0127959235475908E-4,2.0148759300272522E-4,2.0308633840816418E-4,2.0127992481659617E-4,2.014705496249871E-4,2.014915393803378E-4,2.0140000703507247E-4,2.0128956652077786E-4,2.0135881791649224E-4,2.0145357806076913E-4,2.0129995823319903E-4,2.012992222605794E-4,2.0148032151161302E-4,2.0131939038753904E-4,2.013196950669895E-4,2.0144866261914555E-4,2.0130003084716273E-4,2.0149394770156283E-4,2.0135040540050425E-4,2.012790987071481E-4,2.0137035004885436E-4,2.0143181118237799E-4,2.0132037789173174E-4,2.0142820070206607E-4,2.01527096919992E-4,2.017141453144579E-4,2.0135005746134296E-4,2.0128944443546483E-4,2.0136202064780013E-4,2.0130988725827596E-4,2.0124870786807886E-4,2.0129989589387775E-4,2.0150163278967914E-4,2.0139109646015097E-4,2.0142865972223018E-4,2.0125872399380577E-4,2.0129994707934182E-4,2.0128936874294832E-4,2.0135750336924287E-4,2.013924190120031E-4,2.0135146700162235E-4,2.0131955243836503E-4,2.0128986651608998E-4,2.017022767636138E-4,2.0134051684480358E-4,2.0129990094164952E-4,2.0133943859176358E-4,2.0127930464302831E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585417E-4,2.012901491012992E-4,2.0127918974766824E-4,2.014402179277787E-4,2.0135935477464626E-4,2.012

{"value":"No matter how well meaning his \"message\" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.","finished_norm":["no","matt","how","good","mean","hi","messag","be","thi","film","be","a","terribli","make","trainwreck","aw","act","lame","camera","work","i","do","not","know","why","carr","agre","to","try","and","pull","off","a","stutter","he","be","lousi","at","it","you","watch","the","extra","on","the","dvd","and","the","wai","he","have","a","camera","follow","him","around","he","just","soak","it","up","he","love","be","the","center","of","attent","he","be","a","bad","actor","he","remind","me","of","anoth","arrog","filmmak","eric","schaffer","some","how","carr","have","have","thi","film","show","at","citi","youth","center","and","new","ag","church","where","damag","peopl","look","for","reinforc","and","attent","themselv","babbl","on","about","how","the","film","touch","them","and","mayb","it","do","but","a","a","film","itself","it","be","choppi","predict","and","sappi"],"filtered":["matt","good","mean","hi","messag","thi","film","terribli","make","trainwreck","aw","act","lame","camera","work","know","carr","agre","try","pull","stutter","lousi","watch","extra","dvd","wai","camera","follow","around","soak","love","center","attent","bad","actor","remind","anoth","arrog","filmmak","eric","schaffer","carr","thi","film","show","citi","youth","center","new","ag","church","damag","peopl","look","reinforc","attent","themselv","babbl","film","touch","mayb","film","choppi","predict","sappi"],"filtered2":["matt","good","mean","messag","terribli","make","trainwreck","aw","act","lame","camera","work","know","carr","agre","try","pull","stutter","lousi","watch","extra","dvd","wai","camera","follow","around","soak","love","center","attent","bad","actor","remind","anoth","arrog","filmmak","eric","schaffer","carr","show","citi","youth","center","new","ag","church","damag","peopl","look","reinforc","attent","themselv","babbl","touch","mayb","choppi","predict","sappi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,9,16,21,23,26,28,33,36,41,48,54,73,87,88,98,138,163,231,247,260,323,337,373,408,436,442,544,569,595,622,636,644,745,1001,1116,1130,1152,1314,1640,1779,1991,2363,2909,3302,5054,5672,6974,7416,8598],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,9,16,21,23,26,28,33,36,41,48,54,73,87,88,98,138,163,231,247,260,323,337,373,408,436,442,544,569,595,622,636,644,745,1001,1116,1130,1152,1314,1640,1779,1991,2363,2909,3302,5054,5672,6974,7416,8598],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.8113893252729412,1.8950689206770979,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,2.0881990796736947,2.2907365189289424,2.4000574358028657,5.409870614011723,2.7303758068497004,2.6754694156628323,3.0433232530252132,2.973659465713028,3.070535816550098,3.130944944345658,3.2070272508030975,3.257696649984802,3.4222967456864013,3.6436037491933098,3.6284289511740746,3.4933926673701317,7.061861173378394,3.5670958631572662,3.6969916226113715,4.035401218572811,4.224077767249142,4.416284083275639,4.213208095012239,8.927501241029125,4.688631791727313,4.8085911068062925,5.089758498236879,5.129498826886393,5.373120909544144,5.541743621979936,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805355E-4,2.1925531043720598E-4,2.1930944626706033E-4,2.1926535805328188E-4,2.19286108918556E-4,2.1925410152956966E-4,2.193222925991185E-4,2.192214800952665E-4,2.1925535677457442E-4,2.1948193342720784E-4,2.2122345868694183E-4,2.1925571892772593E-4,2.1946336794909405E-4,2.1948623224568857E-4,2.1938652538130765E-4,2.192662217077919E-4,2.1934165776813395E-4,2.194448806979818E-4,2.192775414774106E-4,2.1927673977696296E-4,2.1947401253786462E-4,2.1929870906764107E-4,2.192990409572322E-4,2.194395262708674E-4,2.1927762057634125E-4,2.194888556479086E-4,2.1933249395190825E-4,2.1925481904056077E-4,2.193542198056751E-4,2.194211698754802E-4,2.1929978476330176E-4,2.1941723695242696E-4,2.1952496533805875E-4,2.197287185451422E-4,2.1933211493919242E-4,2.1926608871935255E-4,2.1934514652716485E-4,2.1928835723826443E-4,2.1922171407356012E-4,2.1927747357072436E-4,2.194972270715441E-4,2.1937681902578187E-4,2.1941773696650525E-4,2.192326247137997E-4,2.19277529327431E-4,2.192660062669314E-4,2.1934022582203953E-4,2.1937825969134961E-4,2.1933365036190086E-4,2.192988855908109E-4,2.1926654849491634E-4,2.1971579004444685E-4,2.1932172227464693E-4,2.1927747906929967E-4,2.1932054772559202E-4,2.1925504336804653E-4,0.9826707519944567,2.192892508163027E-4,2.1926685631708617E-4,2.1925491821167637E-4,2.1943032740576226E-4,2.1934224257171348E-4,2.1925482655736357E-4,2.1923253

becomes a Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama.<br /><br />The claims made on the outside of the DVD box was overt fraud to<br /><br />take this fabricated death of a Journalist and present it as factual<br /><br />while some portions have Muslims supporting the 9/11 attacks for the USA's treatment of Muslims around the world .<br /><br />I alerted the Video store that the movie should be removed from their \"Documentary\" section and be placed in the War-drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events.","finished_norm":["the","movi","be","complet","mislead","and","the","bonu","materi","confirm","my","impress","that","it","be","a","ripoff","of","joeseph","conrad","heart","of","dark","the","river","be","replac","by","a","road","and","the","boat","becom","a","jeep","and","walter","kurtz","be","osamabr","br","the","claim","make","on","the","outsid","of","the","dvd","box","be","overt","fraud","tobr","br","take","thi","fabric","death","of","a","journalist","and","present","it","a","factualbr","br","while","some","portion","have","muslim","support","the","attack","for","the","usa","treatment","of","muslim","around","the","world","br","br","i","alert","the","video","store","that","the","movi","should","be","remov","from","their","documentari","section","and","be","place","in","the","wardrama","area","for","quasi","fiction","account","of","actual","event"],"filtered":["movi","complet","mislead","bonu","materi","confirm","impress","ripoff","joeseph","conrad","heart","dark","river","replac","road","boat","becom","jeep","walter","kurtz","osamabr","br","claim","make","outsid","dvd","box","overt","fraud","tobr","br","take","thi","fabric","death","journalist","present","factualbr","br","portion","muslim","support","attack","usa","treatment","muslim","around","world","br","br","alert","video","store","movi","remov","documentari","section","place","wardrama","area","quasi","fiction","account","actual","event"],"filtered2":["complet","mislead","bonu","materi","confirm","impress","ripoff","joeseph","conrad","heart","dark","river","replac","road","boat","becom","jeep","walter","kurtz","osamabr","claim","make","outsid","dvd","box","overt","fraud","tobr","take","fabric","death","journalist","present","factualbr","portion","muslim","support","attack","usa","treatment","muslim","around","world","alert","video","store","remov","documentari","section","place","wardrama","area","quasi","fiction","account","actual","event"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,31,52,98,103,115,164,165,240,245,247,368,411,418,459,470,495,537,614,624,654,751,791,793,916,1080,1157,1202,1414,1449,1503,1527,1665,1818,1876,2415,2515,2528,2612,2676,2834,2988,3157,3842,4017,4418,4478,5799,6654,8329],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,31,52,98,103,115,164,165,240,245,247,368,411,418,459,470,495,537,614,624,654,751,791,793,916,1080,1157,1202,1414,1449,1503,1527,1665,1818,1876,2415,2515,2528,2612,2676,2834,2988,3157,3842,4017,4418,4478,5799,6654,8329],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.4070669811451506,1.7122153074726136,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.201553588425805,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,2.7666071276613566,2.7502029743242886,2.7303758068497004,3.1346146732346205,3.229006157521873,3.164467636384302,3.2850956241729166,3.3814747511661465,3.5173618574831282,3.424750734647968,3.553030933689863,3.9241755834625858,3.634471265630037,3.8023521382691974,3.8240921249056035,3.770603439954617,4.100845126825194,4.229557233013768,4.2860694432771105,4.315570107673808,4.484804029712395,4.679973728984199,4.597282013139085,4.5432147918688095,4.77960356993304,4.789173020949191,4.869215728622727,5.170884043049248,5.259176650194926,5.185068678041204,11.700089963268907,5.521540914662417,5.501738287366237,5.390512652256013,5.583416318380505,5.7446844659766265,5.7959777603641776,6.101359409915359,6.032366538428407,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4
