{"value":"The first half of this movie is a pure delight. Novel. Funny. Wonderful performances. A close knit brother and sister living in Manhattan fall for the same woman! Adult. Bright. Witty. What more could you ask. As a romantic comedy this starts refreshing. It heads into unexplored territory. And then it falls apart.<br /><br />It goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming-of-age coming-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times before. What a disappointment. As a people film it begins with such promise. Why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian \"I am who I am\" film. The freeze-frame ending shot of Heather Graham's jumping in the air to celebrate \"her happiness at finding herself\" underlines the banality of the last part of the film.<br /><br />It could have been different. It could have been magical. It ended up being the same old same old.","finished_norm":["the","half","of","thi","movi","be","a","pure","delight","novel","funni","wonder","perform","a","close","knit","brother","and","sister","live","in","manhattan","fall","for","the","same","woman","adult","bright","witti","what","much","can","you","ask","a","a","romant","comedi","thi","start","refresh","it","head","into","unexplor","territori","and","then","it","fall","apartbr","br","it","go","from","be","a","univers","adult","comedi","to","a","comingofag","comingoutofthecloset","stori","that","have","be","do","mani","time","befor","what","a","disappoint","a","a","peopl","film","it","begin","with","such","promis","why","doe","it","ne","to","turn","into","such","a","pedestrian","i","be","who","i","be","film","the","freezefram","end","shoot","of","heather","graham","jump","in","the","air","to","celebr","her","happi","at","find","herself","underlin","the","banal","of","the","last","part","of","the","filmbr","br","it","can","have","be","differ","it","can","have","be","magic","it","end","up","be","the","same","old","same","old"],"filtered":["half","thi","movi","pure","delight","novel","funni","wonder","perform","close","knit","brother","sister","live","manhattan","fall","woman","adult","bright","witti","much","ask","romant","comedi","thi","start","refresh","head","unexplor","territori","fall","apartbr","br","go","univers","adult","comedi","comingofag","comingoutofthecloset","stori","mani","time","befor","disappoint","peopl","film","begin","promis","doe","ne","turn","pedestrian","film","freezefram","end","shoot","heather","graham","jump","air","celebr","happi","find","underlin","banal","last","part","filmbr","br","differ","magic","end","old","old"],"filtered2":["half","pure","delight","novel","funni","wonder","perform","close","knit","brother","sister","live","manhattan","fall","woman","adult","bright","witti","ask","romant","comedi","start","refresh","head","unexplor","territori","fall","apartbr","go","univers","adult","comedi","comingofag","comingoutofthecloset","stori","mani","time","befor","disappoint","peopl","begin","promis","doe","ne","turn","pedestrian","freezefram","end","shoot","heather","graham","jump","air","celebr","happi","find","underlin","banal","last","part","filmbr","differ","magic","end","old","old"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,8,17,18,23,24,38,50,61,62,67,70,71,79,96,105,110,116,117,127,144,147,169,175,187,204,206,208,295,306,381,474,566,585,605,674,679,683,726,734,864,913,1022,1329,1539,2162,2274,2675,2858,3176,3747,3952,3974,4503,7288,8080],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,8,17,18,23,24,38,50,61,62,67,70,71,79,96,105,110,116,117,127,144,147,169,175,187,204,206,208,295,306,381,474,566,585,605,674,679,683,726,734,864,913,1022,1329,1539,2162,2274,2675,2858,3176,3747,3952,3974,4503,7288,8080],"values":[0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,1.519311641348122,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,3.9141830778533158,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,1.9469506069506084,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2.1290479736304078,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,4.871935874217273,2.2931108769894046,2.2844323215331563,4.814274222781855,2.3791142619576227,2.4732161909892554,2.624524614047584,2.597304642813496,2.6289494000279396,2.7910771187233068,2.8739486825973213,3.24941502915308,3.6466665387238555,3.439602492783994,3.7165362186843414,3.5474598886404074,3.6405503117064195,3.6715125373103863,3.6105180246075443,3.6466665387238555,7.5833136983049,3.9782428047328615,4.067587905068712,4.165705761027235,4.416284083275639,4.662879295624898,4.9909126636002465,5.0768550934009715,5.243909178064138,5.408212229355414,5.7959777603641776,5.719991853386255,5.967828017290836,6.137727054086234,6.032366538428407,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079177E-4,1.9803239209117176E-4,1.980812878185433E-4,1.9804146714364078E-4,1.9806020941939227E-4,1.9803130020030463E-4,1.980928906839973E-4,1.9800183637269826E-4,1.9803243394329338E-4,1.9823707900490457E-4,1.9981003252786639E-4,1.9803276104166448E-4,1.982203105807608E-4,1.9824096171727862E-4,1.9815090602457093E-4,1.9804224720031634E-4,1.9811038139259512E-4,1.9820361281160003E-4,1.9805247126764242E-4,1.9805174716815735E-4,1.9822992482167865E-4,1.9807158993126697E-4,1.9807188969545288E-4,1.9819877666871422E-4,1.980525427101558E-4,1.982433311860774E-4,1.981021045921644E-4,1.9803194825949023E-4,1.9812172748195025E-4,1.9818219708903862E-4,1.9807256150447278E-4,1.9817864485507635E-4,1.9827594562220598E-4,1.9845997644414833E-4,1.9810176226615827E-4,1.9804212708455395E-4,1.9811353245559533E-4,1.9806224011196323E-4,1.9800204770295565E-4,1.980524099340

{"value":"I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show. The acting was ham-fisted and amateur, the story was old news, and plot development (or lack thereof) invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode. That's about all there is to say of it, because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind.<br /><br />How can you people like crap like this? It's freaking stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I don't even know how to further explain it... It's as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look, or because, for whatever crazy reason, you haven't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before.<br /><br />I just.. forget it.

{"value":"In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last surviving teenager of Elm Street. Forsaking ANY scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos (come on..Roseanne??? Tom Arnold??!!?? WTF?), this is tied with part 2 is the worst the demon child rapist ever got. Wow was this a piece of crap. Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make the stench of this movie go away. And when they hell did Freddy ever have a daughter?? The whole film is severely retarded in ever single conceivable way, shape & form.

{"value":"This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the lot, and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full-length film make. Poor Sid Caesar as the vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to watch him. As the sly tailor, Robert Morse hasn't an ounce of charm. Neither does his hapless nephew (Jason Carter) The \"songs\" are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down. The direction is practically nonexistent, and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is pretty as the emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players. And the film crawls at a snails pace. Hans Christian Andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared. It can honestly be said, at least of this movie tale, it's no surprise that it went straight to video

{"value":"Having enjoyed Jean Arthur in \"The Devil and Miss Jones\", my interest was peaked, so I tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey--but I didn't make it to the end. Arthur, photographed in a gauzy, movie-magazine fashion, either wants alimony from ex-husband William Powell or another shot at marriage, but I never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness, but once inside a morgue--like all women in these '30's comedies--she faints). William Powell reportedly had a high time working with Miss Arthur, but you'd never know it from the end result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant over their banter. The actor playing Powell's valet is excruciating, and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with

{"value":"There are bad movies, terrible movies even boring movies...I can watch most and put up until the end, not this time. Avoid this like the plague, annoying music throughout, terrible editing, no comedy, its tackier than a novelty mug...My missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be Legally Blonde material or something kind of watchable, but never better than average, chick flick. Its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button.<br /><br />The Girls, well, they were not great to start with (Denise done OK in Starship Troopers and Wild things) but you have sank to the gravel. I feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this...Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face.<br /><br />Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting

{"value":"A remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play, nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie. But doing nothing else nicely at all.<br /><br />A under-parr performance from the actors, Law and Caine, diluted further by weak self-indulgent direction.<br /><br />The warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting. The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine which made the first movie so watchable, is replaced with a horrid, brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer. But this is not the clever, to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well, this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both character from the word

{"value":"Those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good parent does...kick his son out the son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow- 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, gets bitten by rabified dogs, to then just walk off. This film is an INSulT to our intelligence I really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please do

{"value":"I am a great fan of Martin Amis, on whose book this film is based. Unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen. The novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development. It is an hilarious examination of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary British writers. The director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands, the film screams along at breakneck speed, indulging in every known trick shot and 'odd' camera angle possible. It is like Ken Russel on acid, and suffers from that older director's self indulgence cranked up to a hundred.

{"value":"I can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to Argento's. His work is far more imaginative and vicious--and a lot more fun.<br /><br />The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes--and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about--aren't interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really didn't care when it was revealed. The cinematography isn't memorable, and the much-praised 19th century Gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in. Several of the actors are quite good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students), but they're given very little to do.<br /><br />Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism, and lesbianism, but amazingly, they add very little spice or suspense. <br /><br />If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","believ","that","so","mani","be","compar","thi","movi","to","argento","hi","work","be","far","much","imagin","and","viciousand","a","lot","much","funbr","br","the","director","simpli","lack","the","abil","to","build","real","tension","the","murder","scenesand","let","face","it","that","what","thi","genr","be","all","aboutar","interest","it","be","not","hard","to","guess","who","the","murder","be","and","i","realli","do","not","care","when","it","be","reveal","the","cinematographi","be","not","memor","and","the","muchprais","th","centuri","gothic","atmospher","just","do","not","draw","me","in","sever","of","the","actor","be","quit","good","especi","the","headmistress","and","the","sadist","girl","who","lord","it","over","the","young","student","but","thei","re","give","veri","littl","to","dobr","br","ye","there","be","underton","of","incest","sadomasoch","and","lesbian","but","amazingli","thei","add","veri","littl","spice","or","suspens","br","br","if","you","re","look","for","a","good","horror","movi","look","elsewher"],"filtered":["ca","believ","mani","compar","thi","movi","argento","hi","work","far","much","imagin","viciousand","lot","much","funbr","br","director","simpli","lack","abil","build","real","tension","murder","scenesand","let","face","thi","genr","aboutar","interest","hard","guess","murder","realli","care","reveal","cinematographi","memor","muchprais","th","centuri","gothic","atmospher","draw","sever","actor","quit","good","especi","headmistress","sadist","girl","lord","young","student","thei","re","give","veri","littl","dobr","br","ye","underton","incest","sadomasoch","lesbian","amazingli","thei","add","veri","littl","spice","suspens","br","br","re","look","good","horror","movi","look","elsewher"],"filtered2":["ca","believ","mani","compar","argento","work","far","imagin","viciousand","lot","funbr","director","simpli","lack","abil","build","real","tension","murder","scenesand","let","face","genr","aboutar","interest","hard","guess","murder","realli","care","reveal","cinematographi","memor","muchprais","th","centuri","gothic","atmospher","draw","sever","actor","quit","good","especi","headmistress","sadist","girl","lord","young","student","re","give","veri","littl","dobr","ye","underton","incest","sadomasoch","lesbian","amazingli","add","veri","littl","spice","suspens","re","look","good","horror","look","elsewher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,13,14,15,16,30,41,48,50,58,60,68,72,80,81,83,84,91,101,120,124,135,171,183,201,205,209,243,251,267,273,299,316,340,467,477,482,529,576,626,629,833,835,847,853,887,1074,1163,1239,1446,2213,2243,2350,3702,3967,4504,4769,5100,6626,6738],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,13,14,15,16,30,41,48,50,58,60,68,72,80,81,83,84,91,101,120,124,135,171,183,201,205,209,243,251,267,273,299,316,340,467,477,482,529,576,626,629,833,835,847,853,887,1074,1163,1239,1446,2213,2243,2350,3702,3967,4504,4769,5100,6626,6738],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,2.393227744058217,1.3364419891718522,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,4.012839573363895,1.9209463754160525,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.292318797740072,2.2212694515902225,2.0105926690411424,2.098582041218749,2.2044500422972613,2.2323930368088845,2.366244071437088,2.373087554090762,2.4885128563647294,2.561435818751577,2.571852579609833,2.6026896854443837,2.627841366673578,2.6942272927333892,2.7085302779237206,5.934838391705887,2.7949961309240425,2.878207028279898,2.948928684455311,3.342254038012865,3.351345009714117,3.3154667220492153,3.4648563601051974,3.587125145032839,3.6528204042982337,3.488143311483988,3.900174431363043,3.8614098879127985,3.900174431363043,3.8962296530720266,3.944626193933877,4.110553940952155,4.2860694432771105,4.573751515728891,4.581533656170946,5.102830579804232,5.039114765418124,5.0768550934009715,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,6.032366538428407,6.0662680901040895,6.214688095222362,6.543192162194399,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8341338219946424E-4,1.8325085032897526E-4,1.8329609637950098E-4,1.8325924800101349E-4,1.8327659131506574E-4,1.8324983993907009E-4,1.8330683318340586E-4,1.8322257535166697E-4,1.8325088905716912E-4,1.834402589938743E-4,1.84895821004143E-4,1.8325119174025046E-4,1.8342474219911877E-4,1.8344385189267542E-4,1.8336051814059887E-4,1.8325996983266734E-4,1.833230183498302E-4,1.8340929078551418E-4,1.8326943075474953E-4,1.8326876070352732E-4,1.8343363881347997E-4,1.8328712236231613E-4,1.8328739975149167E-4,1.8340481562219985E-4,1.8326949686464796E-4,1.8344604449948895E-4,1.833153593466696E-4,1.832504396257959E-4,1.8333

{"value":"Extremely thin 'plot' of satanic rituals or some such mumbo-jumbo provides the hokey excuse to thread copious amounts of sex scenes together. Straight vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S&M, bestiality, incest, and a few other sexual proliferation's all get their time in the spotlight here. The problem is the storyline is so dull that the rampant sexuality gets pretty tedious after awhile. Who knew that a film with an intimate goat/ girl encounter could be so damn boring? Well now I do.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows all; Helga Line provides T&A (both on display quite frequently); women viewers get the occasional penis.<br /><br />My Grade: D+<br /><br

{"value":"What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly \"must see\" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to \"fine-tune\" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood

{"value":"OK so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of ghetto boom box, gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes, the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what, shaq sucks at rapping, and i guess thats it.<br /><br />So mainly I laughed, I cried......but mainly I laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player/rapper and boy with shaggy hair.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh.<br /><br />I'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b/c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes.<br /><br />If I had 3 wishes one would be to erase this

{"value":"This is the most depressing film I have ever seen. I first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me. I know it was set in a time when life was hard and I know these people were poor and the crops were vital. Yes, I get all that. What I find hard to take is I can't remember one single light moment in the entire film. Maybe it was true to life, I don't know. I'm quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and I know that every film can't have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film. I can't stress enough how this film affected me as a child. I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back.

{"value":"This show was laughably bad. The writing sucked, the dialog sucked. The guy who played Craig couldn't act his way out of a paper sack. Being it was on Thursday night, this was definitely great to watch with some beers. Cool music, bad acting, poor writing, all came together for my entertainment.<br /><br />It was a drama/unintentional comedy. I don't care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they couldn't reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialog around it, which was terrible. I mean, the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible.<br /><br />So, let's review. Everything happening in present time sucked. The flashback scenes, only the writing, dialog and Craig's acting sucked.

{"value":"What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly \"must see\" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to \"fine-tune\" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood

{"value":"this is the result. A piece of trash movie that doesn't deserve to even be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel, that makes no sense whatsoever. Well back to the actors, which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film. Well it's a great horror anyway, nevermind being a film. There's plenty of horrific acting in \"Hobgoblins,\" but the worse is the main guy named Richard, who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for. Well, when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, on a less than shoestring budget, no less, this is what will happen. Oh well at least the MST3K version was hilarious.

{"value":"I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film. The idea of remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he re-did them totally -- so they became Murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this? Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies!

{"value":"I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film. The idea of remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he re-did them totally -- so they became Murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this? Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies!

{"value":"While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities. Both were made just a few years apart, both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing, little energy and some VERY broad performances--even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. Plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class.

{"value":"\"A trio of treasure hunters is searching the West Indies for a hidden fortune. The lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the treasure's location. The deep-sea divers hope to track down the gold, but find that greed and hatred leads to murder,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. \"Manfish\" is the name of their boat, not a monster. The skeleton who gives muscular Captain John Bromfield (as Brannigan) his half of the treasure map is very good. Old salt Victor Jory (as Professor) provides the other half of the map. First mate Lon Chaney Jr. (as Swede) plays dumb, and sexy Tessa Prendergast (as Alita) guards the rum (not very well, obviously). Serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture, which otherwise might have amounted to something.<br /><br />*** Manfish (2/56) W.

{"value":"I hired out Hybrid on the weekend. What a disappointment! A stupid lame attempt at a tele-movie. The guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running {he did a lot} looked like he was eating those minty sweets...with his backside! The wolf contacts he wore were great, though I feel the actor relied on them too much, as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all. The wise native American Indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen. Talk about a sour cow! She smiled about once for the entire film, and I think that is because she had sex. The sex scene was lame too. They may as well have shown blowing curtains, if you can dig that.<br /><br />Last of all, and this is a big pet hate of mine, on the cover and the DVD menu, the losers digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy.

{"value":"This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a horrible approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. \"If a movie is boring, I just make

{"value":"I turn on 700 Club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made- I'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I vote my mind, and its usually not rep. or dem. - i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe, but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds. i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club. it bums me out to hear name calling either direction. i think 700 club folks really do love Jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did. Please don't judge Jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on Him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them.

{"value":"There were only two things that kept me interested in this film: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones.<br /><br />This was basically a one woman show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye-candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this film. Like Jones, he had no role at all. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one that had any real part in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first one and he did redeem himself with Road to Perdition.<br /><br />I don't know what director Jan de Bont's problem was. he did a great job with Speed and Twister. he really fell down on the job here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster Speed 2: Cruise Control.

{"value":"A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman. He's been shot by two policemen and then he is risen from the grave because of some sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy. The hunting of women continues by this zombie-demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again, but only with the help of the police this will come true...<br /><br />A bloody 65-minute mess...Horny zombies, doll-babies, S&M, corrupted and twisted policemen, repented heretics who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three text-screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived (yes, we ought to know!)... Two decent disemboweling shots can't save the situation. I've seen worst horror-flicks, but this one was pretty bad too.

{"value":"As with most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is dry and story is predictable. That is if you want to call this a story. Many points were left connected with no thought at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say that because, that would mean the torture would have lasted longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's failures, this one is no exception and is survivable only by the other actors. Even then, the acting for the most part was contrived and was not believable. The trip down memory lane with actors I have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission. All thought it should be told, they too are quickly joining the ranks of the \"has-been\". My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision.

{"value":"I had never heard of this one before it turned up on Cable TV. It's very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! While not uninteresting in itself (the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized, with far greater aplomb, for both DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and mercifully short, the film's single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes

{"value":"Lame plot and two-dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut-outs. Needless to say, this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters, especially the fiancé; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In summary, I guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for TV drama. It uses just about every cliché in the book. The tortured classical musician who wants to break-out and play salsa. The free-spirited fiancée engaged to a \"bean counter\" personality she doesn't love. I won't list them or else it would be a spoiler because I'd be giving away the whole plot. The dancing was OK but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Thankfully I didn't pay good money to see it at a theater.

{"value":"Salvage is the worst so called horror film I've ever seen. There is nothing remotely horrific about it. It doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine. First of all i don't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie. If I wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. Second: the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly. Third: the story sucks, its been used before, and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summery on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it. I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name.
