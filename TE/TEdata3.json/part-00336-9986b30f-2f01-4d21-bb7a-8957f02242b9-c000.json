me.","finished_norm":["i","have","to","sai","i","be","realli","surpris","at","the","high","rate","for","thi","movi","i","find","it","to","be","absolut","idiot","the","mother","get","vision","when","she","touch","certain","thing","or","peopl","and","on","thing","she","touch","twice","make","her","vision","continu","just","seem","so","ridicul","deede","pfieffer","perform","be","aw","i","think","she","be","veri","irrit","the","girl","who","plai","lori","do","a","good","job","and","so","do","much","of","the","support","cast","for","what","thei","have","to","work","withbr","br","i","usual","love","lmn","and","be","veri","open","mind","when","it","come","to","movi","but","thi","movi","seem","to","have","a","ridicul","plot","and","over","the","top","act","and","it","just","be","not","for","me"],"filtered":["sai","realli","surpris","high","rate","thi","movi","find","absolut","idiot","mother","get","vision","touch","certain","thing","peopl","thing","touch","twice","make","vision","continu","seem","ridicul","deede","pfieffer","perform","aw","think","veri","irrit","girl","plai","lori","good","job","much","support","cast","thei","work","withbr","br","usual","love","lmn","veri","open","mind","come","movi","thi","movi","seem","ridicul","plot","top","act"],"filtered2":["realli","surpris","high","rate","find","absolut","idiot","mother","get","vision","touch","certain","thing","peopl","thing","touch","twice","make","vision","continu","seem","ridicul","deede","pfieffer","perform","aw","think","veri","irrit","girl","plai","lori","good","job","support","cast","work","withbr","usual","love","lmn","veri","open","mind","come","seem","ridicul","plot","top","act"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,12,13,15,21,23,29,32,34,35,38,40,48,54,84,92,105,138,202,211,222,238,242,265,274,289,326,364,397,433,458,706,745,774,959,1256,1509,3233],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,12,13,15,21,23,29,32,34,35,38,40,48,54,84,92,105,138,202,211,222,238,242,265,274,289,326,364,397,433,458,706,745,774,959,1256,1509,3233],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,2.6390769554676132,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.6955116224012472,1.8113893252729412,2.2212694515902225,2.0489535369135887,2.1765612129984904,2.2907365189289424,2.597304642813496,2.5687161421197025,2.5771019354959765,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.73529586597515,5.497904384845272,2.8282659991423613,2.942840385588056,2.9878441007049847,3.3176717946075294,3.164467636384302,3.2850956241729166,3.6590123745461547,7.393983245222743,3.753391311073496,3.969732115064953,4.291900363587903,9.19456402627817,5.5623629091826725]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1079376971861927E-4,1.1004666142793769E-4,1.1090216928563997E-4,1.1026137537002716E-4,1.1026318187852214E-4,1.1010905598504993E-4,1.1043653574525594E-4,1.1006250742811689E-4,1.1030996806735802E-4,1.223828879883974E-4,0.9912316992938777,1.0988484227502541E-4,1.11935788364517E-4,1.1353257698186243E-4,1.0996496915570471E-4,1.0966107342637511E-4,1.123964317282485E-4,1.1044688281504534E-4,1.1010422179136353E-4,1.1019547861503129E-4,1.1126168450157936E-4,1.105563077276058E-4,1.1068219285605622E-4,1.1080144050484199E-4,1.1165178463682056E-4,1.1106787723555291E-4,1.1573695979658144E-4,1.0991751003110364E-4,1.0992045058191032E-4,1.1019893342185772E-4,1.1254118595388977E-4,1.1044048336132119E-4,1.1854850328496141E-4,1.1075113614369095E-4,1.1003715029765227E-4,1.1054504428351223E-4,1.0992689032324573E-4,1.0999184902759019E-4,1.0966052248027574E-4,1.096889734790832E-4,1.0993587002755432E-4,1.110954605089637E-4,1.1053093778829083E-4,1.100939293579868E-4,1.1143168604022121E-4,1.1013618400967987E-4,1.137954624893675E-4,1.121220670439868E-4,1.0971623718546351E-4,1.0995871677925176E-4,1.099205789535593E-4,1.130141572414073E-4,1.0996035275533048E-4,1.0967923560475161E-4,1.1088312217859258E-4,1.0998867562314421E-4,1.1828073256457242E-4,1.0989803066278092E-4,1.0971496838012266E-4,1.1023882515279514E-4,1.1133230164923575E-4,1.1023153222746247E-4,1.0969467086569089E-4,1.099500781062612E-4,1.0966184884370684E-4,1.1219919673078719E-4,1.1060653419396466E-4,1.1037092608190981E-4,1.1027440171878451E-4,1.1067636944216066E-4,1.0965784820554292E-4,1.1027671356995905E-4,1.1206532865746251E-4,1.0985436116057254E-4,1.1257319936154377E-4,1.1014480493084943E-4,1.1100685340427936E-4,1.1032842834985552E-4,1.0962346724045271E-4,1.0975935305710077E-4]}}

{"value":"Not totally off the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. \"Killer Tongue\" is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. What this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film. There is very little dialog, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete \"pond scum\". I wouldn't even call it strange, more like just \"total nonsense\". This movie is certain to disappoint, and you have been warned.

{"value":"Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, it didn't make the goal. The historical subject of giants is a good one, but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese. I say, take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff. I couldn't even watch the entire film. That says a lot because I rarely walk away from any movie. I always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption.

{"value":"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as \"terrible, just terrible.\" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.","finished_norm":["becaus","of","the","writer","guild","of","america","strike","thei","have","to","shoot","thi","episod","in","dai","it","pretti","much","crap","consist","of","repeat","cut","+","past","clip","from","season","and","be","describ","by","it","writer","mauric","hurlei","a","terribl","just","terribl","br","br","why","the","produc","can","not","just","wait","to","shoot","someth","decent","who","know","i","be","guess","becaus","of","the","strike","the","product","run","out","of","monei","and","can","onli","releas","a","flashback","episod","or","mayb","roddenberri","be","too","sick","at","the","time","to","be","abl","to","veto","thi","halfasseri","thi","episod","conjur","mark","the","final","appear","of","diana","muldaur","dr","katherin","pulaski","on","the","seri"],"filtered":["becaus","writer","guild","america","strike","thei","shoot","thi","episod","dai","pretti","much","crap","consist","repeat","cut","+","past","clip","season","describ","writer","mauric","hurlei","terribl","terribl","br","br","produc","wait","shoot","someth","decent","know","guess","becaus","strike","product","run","monei","onli","releas","flashback","episod","mayb","roddenberri","sick","time","abl","veto","thi","halfasseri","thi","episod","conjur","mark","final","appear","diana","muldaur","dr","katherin","pulaski","seri"],"filtered2":["becaus","writer","guild","america","strike","shoot","dai","pretti","crap","consist","repeat","cut","+","past","clip","season","describ","writer","mauric","hurlei","terribl","terribl","produc","wait","shoot","someth","decent","know","guess","becaus","strike","product","run","monei","onli","releas","flashback","mayb","roddenberri","sick","time","abl","veto","halfasseri","conjur","mark","final","appear","diana","muldaur","dr","katherin","pulaski"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,11,22,26,39,53,78,117,126,132,137,156,163,166,169,190,243,261,287,303,309,313,327,331,440,454,668,717,739,778,809,817,828,988,1051,1056,1563,1622,5283,5992,6681,8129],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,11,22,26,39,53,78,117,126,132,137,156,163,166,169,190,243,261,287,303,309,313,327,331,440,454,668,717,739,778,809,817,828,988,1051,1056,1563,1622,5283,5992,6681,8129],"values":[0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.5958480334723544,1.3324924169710188,1.5538940054862738,1.7003182735607676,2.0064197866819473,4.5594602370234405,2.2391270689902285,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.3451551414151686,2.4000574358028657,4.884774065938707,2.4214486257841834,2.558331832813986,2.627841366673578,2.7085302779237206,5.68378037616381,2.868298950055202,2.848772527704847,2.907069060519773,2.9674191958529437,2.932274249550174,3.212973749990824,3.2556198060399626,3.5813614403160887,3.7398317812878634,4.004218291136122,3.8059428063999263,3.90413483257914,4.197121957260614,3.827761853794566,4.039936373738201,4.191816905030921,8.201690253650389,4.74221603786142,4.770124825978496,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.249923041475338E-5,8.194291881732108E-5,8.257994687452555E-5,8.210279906173091E-5,8.21041442236561E-5,8.198937903757446E-5,8.223322693860732E-5,8.19547180621997E-5,8.213898214444173E-5,9.11287168988929E-5,0.5801351891552717,8.182242507822786E-5,8.33496000668118E-5,0.34133408724671155,8.188208913703156E-5,8.165580237145174E-5,8.369260421857978E-5,8.224093157124904E-5,8.198577940142328E-5,8.20537310357237E-5,8.284764900897518E-5,8.232241152357278E-5,8.241614807793136E-5,8.250494223376322E-5,8.313812527874941E-5,8.270333628871504E-5,8.618002743304628E-5,8.184675013497676E-5,8.184893972721794E-5,8.20563035531598E-5,8.380039107559364E-5,8.223616641154144E-5,8.827355827560213E-5,8.246748461234637E-5,8.193583664175367E-5,8.231402454051499E-5,8.185373488587705E-5,8.190210442083164E-5,8.165539212609848E-5,8.167657730205293E-5,8.186042135116017E-5,8.272387533919134E-5,8.230352056540365E-5,8.197811545213415E-5,8.297423551418116E-5,8.2009579100812E-5,8.47343501706492E-5,8.348830685274357E-5,8.169687839660312E-5,8.187743349396661E-5,8.184903531528463E-5,8.415257484303444E-5,8.187865167408461E-5,8.166932628838789E-5,8.25657640222133E-5,8.189974144116905E-5,8.8074170905574E-5,8.183224541237664E-5,8.169593361907247E-5,8.208600772434747E-5,8.290023193264077E-5,8.208057726802357E-5,8.168081968871152E-5,8.187100096734226E-5,8.165637976252058E-5,0.07216975795456558,8.235981114298804E-5,8.218437268671596E-5,8.211249873843949E-5,8.241181184886368E-5,8.165340080828398E-5,8.211422018851035E-5,8.344605832888598E-5,8.179972823804512E-5,8.382422889157479E-5,8.201599840907962E-5,8.265789673800913E-5,8.215272803559743E-5,8.162780006224869E-5,8.172898332667066E-5]}}

Marilyn Bell's is a sweet story, but the usual glorification of us Canadians in the face of a superior world. Another sample of our inferiority complex. Our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies. That's pretty good. Better than Lebanon. What should we do about hockey though...? And curling.

{"value":"Without a doubt this is one of the worst films I've ever wasted money on! The plot is, erm sorry, did I say there was a plot? The scariest moment was when..., nope can't think of one! The best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was..., nope can't think of one for that either. You knew who the killer was right from the start. There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her top off. This film should only be watched to get an idea of how NOT to make a horror movie!!!","finished_norm":["without","a","doubt","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","wast","monei","on","the","plot","be","erm","sorri","do","i","sai","there","be","a","plot","the","scari","moment","be","when","no","ca","not","think","of","on","the","well","special","effect","that","have","me","hide","under","the","bed","cover","be","no","ca","not","think","of","on","for","that","either","you","know","who","the","killer","be","right","from","the","start","there","be","noth","scari","about","the","whole","movi","in","fact","the","onli","two","vagu","interest","bit","be","when","you","see","the","kid","sister","misti","in","the","shower","and","when","you","see","nurs","toppan","take","her","top","off","thi","film","should","onli","be","watch","to","get","a","idea","of","how","not","to","make","a","horror","movi"],"filtered":["without","doubt","thi","wrong","film","ever","wast","monei","plot","erm","sorri","sai","plot","scari","moment","ca","think","well","special","effect","hide","bed","cover","ca","think","either","know","killer","right","start","noth","scari","whole","movi","fact","onli","two","vagu","interest","bit","see","kid","sister","misti","shower","see","nurs","toppan","take","top","thi","film","onli","watch","get","idea","make","horror","movi"],"filtered2":["without","doubt","wrong","ever","wast","monei","plot","erm","sorri","plot","scari","moment","ca","think","well","special","effect","hide","bed","cover","ca","think","either","know","killer","right","start","noth","scari","whole","fact","onli","two","vagu","interest","bit","see","kid","sister","misti","shower","see","nurs","toppan","take","top","onli","watch","get","idea","make","horror"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,11,12,20,25,26,31,32,44,47,49,60,71,81,83,89,97,106,111,114,121,123,125,126,188,203,207,252,364,396,437,491,567,585,707,1065,1381,1507,1820,2234,4634,7602],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,11,12,20,25,26,31,32,44,47,49,60,71,81,83,89,97,106,111,114,121,123,125,126,188,203,207,252,364,396,437,491,567,585,707,1065,1381,1507,1820,2234,4634,7602],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,3.899514464849456,2.292318797740072,1.9940046109572438,2.0545557924622586,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.4433074195966826,2.2190595059394194,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,2.5378812223426954,2.569760528637609,2.5531798379045583,3.0433232530252132,2.9878441007049847,6.583053029006414,3.1952392950510555,3.369778711402955,3.454678155189441,3.7165362186843414,3.6375061693251913,4.1302590120314875,4.449957298382227,4.550761997504193,4.8184434032493035,5.116075806554253,6.2980697041614135,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.871896037106297E-5,9.805327534267195E-5,9.881554605984432E-5,9.824458878199327E-5,9.824619840896941E-5,9.810886985693548E-5,9.840065938221481E-5,9.8067394373622E-5,9.828788562597929E-5,1.090450437777519E-4,0.7023060708946052,9.790909197763078E-5,9.973651662656103E-5,1.0115927995194499E-4,9.798048626612304E-5,9.770971047668276E-5,1.0014695697970448E-4,9.840987878123959E-5,9.810456251568186E-5,9.818587375531316E-5,9.91358796710686E-5,9.850737806873651E-5,9.861954366287023E-5,9.872579516008638E-5,9.948346491786927E-5,9.896319440308756E-5,1.0312341909335673E-4,9.793819945295082E-5,9.794081952914545E-5,9.818895204156566E-5,1.0027593523092669E-4,9.840417676911206E-5,1.0562854777447118E-4,9.868097319719466E-5,9.804480077865886E-5,9.849734216605049E-5,9.7946557438157E-5,9.80044366472156E-5,9.770921957519716E-5,9.773456985464811E-5,9.79545584934152E-5,9.898777152580538E-5,9.848477306088985E-5,9.809539179854478E-5,9.928735366819702E-5,9.813304134595684E-5,1.0139351500021016E-4,9.990249380761784E-5,9.775886223820506E-5,9.797491530211623E-5,9.794093391026779E-5,1.0069735995460633E-4,9.797637298207505E-5,9.772589325818713E-5,9.879857479322374E-5,9.800160909483121E-5,0.22124918517941913,9.79208430348563E-5,9.775773171304575E-5,9.822449619008183E-5,9.919880064053027E-5,9.821799808094868E-5,9.773964631412928E-5,9.796721811103064E-5,9.771040138550404E-5,9.997121755006308E-5,9.855213062616508E-5,9.834220015862962E-5,9.825619545996825E-5,9.861435491112867E-5,9.770683675509779E-5,9.825825535507844E-5,0.06883729444230616,9.788193283377837E-5,1.003044596716923E-4,9.814072271989565E-5,9.890882122672139E-5,9.83043340228606E-5,9.767620278408228E-5,9.77972791458916E-5]}}

And Michael McDowell, other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film, does so, too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is fat too, haha!

{"value":"Return to Cabin by the Lake does not, in any way, stand up to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) returning for the sequal, the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a huge fan of the first film, the story line and acting was really good, but this is one movie that I will never again watch. It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like, but with much worse acting. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, watching it will just detract from the first.","finished_norm":["return","to","cabin","by","the","lake","doe","not","in","ani","wai","stand","up","to","the","origin","with","onli","on","main","charact","stanlei","return","for","the","sequal","the","film","be","not","even","worth","the","hour","of","your","time","i","be","a","huge","fan","of","the","film","the","stori","line","and","act","be","realli","good","but","thi","be","on","movi","that","i","will","never","again","watch","it","be","basic","equal","to","what","the","sequal","to","urban","legend","and","blair","witch","be","like","but","with","much","wrong","act","i","have","person","see","well","act","in","soap","opera","it","be","so","piti","that","you","just","have","to","laugh","i","in","no","wai","recommend","thi","movi","to","anyon","watch","it","will","just","detract","from","the"],"filtered":["return","cabin","lake","doe","ani","wai","stand","origin","onli","main","charact","stanlei","return","sequal","film","even","worth","hour","time","huge","fan","film","stori","line","act","realli","good","thi","movi","never","watch","basic","equal","sequal","urban","legend","blair","witch","like","much","wrong","act","person","see","well","act","soap","opera","piti","laugh","wai","recommend","thi","movi","anyon","watch","detract"],"filtered2":["return","cabin","lake","doe","ani","wai","stand","origin","onli","main","charact","stanlei","return","sequal","even","worth","hour","time","huge","fan","stori","line","act","realli","good","never","watch","basic","equal","sequal","urban","legend","blair","witch","like","wrong","act","person","see","well","act","soap","opera","piti","laugh","wai","recommend","anyon","watch","detract"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,10,11,13,17,18,20,21,25,27,33,42,69,107,133,140,153,158,174,179,219,286,298,377,444,488,906,1135,1266,1343,1377,1437,1610,1854,3117,3446,4310,7001],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,10,11,13,17,18,20,21,25,27,33,42,69,107,133,140,153,158,174,179,219,286,298,377,444,488,906,1135,1266,1343,1377,1437,1610,1854,3117,3446,4310,7001],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,3.4860466360051467,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,2.803707089537043,1.6219954307453837,2.127032521151058,2.1439533986393955,2.3212364753796515,2.317169775997098,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.456282578459816,2.507968722980095,2.5792094178355414,2.780700890737216,2.7819920465008363,3.0602441305135506,3.2535472664379905,6.786618417626299,3.9081109809587793,4.4919214974812585,4.327618446189983,4.520909034354511,4.558366596889411,4.828393734102471,5.051537285416681,5.0768550934009715,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149,5.9370563586240825,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.12210832895030867,9.847104679461803E-5,9.923656528646367E-5,9.866317535503595E-5,9.866479184008182E-5,9.852687817808214E-5,9.881991091867695E-5,9.848522598192736E-5,9.870665667205781E-5,0.22580201667038574,0.5213446840201598,9.832624911359865E-5,1.0016145979360474E-4,1.0159028502664189E-4,9.839794758872271E-5,9.812601811630436E-5,1.0057364889263831E-4,9.882916959840605E-5,9.852255248472143E-5,9.860421016371971E-5,9.955826372958572E-5,9.892708429700229E-5,9.903972779034901E-5,9.914643198883505E-5,9.99073299181777E-5,9.938484270877152E-5,0.020920543835524257,9.835548060591031E-5,9.8358111845353E-5,9.860730156549653E-5,1.0070317667605203E-4,9.882344329195609E-5,1.0607859486995554E-4,9.910141905489773E-5,9.846253612338773E-5,9.891700563476925E-5,9.83638742016313E-5,9.842200001419317E-5,9.812552512325553E-5,9.815098341157223E-5,9.837190934664796E-5,9.940952454619883E-5,9.890438297695272E-5,9.85133426942969E-5,9.97103831055808E-5,9.855115265354662E-5,0.10239248546279121,1.0032814414663185E-4,9.817537929666255E-5,9.839235288874466E-5,9.835822671381417E-5,1.0112639694626574E-4,9.839381677937899E-5,9.814226984710291E-5,9.921952171108368E-5,9.841916041457569E-5,1.058389904803674E-4,9.833805023805774E-5,9.817424395472242E-5,9.864299715546616E-5,9.962145278376643E-5,9.863647136011367E-5,9.815608150011006E-5,9.838462290256189E-5,9.81267119688517E-5,1.0039716069742608E-4,9.89720275297635E-5,9.876120262034509E-5,9.867483148509392E-5,9.90345169311119E-5,9.812313215077513E-5,9.867690015671226E-5,1.0027737397112641E-4,9.829897425392826E-5,1.0073182264969855E-4,9.85588667551912E-5,9.933023786690761E-5,9.872317514992951E-5,9.80923676588922E-5,9.821395988564629E-5]}}

{"value":"Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul, operating on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. He is then finally promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he quits from the Army altogether. One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.","finished_norm":["kathryn","bigelow","and","mark","boal","be","alreadi","prepar","a","sequel","about","a","young","u","corpor","in","afghanistan","he","conjur","happen","to","be","a","highlyqualifi","surgeon","and","be","roam","freeli","around","kabul","oper","on","wound","nato","soldier","on","a","particularli","difficult","mission","he","casual","pick","up","a","sniper","rifl","and","shoot","osama","bin","lade","from","a","distanc","of","about","yard","he","be","then","final","promot","to","sergeant","but","be","unabl","to","decid","between","a","sniper","and","surgeon","career","so","he","quit","from","the","armi","altogeth","on","year","late","frustrat","with","civilian","life","he","join","the","navi","and","the","last","scene","show","him","proudli","wear","a","white","uniform"],"filtered":["kathryn","bigelow","mark","boal","alreadi","prepar","sequel","young","u","corpor","afghanistan","conjur","happen","highlyqualifi","surgeon","roam","freeli","around","kabul","oper","wound","nato","soldier","particularli","difficult","mission","casual","pick","sniper","rifl","shoot","osama","bin","lade","distanc","yard","final","promot","sergeant","unabl","decid","sniper","surgeon","career","quit","armi","altogeth","year","late","frustrat","civilian","life","join","navi","last","scene","show","proudli","wear","white","uniform"],"filtered2":["kathryn","bigelow","mark","boal","alreadi","prepar","sequel","young","u","corpor","afghanistan","conjur","happen","highlyqualifi","surgeon","roam","freeli","around","kabul","oper","wound","nato","soldier","particularli","difficult","mission","casual","pick","sniper","rifl","shoot","osama","bin","lade","distanc","yard","final","promot","sergeant","unabl","decid","sniper","surgeon","career","quit","armi","altogeth","year","late","frustrat","civilian","life","join","navi","last","scene","show","proudli","wear","white","uniform"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[19,28,39,57,75,94,98,112,117,120,135,144,150,156,249,330,359,387,446,497,511,514,657,717,803,982,1295,1319,1365,1420,1477,1500,1633,2259,2527,2709,2714,2780,3092,3174,3597,3663,4254,4398,4492,4664,4793,4927,4954,5315,5767,6113,6822,6825],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[19,28,39,57,75,94,98,112,117,120,135,144,150,156,249,330,359,387,446,497,511,514,657,717,803,982,1295,1319,1365,1420,1477,1500,1633,2259,2527,2709,2714,2780,3092,3174,3597,3663,4254,4398,4492,4664,4793,4927,4954,5315,5767,6113,6822,6825],"values":[1.312380678011735,1.5452294193519092,1.5538940054862738,1.834162586674748,1.9742250248702675,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.2044500422972613,2.366244071437088,2.2931108769894046,2.332712011146513,2.3451551414151686,2.6754694156628323,2.9292757465539174,3.2189558216683714,3.360519385990158,3.233054746047873,3.342254038012865,3.3909310864081816,3.405285399859865,4.00861390260916,3.7398317812878634,3.7636829971100436,4.1554492608600455,4.358390104856736,4.403125998698128,4.422928625994308,4.573751515728891,4.589376833631972,4.520909034354511,4.770124825978496,5.02684467282631,5.243909178064138,5.426230734858092,5.408212229355414,5.3064295350454715,5.426230734858092,5.5623629091826725,5.822646007446338,5.695894301807195,11.814406790948803,6.1754673820690815,6.0662680901040895,12.429376190444724,6.101359409915359,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.1452843423828494E-5,5.1105884871928775E-5,5.150318439483518E-5,5.1205598446720024E-5,5.120643739279951E-5,5.11348610263258E-5,5.128694326767516E-5,5.111324378541448E-5,5.122816499043143E-5,5.6834852621541835E-5,6.619229145299045E-5,5.103073574071934E-5,5.198319911732733E-5,5.272475087531773E-5,5.106794682087396E-5,5.0926817049605436E-5,5.219712279668671E-5,5.129174846712926E-5,5.11326160173198E-5,5.117499586477384E-5,5.167014396450407E-5,5.134256561061069E-5,5.14010269105556E-5,5.145640575195812E-5,5.185130723053568E-5,5.1580139490980104E-5,5.37484705673182E-5,5.1045906710556094E-5,5.104727230810386E-5,5.117660028382331E-5,5.226434694228419E-5,5.128877654829932E-5,5.505415686406841E-5,5.143304430821977E-5,5.1101467884415826E-5,5.133733484513686E-5,5.1050262936579296E-5,5.1080429885967676E-5,5.092656118915897E-5,5.0939773888669146E-5,5.1054433128828874E-5,5.1592949217118376E-5,5.133078376115688E-5,5.112783619112264E-5,5.1749093011655034E-5,5.114745933403955E-5,5.2846835419335E-5,5.20697073005248E-5,5.0952435207253234E-5,5.106504320501652E-5,5.1047331924148805E-5,5.248399573356921E-5,5.106580295550824E-5,5.093525160077754E-5,5.1494338881056977E-5,5.1078956150734246E-5,5.492980361762999E-5,5.10368604537959E-5,5.095184597157054E-5,5.1195126081718

{"value":"Saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest.<br /><br />What can I say? Against my better judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that that acting was a little...weak (mostly I noticed this from the family of the teen boy). I mean, the script wasn't stellar to begin with, but the actors didn't make me believe the relationships.<br /><br />The plot is also predictable.<br /><br />Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are likable, and the plot is not challenging or upsetting. It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don't count it as fifty minutes ill-spent. <br /><br />But I don't recommend it.","finished_norm":["see","it","at","the","philadelphia","gai","and","lesbian","film","festbr","br","what","can","i","sai","against","my","well","judgment","i","like","it","but","it","seem","to","me","that","that","act","be","a","littleweak","mostli","i","notic","thi","from","the","famili","of","the","teen","boi","i","mean","the","script","be","not","stellar","to","begin","with","but","the","actor","do","not","make","me","believ","the","relationshipsbr","br","the","plot","be","conjur","predictablebr","br","nonethelss","i","like","it","the","charact","be","likabl","and","the","plot","be","not","challeng","or","upset","it","sweet","the","charact","care","about","each","other","and","i","do","not","count","it","a","fifti","minut","illspent","br","br","but","i","do","not","recommend","it"],"filtered":["see","philadelphia","gai","lesbian","film","festbr","br","sai","well","judgment","like","seem","act","littleweak","mostli","notic","thi","famili","teen","boi","mean","script","stellar","begin","actor","make","believ","relationshipsbr","br","plot","conjur","predictablebr","br","nonethelss","like","charact","likabl","plot","challeng","upset","sweet","charact","care","count","fifti","minut","illspent","br","br","recommend"],"filtered2":["see","philadelphia","gai","lesbian","festbr","well","judgment","like","seem","act","littleweak","mostli","notic","famili","teen","boi","mean","script","stellar","begin","actor","make","believ","relationshipsbr","plot","conjur","predictablebr","nonethelss","like","charact","likabl","plot","challeng","upset","sweet","charact","care","count","fifti","minut","illspent","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,10,20,21,32,35,39,41,59,77,88,91,147,182,205,282,298,510,640,688,881,884,1239,1388,1438,1463,1826,3074,4214,5631,7518,8557],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,10,20,21,32,35,39,41,59,77,88,91,147,182,205,282,298,510,640,688,881,884,1239,1388,1438,1463,1826,3074,4214,5631,7518,8557],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,2.247774048205673,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.742262257014735,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.8693254449200722,1.9463902258768238,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.2844323215331563,2.7365296724240786,2.571852579609833,2.918851229218033,2.7819920465008363,3.374440724508766,3.9998419165363233,3.6016814428070463,4.086456389373095,3.9323057095458362,4.573751515728891,4.443131333311827,4.513582994262438,4.550761997504193,4.77960356993304,5.463272006538442,5.9370563586240825,6.342521466732247,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1231485927361669E-4,1.1155749392046406E-4,1.1242474706014269E-4,1.1177515567392824E-4,1.1177698698400918E-4,1.1162074509351556E-4,1.119527208289374E-4,1.1157355747065011E-4,1.1182441550122993E-4,1.2406308474429187E-4,0.2863730113774831,1.1139345314964024E-4,1.134725567129908E-4,1.1509126766851058E-4,1.1147468009363162E-4,1.1116661217464854E-4,1.1393952425732316E-4,1.1196320995382448E-4,1.1161584453110155E-4,1.117083542212586E-4,1.1278919806661631E-4,1.1207413716287666E-4,1.1220175057040362E-4,1.1232263537219435E-4,1.1318465389327071E-4,1.1259273001732755E-4,0.1886553426916157,1.114265694018991E-4,1.1142955032357797E-4,1.117118564591869E-4,1.1408626581619828E-4,1.1195672264189096E-4,0.36848683894817813,1.122716403816107E-4,1.1154785221170865E-4,1.1206271908276695E-4,1.1143607847623207E-4,1.1150192899973688E-4,1.1116605366460077E-4,1.1119489526765633E-4,1.1144518146305434E-4,1.1262069198196967E-4,1.1204841891923194E-4,1.1160541079273136E-4,1.12961533559283E-4,1.1164824555925854E-4,1.1535776233563394E-4,1.136613928156296E-4,1.1122253327792674E-4,1.1146834187819569E-4,1.1142968045764351E-4,1.1456573053459268E-4,1.114700003146179E-4,1.1118502370188189E-4,1.1240543845503765E-4,1.1149871202756714E-4,1.1990461076023578E-4,1.1140682260099628E-4,1.1122124705313572E-4,1.1175229586437905E-4,1.1286078471829786E-4,1.1174490281435005E-4,1.1120067087378198E-4,1.114595846047162E-4,1.1116739823769804E-4,1.1373958141721619E-4,1.121250531892492E-4,0.10252618564360923,1.1178836086164996E-4,1.1219584720675932E-4,1.1116334267470451E-4,1.1179070445226872E-4,0.045532932541058675,1.1136255355944693E-4,1.1411871873647223E-4,1.1165698483720195E-4,1.1253086838883317E-4,1.1184312922526083E-4,1.1112848969275791E-4,1.1126624108810143E-4]}}
{"value":"Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I ever saw! I didn't like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (apart from SRK of course, though even he doesn't manage to save the movie), and not much sense. The director makes it all look very confusing, God knows why... Maybe it's because he's trying to make it all look very surrealistic, and yet credible. Well, he manages neither.<br /><br />Even if you've got a few hours to loose, don't watch this movie, please!

{"value":"If you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece. How could it be worse more you ask? Well...at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. Other than updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going. And for anyone that didn't see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once. Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again.","finished_norm":["if","you","think","that","the","origin","from","be","bad","then","try","out","thi","modern","dai","masterpiec","how","can","it","be","wrong","much","you","ask","wellat","littl","in","the","on","you","have","alli","sheedi","jog","in","a","sport","bra","other","than","updat","graphic","modern","dai","theme","such","a","terrorist","modern","weapon","and","a","sexi","new","voic","for","riplei","unfortun","thi","be","the","same","sad","tire","stori","anyon","that","see","the","on","can","see","exactli","where","the","next","scene","line","in","the","stori","be","go","and","for","anyon","that","do","not","see","the","onewel","consid","yourself","lucki","that","you","onli","watch","it","onc","mayb","in","anoth","year","hollywood","will","try","again"],"filtered":["think","origin","bad","try","thi","modern","dai","masterpiec","wrong","much","ask","wellat","littl","alli","sheedi","jog","sport","bra","updat","graphic","modern","dai","theme","terrorist","modern","weapon","sexi","new","voic","riplei","unfortun","thi","sad","tire","stori","anyon","see","see","exactli","next","scene","line","stori","go","anyon","see","onewel","consid","lucki","onli","watch","onc","mayb","anoth","year","hollywood","try"],"filtered2":["think","origin","bad","try","modern","dai","masterpiec","wrong","ask","wellat","littl","alli","sheedi","jog","sport","bra","updat","graphic","modern","dai","theme","terrorist","modern","weapon","sexi","new","voic","riplei","unfortun","sad","tire","stori","anyon","see","see","exactli","next","scene","line","stori","go","anyon","see","onewel","consid","lucki","onli","watch","onc","mayb","anoth","year","hollywood","try"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,7,9,11,12,14,17,19,25,36,57,69,73,87,107,132,158,163,227,236,297,300,306,317,428,455,462,533,729,900,1087,1146,1174,1278,1676,1822,2022,2281,2559,5444,6721],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,7,9,11,12,14,17,19,25,36,57,69,73,87,107,132,158,163,227,236,297,300,306,317,428,455,462,533,729,900,1087,1146,1174,1278,1676,1822,2022,2281,2559,5444,6721],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,2.9360366939211433,1.834162586674748,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,2.115024371522662,2.1439533986393955,4.506988091575534,4.621394522982961,2.4000574358028657,2.6005321873043625,2.617923930016232,2.813490713560207,2.932274249550174,2.8739486825973213,2.8529247828056143,3.3721070011625462,3.2787058260741455,3.2639531875991072,3.4933926673701317,11.385627752270452,3.9201351739255808,4.176068548062782,4.297765483040301,4.235066888824737,4.470719289830655,4.770124825978496,5.014723312293965,4.890269137820559,5.339219357868463,5.243909178064138,6.255510089742618,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.828578576555386E-5,8.76904540726049E-5,8.837216373586186E-5,8.786154843233586E-5,8.786298794488587E-5,8.774017304611881E-5,8.80011246142939E-5,8.770308092500476E-5,8.790026942248918E-5,9.75205506376058E-5,0.8939259460521538,8.756150881599832E-5,8.919580095655292E-5,9.046819865672921E-5,8.762535775479407E-5,0.09917443490270923,8.956286366619812E-5,8.800936965540991E-5,8.773632092889932E-5,8.780903873969713E-5,8.865864269054038E-5,8.809656467018613E-5,8.819687597387828E-5,8.82918982156567E-5,8.896949317477326E-5,8.850420777229838E-5,9.222475653376339E-5,8.758754004972102E-5,8.758988322153664E-5,8.781179169535624E-5,8.96782107708781E-5,8.800427026397353E-5,9.446512913518357E-5,8.825181328973594E-5,8.768287514815003E-5,8.808758941810514E-5,8.759501471607255E-5,8.764677692499392E-5,8.738276005248446E-5,8.740543117191572E-5,8.760217017483922E-5,8.852618744654579E-5,8.807634868662554E-5,8.772811942469549E-5,8.87941080642565E-5,8.776178995631877E-5,9.067767842851967E-5,8.934423673620124E-5,8.742715619983725E-5,8.762037556157642E-5,8.758998551421906E-5,9.005509696104095E-5,8.762167918572396E-5,8.739767156693764E-5,8.835698608808881E-5,8.764424820423846E-5,9.425175659163181E-5,8.757201795544663E-5,8.742614515493115E-5,8.784357933847284E-5,8.871491381828701E-5,8.783776798603705E-5,8.740997112262547E-5,8.761349185290867E-5,8.738381696243546E-5,8.940569736726666E-5,8.81365875258032E-5,8.794884369004123E-5,8.787192845134433E-5,8.819223559858538E-5,8.73806290622064E-5,8.787377064516115E-5,8.929902487049717E-5,8.753722000312269E-5,8.970372058841518E-5,8.776865951948472E-5,8.8455581058828E-5,8.791497946033593E-5,8.735323266143336E-5,8.746151299278805E-5]}}

{"value":"Even 20+ years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I ever managed to sit through. Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene, fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine guns with wild abandon, and then silently leave. Wow, how will we find those silent invisible assassins? Just follow the shell casings and smoke!Painfully bad dialog (or was it brilliant and just poorly translated?), not an Asian in sight in the cast, and a whopping total of 3 Asians among the stunt crew.

{"value":"This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this junk either. For starters the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the worst part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move. You never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter. The main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy impossible. This game wouldn't even be worth renting.","finished_norm":["thi","game","be","make","by","sega","be","make","by","sega","i","do","not","expect","much","but","i","conjur","do","not","expect","thi","junk","either","for","starter","the","camera","angl","work","against","you","in","thi","game","the","motorcycl","be","your","mean","of","get","around","the","motorcycl","be","the","wrong","part","in","the","game","whenev","you","run","in","to","someth","you","just","stick","there","and","you","do","not","move","you","never","fall","off","the","bike","or","wreck","for","that","matt","the","main","charact","hardli","talk","even","though","he","get","a","voic","that","suit","him","the","graphic","be","horribl","you","ride","through","tree","on","your","bike","the","camera","make","fight","the","enemi","imposs","thi","game","would","not","even","be","worth","rent"],"filtered":["thi","game","make","sega","make","sega","expect","much","conjur","expect","thi","junk","either","starter","camera","angl","work","thi","game","motorcycl","mean","get","around","motorcycl","wrong","part","game","whenev","run","someth","stick","move","never","fall","bike","wreck","matt","main","charact","hardli","talk","even","though","get","voic","suit","graphic","horribl","ride","tree","bike","camera","make","fight","enemi","imposs","thi","game","even","worth","rent"],"filtered2":["game","make","sega","make","sega","expect","conjur","expect","junk","either","starter","camera","angl","work","game","motorcycl","mean","get","around","motorcycl","wrong","part","game","whenev","run","someth","stick","move","never","fall","bike","wreck","matt","main","charact","hardli","talk","even","though","get","voic","suit","graphic","horribl","ride","tree","bike","camera","make","fight","enemi","imposs","game","even","worth","rent"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,10,25,39,42,48,53,61,86,88,98,130,137,170,179,186,207,219,230,231,232,275,374,408,416,428,661,665,888,901,1002,1146,1293,1351,1482,1498,1564,1886,3541,4076,5187],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,10,25,39,42,48,53,61,86,88,98,130,137,170,179,186,207,219,230,231,232,275,374,408,416,428,661,665,888,901,1002,1146,1293,1351,1482,1498,1564,1886,3541,4076,5187],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,1.1238870241028365,1.2796387880827016,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,2.0881990796736947,4.528427806839927,2.2939035841256437,2.4071371113909277,2.507968722980095,2.571852579609833,2.5531798379045583,2.5792094178355414,2.7121382192999195,5.409870614011723,2.8377834061292515,2.7832848715031413,13.828852043170517,3.130944944345658,3.1401446412440817,3.3721070011625462,3.5727776966246974,3.5929222627171646,3.9323057095458362,3.8962296530720266,4.072271754381138,4.297765483040301,4.409683399244287,4.573751515728891,4.506310234933358,4.506310234933358,4.724033718778229,4.848596441419991,12.064733076856815,5.822646007446338,12.596139408322827]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.658736436051358E-5,7.607091785796647E-5,7.666229670695346E-5,7.621934113986988E-5,7.622058990796106E-5,7.611404875505396E-5,7.634042260061664E-5,7.608187157307576E-5,7.625293135550377E-5,8.459846485541868E-5,0.6029120577195333,7.595905865815698E-5,7.737679682013654E-5,7.848059382924583E-5,7.601444721133321E-5,7.580437607638692E-5,7.769522141411828E-5,7.634757512197265E-5,7.611070706757288E-5,7.617378931147861E-5,7.691081539989285E-5,7.642321624935436E-5,7.65102356749474E-5,7.659266687256695E-5,7.718047624156907E-5,7.677684407879258E-5,8.000439674929908E-5,7.59816405898302E-5,7.598367327665567E-5,7.617617748321321E-5,0.3911045570244948,7.634315143194635E-5,8.194790590244779E-5,7.655789345122581E-5,7.606434318862812E-5,7.641543027457491E-5,7.598812481591907E-5,7.603302820688275E-5,7.580399522907247E-5,7.582366228271295E-5,7.5994332131434E-5,7.679591130808113E-5,7.640567901065353E-5,7.610359231421462E-5,7.702833076032222E-5,7.613280128881096E-5,7.866231621489551E-5,7.75055639262056E-5,7.584250860791399E-5,7.60101251900252E-5,7.598376201491485E-5,7.812223070418242E-5,7.601125607578117E-5,7.58169308741561E-5,7.664913019288722E-5,7.603083455751796E-5,8.176280656175748E-5,7.596817527058856E-5,7.58416315328114E-5,7.620375306386215E-5,7.695963024960323E-5,7.619871175214285E-5,7.582760066142444E-5,7.60041536160134E-5,7.58049120918133E-5,7.7558880637434E-5,7.645793582509708E-5,7.62950692273627E-5,7.622834574113131E-5,7.65062101785411E-5,7.580214660839748E-5,7.622994383269098E-5,7.746634291682034E-5,7.593798826561915E-5,7.781741390899153E-5,7.613876059168884E-5,7.673466071042908E-5,7.626569222089741E-5,7.577838040288684E-5,7.587231290989948E-5]}}
{"value":"This film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. Whereas Babe (the original) bucked the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat-grinder (even more so if one could understand their pointless babble).

{"value":"It was 1 a.m. in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don't judge me... please.<br /><br />We're back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group have made their way onto an island. It doesn't take too long before they encounter a large \"reptile\", which gobbles up their horse. Soon they're captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the \"reptile gods.\" THE CG sucks; it reminds me of the CG of early console video games. The encounters were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit.

{"value":"\"Diary of Sex Addict\" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. Probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it. Bottom line, \"Diary...\" would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world, a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim, and no job in spite of being a restaurateur. At the best, this flick could have been good drama. At the worst, cheap softcore. \"Diary...\" isn't either and nowhere in between. This one's for the dumpster.

{"value":"Sure I've seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually became angry in the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket, of course I didn't receive a refund (or even a reply) but it's the point that matters. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a -42. Why did the \"Jeep\" (Chevy Blazer??) stop running from being hit with a bat? Why did they hit the \"Jeep\"(Chevy Blazer?????) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum's skull? The plot was thin, the movie filled with obvious clichés, and certain parts of it just didn't make any sense.","finished_norm":["sure","i","have","see","bad","movi","in","my","life","but","thi","on","be","so","bad","that","i","actual","becom","angri","in","the","theater","i","want","my","monei","back","i","write","to","the","director","ask","him","to","refund","my","movi","ticket","of","cours","i","do","not","receiv","a","refund","or","even","a","repli","but","it","the","point","that","matter","on","a","scale","of","i","give","thi","movi","a","why","do","the","jeep","chevi","blazer","stop","run","from","be","hit","with","a","bat","why","do","thei","hit","the","jeepchevi","blazer","with","the","bat","in","the","place","instead","of","crack","the","bum","skull","the","plot","be","thin","the","movi","fill","with","obviou","cliché","and","certain","part","of","it","just","do","not","make","ani","sens"],"filtered":["sure","see","bad","movi","life","thi","bad","actual","becom","angri","theater","want","monei","back","write","director","ask","refund","movi","ticket","cours","receiv","refund","even","repli","point","matter","scale","give","thi","movi","jeep","chevi","blazer","stop","run","hit","bat","thei","hit","jeepchevi","blazer","bat","place","instead","crack","bum","skull","plot","thin","movi","fill","obviou","cliché","certain","part","make","ani","sens"],"filtered2":["sure","see","bad","life","bad","actual","becom","angri","theater","want","monei","back","write","director","ask","refund","ticket","cours","receiv","refund","even","repli","point","matter","scale","give","jeep","chevi","blazer","stop","run","hit","bat","hit","jeepchevi","blazer","bat","place","instead","crack","bum","skull","plot","thin","fill","obviou","cliché","certain","part","make","ani","sens"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,9,27,30,32,37,52,58,61,63,65,66,75,115,119,126,137,152,164,173,199,306,315,383,388,424,523,553,774,980,1031,1161,1474,1687,1923,1926,2219,2499,4137,4390,4978,5477,5551],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,9,27,30,32,37,52,58,61,63,65,66,75,115,119,126,137,152,164,173,199,306,315,383,388,424,523,553,774,980,1031,1161,1474,1687,1923,1926,2219,2499,4137,4390,4978,5477,5551],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.7122153074726136,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.9742250248702675,2.201553588425805,2.1653408989309972,2.2391270689902285,2.2939035841256437,2.3131195476980753,2.3930275298746078,2.4368824319140248,2.558331832813986,2.8739486825973213,2.854312708080462,3.0433232530252132,6.182885002738823,3.212973749990824,3.4986697244709752,3.454678155189441,3.753391311073496,4.081705786614497,4.081705786614497,4.327618446189983,10.179516996473758,4.646072177308517,4.828393734102471,4.828393734102471,5.014723312293965,5.541743621979936,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,12.275454108172468,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.919379919324008E-5,7.865977689128117E-5,7.927128165064787E-5,7.881325134076517E-5,7.881454260715458E-5,7.87043756267448E-5,7.893845346736227E-5,7.867110338517514E-5,7.88479847046037E-5,8.747753488786434E-5,0.5616616453441168,7.854411087924907E-5,8.00100977590155E-5,8.115145938464898E-5,7.860138442553794E-5,7.838416411228988E-5,8.033935903552679E-5,7.894584940459973E-5,7.870092021435983E-5,7.87661492844322E-5,7.952825797603446E-5,7.902406476430867E-5,7.911404565050143E-5,7.919928216132862E-5,0.10847999369912598,7.938972731905917E-5,8.272712063723789E-5,7.856746132324537E-5,7.856956318683114E-5,7.876861873085286E-5,8.044282728204392E-5,7.894127516676611E-5,8.473677164024376E-5,7.916332532471536E-5,7.86529784716242E-5,7.901601381584798E-5,7.857416622167207E-5,7.862059777283937E-5,7.838377030391176E-5,7.840410667022664E-5,7.858058478565483E-5,7.940944344769288E-5,7.900593069517503E-5,7.869356333044734E-5,7.964977264015263E-5,7.872376635007255E-5,8.133936617891225E-5,8.014324709018618E-5,7.842359437692557E-5,7.859691531643052E-5,7.856965494504659E-5,8.07809003818487E-5,7.859808468869208E-5,7.839714617717415E-5,7.925766705142849E-5,7.861832946880845E-5,0.23580912976680837,7.855353774985962E-5,7.842268745304679E-5,7.879713276857676E-5,7.957873410140959E-5,7.879191989003861E-5,7.840817908054431E-5,7.859074051674775E-5,7.838471836948879E-5,8.01983782852328E-5,0.08802518790820267,7.889155662002722E-5,7.882256238822147E-5,7.910988315768405E-5,7.83818587706485E-5,7.882421486631788E-5,8.010269130441985E-5,7.85223234153574E-5,8.046571000716178E-5,7.8729928461008E-5,7.934610835878592E-5,7.886117985004256E-5,7.83572837493965E-5,7.845441298422773E-5]}}
{"value":"This show was absolutely terrible. For one George isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. He also treats his mother with no respect.

For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times?
