{"value":"I saw this film at the Rotterdam Festival, as did presumably all the other voters. The Director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project, which I think explains the above average reception and mark it got. It's most similar to a feature length episode of Aussie kids favourite \"Round the Twist\" but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature. The movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all UN member states, as I can't think of another Fijian movie but overall it was generic, poorly acted (albeit by an amateur cast) and prey to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over, but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","at","the","rotterdam","festiv","a","do","presum","all","the","other","voter","the","director","be","present","and","seem","to","have","work","veri","hard","and","be","veri","commit","to","the","project","which","i","think","explain","the","abov","averag","recept","and","mark","it","get","it","much","similar","to","a","featur","length","episod","of","aussi","kid","favourit","round","the","twist","but","it","take","itself","too","serious","to","have","even","that","redeem","featur","the","movi","in","itself","be","mayb","worth","see","if","you","re","try","to","do","a","cinemat","world","tour","visit","all","un","member","state","a","i","ca","not","think","of","anoth","fijian","movi","but","overal","it","be","gener","poorli","act","albeit","by","a","amateur","cast","and","prei","to","the","subaltern","mental","the","moral","of","the","stori","seem","to","be","that","nativ","island","will","try","and","screw","each","other","over","but","a","long","a","there","be","a","essenti","decent","white","governor","to","step","in","all","problem","can","be","solv","by","leav","the","island"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","rotterdam","festiv","presum","voter","director","present","seem","work","veri","hard","veri","commit","project","think","explain","abov","averag","recept","mark","get","much","similar","featur","length","episod","aussi","kid","favourit","round","twist","take","serious","even","redeem","featur","movi","mayb","worth","see","re","try","cinemat","world","tour","visit","un","member","state","ca","think","anoth","fijian","movi","overal","gener","poorli","act","albeit","amateur","cast","prei","subaltern","mental","moral","stori","seem","nativ","island","try","screw","long","essenti","decent","white","governor","step","problem","solv","leav","island"],"filtered2":["see","rotterdam","festiv","presum","voter","director","present","seem","work","veri","hard","veri","commit","project","think","explain","abov","averag","recept","mark","get","similar","featur","length","aussi","kid","favourit","round","twist","take","serious","even","redeem","featur","mayb","worth","see","re","try","cinemat","world","tour","visit","un","member","state","ca","think","anoth","fijian","overal","gener","poorli","act","albeit","amateur","cast","prei","subaltern","mental","moral","stori","seem","nativ","island","try","screw","long","essenti","decent","white","governor","step","problem","solv","leav","island"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,12,15,17,21,31,35,36,48,58,68,73,74,81,92,99,114,163,165,167,171,219,225,305,309,359,371,395,398,411,412,435,498,589,618,634,643,659,704,717,719,878,911,969,1060,1093,1158,1167,1197,1217,1365,1480,1607,1651,1705,1798,2305,2643,3148,3933,4761,5772,6189,6496,7792],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,12,15,17,21,31,35,36,48,58,68,73,74,81,92,99,114,163,165,167,171,219,225,305,309,359,371,395,398,411,412,435,498,589,618,634,643,659,704,717,719,878,911,969,1060,1093,1158,1167,1197,1217,1365,1480,1607,1651,1705,1798,2305,2643,3148,3933,4761,5772,6189,6496,7792],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,2.926338025798268,2.9360366939211433,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,1.949757232424728,2.0489535369135887,2.056430207256609,2.4433074195966826,2.4000574358028657,2.448847599972298,2.4609576687888097,2.373087554090762,2.5792094178355414,2.641219492619754,5.7225627547931115,2.848772527704847,3.2189558216683714,3.0466846007279185,3.153168081130368,3.143848349181566,3.229006157521873,3.107414446935464,3.2829611516442836,3.386191741044285,3.530930586689197,3.5642670069567886,3.5119855004467477,3.5813614403160887,3.6405503117064195,3.5900195030592035,3.7398317812878634,8.144543508762276,4.067587905068712,3.969732115064953,4.0536665665501035,4.160564361526816,4.150360191352575,4.2860694432771105,4.2574141875167335,4.240607069200353,4.477736862489302,4.724033718778229,4.5432147918688095,4.597282013139085,4.6295428753573065,4.751432692966343,4.85885294158718,5.064116067623542,5.322690055917252,5.482320201509136,5.822646007446338,6.2980697041614135,6.543192162194399,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6384573438366721E-4,1.6370054239515648E-4,1.6374096132363078E-4,1.6370804415280206E-4,1.6372353717732113E-4,1.6369963979975127E-4,1.637505526604222E-4,1.636752839632678E-4,1.6370057699159263E-4,1.638697437992572E-4,1.6517000252032883E-4,1.6370084738261402E-4,1.638558824299203E-4,1.6387295338590556E-4,1.6379851018201176E-4,1.6

{"value":"The most misogynistic movie of all time? Not to mention by '68 shouldn't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the \"Indians\"? My favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, then there's the blatant rip-offs of \"The Hustler\" (fat boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the Indians with the lead rebel dude), the horrific acting, the so-on-the-nose-they-might-as-well-have-just-told-you-what-to-think music cues, the lack of ANYONE WHO'S ACTUALLY Indian in this movie. And who are we supposed to be rooting for? I have to say it figures that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Even though his movies tend to champion strong women, I've heard from at least one source that in real life he's a misogynistic idiot. Why did I watch it, you ask?

{"value":"Is Miike like Chabrol, alternating art with dreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does he match the fifty/fifty rate some claim for Chabrol? Do we see here too much or too little Miike? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I could easily fill ten lines just citing Chakushin ari's (One Missed Call's) steals, allusions, and clichés. Others here will hit on most of them, though not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural. Only once, when Yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arms, did One Missed Call startle me a little.<br /><br />One other point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as the detective. Ishibashi in Audition's abusive back story, and as Dead or Alive's Boss Aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more, may be the most convincingly evil character actor I've ever seen.

{"value":"\"Smokey And The Bandit\" wasn't exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it to be. It was lowdown slapstick, but it did have brains. It had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. People came out of the theater smiling. \"Hooper\" provides none of this. There is no reason to smile. If it's supposed to be a tribute to the Hollywood Stuntman, it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly-choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car-jumps I've ever seen. It all looks phony, badly-filmed almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (as the girlfriend who wrings her hands on the sidelines) is given her weakest role, with not a single funny or smart line (\"If you do that jump, I won't be here when you get back\").

{"value":"Unentertaining, uninvolving hybrid of \"Cruel Intentions\" and \"Wild Things\", but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics. It's about the acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class Univesity, but to keep it on the down low. As he digs deeper he thinks it's much more than it at first glance seems to be. We follow Alicia, the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well. At about 90 minutes, if this film was welcomed to begin with, it would have worn it out. This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But it IS the only movie thus far that has Miss Swain topless so the grade is higher just for that.<br /><br />My Grade: D<br /><br />Eye Candy: Dominique Swain gets topless( fixing a mistake of

{"value":"WOW!<br /><br />I just was given this film from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt that he got taken! It is beyond boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a script. The Martians are CGI, which look like they were done by a novice, or a Fan produced movie. I cannot stress just how bad this DVD really is!<br /><br />Example: In one of the scenes, the martians are torturing a local female captive. She goes from a woman in front of a green screen, to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is totally noticeable, and when she is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, looking like something from a game back in 1990!<br /><br />If at all possible, avoid this movie like the plague!

{"value":"The beginning of the 90s brought many \"quirky\" and \"off-beat\" independent films, a particular sub-genre of which is the semi-spiritual desert crime movie. Others of note are \"Wild at Heart\", \"From Dusk Til Dawn\", and to a certain extent \"Natural Born Killers\". Good films like those spawned junk like \"Highway 666\", \"Destiny Turns on the Radio\" and this ineptly surreal anti-masterpiece \"Under The Hula Moon\". It's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone, attains it, but keeps going to the point of irritation. While the pursuit across the spirit-world of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and isn't focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy. I won't blow the ending, but let's just say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of genre-cancer.

{"value":"Another British cinema flag waver. Real garbage on offer here once again. I cannot understand (and I am British) why this over the top, patriotic nonsense was ever made. EIGHT years mark you, from when the second world war had actually ended! Other commenter's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage. This is extremely poorly observed. The archive footage is in abundance. Model aircraft swing from wires in the 'action scenes' like so many children's kites in the wind. The usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole Malta event. Guinness must have his worst acting performance ever. The shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable. Hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area. Ealing made many great movies. This clearly is not one of them.

{"value":"I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and appealing: each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous, noteworthy horror director. Then, when I finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown.

The episode \"Sounds Like\" may very well be the worst thing I have watched on TV in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes aren't much better. I really hope that season 3 turns this around next year, but I'm not holding my breath.","finished_norm":["i","be","veri","excit","when","thi","seri","premier","in","the","premis","be","veri","simpl","and","appeal","each","episod","would","be","a","onehour","mini","movi","direct","by","a","famou","noteworthi","horror","director","then","when","i","final","watch","them","it","be","a","bite","of","a","letdown","some","good","episod","emerg","from","that","season","but","all","in","all","it","be","a","mix","bag","i","attribut","it","to","the","learn","curv","and","figur","that","season","would","be","a","whole","lot","betterbr","br","boi","be","i","in","for","a","shock","at","littl","season","on","have","a","few","good","stori","here","and","there","season","with","the","except","of","the","black","cat","star","the","excel","jeffrei","comb","be","a","complet","and","total","loss","to","me","the","episod","sound","like","mai","veri","good","be","the","wrong","thing","i","have","watch","on","tv","in","the","last","year","and","much","of","the","other","episod","be","not","much","well","i","realli","hope","that","season","turn","thi","around","next","year","but","i","be","not","hold","my","breath"],"filtered":["veri","excit","thi","seri","premier","premis","veri","simpl","appeal","episod","onehour","mini","movi","direct","famou","noteworthi","horror","director","final","watch","bite","letdown","good","episod","emerg","season","mix","bag","attribut","learn","curv","figur","season","whole","lot","betterbr","br","boi","shock","littl","season","good","stori","season","except","black","cat","star","excel","jeffrei","comb","complet","total","loss","episod","sound","like","mai","veri","good","wrong","thing","watch","tv","last","year","much","episod","much","well","realli","hope","season","turn","thi","around","next","year","hold","breath"],"filtered2":["veri","excit","premier","premis","veri","simpl","appeal","onehour","mini","direct","famou","noteworthi","horror","director","final","watch","bite","letdown","good","emerg","season","mix","bag","attribut","learn","curv","figur","season","whole","lot","betterbr","boi","shock","littl","season","good","stori","season","except","black","cat","star","excel","jeffrei","comb","complet","total","loss","sound","like","mai","veri","good","wrong","thing","watch","tv","last","year","well","realli","hope","season","turn","around","next","year","hold","breath"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,13,14,15,17,20,25,29,46,57,58,72,83,96,98,100,102,103,111,144,154,156,172,178,181,184,229,232,282,297,414,415,431,484,508,524,580,690,736,782,792,817,865,1599,1805,1896,2010,2169,2852,3106,3273,3480,3673,3918,4868,6698],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,13,14,15,17,20,25,29,46,57,58,72,83,96,98,100,102,103,111,144,154,156,172,178,181,184,229,232,282,297,414,415,431,484,508,524,580,690,736,782,792,817,865,1599,1805,1896,2010,2169,2852,3106,3273,3480,3673,3918,4868,6698],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.0358433949768115,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.655771293751733,3.668325173349496,1.865701314626681,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,2.098582041218749,2.1183455303375887,2.2931108769894046,2.348499626138016,2.3451551414151686,2.5001408943598484,2.532833256045391,2.4442286541160034,2.496249838866882,2.8432628718938773,2.6102777977348763,2.918851229218033,2.813490713560207,3.1254654785810323,3.1588018988486244,3.2189558216683714,3.291526514503207,3.4149707055943286,3.4028786598293,3.5039747767006686,3.634471265630037,3.6841709341823097,3.7568101178222815,4.115443926246347,20.98560978630307,3.9201351739255808,4.662879295624898,4.724033718778229,4.85885294158718,4.9676558014359795,4.956227105612356,5.373120909544144,5.907203395474402,5.822646007446338,5.604922523601468,5.695894301807195,6.032366538428407,6.101359409915359,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7809600260830527E-4,1.7793818273669385E-4,1.7798211704855166E-4,1.779463369498886E-4,1.7796317745993016E-4,1.7793720163923504E-4,1.7799254257930256E-4,1.7791072748576256E-4,1.7793822034210973E-4,1.7812210021138066E-4,1.7953544723228745E-4,1.7793851425003618E-4,1.7810703326759438E-4,1.7812558894762543E-4,1.7804467114354152E-4,1.7794703785475478E-4,1.7800825851784071E-4,1.7809202980947902E-4,1.779562244930667E-4,1.779555738674537E-4,1.7811567195816035E-4,1.7797340319916513E-4,1.779736725464872E-4,1.7808768438665467E-4,1.7795628868635783E-4,1.7812771798807002E-4,1.780008215586041E-4,1.7793778394030492E-4,1.780184533273853E-4,1.7807278712541946E-4,1.779742761875122E-4,1.7806959533417144E-4,1.781570230600051E-4,1.783223804021963E-4,1.7800

{"value":"1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough.

{"value":"I'm never much for classic films. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane bore me. However, I would much rather watch any one of those films 3,469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the latter, I'd probably be sleeping the entire time.<br /><br />The color art direction and the music didn't interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. The dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep. The dialogue doesn't match up to Singin' in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other film that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can't blame me.

{"value":"I won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as I'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a \"Boogeyman\" sequel. Literally 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor \"The Boogeyman\", a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress Suzanna Love's original character's name (Lacy) right. And to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I wish IMDb's

{"value":"I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as the vampiress Quintana) looks sooooo sexy in this movie.<br /><br />Certainly there is very little logic to this movie, but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks. The movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable, but ridiculous.<br /><br />There is too much gore and too many rip-off-the-body scenes that made me feel sick. A good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood -- we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he/she is going to do what a vampire will do. A few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene (like the one at end when Quintana tries to sexually arouse Rosa, all it needs is a few moans, the rest is your imagination).

{"value":"\"Triumph of Love\" is proof that not every Comédie-Française author who uses cross-dressing disguised courtship like Shakespeare is worth seeing. <br /><br />Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright of whom Brittannica says: \"His nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage.\" <br /><br />While Mira Sorvino has fun dangling three mixed-up romances, her pants role wasn't even up to Cherubino in \"Marriage of Figaro.\"<br /><br />The herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech.<br /><br />Best was Fiona Shaw as the fooled spinster, as well as the costumes.<br /><br />The glimpses of audience we see and the

{"value":"My God, was this the \"Run, Lola, Run\" adaptation of Persuasion? It was horrible. Bad enough that the \"screenwriter\" (and I use the term very loosely) cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another, often completely out of context and to rush the story along: but Anne Elliott running from location to location in pursuit of Wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen must be spinning in her grave. No respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion. And the actress that played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen remakes are this bad, they will be turning off a new generation of watchers.<br /><br />If you want to see an impeccable version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get the 1995 Roger Michell directed version starring Amanda Root (whose expressions alone can speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds.

{"value":"This reminds me of when I was a born-again believer who was going to be a minister. I never actually thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be raptured to Heaven before that would ever happen. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch rubbish. I am now an atheist, and that just proves that the \"once saved always saved\" doctorine that Christians tell us is no more real than elves. If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devout born again believer? Yes, I really was saved. I prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heart.<br /><br />If Christians were to read their Bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are alright according to him.

{"value":"Ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying breed, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! Jeez, when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing Westerns for crying out loud? S**t happens. If it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection.<br /><br />Boring, tedious, and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of Coburn/Hackman/Bergen's presence. Nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty. May have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth. A monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70's. Virtually impossible to sit through the entire film.

flop except GHAJINI and some more<br /><br />Okay coming to JAWANI DIWANI<br /><br />Review in short The film is about Emraan Hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it's annoying this time after repetitions It has an irritating Hrishita Bhatt and a flop Celina Jaitley<br /><br />Cringeworthy dialogues, comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholes<br /><br />Direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is annoying here, luckily now he is coming of age But post FOOTPATH and MURDER and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his

{"value":"I sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn't quite make the cut. It plays up every Hollywood cliché imaginable, all the while flogging us with the 'corporations are the ultimate evil' message. Subtlety this movie does not know. As far as that goes, it even manages to provide it's own spoilers.<br /><br />The story appears to be a computer nerd's fantasy world come true. The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you'll have to see

{"value":"Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! <br /><br />I was appalled. <br /><br />Do NOT take kids to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. Certainly *we all* have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his \"thumbs up\" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.<br /><br />What a pity. <br /><br />Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth a \"free\" ticket viewing.<br /><br />Stick with the book. The tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money...seriously.

{"value":"I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, \"Burning Moon\". But while that movie was rather grim and nasty, \"Premutos\" seems to mostly play it for laughs. While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene. Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy. But be warned: there's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition. Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially \"Braindead\". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in \"Bad Taste\", it's clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for

{"value":"This movie is an embarrassment to film-making. I can't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the script atrocious, but the casting people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond that... %99 of the rest of the cast...ouch. Pretty much everyone else...wow it is hard to even...wow. Here is the number one rule about comedy \"DON'T TRY TO BE FUNNY\". There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this film. Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film-making in Canada. I realize this is technically a \"US\" film, but look at the director, actors, location, etc. I just saw this on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film.

{"value":"As many agree, Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music, graphics, and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than this, than I suggest looking else where. The beauty stops short of its appearance, and when it really comes down to plot and characters, there's nothing special. Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat, corny at times, and do not act realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there... So, in summary, oh my goodness, I've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness, it's like... -poke- people don't act like that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there's not even that much action to make up for

{"value":"I've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time, this one however, takes the cake. More comedy than horror, \"Full Moon High\" puts the \"c\" in cheese-fest. The star quality in this movie is not bad. Just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an all-American high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove everyone batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state.

{"value":"the author of the book, by the same title, should not have let her name be used for this movie. if you have read the book, this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details. the movie adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the book's own literary achievement.<br /><br />for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it doesn't offer anything more while it is moving slowly (like character development, for example). some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie, but you might as well watch a

{"value":"It took 9 years to complete this film. I would think that within those 9 years someone would have said,hey, this film is terrible. I've seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. Abused child turns into serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about abused child turns into a florist? At least that would have been a new twist. Why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea (especially unoriginal movie ideas) thinks that they can be a director? I do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed. That shows tenacity and spirit. With this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script. If you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer/director from Michigan see Hatred of A Minute.

{"value":"In the Comic, Modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden who plays Modesty Blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model. She does not either have the moral or personality that Modesty have in the comics. Modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money. I cannot see any similarities with my comic books with Modesty and this movie. Its like a Mission Impossible movie would be about Ethan Hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). Soo if you are an Modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry. If do not know much about the Modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one.I cannot understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it.

{"value":"In this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this Grade-Z film which bares less resemblance to Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. The plot, and I use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with \"the general,\" whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter. I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. The film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested.

{"value":"really awful... lead actor did OK... the film, plot etc was completely crap and inaccurate it may as well have been a sequel to well... anything it had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way... and should be avoided like the plague by any Carlito's ways fans... no mention of Gail in fact he ends up with some other bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail... they attempted to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning... but to be honest when rating it I was looking for a zero mark... unfortunately I

{"value":"I've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production. While a comedy/oldies radio DJ in 1988, I got a call from the production company. They asked if I'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a TV (the television screen itself would never be shown). I said sure, wrote a parody of '50s sci-fi monster clichés, rounded up some sound effects and called in another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. As she happened to be on the air at the time, she put on a long song, joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take. Giggling, she then went back to her show while I mixed in the goofy sound effects.

{"value":"Man oh man! What a piece of crummy film-making! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialog that's so bad it's good and a nice Carole King song played over the end credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick.
