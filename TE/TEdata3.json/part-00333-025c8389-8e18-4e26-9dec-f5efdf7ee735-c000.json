{"value":"This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ludicrous, the acting is over-the-top, and it looks cheesy. The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as watching a train wreck. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competency to execute either task well. Bollywood has produced far better films.","finished_norm":["thi","typic","melodramat","bollywood","film","have","inexplic","becom","a","favorit","of","western","critic","the","script","be","ludicr","the","act","be","overthetop","and","it","look","cheesi","the","onli","reason","for","watch","thi","soap","opu","be","the","wonder","song","sing","by","mangeshkar","and","the","curtain","call","of","the","legendari","meena","kumari","watch","the","actress","who","be","ill","dure","the","film","and","would","drink","herself","to","death","at","ag","shortli","after","the","film","be","releas","have","the","same","fascin","a","watch","a","train","wreck","her","exhusband","amrohi","write","and","direct","but","lack","the","compet","to","execut","either","task","good","bollywood","have","produc","far","well","film"],"filtered":["thi","typic","melodramat","bollywood","film","inexplic","becom","favorit","western","critic","script","ludicr","act","overthetop","look","cheesi","onli","reason","watch","thi","soap","opu","wonder","song","sing","mangeshkar","curtain","call","legendari","meena","kumari","watch","actress","ill","dure","film","drink","death","ag","shortli","film","releas","fascin","watch","train","wreck","exhusband","amrohi","write","direct","lack","compet","execut","either","task","good","bollywood","produc","far","well","film"],"filtered2":["typic","melodramat","bollywood","inexplic","becom","favorit","western","critic","script","ludicr","act","overthetop","look","cheesi","onli","reason","watch","soap","opu","wonder","song","sing","mangeshkar","curtain","call","legendari","meena","kumari","watch","actress","ill","dure","drink","death","ag","shortli","releas","fascin","watch","train","wreck","exhusband","amrohi","write","direct","lack","compet","execut","either","task","good","bollywood","produc","far","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,11,16,20,21,65,77,95,101,102,115,142,175,183,207,239,245,261,327,328,355,442,543,579,613,660,662,667,713,769,822,1200,1257,1343,1361,1394,1488,1868,1897,1921,2044,2171,2803,2972,2983,5632,8362],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,11,16,20,21,65,77,95,101,102,115,142,175,183,207,239,245,261,327,328,355,442,543,579,613,660,662,667,713,769,822,1200,1257,1343,1361,1394,1488,1868,1897,1921,2044,2171,2803,2972,2983,5632,8362],"values":[0.6786144649922705,2.8828493162168796,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.9073850067444174,1.9463902258768238,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.201553588425805,2.2844323215331563,2.3791142619576227,2.4885128563647294,2.5531798379045583,2.6593400337329487,2.7502029743242886,2.7085302779237206,2.9674191958529437,3.1550424959247185,3.0316467233633775,3.257696649984802,3.477726550625732,3.5642670069567886,3.5364100524538222,3.8023521382691974,3.616452760127359,3.6652429242967908,3.865219416329466,4.0536665665501035,3.813163054373413,4.499089986959872,4.34596758485818,4.520909034354511,4.396611317676934,4.403125998698128,4.5432147918688095,4.789173020949191,4.848596441419991,4.869215728622727,10.964640403018272,5.039114765418124,5.3560264761848435,5.408212229355414,5.408212229355414,6.342521466732247,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4,2.3612500142009964E-4,2.3610099510202473E-4,2.360772525389538E-4,2.3629070374590536E-4,2.3613656901327567E-4,2.3624390791467605E-4,2.3631323951260914E-4,2.3620602879437978E-4,2.361497096615575E-4,2.3610130461469635E-4,2.

{"value":"Horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. Would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie. What a waste. Starting from the name of the movie.<br /><br />\"The Enemy\" Naming it \"Action Movie\" would've made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). The cop looking like a 60 Year old player, the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times.

{"value":"It's a hideous little production, apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches. It's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, sickening, even creepy kind of weird. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary.","finished_norm":["it","a","hideou","littl","product","apt","to","give","on","nightmar","a","good","a","headach","it","a","unsightli","blend","of","live","action","and","ugli","stopmot","anim","it","weird","but","it","not","the","kind","of","fun","weird","trip","anyon","optimist","mai","expect","it","the","cold","inhuman","unfriendli","sicken","even","creepi","kind","of","weird","there","be","absolut","no","reason","to","watch","thi","movi","after","all","disnei","do","a","fantast","job","with","the","same","sourc","materi","and","cosgrovehal","do","far","much","attract","thing","with","stopmotionbr","br","interestingli","thi","be","a","french","product","a","such","it","reenforc","the","stereotyp","that","the","french","have","no","concept","of","scari"],"filtered":["hideou","littl","product","apt","give","nightmar","good","headach","unsightli","blend","live","action","ugli","stopmot","anim","weird","kind","fun","weird","trip","anyon","optimist","mai","expect","cold","inhuman","unfriendli","sicken","even","creepi","kind","weird","absolut","reason","watch","thi","movi","disnei","fantast","job","sourc","materi","cosgrovehal","far","much","attract","thing","stopmotionbr","br","interestingli","thi","french","product","reenforc","stereotyp","french","concept","scari"],"filtered2":["hideou","littl","product","apt","give","nightmar","good","headach","unsightli","blend","live","action","ugli","stopmot","anim","weird","kind","fun","weird","trip","anyon","optimist","mai","expect","cold","inhuman","unfriendli","sicken","even","creepi","kind","weird","absolut","reason","watch","disnei","fantast","job","sourc","materi","cosgrovehal","far","attract","thing","stopmotionbr","interestingli","french","product","reenforc","stereotyp","french","concept","scari"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,14,29,30,46,95,101,116,122,129,130,158,190,222,259,277,289,396,537,604,625,648,725,755,841,895,899,1042,1054,1106,1392,1588,2300,3311,3317,3336,5079,5330,5401,5717],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,14,29,30,46,95,101,116,122,129,130,158,190,222,259,277,289,396,537,604,625,648,725,755,841,895,899,1042,1054,1106,1392,1588,2300,3311,3317,3336,5079,5330,5401,5717],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,4.497869534746497,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.3106972614914807,5.116663665627972,2.5771019354959765,2.7464553122240485,3.1163992333432793,2.8282659991423613,3.291526514503207,3.424750734647968,3.5727776966246974,10.85830016479649,3.6105180246075443,3.7034641371169887,3.79165684915245,4.30366520516749,3.9954846111673676,8.394243914521228,4.115443926246347,4.3095999406873045,4.213208095012239,4.403125998698128,4.654440426979034,5.064116067623542,5.541743621979936,5.541743621979936,5.604922523601468,6.214688095222362,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351994E-4,2.558082347393932E-4,2.558713957686225E-4,2.5581995743348255E-4,2.558441677579873E-4,2.5580682428995966E-4,2.5588638376375985E-4,2.5576876440667963E-4,2.5580828880184854E-4,2.560726389488426E-4,2.581045008063246E-4,2.558087113309914E-4,2.5605097834607816E-4,2.560776544404393E-4,2.5596132504838114E-4,2.558209650712688E-4,2.559089773770748E-4,2.560294090118496E-4,2.558341720046746E-4,2.5583323664955874E-4,2.5606339753655294E-4,2.5585886852800963E-4,2.558592557482337E-4,2.5602316192690805E-4,2.558342642905024E-4,2.5608071520047095E-4,2.5589828582462163E-4,2.5580766142006004E-4,2.559236336818262E-4,2.560017452638826E-4,2.558601235571696E-4,2.5599715666759453E-4,2.561228448805954E-4,2.563605665947129E-4,2.5589784362518945E-4,2.558208099117981E-4,2.5591304776099094E-4,2.55846790904011E-4,2.5576903739242464E-4,2.558340927769948E-4,2.560904822574156E-4,2.559500005077447E-4,2.559977400410073E-4,2.557817669888663E-4,2.558341578291236E-4,2.558207137134061E-4,2.5590730670555526E-4,2.559516813523956E-4,2.5589963502432064E-4,2.558590744800588E-4,2.5582134633837366E-4,2.5634548273227825E-4,2.5588571835822866E-4,2.558340991922594E-4,2.5588434799543217E-4,2.5580792314607264E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.5584783345399583E-4,2.5582170547880096E-4,2.5580777712438653E-4,2.560124294824375E-4,2.5590965967558355E-4,2.558076701900189E-4,2.557816627775906E-4,2.557559411059887E-4,2.559871849625102E-4,2.5582020202291367E-4,2.559364883717664E-4,2.560115992428353E-4,2.558954517621166E-4,2.5583443803604887E-4,2.5578199809030605E-4,2.558474318513175E-4,2.5578186032295395E-4,2.5579528334132156E-4,2.557820053295741E-4,2.5594804359407836E-4,2.558718652654192E-4,2.5580801162741447E-4,2.5583279142898745E-4]}}

{"value":"I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! When Jim tosses that little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless.

I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious.

{"value":"This film turned up on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought that I'd warn even those who enjoy watching B grade bad movies (which I do)that this is not even amusing. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film, obviously shot in the early seventies, consists of extreme wide shots of people walking, in real time and awfully slowly, from A to B.

A mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago. Then what ? His stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal ? This film a fascinatingly stupid... It's a must of silliness.

{"value":"Maybe this isn't fair, because I only made it about halfway through the movie. One of the few movies I have actually not been able to watch due to lameness.<br /><br />The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a coke deal, the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - I'm no expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag.<br /><br />They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's that over the top 'crunching' sound\" and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects.<br /><br />Worst movie ever.","finished_norm":["mayb","thi","be","not","fair","becaus","i","onli","make","it","about","halfwai","through","the","movi","on","of","the","few","movi","i","have","actual","not","be","abl","to","watch","due","to","lamenessbr","br","the","act","be","terribl","the","camera","work","be","terribl","the","plot","be","ridicul","and","the","whole","movi","be","just","unrealist","and","cheesi","for","exampl","dure","a","coke","deal","the","coke","be","just","keep","loos","in","a","briefcas","i","be","no","expert","but","i","think","peopl","gener","put","it","in","a","bagbr","br","thei","us","the","same","stupid","sound","effect","whenev","a","punch","be","throw","it","that","over","the","top","crunch","sound","and","thei","us","toi","gun","with","dub","in","sound","effectsbr","br","wrong","movi","ever"],"filtered":["mayb","thi","fair","becaus","onli","make","halfwai","movi","movi","actual","abl","watch","due","lamenessbr","br","act","terribl","camera","work","terribl","plot","ridicul","whole","movi","unrealist","cheesi","exampl","dure","coke","deal","coke","keep","loos","briefcas","expert","think","peopl","gener","put","bagbr","br","thei","us","stupid","sound","effect","whenev","punch","throw","top","crunch","sound","thei","us","toi","gun","dub","sound","effectsbr","br","wrong","movi","ever"],"filtered2":["mayb","fair","becaus","onli","make","halfwai","actual","abl","watch","due","lamenessbr","act","terribl","camera","work","terribl","plot","ridicul","whole","unrealist","cheesi","exampl","dure","coke","deal","coke","keep","loos","briefcas","expert","think","peopl","gener","put","bagbr","us","stupid","sound","effect","whenev","punch","throw","top","crunch","sound","us","toi","gun","dub","sound","effectsbr","wrong","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,11,12,21,22,23,25,32,44,48,52,56,106,111,134,136,159,163,166,178,225,231,239,274,307,310,364,454,468,501,543,568,877,940,949,1264,1396,1412,1498,1542,1940,4657,5883],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,11,12,21,22,23,25,32,44,48,52,56,106,111,134,136,159,163,166,178,225,231,239,274,307,310,364,454,468,501,543,568,877,940,949,1264,1396,1412,1498,1542,1940,4657,5883],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,3.7221218701403576,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.2443961816702407,2.346825985579986,2.300267965194495,2.4000574358028657,4.884774065938707,7.598499768136172,2.641219492619754,2.7049353070058615,2.6593400337329487,2.748952192422636,2.8767855639325206,2.854312708080462,2.9878441007049847,3.2556198060399626,3.304513710030018,3.5119855004467477,3.477726550625732,3.4471119148061256,3.865219416329466,3.952924996748572,4.086456389373095,4.327618446189983,4.409683399244287,4.605250182788262,4.506310234933358,4.597282013139085,4.8796870284900224,12.429376190444724,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815664E-4,2.4557311712357463E-4,2.4563375102320016E-4,2.4558437078212687E-4,2.4560761242976685E-4,2.455717631074919E-4,2.4564813933516776E-4,2.455352260343834E-4,2.4557316902294247E-4,2.458269422827265E-4,2.4777750751927836E-4,2.455735746463142E-4,2.4580614834016616E-4,2.4583175709999214E-4,2.457200821515687E-4,2.4558533810341873E-4,2.456698289576871E-4,2.4578544201440543E-4,2.4559801661553705E-4,2.455971186848209E-4,2.458180706276568E-4,2.4562172500875465E-4,2.456220967359492E-4,2.457794448809527E-4,2.4559810520892586E-4,2.458346953962612E-4,2.456595651838665E-4,2.455725667432638E-4,2.456838988504995E-4,2.4575888511788296E-4,2.4562292982306883E-4,2.457544801154606E-4,2.458751394299809E-4,2.4610334968444466E-4,2.4565914067723143E-4,2.455851891520181E-4,2.4567373648188076E-4,2.4561013062135813E-4,2.455354880977231E-4,2.45597940557828E-4,2.458440716644703E-4,2.4570921071599146E-4,2.4575504014757825E-4,2.455477083715587E-4,2.4559800300716264E-4,2.455850968026103E-4,2.4566822513123813E-4,2.457108243085357E-4,2.4566086040087173E-4,2.45621922720477E-4,2.455857041156837E-4,2.460888693409166E-4,2.4564750055311056E-4,2.4559794671641215E-4,2.4564618501976245E-4,2.4557281799738315E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798015E-4,2.455860488865794E-4,2.455726778181561E-4,2.457691418512411E-4,2.456704839568187E-4,2.4557257516232873E-4,2.455476083298698E-4,2.4552291580548984E-4,2.4574490738726797E-4,2.455846055853148E-4,2.456962392127302E-4,2.457683448302724E-4,2.4565684451475204E-4,2.4559827200275666E-4,2.4554793022642186E-4,2.4561074592378623E-4,2.455477979712655E-4,2.4556068392259187E-4,2.455479371760403E-4,2.457073321002015E-4,2.456342017350076E-4,2.455729029385069E-4,2.4559669127792525E-4]}}
{"value":"Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about such and interesting true story. It had such promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something out of a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what was suppose to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the \"King\" dying. I liked the Queens' punishment. And, the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I don't recommend this.","finished_norm":["warn","spoiler","i","have","to","agre","with","you","it","be","almost","there","thi","be","such","a","bad","movi","about","such","and","interest","true","stori","it","have","such","promis","but","the","act","be","ridicul","at","well","some","set","be","beauti","and","realist","other","be","someth","out","of","a","theme","park","i","find","myself","laugh","a","i","watch","what","be","suppos","to","be","seriou","scene","i","realli","want","to","like","thi","movi","but","i","can","not","the","well","part","be","the","fight","between","friend","that","end","with","the","king","dye","i","like","the","queen","punish","and","the","final","shoot","make","a","beauti","pictur","though","there","be","so","mani","well","movi","to","watch","i","do","not","recommend","thi"],"filtered":["warn","spoiler","agre","almost","thi","bad","movi","interest","true","stori","promis","act","ridicul","well","set","beauti","realist","someth","theme","park","find","laugh","watch","suppos","seriou","scene","realli","want","like","thi","movi","well","part","fight","friend","end","king","dye","like","queen","punish","final","shoot","make","beauti","pictur","though","mani","well","movi","watch","recommend","thi"],"filtered2":["warn","spoiler","agre","almost","bad","interest","true","stori","promis","act","ridicul","well","set","beauti","realist","someth","theme","park","find","laugh","watch","suppos","seriou","scene","realli","want","like","well","part","fight","friend","end","king","dye","like","queen","punish","final","shoot","make","beauti","pictur","though","mani","well","watch","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,9,13,17,19,20,21,24,37,38,50,53,60,61,86,109,117,131,133,149,156,161,233,274,298,304,311,325,490,493,527,534,541,622,683,935,959,1230,1469,2428],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,9,13,17,19,20,21,24,37,38,50,53,60,61,86,109,117,131,133,149,156,161,233,274,298,304,311,325,490,493,527,534,541,622,683,935,959,1230,1469,2428],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,3.4960351200691706,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.031112399272319,2.125691139326857,2.2797301185117202,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.3253197803590226,2.3451551414151686,2.4323182980210873,2.8377834061292515,2.748952192422636,2.7819920465008363,2.871119826396843,2.9203338091782562,5.947318931426056,3.3490645070153917,3.342254038012865,3.439602492783994,3.4933926673701317,3.8023521382691974,3.4933926673701317,3.6105180246075443,4.135246553542527,4.067587905068712,4.390138803171316,4.654440426979034,5.143104478942172]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351994E-4,2.5580823473939323E-4,2.558713957686225E-4,2.558199574334826E-4,2.558441677579874E-4,2.558068242899597E-4,2.558863837637599E-4,2.557687644066797E-4,2.5580828880184854E-4,2.5607263894884266E-4,2.581045008063246E-4,2.5580871133099145E-4,2.560509783460782E-4,2.5607765444043935E-4,2.559613250483812E-4,2.5582096507126886E-4,2.5590897737707484E-4,2.5602940901184963E-4,2.5583417200467464E-4,2.5583323664955874E-4,2.56063397536553E-4,2.558588685280097E-4,2.558592557482337E-4,2.560231619269081E-4,2.5583426429050244E-4,2.5608071520047095E-4,2.558982858246217E-4,2.558076614200601E-4,2.559236336818262E-4,2.560017452638827E-4,2.5586012355716966E-4,2.559971566675946E-4,2.561228448805954E-4,2.5636056659471295E-4,2.558978436251895E-4,2.5582080991179814E-4,2.5591304776099094E-4,2.5584679090401107E-4,2.557690373924247E-4,2.558340927769948E-4,2.5609048225741564E-4,2.5595000050774474E-4,2.559977400410073E-4,2.5578176698886636E-4,2.558341578291236E-4,2.558207137134061E-4,2.559073067055553E-4,2.5595168135239565E-4,2.5589963502432064E-4,2.558590744800588E-4,2.5582134633837366E-4,2.5634548273227825E-4,2.558857183582287E-4,2.5583409919225947E-4,2.558843479954322E-4,2.5580792314607264E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539959E-4,2.55821705478801E-4,2.558077771243866E-4,2.5601242948243753E-4,2.559096596755836E-4,2.5580767019001897E-4,2.557816627775906E-4,2.5575594110598875E-4,2.5598718496251026E-4,2.5582020202291367E-4,2.5593648837176643E-4,2.5601159924283536E-4,2.558954517621166E-4,2.5583443803604887E-4,2.557819980903061E-4,2.5584743185131753E-4,2.55781860322954E-4,2.557952833413216E-4,2.5578200532957416E-4,2.559480435940784E-4,2.5587186526541923E-4,2.558080116274145E-4,2.558327914289875E-4]}}
{"value":"After watching about half of this I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The acting is poor---much worse than the acting in 80s T&A movies.<br /><br />There are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal, but for those that have seen many movies, you will know how the film turns out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this.","finished_norm":["after","watch","about","half","of","thi","i","be","readi","to","give","up","and","turn","it","off","but","i","endur","to","the","end","thi","be","a","movi","that","try","to","be","a","romant","comedi","and","fail","the","act","be","poormuch","wrong","than","the","act","in","ta","moviesbr","br","there","be","sever","attempt","at","humour","that","fail","miser","and","the","movi","be","predict","perhap","if","you","be","a","teenag","thi","movi","will","hold","some","appeal","but","for","that","that","have","see","mani","movi","you","will","know","how","the","film","turn","out","after","the","minut","the","rest","of","your","time","will","be","spend","in","agoni","wait","for","the","end","credit","to","rollbr","br","do","not","wast","your","time","watch","thi"],"filtered":["watch","half","thi","readi","give","turn","endur","end","thi","movi","try","romant","comedi","fail","act","poormuch","wrong","act","ta","moviesbr","br","sever","attempt","humour","fail","miser","movi","predict","perhap","teenag","thi","movi","hold","appeal","see","mani","movi","know","film","turn","minut","rest","time","spend","agoni","wait","end","credit","rollbr","br","wast","time","watch","thi"],"filtered2":["watch","half","readi","give","turn","endur","end","try","romant","comedi","fail","act","poormuch","wrong","act","ta","moviesbr","sever","attempt","humour","fail","miser","predict","perhap","teenag","hold","appeal","see","mani","know","turn","minut","rest","time","spend","agoni","wait","end","credit","rollbr","wast","time","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,21,24,25,26,30,36,50,59,89,96,127,177,206,215,226,283,316,318,331,337,356,414,690,693,864,1235,1330,1334,1762,2543,2837,4501],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,21,24,25,26,30,36,50,59,89,96,127,177,206,215,226,283,316,318,331,337,356,414,690,693,864,1235,1330,1334,1762,2543,2837,4501],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,2.324031090670098,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.717994385570355,1.8693254449200722,1.9940046109572438,4.078141625743051,2.4359679371086367,2.458149992634611,2.597304642813496,5.211869371175422,2.5940874818617203,2.7678802023081546,2.878207028279898,2.902686292364678,2.932274249550174,2.973659465713028,3.028335462059722,3.1254654785810323,3.634471265630037,3.753391311073496,3.9782428047328615,4.4637506205145625,4.370968887063596,4.383707912841026,4.724033718778229,5.156897801074508,5.501738287366237,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.9262343200910735E-4,2.923641235923331E-4,2.924363105529078E-4,2.923775215002897E-4,2.924051915645976E-4,2.923625115847567E-4,2.924534403848196E-4,2.923190128114255E-4,2.9236418538050184E-4,2.9266631208539926E-4,2.949885340882546E-4,2.923646682905328E-4,2.9264155610696035E-4,2.9267204430823623E-4,2.925390910403644E-4,2.9237867313302966E-4,2.924792627042705E-4,2.9261690443964936E-4,2.9239376738327715E-4,2.923926983626533E-4,2.926557500430648E-4,2.9242199312592374E-4,2.924224356812682E-4,2.926097646244835E-4,2.923938728570716E-4,2.926755424615505E-4,2.9246704329168597E-4,2.9236346834366785E-4,2.9249601344608344E-4,2.92585287445623E-4,2.924234275031275E-4,2.9258004312292306E-4,2.9272369261988825E-4,2.929953855959867E-4,2.9246653790041276E-4,2.923784958007295E-4,2.9248391476024337E-4,2.924081895673361E-4,2.9231932480778546E-4,2.923936768336856E-4,2.9268670526499426E-4,2.9252614818337766E-4,2.925807098624309E-4,2.9233387350795204E-4,2.9239375118199053E-4,2.923783858552518E-4,2.924773532879645E-4,2.92528069226591E-4,2.9246858529672715E-4,2.924222285092389E-4,2.9237910888453344E-4,2.929781461970065E-4,2.924526798905175E-4,2.9239368416571394E-4,2.9245111369809835E-4,2.923637674712404E-4,0.9768924620546159,2.924093811013495E-4,2.9237951934738026E-4,2.923636005825461E-4,2.9259749847626966E-4,2.9248004250561564E-4,2.923634783668845E-4,2.923337544045215E-4,2.923043570163457E-4,2.925686464264067E-4,2.9237780104240355E-4,2.925107051160457E-4,2.9259654959253294E-4,2.924638042317654E-4,2.9239407143146254E-4,2.9233413763459344E-4,2.9240892210824785E-4,2.923339801798063E-4,2.923493213943102E-4,2.9233414590837815E-4,2.925239116199239E-4,2.924368471424341E-4,2.9236386859687457E-4,2.923921895185097E-4]}}
{"value":"This was the WORST Christmas movie I ever saw. I took my two small children to see this. It was the darkest, most dismal plot- family has no money, mom loses her job, father gets killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is left all alone. No wonder her Christmas spririt is gone. Christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned, and Santa does not bring back dead fathers! I thought this was the WORST message to send children. Better to tell them that there is NO Santa than show them a movie like

{"value":"I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. However, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are way too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but overall this is a very sub par movie, but I guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","movi","on","dvd","i","know","that","the","movi","would","not","live","up","to","what","it","promis","me","on","the","back","of","the","case","but","onc","i","see","that","leatherfac","gunnar","hansen","be","in","it","i","have","to","rend","it","it","start","off","pretti","good","with","the","premis","be","that","snuff","film","be","be","air","over","cabl","howev","the","main","charact","have","noth","about","her","to","make","you","feel","sorri","for","her","whatsoev","and","the","end","of","the","movi","realli","leav","you","hang","there","be","wai","too","mani","unansw","question","there","be","a","great","scene","at","the","end","that","total","take","me","by","surpris","but","overal","thi","be","a","veri","sub","par","movi","but","i","guess","it","be","worth","the","rental","fee"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","dvd","know","movi","live","promis","back","case","onc","see","leatherfac","gunnar","hansen","rend","start","pretti","good","premis","snuff","film","air","cabl","howev","main","charact","noth","make","feel","sorri","whatsoev","end","movi","realli","leav","hang","wai","mani","unansw","question","great","scene","end","total","take","surpris","overal","thi","veri","sub","par","movi","guess","worth","rental","fee"],"filtered2":["rent","dvd","know","live","promis","back","case","onc","see","leatherfac","gunnar","hansen","rend","start","pretti","good","premis","snuff","air","cabl","howev","main","charact","noth","make","feel","sorri","whatsoev","end","realli","leav","hang","wai","mani","unansw","question","great","scene","end","total","take","surpris","overal","veri","sub","par","guess","worth","rental","fee"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,10,13,15,19,24,26,31,33,43,49,50,51,63,71,74,78,113,116,179,184,219,236,243,247,288,326,378,412,437,484,533,661,679,683,848,991,1505,1533,2135,2529,2905,3695,4623],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,10,13,15,19,24,26,31,33,43,49,50,51,63,71,74,78,113,116,179,184,219,236,243,247,288,326,378,412,437,484,533,661,679,683,848,991,1505,1533,2135,2529,2905,3695,4623],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,2.6420723132238515,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,1.9486336368009016,2.0064197866819473,2.1521782565202803,2.2466628996789315,2.507968722980095,2.496249838866882,2.5792094178355414,2.617923930016232,2.627841366673578,2.7303758068497004,2.8015621426949333,2.942840385588056,3.130944944345658,3.107414446935464,3.1952392950510555,3.291526514503207,3.424750734647968,3.5727776966246974,3.6715125373103863,3.6105180246075443,3.827761853794566,4.004218291136122,4.535724120139652,4.558366596889411,4.956227105612356,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035197E-4,2.55808234739393E-4,2.5587139576862226E-4,2.5581995743348233E-4,2.558441677579871E-4,2.5580682428995945E-4,2.5588638376375963E-4,2.5576876440667947E-4,2.558082888018483E-4,2.5607263894884244E-4,2.581045008063244E-4,2.5580871133099124E-4,2.56050978346078E-4,2.5607765444043913E-4,2.55961325048381E-4,2.558209650712686E-4,2.559089773770746E-4,2.560294090118494E-4,2.558341720046744E-4,2.558332366495585E-4,2.560633975365527E-4,2.558588685280094E-4,2.558592557482335E-4,2.560231619269079E-4,2.558342642905022E-4,2.5608071520047073E-4,2.5589828582462147E-4,2.558076614200599E-4,2.55923633681826E-4,2.5600174526388246E-4,2.5586012355716944E-4,2.5599715666759437E-4,2.561228448805952E-4,2.5636056659471274E-4,2.558978436251893E-4,2.558208099117979E-4,2.559130477609907E-4,2.5584679090401085E-4,2.557690373924244E-4,2.5583409277699456E-4,2.560904822574154E-4,2.5595000050774447E-4,2.559977400410071E-4,2.5578176698886615E-4,2.558341578291234E-4,2.558207137134059E-4,2.5590730670555504E-4,2.5595168135239543E-4,2.558996350243204E-4,2.5585907448005856E-4,2.5582134633837344E-4,2.5634548273227803E-4,2.558857183582285E-4,2.5583409919225926E-4,2.55884347995432E-4,2.5580792314607243E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.5584783345399567E-4,2.5582170547880075E-4,2.558077771243863E-4,2.560124294824373E-4,2.559096596755834E-4,2.5580767019001876E-4,2.5578166277759036E-4,2.5575594110598853E-4,2.5598718496251E-4,2.5582020202291345E-4,2.559364883717662E-4,2.5601159924283515E-4,2.558954517621164E-4,2.5583443803604865E-4,2.5578199809030583E-4,2.5584743185131726E-4,2.5578186032295373E-4,2.557952833413214E-4,2.5578200532957394E-4,2.559480435940782E-4,2.5587186526541896E-4,2.558080116274143E-4,2.558327914289873E-4]}}
{"value":"Before writing this review, I went back and reread the reviews of others. This movie was a particular disappointment to me, since it features two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, boasts a score by the often wonderous Michel LeGrand (\"Wuthering Heights,\" \"Ice Station Zebra,\" \"The Thomas Crowne Affair\"). The dancing was stilted, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgettable, the story a joke. Even the costuming was not particularly flattering. Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit. I'm glad other people enjoyed \"The Young Girls of Rochefort,\" though I most certainly did not.","finished_norm":["befor","write","thi","review","i","go","back","and","reread","the","review","of","other","thi","movi","be","a","particular","disappoint","to","me","sinc","it","featur","two","of","my","favorit","dancer","gene","kelli","and","georg","chakiri","boast","a","score","by","the","often","wonder","michel","legrand","wuther","height","ic","station","zebra","the","thoma","crown","affair","the","danc","be","stilt","unmotiv","and","unorigin","the","song","forgett","the","stori","a","joke","even","the","costum","be","not","particularli","flatter","onli","the","photographi","correctli","captur","the","proper","mood","and","spirit","i","be","glad","other","peopl","enjoi","the","young","girl","of","rochefort","though","i","much","certainli","do","not"],"filtered":["befor","write","thi","review","go","back","reread","review","thi","movi","particular","disappoint","sinc","featur","two","favorit","dancer","gene","kelli","georg","chakiri","boast","score","often","wonder","michel","legrand","wuther","height","ic","station","zebra","thoma","crown","affair","danc","stilt","unmotiv","unorigin","song","forgett","stori","joke","even","costum","particularli","flatter","onli","photographi","correctli","captur","proper","mood","spirit","glad","peopl","enjoi","young","girl","rochefort","though","much","certainli"],"filtered2":["befor","write","review","go","back","reread","review","particular","disappoint","sinc","featur","two","favorit","dancer","gene","kelli","georg","chakiri","boast","score","often","wonder","michel","legrand","wuther","height","ic","station","zebra","thoma","crown","affair","danc","stilt","unmotiv","unorigin","song","forgett","stori","joke","even","costum","particularli","flatter","onli","photographi","correctli","captur","proper","mood","spirit","glad","peopl","enjoi","young","girl","rochefort","though","certainli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,11,17,23,47,63,65,79,84,86,135,162,175,176,187,200,214,305,328,389,400,492,497,518,680,776,822,832,894,925,1129,1201,1227,1258,1372,1391,1618,1946,1979,2063,2155,2192,2291,2382,2700,3128,3303,3502,4069,6820,7098],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,11,17,23,47,63,65,79,84,86,135,162,175,176,187,200,214,305,328,389,400,492,497,518,680,776,822,832,894,925,1129,1201,1227,1258,1372,1391,1618,1946,1979,2063,2155,2192,2291,2382,2700,3128,3303,3502,4069,6820,7098],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.7064694353107215,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,1.9469506069506084,2.2212694515902225,2.031112399272319,2.366244071437088,2.3586007221245198,2.3791142619576227,5.008094298653827,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.7303758068497004,2.8612813773965557,3.1550424959247185,3.0914425013694116,3.130944944345658,3.6016814428070463,3.342254038012865,3.4101163271295305,3.8095464139032247,3.770603439954617,3.813163054373413,3.7987743169213135,4.091229668125752,3.969732115064953,4.197121957260614,4.315570107673808,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.403125998698128,4.429617614145104,4.605250182788262,5.014723312293965,4.979216623837056,5.3064295350454715,5.426230734858092,5.129498826886393,5.259176650194926,5.102830579804232,5.243909178064138,5.501738287366237,5.541743621979936,5.626901430320244,5.999576715605417,6.600350576034347,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255748E-4,2.2737792632708306E-4,2.2743406769354637E-4,2.2738834617097792E-4,2.274098657807247E-4,2.273766726337932E-4,2.2744738993572364E-4,2.2734284269338773E-4,2.2737797438108335E-4,2.2761294487884317E-4,2.2941898734736658E-4,2.2737834995069869E-4,2.2759369161694332E-4,2.2761740295299364E-4,2.2751400231007054E-4,2.2738924182076246E-4,2.2746747251417945E-4,2.2757451948007235E-4,2.2740098094688562E-4,2.274001495463373E-4,2.2760473054921106E-4,2.2742293271974052E-4,2.274232769046401E-4,2.2756896669080798E-4,2.2740106297614544E-4,2.2762012354277325E-4,2.2745796921172127E-4,2.2737741672597023E-4,2.274804999297565E-4,2.275499302573932E-4,2.2742404826603312E-4,2.275458516337719E-4,2.2765757096628283E-4,2.278688724924203E-4,2.2745757615795576E-4,2.273891039055826E-4,2.2747109051910857E-4,2.2741219739254293E-4,2.2734308533973053E-4,2.2740091052450236E-4,2.27628805097363E-4,2.2750393636919436E-4,2.275463701715625E-4,2.273544001797115E-4,2.2740096834679324E-4,2.2738901839859763E-4,2.274659875196636E-4,2.2750543040620845E-4,2.274591684625197E-4,2.2742311578245506E-4,2.273895807141674E-4,2.2785546503755516E-4,2.274467984827941E-4,2.2740091622678002E-4,2.274455804209467E-4,2.2737764936397764E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441417E-4,2.2738989994003478E-4,2.2737751957101684E-4,2.2755942704103625E-4,2.2746807898261552E-4,2.273774245212434E-4,2.2735430755038778

{"value":"I am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad. First of all, it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie toon or an adult one, that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving \"funny\" moments in the beginning.<br /><br />But that's hardly important, the film is simply boring, unmoving and not true to the original story.

{"value":"I blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that I paid as much as I did but I would say that it's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting.

I guess it could be called so-bad-it's-good.<br /><br />As I said, the acting is awful, I feel like I could have done a better job showing, at least, any emotion. The story is nothing new and has been done better. I guess I just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film. I would say rent this or download it but definitely don't buy it.

{"value":"This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film. His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it's the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent. He is a good character actor but that's about it. Klaus is so much better.

{"value":"I just came back from \"El Otro\" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say I was very disappointed. The film is very slow moving (don't get me wrong, I enjoy slow moving films!), slow to the point of driving you crazy. All you hear is Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film. This is a poorly made film, but more importantly, it is a film without a lick of inspiration, I felt nothing for the story or its characters.<br /><br />\"El Otro\" was made only for the sake of making a film... making it forgetful. I would advise you to pass on this one, if you want to see good Argentinian films, look for films by Sorin.","finished_norm":["i","just","come","back","from","el","otro","plai","here","in","bueno","air","and","i","have","to","sai","i","be","veri","disappoint","the","film","be","veri","slow","move","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","enjoi","slow","move","film","slow","to","the","point","of","drive","you","crazi","all","you","hear","be","julio","chavez","breath","heavili","throughout","the","whole","film","thi","be","a","poorli","make","film","but","much","importantli","it","be","a","film","without","a","lick","of","inspir","i","feel","noth","for","the","stori","or","it","charactersbr","br","el","otro","be","make","onli","for","the","sake","of","make","a","film","make","it","forget","i","would","advis","you","to","pass","on","thi","on","if","you","want","to","see","good","argentinian","film","look","for","film","by","sorin"],"filtered":["come","back","el","otro","plai","bueno","air","sai","veri","disappoint","film","veri","slow","move","get","wrong","enjoi","slow","move","film","slow","point","drive","crazi","hear","julio","chavez","breath","heavili","throughout","whole","film","thi","poorli","make","film","much","importantli","film","without","lick","inspir","feel","noth","stori","charactersbr","br","el","otro","make","onli","sake","make","film","make","forget","advis","pass","thi","want","see","good","argentinian","film","look","film","sorin"],"filtered2":["come","back","el","otro","plai","bueno","air","veri","disappoint","veri","slow","move","get","wrong","enjoi","slow","move","slow","point","drive","crazi","hear","julio","chavez","breath","heavili","throughout","whole","poorli","make","importantli","without","lick","inspir","feel","noth","stori","charactersbr","el","otro","make","onli","sake","make","make","forget","advis","pass","want","see","good","argentinian","look","sorin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,11,15,16,17,25,34,37,40,43,49,63,66,111,125,187,200,216,275,372,390,398,438,461,487,679,712,909,1270,1805,2043,2098,2892,3101,4585,4810],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,11,15,16,17,25,34,37,40,43,49,63,66,111,125,187,200,216,275,372,390,398,438,461,487,679,712,909,1270,1805,2043,2098,2892,3101,4585,4810],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.8729627573220065,1.929723173391612,2.1183455303375887,2.2242236634876535,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.6070186965339692,5.566569743006283,3.0316467233633775,9.398334376281957,3.143848349181566,3.1797351085150902,3.358217889001879,3.3220965805878846,3.6715125373103863,3.7165362186843414,3.9612932464190886,4.3521595551061,4.724033718778229,4.900964426937307,4.944927550358424,5.339219357868463,5.426230734858092,12.350934764138163,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035198E-4,2.55808234739393E-4,2.558713957686223E-4,2.558199574334824E-4,2.5584416775798716E-4,2.558068242899595E-4,2.558863837637597E-4,2.5576876440667947E-4,2.558082888018484E-4,2.5607263894884244E-4,2.5810450080632446E-4,2.5580871133099124E-4,2.56050978346078E-4,2.560776544404392E-4,2.55961325048381E-4,2.5582096507126864E-4,2.559089773770747E-4,2.5602940901184947E-4,2.558341720046744E-4,2.558332366495586E-4,2.560633975365528E-4,2.5585886852800947E-4,2.5585925574823356E-4,2.5602316192690794E-4,2.558342642905022E-4,2.560807152004708E-4,2.558982858246215E-4,2.558076614200599E-4,2.5592363368182606E-4,2.5600174526388246E-4,2.558601235571695E-4,2.559971566675944E-4,2.5612284488059524E-4,2.563605665947128E-4,2.558978436251893E-4,2.558208099117979E-4,2.559130477609908E-4,2.5584679090401085E-4,2.557690373924245E-4,2.558340927769946E-4,2.560904822574154E-4,2.559500005077445E-4,2.5599774004100715E-4,2.557817669888662E-4,2.5583415782912345E-4,2.5582071371340595E-4,2.559073067055551E-4,2.5595168135239543E-4,2.558996350243205E-4,2.558590744800586E-4,2.558213463383735E-4,2.563454827322781E-4,2.5588571835822855E-4,2.5583409919225926E-4,2.5588434799543206E-4,2.558079231460725E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539957E-4,2.558217054788008E-4,2.5580777712438637E-4,2.560124294824373E-4,2.5590965967558344E-4,2.5580767019001876E-4,2.557816627775904E-4,2.5575594110598853E-4,2.5598718496251004E-4,2.558202020229135E-4,2.5593648837176627E-4,2.5601159924283515E-4,2.5589545176211645E-4,2.558344380360487E-4,2.557819980903059E-4,2.558474318513173E-4,2.557818603229538E-4,2.557952833413214E-4,2.5578200532957394E-4,2.559480435940782E-4,2.55871865265419E-4,2.558080116274143E-4,2.5583279142898734E-4]}}
{"value":"This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people.

I was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back. But to travel all that way just to start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise, they abandon technology? No way. Sure they were eating paper and rationing food, but that is over. They can live like humans again. They only have one good doctor. What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth... yea right.

not.","finished_norm":["the","sad","part","of","thi","be","the","fact","that","thi","be","minut","i","will","never","get","back","i","know","thi","be","terribl","from","the","getgo","with","the","gui","dress","a","a","lunat","indian","chief","on","top","of","the","roof","see","if","thei","can","get","awai","with","that","in","my","yearold","boi","be","realli","into","basebal","right","now","so","we","decid","to","rend","it","on","a","raini","dai","even","though","he","seem","to","enjoi","part","of","it","i","have","to","cring","when","i","hear","all","the","needless","foul","languag","bad","bad","movi","thi","be","a","aw","ripoff","of","bad","new","bear","complet","shameless","and","complet","predict","i","do","not","mind","a","predict","movi","if","it","do","good","but","thi","on","absolut","be","not"],"filtered":["sad","part","thi","fact","thi","minut","never","get","back","know","thi","terribl","getgo","gui","dress","lunat","indian","chief","top","roof","see","thei","get","awai","yearold","boi","realli","basebal","right","decid","rend","raini","dai","even","though","seem","enjoi","part","cring","hear","needless","foul","languag","bad","bad","movi","thi","aw","ripoff","bad","new","bear","complet","shameless","complet","predict","mind","predict","movi","good","thi","absolut"],"filtered2":["sad","part","fact","minut","never","get","back","know","terribl","getgo","gui","dress","lunat","indian","chief","top","roof","see","get","awai","yearold","boi","realli","basebal","right","decid","rend","raini","dai","even","though","seem","enjoi","part","cring","hear","needless","foul","languag","bad","bad","aw","ripoff","bad","new","bear","complet","shameless","complet","predict","mind","predict","good","absolut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,9,13,26,35,42,55,59,61,63,86,87,97,103,121,132,138,155,166,200,216,222,238,249,282,337,364,455,525,533,873,1025,1094,1414,1645,1828,2092,2203,2840,3351,4051,4086,4335,4793,7922],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,9,13,26,35,42,55,59,61,63,86,87,97,103,121,132,138,155,166,200,216,222,238,249,282,337,364,455,525,533,873,1025,1094,1414,1645,1828,2092,2203,2840,3351,4051,4086,4335,4793,7922],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,3.205071257016622,1.1317941569733974,1.3324924169710188,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,1.9536997889255368,1.8693254449200722,3.7637034094785053,1.8729627573220065,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.0545557924622586,4.197164082437498,2.2190595059394194,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.3074766467914385,2.4423870329693536,2.5308211829319704,2.6070186965339692,2.5771019354959765,2.597304642813496,2.6754694156628323,2.918851229218033,5.947318931426056,2.9878441007049847,3.2787058260741455,3.4149707055943286,3.424750734647968,3.892300374932137,4.436351646326448,4.218628162481577,4.484804029712395,4.77960356993304,4.770124825978496,5.129498826886393,5.0768550934009715,5.5623629091826725,5.695894301807195,5.878215858601149,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164666E-4,2.2324275812784218E-4,2.2329787848933367E-4,2.2325298847310007E-4,2.232741167202932E-4,2.2324152723462225E-4,2.2331095844892404E-4,2.2320831253640853E-4,2.2324280530791694E-4,2.2347350255652812E-4,2.2524669975505126E-4,2.232431740473023E-4,2.2345459944065005E-4,2.2347787955470628E-4,2.233763593891774E-4,2.2325386783430916E-4,2.2333067579914008E-4,2.234357759744349E-4,2.2326539346890386E-4,2.232645771884737E-4,2.2346543761534026E-4,2.2328694601974765E-4,2.2328728394518978E-4,2.234303241699845E-4,2.2326547400635315E-4,2.2348055066696395E-4,2.2332134532680116E-4,2.232422577944993E-4,2.2334346629394178E-4,2.234116339392788E-4,2.232880412783561E-4,2.2340762949082027E-4,2.2351731705956898E-4,2.2372477578809873E-4,2.2332095942123798E-4,2.232537324272992E-4,2.2333422800586636E-4,2.23276405928668E-4,2.2320855076990678E-4,2.2326532432724475E-4,2.2348907433600588E-4,2.2336647651074388E-4,2.234081385983156E-4,2.2321965983456373E-4,2.2326538109796083E-4,2.232536484753718E-4,2.233292178112128E-4,2.2336794337671966E-4,2.2332252276763831E-4,2.2328712575322472E-4,2.2325420056448948E-4,2.2371161216552587E-4,2.2331037775234796E-4,2.2326532992581892E-4,2.2330918184256562E-4,2.2324248620167697E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760425E-4,2.2325451398481244E-4,2.2324235876917278E-4,2.2342095801135593E-4,2.2333127123814588E-4,2.2324226544800512E-4,2.2321956888982672E-4,2.2319712169645192E-4,2.233989272262175E-4,2.23253201925256E-4,2.2335468452716267E-4,2.2342023346478732E-4,2.2331887205251044E-4,2.2326562563335236E-4,2.2321986151580694E-4,2.2327696528065544E-4,2.232197412868249E-4,2.2323145549784645E-4,2.232198678334854E-4,2.23364768720

{"value":"Lipstick is another glossy movie failure.I am trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie, and I am having trouble coming up with something.I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part.The writing and the script was not the worst that I have ever encountered,but it could have been a lot better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view.The sets were very glossy and nice to look at.The cast was okay. I felt like Anne Bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie.It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one.","finished_norm":["lipstick","be","anoth","glossi","movi","failurei","be","try","to","think","of","on","good","thing","that","i","can","sai","about","the","movi","and","i","be","have","troubl","come","up","with","somethingi","guess","the","red","dress","that","margaux","hemingwai","be","wear","in","the","end","of","the","movi","be","the","well","partth","write","and","the","script","be","not","the","wrong","that","i","have","ever","encounteredbut","it","can","have","be","a","lot","well","lipstick","be","veri","pleas","to","the","ey","to","viewth","set","be","veri","glossi","and","nice","to","look","atth","cast","be","okai","i","feel","like","ann","bancroft","charact","be","the","onli","feasibl","charact","in","the","entir","movieit","be","sad","to","see","chri","sarandon","wast","hi","time","on","thi","on"],"filtered":["lipstick","anoth","glossi","movi","failurei","try","think","good","thing","sai","movi","troubl","come","somethingi","guess","red","dress","margaux","hemingwai","wear","end","movi","well","partth","write","script","wrong","ever","encounteredbut","lot","well","lipstick","veri","pleas","ey","viewth","set","veri","glossi","nice","look","atth","cast","okai","feel","like","ann","bancroft","charact","onli","feasibl","charact","entir","movieit","sad","see","chri","sarandon","wast","hi","time","thi"],"filtered2":["lipstick","anoth","glossi","failurei","try","think","good","thing","troubl","come","somethingi","guess","red","dress","margaux","hemingwai","wear","end","well","partth","write","script","wrong","ever","encounteredbut","lot","well","lipstick","veri","pleas","ey","viewth","set","veri","glossi","nice","look","atth","cast","okai","feel","like","ann","bancroft","charact","onli","feasibl","charact","entir","movieit","sad","see","chri","sarandon","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,10,11,12,15,16,20,24,25,29,34,36,43,44,65,72,73,77,89,92,109,191,198,243,262,281,346,455,514,752,779,873,1140,1287,5478,6831,6846,7066,7279],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,10,11,12,15,16,20,24,25,29,34,36,43,44,65,72,73,77,89,92,109,191,198,243,262,281,346,455,514,752,779,873,1140,1287,5478,6831,6846,7066,7279],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.9073850067444174,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.125691139326857,2.5460113484259455,2.5439726117360975,2.627841366673578,2.726701583487816,2.832333801361687,3.023389038124396,3.2787058260741455,3.405285399859865,3.719831114581194,3.8463152616903136,3.892300374932137,4.558366596889411,4.733083554298147,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925,6.600350576034347,13.589013180950609,13.589013180950609]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351983E-4,2.558082347393931E-4,2.558713957686224E-4,2.5581995743348244E-4,2.558441677579872E-4,2.5580682428995955E-4,2.5588638376375974E-4,2.557687644066796E-4,2.5580828880184843E-4,2.5607263894884255E-4,2.5810450088981107E-4,2.5580871133099134E-4,2.560509783460781E-4,2.5607765444043924E-4,2.559613250483811E-4,2.558209650712687E-4,2.5590897737707473E-4,2.560294090118495E-4,2.5583417200467453E-4,2.5583323664955863E-4,2.5606339753655283E-4,2.558588685280096E-4,2.558592557482336E-4,2.56023161926908E-4,2.5583426429050233E-4,2.5608071520047084E-4,2.558982858246216E-4,2.5580766142006E-4,2.559236336818261E-4,2.5600174526388257E-4,2.5586012355716955E-4,2.559971566675945E-4,2.561228448805953E-4,2.5636056659471284E-4,2.558978436251894E-4,2.5582080991179803E-4,2.5591304776099083E-4,2.5584679090401096E-4,2.5576903739242454E-4,2.5583409277699467E-4,2.5609048225741553E-4,2.5595000050774463E-4,2.559977400410072E-4,2.5578176698886625E-4,2.558341578291235E-4,2.55820713713406E-4,2.559073067055552E-4,2.5595168135239554E-4,2.5589963502432053E-4,2.5585907448005867E-4,2.5582134633837355E-4,2.5634548273227814E-4,2.558857183582286E-4,2.5583409919225936E-4,2.558843479954321E-4,2.5580792314607254E-4,0.9797817241788224,2.558478334539958E-4,2.558217054788009E-4,2.558077771243864E-4,2.560124294824374E-4,2.559096596755835E-4,2.5580767019001886E-4,2.5578166277759047E-4,2.5575594110598864E-4,2.559871849625101E-4,2.5582020202291356E-4,2.559364883717663E-4,2.5601159924283526E-4,2.558954517621165E-4,2.5583443803604876E-4,2.5578199809030594E-4,2.5584743185131737E-4,2.557818603229539E-4,2.557952833413215E-4,2.5578200532957405E-4,2.559480435940783E-4,2.5587186526541906E-4,2.558080116274144E-4,2.558327914289874E-4]}}
{"value":"The movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the Novel. If you want to see the movie then don't read the novel first as it will shock you. However, cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores Africa then go for it. Acting performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.","finished_norm":["the","movi","be","veri","lengthi","and","unfortun","pretti","differ","from","the","novel","if","you","want","to","see","the","movi","then","do","not","read","the","novel","a","it","will","shock","you","howev","cinematographi","be","okai","and","if","you","be","a","person","who","love","adventur","genr","which","explor","africa","then","go","for","it","act","perform","be","adequ","howev","mani","import","event","that","be","present","in","the","novel","be","omit","in","the","novel","sir","henri","curti","be","in","search","of","hi","miss","brother","rather","than","a","ladi","in","search","of","her","father","gagool","be","cun","and","be","kill","in","the","cave","wherea","here","she","be","show","to","be","a","good","person","who","prefer","to","stai","with","the","new","king"],"filtered":["movi","veri","lengthi","unfortun","pretti","differ","novel","want","see","movi","read","novel","shock","howev","cinematographi","okai","person","love","adventur","genr","explor","africa","go","act","perform","adequ","howev","mani","import","event","present","novel","omit","novel","sir","henri","curti","search","hi","miss","brother","rather","ladi","search","father","gagool","cun","kill","cave","wherea","show","good","person","prefer","stai","new","king"],"filtered2":["veri","lengthi","unfortun","pretti","differ","novel","want","see","read","novel","shock","howev","cinematographi","okai","person","love","adventur","genr","explor","africa","go","act","perform","adequ","howev","mani","import","event","present","novel","omit","novel","sir","henri","curti","search","miss","brother","rather","ladi","search","father","gagool","cun","kill","cave","wherea","show","good","person","prefer","stai","new","king"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,15,21,28,37,50,54,76,78,87,105,113,145,153,160,191,204,227,255,343,366,381,411,467,470,472,474,508,541,600,629,1076,1089,1268,1291,1612,2312,2410,2411,2457,2916,3937,4408,6217,8315],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,15,21,28,37,50,54,76,78,87,105,113,145,153,160,191,204,227,255,343,366,381,411,467,470,472,474,508,541,600,629,1076,1089,1268,1291,1612,2312,2410,2411,2457,2916,3937,4408,6217,8315],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.4876543214774305,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,2.1337665533324026,2.0064197866819473,2.115024371522662,2.1765612129984904,4.3043565130405606,2.34599021453259,4.681980408231769,2.3722295531801256,2.5460113484259455,2.624524614047584,2.6005321873043625,2.6754694156628323,3.112795625839981,3.008694896185175,3.24941502915308,3.229006157521873,3.342254038012865,3.3814747511661465,3.4222967456864013,14.586666154895422,3.4149707055943286,3.8023521382691974,3.558633189238533,3.488143311483988,4.202455303235976,8.415634492754723,4.30366520516749,4.449957298382227,5.02684467282631,5.290429193699031,5.089758498236879,5.339219357868463,5.129498826886393,5.482320201509136,5.770002273960917,5.999576715605417,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125571E-4,2.273779263270827E-4,2.2743406769354602E-4,2.2738834617097757E-4,2.2740986578072433E-4,2.2737667263379285E-4,2.2744738993572328E-4,2.2734284269338738E-4,2.27377974381083E-4,2.276129448788428E-4,2.2941898734736622E-4,2.2737834995069833E-4,2.2759369161694297E-4,2.276174029529933E-4,2.275140023100702E-4,2.273892418207621E-4,2.2746747251417907E-4,2.2757451948007197E-4,2.2740098094688527E-4,2.2740014954633695E-4,2.2760473054921068E-4,2.2742293271974017E-4,2.2742327690463971E-4,2.2756896669080763E-4,2.274010629761451E-4,2.276201235427729E-4,2.2745796921172092E-4,2.2737741672596988E-4,2.2748049992975616E-4,2.2754993025739283E-4,2.2742404826603274E-4,2.2754585163377154E-4,2.2765757096628245E-4,2.2786887249241994E-4,2.2745757615795538E-4,2.2738910390558226E-4,2.2747109051910822E-4,2.2741219739254258E-4,2.2734308533973015E-4,2.27400910524502E-4,2.2762880509736262E-4,2.27503936369194E-4,2.2754637017156215E-4,2.2735440017971115E-4,2.2740096834679289E-4,2.2738901839859728E-4,2.2746598751966326E-4,2.275054304062081E-4,2.2745916846251936E-4,2.274231157824547E-4,2.2738958071416703E-4,2.2785546503755478E-4,2.2744679848279374E-4,2.2740091622677964E-4,2.2744558042094633E-4,2.2737764936397726E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441381E-4,2.2738989994003443E-4,2.2737751957101646E-4,2.275594270410359E-4,2.2746807898261516E-4,2.2737742452124304E-4,2.2735430755038743E-4,2.2733144456336726E-4,2.275369881754613E-4,2.273885635769485E-4,2.274919259604512E-4,2.2755868907355298E-4,2.2745545012449865E-4,2.2740121741176013E-4,2.273546055967345E-4,2.274127671055136E-4,2.273544831407281E-4,2.2736641433631524E-4,2.2735461203143652E-4,2.275021969452388E-4,2.2743448501

{"value":"Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame jokes abound, and every punch line is well telegraphed. The dumb one liners come at a fast pace, and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school.

{"value":"I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this was too much. The acting wasn't great, but that wasn't the real problem. The issue was the sinking feeling I got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.","finished_norm":["i","like","movi","about","moral","corrupt","charact","but","thi","be","too","much","the","act","be","not","great","but","that","be","not","the","real","problem","the","issu","be","the","sink","feel","i","get","in","the","pit","of","my","stomach","about","minut","into","the","film","thi","charact","be","hollow","thei","have","almost","no","depth","and","what","littl","thei","do","have","be","devot","to","the","cruelti","thei","displai","to","each","other","in","the","guis","of","friendship","explor","the","dark","side","of","a","set","of","charact","can","be","fascin","but","you","have","to","give","that","charact","actual","person","or","thei","be","just","cardboard","cutout","thi","charact","be","cardboard","and","the","pictur","thei","give","be","just","ugli"],"filtered":["like","movi","moral","corrupt","charact","thi","much","act","great","real","problem","issu","sink","feel","get","pit","stomach","minut","film","thi","charact","hollow","thei","almost","depth","littl","thei","devot","cruelti","thei","displai","guis","friendship","explor","dark","side","set","charact","fascin","give","charact","actual","person","thei","cardboard","cutout","thi","charact","cardboard","pictur","thei","give","ugli"],"filtered2":["like","moral","corrupt","charact","act","great","real","problem","issu","sink","feel","get","pit","stomach","minut","charact","hollow","almost","depth","littl","devot","cruelti","displai","guis","friendship","explor","dark","side","set","charact","fascin","give","charact","actual","person","cardboard","cutout","charact","cardboard","pictur","give","ugli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,10,14,21,30,43,51,52,59,80,109,131,153,167,311,368,425,806,878,895,914,1063,1257,1291,1359,1783,1816,1825,2316,2836,3033,3179,4487,4983,7453],"values":[1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,10,14,21,30,43,51,52,59,80,109,131,153,167,311,368,425,806,878,895,914,1063,1257,1291,1359,1783,1816,1825,2316,2836,3033,3179,4487,4983,7453],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,5.619435120514183,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,2.6728839783437044,1.6608112036218214,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.9951803900462557,2.125691139326857,2.2512118082053005,2.3409902041158843,2.4609576687888097,2.9203338091782562,3.1346146732346205,3.226987993365636,3.880604335168946,4.067587905068712,3.9954846111673676,3.9612932464190886,4.100845126825194,4.34596758485818,4.449957298382227,4.456830177669989,4.869215728622727,9.738431457245454,4.798834931860927,5.185068678041204,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.583416318380505,6.032366538428407,6.101359409915359,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.8581607958720585E-4,2.855628035095606E-4,2.8563331117166784E-4,2.855758897395338E-4,2.856029161100746E-4,2.8556122900241126E-4,2.8565004250916674E-4,2.855187421490003E-4,2.8556286386033987E-4,2.8585796213643995E-4,2.8812616186409064E-4,2.855633355363464E-4,2.8583378206085546E-4,2.8586356100952857E-4,2.857337006578454E-4,2.855770145816307E-4,2.8567526411927717E-4,2.8580970386979013E-4,2.8559175769157384E-4,2.8559071353977225E-4,2.8584764580082817E-4,2.856193268136065E-4,2.856197590737051E-4,2.8580273014945043E-4,2.8559186071171205E-4,2.8586697778466244E-4,2.856633289691226E-4,2.855621635040649E-4,2.856916251855195E-4,2.8577882238767883E-4,2.85620727822631E-4,2.85773700064617E-4,2.859140078170598E-4,2.8617938034976054E-4,2.85662835334859E-4,2.855768413746442E-4,2.85679807953621E-4,2.8560584436972705E-4,2.855190468873319E-4,2.8559166924845393E-4,2.8587788090576795E-4,2.8572105889290814E-4,2.857743512936418E-4,2.8553325713842544E-4,2.8559174186718067E-4,2.855767339868483E-4,2.856733991220719E-4,2.857229352465418E-4,2.856648351022184E-4,2.8561955672115657E-4,2.855774401961675E-4,2.86162541994072E-4,2.8564929970638267E-4,2.85591676409916E-4,2.8564776994858426E-4,2.85562455672978E-4,0.9774300169363856,2.856070081848668E-4,2.855778411103421E-4,2.855622926666459E-4,2.8579074935088604E-4,2.8567602577996096E-4,2.8556217329410953E-4,2.855331408057198E-4,2.855044272943621E-4,2.857625684915363E-4,2.8557616277860825E-4,2.8570597508047614E-4,2.8578982254120523E-4,2.8566016526004537E-4,2.8559205466663064E-4,2.8553351512064046E-4,2.856065598694056E-4,2.855333613287528E-4,2.855483456577777E-4,2.855335232019506E-4,2.85718874359039E-4,2.8563383527841385E-4,2.85562554446108E-4,2.8559021653296306E-4]}}

Based on a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you got paid well) to save it. The story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal Ms Spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way.

{"value":"Having read another review, I thought this movie would actually be good. I do enjoy the \"B\" movies, but this couldn't even be classed as such. The photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. But the editing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. The music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. If the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn flicks. If you want to see a \"B\" vampire movie, check out 'Blood Ties'. You'll be much more

{"value":"Hood of the Living Dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing). I find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage is better than this film (although the similarities between them warrant the comparison). \"Hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies!\". Hopefully nobody ELSE wasn't. My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the

{"value":"The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful. This image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad. The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck. Every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary. And the distributors; did they even see it!? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. To label this a comedy is an insult to mankind. I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.","finished_norm":["the","fact","that","thi","movi","make","it","all","the","wai","to","the","rentalrack","in","norwai","be","bizarr","thi","movi","be","just","aw","thi","imag","qualiti","be","just","on","teeni","bite","well","than","you","get","of","a","mobil","phone","and","the","plot","be","soooo","bad","the","main","charact","be","just","plain","annoi","and","the","rest","just","suck","everi","person","affili","with","thi","movi","should","be","asham","the","fact","that","the","peopl","that","make","thi","movi","put","their","name","on","thi","be","extraordinari","and","the","distributor","do","thei","even","see","it","thi","be","probabl","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","to","label","thi","a","comedi","be","a","insult","to","mankind","i","urg","you","not","to","support","thi","movi","by","bui","or","rent","it"],"filtered":["fact","thi","movi","make","wai","rentalrack","norwai","bizarr","thi","movi","aw","thi","imag","qualiti","teeni","bite","well","get","mobil","phone","plot","soooo","bad","main","charact","plain","annoi","rest","suck","everi","person","affili","thi","movi","asham","fact","peopl","make","thi","movi","put","name","thi","extraordinari","distributor","thei","even","see","thi","probabl","wrong","movi","ever","see","label","thi","comedi","insult","mankind","urg","support","thi","movi","bui","rent"],"filtered2":["fact","make","wai","rentalrack","norwai","bizarr","aw","imag","qualiti","teeni","bite","well","get","mobil","phone","plot","soooo","bad","main","charact","plain","annoi","rest","suck","everi","person","affili","asham","fact","peopl","make","put","name","extraordinari","distributor","even","see","probabl","wrong","ever","see","label","comedi","insult","mankind","urg","support","bui","rent"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,9,10,20,23,25,32,33,44,85,97,127,138,143,148,153,154,159,179,226,271,319,347,421,459,586,661,709,742,823,983,1584,2605,2610,3518,4556,4664,4676,5902,8437],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,9,10,20,23,25,32,33,44,85,97,127,138,143,148,153,154,159,179,226,271,319,347,421,459,586,661,709,742,823,983,1584,2605,2610,3518,4556,4664,4676,5902,8437],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.604729392502474,2.011190219103739,4.109111584924517,2.4359679371086367,2.2907365189289424,2.3409902041158843,2.3018654096236517,2.3409902041158843,2.348499626138016,2.300267965194495,2.507968722980095,2.5940874818617203,2.757740698455715,2.9056060024680126,3.0151989841543516,3.2597778161886266,3.2850956241729166,3.4572130107926293,3.5727776966246974,3.6497387377608255,3.7740817043309423,3.850067611308864,4.165705761027235,4.597282013139085,5.185068678041204,5.259176650194926,5.770002273960917,6.032366538428407,6.032366538428407,6.0662680901040895,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485936E-4,2.612525409305093E-4,2.613170462009934E-4,2.6126451311592587E-4,2.612892387030442E-4,2.6125110046281385E-4,2.6133235318208836E-4,2.6121223056003475E-4,2.612525961435631E-4,2.615225723922476E-4,2.635976778853438E-4,2.612530276652938E-4,2.615004507919948E-4,2.615276946273664E-4,2.6140888942435543E-4,2.6126554219902895E-4,2.613554276499348E-4,2.6147842240272444E-4,2.612790302124765E-4,2.6127807495041885E-4,2.615131342971647E-4,2.6130425234607987E-4,2.613046478074204E-4,2.614720423625508E-4,2.6127912446240176E-4,2.6153082052883026E-4,2.613445085516981E-4,2.612519554093563E-4,2.613703958813557E-4,2.6145016989374874E-4,2.613055340857288E-4,2.614454836394505E-4,2.61573846844978E-4,2.6181662793414365E-4,2.613440569410399E-4,2.612653837373359E-4,2.613595846628696E-4,2.6129191767686465E-4,2.612125093556708E-4,2.6127894929861274E-4,2.615407954557391E-4,2.613973238661975E-4,2.614460794286617E-4,2.612255098731045E-4,2.612790157352306E-4,2.612652854915763E-4,2.613537214219082E-4,2.613990404838678E-4,2.613458864660953E-4,2.6130446268135776E-4,2.6126593158055147E-4,2.6180122304543036E-4,2.613316736148886E-4,2.6127895585041194E-4,2.6133027408698466E-4,2.6125222270562175E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151943E-4,2.612662983644796E-4,2.612520735761906E-4,2.6146108150200154E-4,2.6135612446964143E-4,2.6125196436596414E-4,2.612254034439248E-4,2.611991343440664E-4,2.61435299708924E-4,2.6126476291089606E-4,2.6138352415462326E-4,2.614602335926062E-4,2.6134161417251065E-4,2.6127930190573365E-4,2.612257458930215E-4,2.612925722653011E-4,2.612256051935994E-4,2.61239313890894E-4,2.612257532863612E-4,2.6139532530400025E-4,2.6131752568997945E-4,2.612523130700911E-4,2.612776202543234E-4]}}
{"value":"Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials in TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection). <br /><br />This little movie is like a Nacho's commercial: bad storyline, bad directing, and awful performances. I can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar...<br /><br />Nacho could made this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business

{"value":"I cannot believe how uneducated this movie is. It's like watching police academy, except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about, and...Wait, there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick. I can understand suspension of disbelief, but this is just complete stupidity. Not only is there no plot to this movie. It's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor, throw non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility. Plus the people are wearing clothes that are un-befitting for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a valley-girls \"b\" movie, in space.","finished_norm":["i","cannot","believ","how","uneduc","thi","movi","be","it","like","watch","polic","academi","except","it","with","peopl","that","have","no","clue","of","what","thei","be","talk","about","andwait","there","be","a","stupid","robot","that","be","suppos","to","be","a","sidekick","i","can","understand","suspens","of","disbelief","but","thi","be","just","complet","stupid","not","onli","be","there","no","plot","to","thi","movi","it","like","watch","someon","that","pretend","to","be","a","doctor","throw","nonmed","word","around","a","if","thei","be","chief","of","staff","at","a","major","medic","facil","plu","the","peopl","be","wear","cloth","that","be","unbefit","for","a","space","program","i","feel","like","i","be","watch","a","valleygirl","b","movi","in","space"],"filtered":["believ","uneduc","thi","movi","like","watch","polic","academi","except","peopl","clue","thei","talk","andwait","stupid","robot","suppos","sidekick","understand","suspens","disbelief","thi","complet","stupid","onli","plot","thi","movi","like","watch","someon","pretend","doctor","throw","nonmed","word","around","thei","chief","staff","major","medic","facil","plu","peopl","wear","cloth","unbefit","space","program","feel","like","watch","valleygirl","b","movi","space"],"filtered2":["believ","uneduc","like","watch","polic","academi","except","peopl","clue","talk","andwait","stupid","robot","suppos","sidekick","understand","suspens","disbelief","complet","stupid","onli","plot","like","watch","someon","pretend","doctor","throw","nonmed","word","around","chief","staff","major","medic","facil","plu","peopl","wear","cloth","unbefit","space","program","feel","like","watch","valleygirl","b","space"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,23,32,43,91,98,103,136,139,149,186,212,232,258,310,404,471,514,529,637,642,692,749,879,1045,1154,1371,1428,1780,1810,1880,2092,2690,2737,4190,6016],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,23,32,43,91,98,103,136,139,149,186,212,232,258,310,404,471,514,529,637,642,692,749,879,1045,1154,1371,1428,1780,1810,1880,2092,2690,2737,4190,6016],"values":[1.9381148836729736,2.8828493162168796,0.9913098153388195,2.729695454751562,1.3711311285073675,1.6608112036218214,2.0105926690411424,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,4.693651971159972,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.571852579609833,2.5983793339432615,2.6102777977348763,2.7061321952397077,2.854312708080462,3.1419947805322432,3.496027715008137,3.405285399859865,3.4648563601051974,7.486408931533005,3.622422927113863,3.8463152616903136,3.7165362186843414,3.8962296530720266,4.165705761027235,4.589376833631972,4.436351646326448,4.671389985292807,4.715065048795469,4.900964426937307,4.933754249760298,5.129498826886393,5.373120909544144,5.259176650194926,5.967828017290836,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6717037937823467E-4,2.6693362619818387E-4,2.6699953417250595E-4,2.669458587255897E-4,2.6697112198467937E-4,2.6693215440669815E-4,2.670151740126211E-4,2.668924392557494E-4,2.66933682611877E-4,2.672095296478218E-4,2.693297594914936E-4,2.669341235172935E-4,2.6718692700077474E-4,2.6721476326886006E-4,2.6709337457905824E-4,2.6694691018669083E-4,2.670387502479101E-4,2.6716441959163614E-4,2.669606915046713E-4,2.669597154698962E-4,2.67199886315987E-4,2.669864621079321E-4,2.669868661688047E-4,2.671579008138559E-4,2.6696078780411486E-4,2.672179571448312E-4,2.6702759370766455E-4,2.6693302794454E-4,2.670540439720466E-4,2.671355527157649E-4,2.6698777171973954E-4,2.671307645561985E-4,2.672619190927241E-4,2.6750997959492056E-4,2.6702713227647545E-4,2.6694674827915804E-4,2.670429976574583E-4,2.66973859214311E-4,2.6689272411395534E-4,2.669606088312894E-4,2.672281489822057E-4,2.6708155752125243E-4,2.671313733011853E-4,2.669060073350435E-4,2.6696067671260946E-4,2.669466478969884E-4,2.670370069169835E-4,2.670833114677515E-4,2.67029001585595E-4,2.6698667701707037E-4,2.669473080355363E-4,2.674942397181302E-4,2.670144796678456E-4,2.669606155255613E-4,2.670130497064104E-4,2.6693330105331494E-4,0.9789024083376444,2.6697494710598203E-4,2.669476827953898E-4,2.669331486809794E-4,2.6714670160315254E-4,2.670394622203581E-4,2.669330370959144E-4,2.669058985915007E-4,2.668790582551074E-4,2.671203591703036E-4,2.669461139524937E-4,2.67067457727092E-4,2.6714583525548456E-4,2.6702463638855355E-4,2.66960969106053E-4,2.66906248487348E-4,2.669745280371458E-4,2.669061047283369E-4,2.6692011152906026E-4,2.6690625604146014E-4,2.670795154991821E-4,2.67000024088253E-4,2.669333933828111E-4,2.6695925088617527E-4]}}
{"value":"Oh this was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but I think she acts bitchy through the movie, not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night, but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap. Faye Dunaway acts like she is remaking Mommy Dearest and the ending is completely silly. I really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was intrigued a bit by the references to his work(Ravens, House of Usher-like family curse,and being buried alive)-still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film.","finished_norm":["oh","thi","be","a","realli","bad","movi","the","girl","who","plai","jennif","be","okai","but","i","think","she","act","bitchi","through","the","movi","not","becaus","she","be","have","her","organ","rip","out","by","a","raven","at","night","but","becaus","she","be","think","of","fire","her","agent","for","putt","her","in","thi","piec","of","crap","faye","dunawai","act","like","she","be","remak","mommi","dear","and","the","end","be","complet","silli","i","realli","ca","not","recommend","thi","movi","at","all","even","though","a","a","fan","of","edgar","allen","poe","i","be","intrigu","a","bite","by","the","refer","to","hi","workraven","hous","of","usherlik","famili","curseand","be","buri","alivestil","he","would","probabl","turn","over","in","hi","grave","if","he","know","about","thi","film"],"filtered":["oh","thi","realli","bad","movi","girl","plai","jennif","okai","think","act","bitchi","movi","becaus","organ","rip","raven","night","becaus","think","fire","agent","putt","thi","piec","crap","faye","dunawai","act","like","remak","mommi","dear","end","complet","silli","realli","ca","recommend","thi","movi","even","though","fan","edgar","allen","poe","intrigu","bite","refer","hi","workraven","hous","usherlik","famili","curseand","buri","alivestil","probabl","turn","hi","grave","know","thi","film"],"filtered2":["oh","realli","bad","girl","plai","jennif","okai","think","act","bitchi","becaus","organ","rip","raven","night","becaus","think","fire","agent","putt","piec","crap","faye","dunawai","act","like","remak","mommi","dear","end","complet","silli","realli","ca","recommend","even","though","fan","edgar","allen","poe","intrigu","bite","refer","workraven","hous","usherlik","famili","curseand","buri","alivestil","probabl","turn","grave","know"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,9,12,13,21,22,24,26,40,81,84,86,96,103,140,148,154,182,191,210,213,218,234,298,313,385,483,551,715,825,1017,1069,1213,1345,1445,1576,1591,1767,1983,4187,4277,4351,4506,5216,5579,6031],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,9,12,13,21,22,24,26,40,81,84,86,96,103,140,148,154,182,191,210,213,218,234,298,313,385,483,551,715,825,1017,1069,1213,1345,1445,1576,1591,1767,1983,4187,4277,4351,4506,5216,5579,6031],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,2.324031090670098,2.5958480334723544,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.6284968758320737,1.949757232424728,2.2212694515902225,2.031112399272319,2.0390708128715254,2.098582041218749,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,2.348499626138016,2.7365296724240786,2.5460113484259455,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.5940874818617203,2.673149229007135,2.7819920465008363,2.907069060519773,3.09496984188738,3.613480989738201,3.528202072035993,3.68099128126493,3.8767358583910254,4.0536665665501035,4.2860694432771105,4.251780369798478,4.760735085628657,4.573751515728891,4.848596441419991,4.688631791727313,4.77960356993304,4.944927550358424,6.214688095222362,6.032366538428407,6.489124940924123,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918352E-4,2.3612552253122064E-4,2.3618382374676034E-4,2.3613634324334566E-4,2.36158690747249E-4,2.361242206063243E-4,2.3619765851711915E-4,2.3608908917345183E-4,2.3612557243393595E-4,2.3636958262639038E-4,2.3824510646673104E-4,2.3612596245232122E-4,2.3634958866039743E-4,2.363742122098564E-4,2.362668335771339E-4,2.3613727335022451E-4,2.362185137048159E-4,2.3632967894044428E-4,2.3614946409949674E-4,2.3614860071362605E-4,2.3636105227822527E-4,2.361722603925212E-4,2.3617261781876998E-4,2.363239125264052E-4,2.3614954928455472E-4,2.3637703746512054E-4,2.3620864479495754E-4,2.3612499332492963E-4,2.3623204230611885E-4,2.3630414373063946E-4,2.3617341885568208E-4,2.3629990819577752E-4,2.3641592555151696E-4,2.3663535618876835E-4,2.3620823661977858E-4,2.3613713012922487E-4,2.3622227090024033E-4,2.3616111205994108E-4,2.3608934115479146E-4,2.3614939096785063E-4,2.363860530131423E-4,2.362563803832485E-4,0.044639747396792,2.361010912949481E-4,2.3614945101465846E-4,2.36137041332648E-4,2.3621697158016173E-4,2.3625793189828046E-4,2.362098901828718E-4,2.3617245049795414E-4,2.3613762528140628E-4,2.366214329274519E-4,2.3619704431003977E-4,2.361493968895041E-4,2.3619577938738506E-4,2.3612523491289706E-4,0.936933936704487,2.3616207439276115E-4,2.3613795678840857E-4,2.3612510012659135E-4,2.3631400587089337E-4,2.362191435050726E-4,2.3612500142009956E-4,2.3610099510202465E-4,2.360772525389537E-4,2.3629070374590528E-4,2.3613656901327556E-4,2.3624390791467597E-4,2.3631323951260906E-4,2.3620602879437968E-4,2.361497096615574E-4,2.3610130461469624E-4,2.361617036906906E-4,2.361011774476094E-4,2.3611356765556823E-4,2.361
