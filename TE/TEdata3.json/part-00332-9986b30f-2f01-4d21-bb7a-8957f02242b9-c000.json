good anyway... but it wasn't...<br /><br />my opinion: if like movies they look little bit like documentary, with little bit of comedy try some Moore's movies or Alien autopsy, they are really about

{"value":"\"Algie, the Miner\" is one bad and unfunny silent comedy. The timing of the slapstick is completely off. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is an effeminate guy, acting much like the stereotypical \"pansy\" common in many early films. The film has the homophobic attitude common of the time. \"Algie, the Miner\" is pretty awful, but fascinating from a historical viewpoint.

{"value":"Evidently lots of people really like this, but I found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there's a marked dip in invention later on). I don't get on with Monroe - she's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ain't that dumb, but she just comes over as dumb. Russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium, but is otherwise rather wonderful. The men are staggeringly uninteresting, as is the plot.

{"value":"Don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. The problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. Even worse, the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking \"Is that it?\" I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.

{"value":"I kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. It is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason why. Stop teaching the kids of the United States of America to think they own the planet. Such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations. Even in jest. I would never refer to the USA as 'Alberta South'. Walt would never put us down, so why start now.

time.","finished_norm":["i","kinda","like","the","film","despit","it","frenzi","pace","but","i","do","not","appreci","the","comment","that","canada","be","refer","to","a","montana","north","it","be","definit","not","montana","north","and","never","will","be","american","wonder","why","thei","be","perceiv","a","arrog","in","the","rest","of","the","world","and","that","be","on","reason","why","stop","teach","the","kid","of","the","unit","state","of","america","to","think","thei","own","the","planet","such","a","centrist","world","view","be","not","becom","of","on","of","the","world","great","nation","even","in","jest","i","would","never","refer","to","the","usa","a","alberta","south","walt","would","never","put","u","down","so","why","start","now","other","than","that","the","film","be","pretti","goofi","well","luck","next","time"],"filtered":["kinda","like","film","despit","frenzi","pace","appreci","comment","canada","refer","montana","north","definit","montana","north","never","american","wonder","thei","perceiv","arrog","rest","world","reason","stop","teach","kid","unit","state","america","think","thei","planet","centrist","world","view","becom","world","great","nation","even","jest","never","refer","usa","alberta","south","walt","never","put","u","start","film","pretti","goofi","well","luck","next","time"],"filtered2":["kinda","like","despit","frenzi","pace","appreci","comment","canada","refer","montana","north","definit","montana","north","never","american","wonder","perceiv","arrog","rest","world","reason","stop","teach","kid","unit","state","america","think","planet","centrist","world","view","becom","world","great","nation","even","jest","never","refer","usa","alberta","south","walt","never","put","u","start","pretti","goofi","well","luck","next","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,12,20,42,51,71,78,95,112,114,115,159,165,175,223,226,280,297,312,315,391,392,498,546,715,809,961,1008,1055,1111,1299,1397,1481,1794,1987,2161,2364,2510,2689,4436,5790,6654,7843],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,12,20,42,51,71,78,95,112,114,115,159,165,175,223,226,280,297,312,315,391,392,498,546,715,809,961,1008,1055,1111,1299,1397,1481,1794,1987,2161,2364,2510,2689,4436,5790,6654,7843],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,4.865986292236151,1.7139899308309823,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.4433074195966826,2.201553588425805,2.300267965194495,7.346542799916893,2.3791142619576227,2.825563294794476,2.5940874818617203,2.8028805344481915,2.813490713560207,2.8824835850471584,2.854312708080462,3.109204957709252,3.0670934723591254,3.386191741044285,3.4572130107926293,7.36198256252986,3.90413483257914,3.9954846111673676,4.358390104856736,4.246178114249808,4.268777946167049,4.5432147918688095,4.422928625994308,4.597282013139085,4.74221603786142,4.869215728622727,10.286208957884345,5.129498826886393,5.259176650194926,5.426230734858092,5.9370563586240825,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.967517969832866E-5,6.920534367289553E-5,6.974334922925599E-5,6.934037141440856E-5,6.934150747832564E-5,6.924458190795183E-5,6.945052499660986E-5,6.921530879018317E-5,6.937093003631621E-5,7.696326006542982E-5,0.44037854696844175,6.910358002150585E-5,7.039336407434412E-5,0.17503347254700155,6.915396963117591E-5,6.89628578962438E-5,7.068305012100854E-5,6.94570319865675E-5,6.924154181540284E-5,6.929893074263131E-5,6.996943854220633E-5,6.952584632933684E-5,6.960501205290058E-5,6.968000364655114E-5,7.021476187665286E-5,6.984755843900622E-5,0.27888999434015604,6.912412388223802E-5,6.91259731144321E-5,6.930110337640906E-5,7.077408210511074E-5,6.945300754467574E-5,7.455192011540962E-5,6.964836860595535E-5,6.919936238249035E-5,6.951876305657488E-5,6.913002289210367E-5,6.917087364941308E-5,6.896251142126984E-5,6.898040347837325E-5,6.913566998320751E-5,6.986490480727626E-5,6.950989186650742E-5,6.923506918479483E-5,7.007634787279365E-5,6.926164198268123E-5,7.156286240586912E-5,7.051050965481302E-5,6.899754887965451E-5,6.915003768216826E-5,6.91260538438606E-5,7.10715208467803E-5,6.915106650290028E-5,6.897427959482225E-5,6.973137102317427E-5,6.916887798191671E-5,7.43835264132327E-5,6.911187383883087E-5,6.899675096258435E-5,6.932619019788467E-5,7.001384774017151E-5,6.93216038760692E-5,6.898398640940546E-5,6.914460505635814E-5,6.896334553505297E-5,7.055901441100592E-5,6.955743238402252E-5,6.940926486894024E-5,6.934856332982752E-5,6.960134986674461E-5,6.89608296428355E-5,6.935001718997173E-5,7.047482843115835E-5,6.90844112800477E-5,7.079421446396732E-5,6.926706344485531E-5,6.980918221604112E-5,6.938253920444509E-5,6.893920839168622E-5,0.10039704702104335]}}
{"value":"be warned: this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence.<br /><br />The only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways.<br /><br />Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot. Just an sketchy idea of a plot. The writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer. However, that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these \"jokes\" were just silly.<br /><br />This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart.

{"value":"Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this! The plot holds much potential for suspense. John Garfield is as almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against type. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable.<br /><br />Yes it starts to sag fairly early. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more, in the end, than a love story.<br /><br />It's fun to watch for Garfield, Massey, and the character performers.

{"value":"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.","finished_norm":["whoever","write","the","screenplai","for","thi","movi","obvious","never","consult","ani","book","about","lucil","ball","especi","her","autobiographi","i","have","never","see","so","mani","mistak","in","a","biopic","rang","from","her","earli","year","in","celoron","and","jamestown","to","her","late","year","with","desi","i","can","write","a","whole","list","of","factual","error","but","it","would","go","on","for","page","in","all","i","believ","that","lucil","ball","be","on","of","that","inimit","peopl","who","simpli","cannot","be","portrai","by","anyon","other","than","themselv","if","i","be","luci","arnaz","and","desi","jr","i","would","be","irat","at","how","mani","mistak","be","make","in","thi","film","the","filmmak","try","hard","but","the","movi","seem","awfulli","sloppi","to","me"],"filtered":["whoever","write","screenplai","thi","movi","obvious","never","consult","ani","book","lucil","ball","especi","autobiographi","never","see","mani","mistak","biopic","rang","earli","year","celoron","jamestown","late","year","desi","write","whole","list","factual","error","go","page","believ","lucil","ball","inimit","peopl","simpli","portrai","anyon","themselv","luci","arnaz","desi","jr","irat","mani","mistak","make","thi","film","filmmak","try","hard","movi","seem","awfulli","sloppi"],"filtered2":["whoever","write","screenplai","obvious","never","consult","ani","book","lucil","ball","especi","autobiographi","never","see","mani","mistak","biopic","rang","earli","year","celoron","jamestown","late","year","desi","write","whole","list","factual","error","go","page","believ","lucil","ball","inimit","peopl","simpli","portrai","anyon","themselv","luci","arnaz","desi","jr","irat","mani","mistak","make","filmmak","try","hard","seem","awfulli","sloppi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,23,27,35,36,42,50,57,65,91,111,150,151,158,171,201,266,267,323,341,436,469,593,602,703,1311,1338,1553,1609,1845,1913,2001,2778,3326,5090,5403,6774,6973,7099],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,23,27,35,36,42,50,57,65,91,111,150,151,158,171,201,266,267,323,341,436,469,593,602,703,1311,1338,1553,1609,1845,1913,2001,2778,3326,5090,5403,6774,6973,7099],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,3.2439908614907673,3.43598877114071,3.668325173349496,3.8147700134888347,2.0105926690411424,2.1183455303375887,2.332712011146513,2.8002454868101863,2.3106972614914807,2.373087554090762,2.561435818751577,2.747702973022204,2.7085302779237206,3.0433232530252132,2.933776879434709,3.2070272508030975,3.328770687675578,7.045534552100071,3.555828138310924,3.6746621462132825,9.012620469866716,4.646072177308517,4.589376833631972,4.621379564718146,4.9227044135737135,4.890269137820559,4.956227105612356,5.290429193699031,5.9370563586240825,6.255510089742618,13.737229125258052,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.693161953392331E-5,7.641285163826161E-5,7.700688869633973E-5,7.656194207307042E-5,7.656319645429216E-5,7.645617640589915E-5,7.668356778703197E-5,7.6423854589601E-5,7.659568327451776E-5,8.497872939947464E-5,0.5216659963294022,7.630048963869462E-5,7.77246004406113E-5,7.883335894479164E-5,7.63561271597801E-5,7.61451117688773E-5,0.18408862312734683,7.669075245850178E-5,7.64528196977523E-5,7.651618549220185E-5,7.725652446448399E-5,7.676673358778381E-5,7.685414415998044E-5,7.693694588042014E-5,7.752739741393526E-5,7.71219509510931E-5,8.03640112589044E-5,7.632317307466778E-5,7.632521489828704E-5,7.651858439861156E-5,7.814496899680958E-5,7.668630888427931E-5,8.231625635806885E-5,7.690201615483362E-5,7.640624741621633E-5,7.675891261555904E-5,0.21557870250421318,7.637479167568442E-5,7.614472920967918E-5,7.616448466543426E-5,7.633592166391765E-5,7.714110388632517E-5,7.674911752034668E-5,7.64456729640449E-5,0.04223658843395515,7.647501323106394E-5,7.901589816063135E-5,7.785394634636617E-5,7.618341570362948E-5,7.635178571127011E-5,7.632530403541888E-5,7.847338500101431E-5,7.63529216802833E-5,7.615772299963799E-5,0.030650406830136468,7.63725881660098E-5,8.213032500799738E-5,7.630964722970041E-5,7.61825346861319E-5,7.654628392968468E-5,7.730555873373821E-5,7.654121995760025E-5,7.616844074689945E-5,7.634578729542528E-5,7.614565019365782E-5,7.790750271271031E-5,7.68016092257395E-5,7.663801055334355E-5,7.657098714942319E-5,7.685010056923215E-5,7.614287227957565E-5,7.657259242429948E-5,7.78145490411193E-5,7.6279324536126E-5,7.816719807434595E-5,7.648099932061692E-5,7.707957797125892E-5,7.660850149916335E-5,7.611899924653195E-5,7.621335397399519E-5]}}

{"value":"A demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life. Honest this is the plot of the movie. He try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body. For some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin. The sleaze style of the movie is laughable. No one in the movie can actually act including the head. The closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so badly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me folks I wouldn't watch this movie on its own.","finished_norm":["a","dement","scientist","girlfriend","be","decapit","so","he","bring","her","head","back","to","life","honest","thi","be","the","plot","of","the","movi","he","try","to","get","her","anoth","bodi","he","search","through","the","sleaz","area","of","town","for","that","perfect","bodi","for","some","reason","he","have","ugli","look","monster","in","a","closet","at","hi","cabin","the","sleaz","styl","of","the","movi","be","laughabl","no","on","in","the","movi","can","actual","act","includ","the","head","the","closet","monster","be","a","man","with","a","mask","tie","on","and","you","can","realli","tell","the","plot","be","slow","weak","and","the","end","be","so","badli","do","watch","the","mysteri","scienc","theater","version","of","thi","move","believ","me","folk","i","would","not","watch","thi","movi","on","it","own"],"filtered":["dement","scientist","girlfriend","decapit","bring","head","back","life","honest","thi","plot","movi","try","get","anoth","bodi","search","sleaz","area","town","perfect","bodi","reason","ugli","look","monster","closet","hi","cabin","sleaz","styl","movi","laughabl","movi","actual","act","includ","head","closet","monster","man","mask","tie","realli","tell","plot","slow","weak","end","badli","watch","mysteri","scienc","theater","version","thi","move","believ","folk","watch","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["dement","scientist","girlfriend","decapit","bring","head","back","life","honest","plot","try","get","anoth","bodi","search","sleaz","area","town","perfect","bodi","reason","ugli","look","monster","closet","cabin","sleaz","styl","laughabl","actual","act","includ","head","closet","monster","man","mask","tie","realli","tell","plot","slow","weak","end","badli","watch","mysteri","scienc","theater","version","move","believ","folk","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,13,16,21,24,32,36,45,52,63,73,75,90,91,95,208,220,250,275,301,376,379,380,390,403,413,424,448,450,552,677,730,805,895,910,1005,1089,1103,1156,1175,1340,1610,2733,3212,3320,3919],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,13,16,21,24,32,36,45,52,63,73,75,90,91,95,208,220,250,275,301,376,379,380,390,403,413,424,448,450,552,677,730,805,895,910,1005,1089,1103,1156,1175,1340,1610,2733,3212,3320,3919],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,1.8162961064622165,1.7122153074726136,1.8729627573220065,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.0323326556775485,5.257898800055879,2.8336934208777267,2.6812935439488212,2.7832848715031413,2.8309760279012264,6.313840861497837,3.1272886331425473,3.102062070196872,3.132778125427319,3.189397019426827,6.934834361933742,3.212973749990824,3.2681460658591432,3.469984576472117,3.424750734647968,3.6559115968679063,3.767137231978131,4.096025840389245,3.9954846111673676,4.096025840389245,4.086456389373095,4.2078172463773615,4.160564361526816,4.2860694432771105,4.263079925052412,4.5432147918688095,5.051537285416681,10.964640403018272,5.521540914662417,5.5623629091826725,11.756431717202299]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.04565962354330484,7.321608414904975E-5,7.378526938817413E-5,7.335893731558847E-5,7.336013921918344E-5,7.325759640471197E-5,7.347547476075874E-5,7.322662678675898E-5,7.339126693804718E-5,0.23523864929935911,0.6473882514681658,7.310842286643725E-5,7.447295532498633E-5,7.55353283970887E-5,7.316173276573173E-5,7.295954530268268E-5,7.47794298953553E-5,7.348235885812769E-5,7.325438012602488E-5,7.331509498274236E-5,7.402446152686815E-5,7.355516128122778E-5,7.363891499113724E-5,7.371825266276476E-5,7.428400237942802E-5,7.389551795953074E-5,7.700194515369857E-5,7.313015733022697E-5,7.313211373319742E-5,7.331739352977722E-5,7.487573756546505E-5,7.347810118291704E-5,7.887251716345225E-5,7.368478423863168E-5,7.320975621773139E-5,7.35476675030444E-5,7.313639821250278E-5,7.317961644285874E-5,7.295917874802805E-5,7.297810772502545E-5,7.314237257626594E-5,7.391386962273383E-5,7.353828219023457E-5,7.324753237927426E-5,7.413756670241061E-5,7.327564518246071E-5,7.571023099921499E-5,7.459688998410513E-5,7.299624677435829E-5,7.315757294375649E-5,7.313219914123554E-5,7.51904141320926E-5,7.315866138897319E-5,7.297162893668929E-5,7.377259699471593E-5,7.317750511804488E-5,7.869436433862085E-5,7.311719734532801E-5,7.299540261464097E-5,7.334393423797561E-5,7.407144442446892E-5,7.333908211953857E-5,7.298189830196696E-5,7.315182547445204E-5,7.296006120220996E-5,7.464820579474302E-5,7.358857788051142E-5,7.343182343530998E-5,7.33676039869295E-5,7.363504056590451E-5,7.295739950346637E-5,7.336914210437839E-5,7.455914088360231E-5,7.308814321586194E-5,7.48970366791163E-5,0.06610818079661383,7.385491767318268E-5,7.340354

{"value":"This is by far the worst horror/thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO. This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it. The plot isn't even the worst part of this movie.....its the acting, camera work, lighting, and sound. there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. whoever paid to have this film made is broke now. I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie. In its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killer's capture but I've seen movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this.","finished_norm":["thi","be","by","far","the","wrong","horrorthril","i","have","see","in","my","year","if","someon","offer","thi","to","you","for","free","tell","them","no","thi","movi","make","you","a","dumb","person","for","know","you","watch","it","the","plot","be","not","even","the","wrong","part","of","thi","movieit","the","act","camera","work","light","and","sound","there","be","absolut","noth","to","like","about","thi","movi","whoever","pai","to","have","thi","film","make","be","break","now","i","hope","the","director","never","get","the","greenlight","for","anoth","movi","in","it","defens","thi","movi","be","make","quickli","to","try","to","capit","on","the","actual","btk","killer","captur","but","i","have","see","movi","of","the","week","that","look","like","oscar","winner","compar","to","thi"],"filtered":["thi","far","wrong","horrorthril","see","year","someon","offer","thi","free","tell","thi","movi","make","dumb","person","know","watch","plot","even","wrong","part","thi","movieit","act","camera","work","light","sound","absolut","noth","like","thi","movi","whoever","pai","thi","film","make","break","hope","director","never","get","greenlight","anoth","movi","defens","thi","movi","make","quickli","try","capit","actual","btk","killer","captur","see","movi","week","look","like","oscar","winner","compar","thi"],"filtered2":["far","wrong","horrorthril","see","year","someon","offer","free","tell","make","dumb","person","know","watch","plot","even","wrong","part","movieit","act","camera","work","light","sound","absolut","noth","like","whoever","pai","make","break","hope","director","never","get","greenlight","anoth","defens","make","quickli","try","capit","actual","btk","killer","captur","see","week","look","like","oscar","winner","compar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,16,21,25,26,32,36,42,48,49,52,57,58,61,73,90,101,139,153,178,181,222,231,252,322,353,360,420,482,507,686,771,857,924,979,1609,2125,2339,3015,4256,5618,6627,6843],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,16,21,25,26,32,36,42,48,49,52,57,58,61,73,90,101,139,153,178,181,222,231,252,322,353,360,420,482,507,686,771,857,924,979,1609,2125,2339,3015,4256,5618,6627,6843],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,1.834162586674748,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,1.8950689206770979,2.0477128419653545,2.098582041218749,2.2939035841256437,2.3409902041158843,2.532833256045391,2.4442286541160034,2.5771019354959765,2.7049353070058615,3.0433232530252132,2.885344817328191,3.0266839340212486,3.028335462059722,3.3023374306074227,3.3154667220492153,3.365138331846453,3.6016814428070463,3.7264536553416874,3.9612932464190886,3.969732115064953,4.096025840389245,4.621379564718146,5.00274712124725,5.170884043049248,5.444579873526289,6.342521466732247,6.2980697041614135,6.794506590475304,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.95202022228379E-5,8.891654657113448E-5,8.960778793442806E-5,8.909003318111919E-5,8.90914928210087E-5,8.896696071792701E-5,8.92315609245269E-5,8.89293499728426E-5,8.912929557017465E-5,9.888408805856888E-5,1.1516462302490614E-4,8.878579839523049E-5,9.044294129365982E-5,9.173312972478661E-5,8.885054007321574E-5,8.860499551585178E-5,9.08151362932395E-5,8.923992124823746E-5,8.896305474020379E-5,8.903678929522164E-5,8.989827245277976E-5,8.932833542825414E-5,8.94300492898219E-5,8.952640013753663E-5,9.021346926468208E-5,8.974167821746305E-5,9.351424788559446E-5,8.881219359901963E-5,8.881456953318568E-5,8.903958074285021E-5,0.9928910725994701,8.923475055684429E-5,9.578594549347701E-5,8.948575474209275E-5,8.890886167776293E-5,8.931923468373085E-5,8.88197727765456E-5,8.887225872736952E-5,8.86045503571903E-5,8.862753846539489E-5,8.882702828330964E-5,8.976396521266118E-5,8.930783678375793E-5,8.89547385621408E-5,9.003563191041049E-5,8.898887987689186E-5,9.194553845366257E-5,9.059345251011441E-5,8.864956725378892E-5,8.88454882187129E-5,8.881467325612971E-5,9.131425201966188E-5,8.884681007020121E-5,8.861967036521562E-5,8.959239807199291E-5,8.886969464990867E-5,9.556958956390213E-5,8.87964544740142E-5,8.864854207240027E-5,8.907181284244938E-5,8.995533036636691E-5,8.9065920235381E-5,8.863214189393204E-5,8.883850826167184E-5,8.860562204491132E-5,9.065577248692621E-5,8.93689178855241E-5,8.917854900566689E-5,8.910055833409437E-5,8.942534403255985E-5,8.860238957129512E-5,8.910242628556112E-5,9.054760848974801E-5,8.876116997490751E-5,9.095796268428329E-5,8.899584549064799E-5,8.969237160275092E-5,8.914421128453713E-5,8.85746101

To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even Babban getting killed was cut out!!! Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!! Amitabhs acting was great but that 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate can't even act.

{"value":"I chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move. It wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious. The girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a surf \"theme\" that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now, being married with Gordon Gekko and all, but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time. A bad movie with GREAT surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL cinematography was IN GOD'S HANDS.","finished_norm":["i","choos","thi","movi","by","the","cover","which","be","a","bad","move","it","be","not","funni","at","all","and","the","main","charact","be","obnoxi","the","girl","be","beauti","but","the","stori","and","the","act","be","terribl","it","have","absolut","noth","to","do","with","surf","terribl","movi","with","a","surf","theme","that","have","noth","to","do","with","surf","and","no","real","surfer","catherin","zeta","jone","be","beauti","and","the","movi","will","probabl","see","a","resurg","just","becuas","she","be","in","the","limelight","now","be","marri","with","gordon","gekko","and","all","but","if","you","have","not","see","it","do","not","wast","your","time","a","bad","movi","with","great","surf","real","surfer","and","amaz","beauti","cinematographi","be","in","god","hand"],"filtered":["choos","thi","movi","cover","bad","move","funni","main","charact","obnoxi","girl","beauti","stori","act","terribl","absolut","noth","surf","terribl","movi","surf","theme","noth","surf","real","surfer","catherin","zeta","jone","beauti","movi","probabl","see","resurg","becuas","limelight","marri","gordon","gekko","see","wast","time","bad","movi","great","surf","real","surfer","amaz","beauti","cinematographi","god","hand"],"filtered2":["choos","cover","bad","move","funni","main","charact","obnoxi","girl","beauti","stori","act","terribl","absolut","noth","surf","terribl","surf","theme","noth","surf","real","surfer","catherin","zeta","jone","beauti","probabl","see","resurg","becuas","limelight","marri","gordon","gekko","see","wast","time","bad","great","surf","real","surfer","amaz","beauti","cinematographi","god","hand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,9,10,17,21,49,51,62,80,84,89,148,166,179,222,235,275,325,352,491,533,584,629,685,733,1195,1519,2100,2507,2597,6046,7666],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,9,10,17,21,49,51,62,80,84,89,148,166,179,222,235,275,325,352,491,533,584,629,685,733,1195,1519,2100,2507,2597,6046,7666],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,3.3840606616174704,1.7139899308309823,2.0226120445069267,3.9903607800925114,2.2212694515902225,1.9940046109572438,2.3018654096236517,4.884774065938707,2.507968722980095,2.5771019354959765,2.6457189377809835,2.7832848715031413,8.920978397139084,3.1236456418640466,3.369778711402955,3.4933926673701317,3.5146700658174166,3.488143311483988,3.607563812710113,3.7636829971100436,4.422928625994308,4.573751515728891,5.214056214914456,5.3064295350454715,23.080009095843668,13.589013180950609,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.936201866208669E-5,8.87594296791137E-5,8.944944960839049E-5,8.893260973561631E-5,8.89340667962999E-5,8.880975474334101E-5,8.90738873973459E-5,8.8772210457016E-5,0.40385929083259064,0.49364864577599815,0.0956075684425799,8.862891253722788E-5,9.028312723891683E-5,9.157103588743581E-5,8.869353981568209E-5,8.844842913929072E-5,9.06546645642636E-5,8.908223294823713E-5,8.880585566753993E-5,8.887945993247606E-5,8.97394208361741E-5,8.917049089905115E-5,8.927202503067638E-5,8.936820562497573E-5,9.005406069050922E-5,8.958310330525617E-5,9.334900678532645E-5,8.86552611002899E-5,8.86576328361441E-5,8.888224644757416E-5,9.077141778825826E-5,8.90770713935344E-5,9.561669026893716E-5,8.932763205056464E-5,8.875175836506578E-5,8.916140623568204E-5,8.866282688529376E-5,8.87152200926432E-5,8.844798476723137E-5,8.847093225509864E-5,8.867006957146684E-5,8.960535091899435E-5,8.915002847597196E-5,8.879755418429024E-5,8.987653757755115E-5,8.883163517081814E-5,9.178306928685278E-5,9.043337249975961E-5,8.849292211828808E-5,8.86884968878831E-5,8.865773637580812E-5,9.115289834559568E-5,8.86898164036397E-5,8.846307805797223E-5,8.943408694007666E-5,8.871266054594627E-5,9.5400716643585E-5,8.863954978655808E-5,8.849189874841056E-5,8.891442159256242E-5,8.979637792755892E-5,8.890853939782047E-5,8.847552754930746E-5,8.868152926453243E-5,8.844905456126387E-5,9.049558235622323E-5,8.921100164650103E-5,8.902096915135391E-5,8.894311629048587E-5,8.926732808767557E-5,8.844582779947778E-5,8.894498094125393E-5,9.038760948647541E-5,8.860432763569869E-5,9.07972385788991E-5,8.883858847622869E-5,8.95338838160832E-5,8.898669210550037E-5,8.841809742752803E-5,8.852769773189583E-5]}}
{"value":"(A possible spoiler or two) <br /><br /> \"Soul Survivors\" is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever. Nothing makes sense at all, there's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together, by the end of the film. <br /><br /> Tha acting is non-existent, the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even harder to watch.<br /><br /> I kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came. Definitely the worst film of the year. -****1/2

While I prefer hardcore porn flicks, I'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances. Well, these aren't the right circumstances. These aren't ANY circumstances. There's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere, but I'll be damned if I can untangle it. This is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you, despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place.

{"value":"This movie is some of the worst crap I have ever seen. I literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was awful, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out-anything, except he can't seem to work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was the split screen camera work. I felt like I was watching the Brady Bunch or something, only it wasn't different people in the boxes, just close ups and different views of the same thing. I can only figure that the actors really needed the money, because this movie wasn't worth the film it was shot

{"value":"Really, I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. It had zombies in it right? Was I wrong! To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. Overall I think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some boob but I had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.","finished_norm":["realli","i","ca","not","believ","that","i","spend","on","thi","movi","i","be","a","huge","zombi","fanat","and","think","the","movi","can","not","be","that","bad","it","have","zombi","in","it","right","be","i","wrong","to","be","honest","the","movi","have","it","momentsi","think","it","be","cool","when","the","gui","get","hi","head","rip","off","but","that","be","about","it","overal","i","think","that","it","would","be","much","enjoy","to","slide","down","a","razorblad","slide","on","my","bare","nutsack","into","a","vat","of","vinegar","then","watch","thi","movi","again","the","movi","can","have","be","well","if","we","can","see","some","boob","but","i","have","to","watch","the","trailer","for","the","other","movi","produc","by","thi","compani","to","see","that","buyer","bewareunless","you","be","into","masoch"],"filtered":["realli","ca","believ","spend","thi","movi","huge","zombi","fanat","think","movi","bad","zombi","right","wrong","honest","movi","momentsi","think","cool","gui","get","hi","head","rip","overal","think","much","enjoy","slide","razorblad","slide","bare","nutsack","vat","vinegar","watch","thi","movi","movi","well","see","boob","watch","trailer","movi","produc","thi","compani","see","buyer","bewareunless","masoch"],"filtered2":["realli","ca","believ","spend","huge","zombi","fanat","think","bad","zombi","right","wrong","honest","momentsi","think","cool","gui","get","head","rip","overal","think","enjoy","slide","razorblad","slide","bare","nutsack","vat","vinegar","watch","well","see","boob","watch","trailer","produc","compani","see","buyer","bewareunless","masoch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,9,12,13,20,25,55,81,91,121,208,261,268,283,412,444,481,589,736,824,882,950,1103,3158,3371,3543,7264],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,9,12,13,20,25,55,81,91,121,208,261,268,283,412,444,481,589,736,824,882,950,1103,3158,3371,3543,7264],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,3.200185830788664,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.9536997889255368,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.2190595059394194,2.6289494000279396,2.7085302779237206,7.349324292426565,2.7678802023081546,3.107414446935464,3.2535472664379905,3.353630724994973,3.496027715008137,3.68099128126493,3.8767358583910254,3.9612932464190886,4.125296222689358,4.160564361526816,5.521540914662417,11.209845047202936,5.770002273960917,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.2513830209163047E-4,1.2429446526567974E-4,1.252607362122393E-4,1.2453697834395767E-4,1.2453901874213483E-4,1.243649380815846E-4,1.2473481683257965E-4,1.2431236285651365E-4,1.2459186236544624E-4,1.3822787009267664E-4,0.36799767652315324,1.2411169529501464E-4,1.2642817854106956E-4,1.2823170428878376E-4,1.24202196248503E-4,1.2385895496627402E-4,1.269484616630676E-4,1.2474650354337896E-4,1.2435947800209246E-4,1.2446254989861752E-4,1.2566679806763983E-4,1.2487009576159772E-4,0.62222379817115,1.2514696601890774E-4,1.2610740468923758E-4,1.254478984646643E-4,1.3072148980013953E-4,1.2414859256405021E-4,1.241519138296421E-4,1.244664520012485E-4,1.2711195730062325E-4,1.2473927554874182E-4,1.3389704542286264E-4,1.2509014872351078E-4,1.2428372272394738E-4,1.2485737403299192E-4,1.2415918732795045E-4,1.2423255627268788E-4,1.2385833268886985E-4,1.2389046725467276E-4,1.2416932963968256E-4,1.2547905296016995E-4,1.2484144116181196E-4,1.2434785300151322E-4,1.2585880980216818E-4,1.2439557838699088E-4,1.2852862573244642E-4,1.266385748271055E-4,1.2392126080862278E-4,1.2419513437331503E-4,1.241520588216415E-4,1.276461644497107E-4,1.2419698216014702E-4,1.2387946861221362E-4,1.2523922306541054E-4,1.242289720057636E-4,1.335946062750258E-4,1.24126591190833E-4,1.239198277303329E-4,1.245115085372765E-4,1.257465580575627E-4,1.2450327139275355E-4,1.238969022851646E-4,1.241853772464196E-4,1.2385983077732864E-4,1.26725690538319E-4,1.2492682507711945E-4,1.246607126488084E-4,1.245516912214966E-4,1.2500570193461414E-4,1.2385531217426652E-4,1.2455430238935745E-4,1.2657449048941125E-4,1.240772677733392E-4,1.2714811550237199E-4,1.244053154637269E-4,1.25378973843252E-4,1.246127127112169E-4,1.238164798860739E-4,1.2396995891668058E-4]}}
{"value":"Oh dear. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of Japan's Ringu. Well, I guess the U.S. made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. So, so sad. I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so I can't believe this had to happen. Claudine and Kris are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. To any aspiring movie makers out there in the Philippines: You do not have to stoop this low to make money. There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them!","finished_norm":["oh","dear","i","be","so","disappoint","that","thi","movi","be","just","a","ripoff","of","japan","ringu","good","i","guess","the","u","make","their","version","of","it","a","good","but","at","littl","it","be","a","outright","remak","so","so","sad","i","veri","much","enjoi","watch","filipino","movi","and","know","some","great","thing","can","come","out","of","such","a","littl","countri","so","i","ca","not","believ","thi","have","to","happen","claudin","and","kri","be","such","big","name","there","surpris","thei","would","be","affili","with","plagiar","to","ani","aspir","movi","maker","out","there","in","the","philippin","you","do","not","have","to","stoop","thi","low","to","make","monei","there","be","mani","movi","buff","that","be","watch","the","movi","filipino","put","out","and","enjoi","them"],"filtered":["oh","dear","disappoint","thi","movi","ripoff","japan","ringu","good","guess","u","make","version","good","littl","outright","remak","sad","veri","much","enjoi","watch","filipino","movi","know","great","thing","come","littl","countri","ca","believ","thi","happen","claudin","kri","big","name","surpris","thei","affili","plagiar","ani","aspir","movi","maker","philippin","stoop","thi","low","make","monei","mani","movi","buff","watch","movi","filipino","put","enjoi"],"filtered2":["oh","dear","disappoint","ripoff","japan","ringu","good","guess","u","make","version","good","littl","outright","remak","sad","veri","enjoi","watch","filipino","know","great","thing","come","littl","countri","ca","believ","happen","claudin","kri","big","name","surpris","affili","plagiar","ani","aspir","maker","philippin","stoop","low","make","monei","mani","buff","watch","filipino","put","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,14,15,26,27,29,34,50,51,81,82,91,94,112,126,143,159,187,200,217,220,234,243,326,455,483,608,762,1413,1841,1983,2331,2615,4071,5950,5965,6734,8487],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,14,15,26,27,29,34,50,51,81,82,91,94,112,126,143,159,187,200,217,220,234,243,326,455,483,608,762,1413,1841,1983,2331,2615,4071,5950,5965,6734,8487],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.357228929984541,1.9218995441445863,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.0105926690411424,2.08112281984698,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.300267965194495,2.4732161909892554,5.061642365863941,2.6113665294700725,2.8336934208777267,2.673149229007135,2.627841366673578,2.942840385588056,3.2787058260741455,3.613480989738201,3.616452760127359,3.749984152751882,4.484804029712395,5.156897801074508,4.944927550358424,5.089758498236879,5.290429193699031,5.878215858601149,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.670630274888724E-5,9.605418954136349E-5,9.680091927265726E-5,9.624160252984511E-5,9.624317934014662E-5,9.610865060849122E-5,9.639449120146901E-5,9.606802071702058E-5,9.628401664853969E-5,1.0682186053418009E-4,0.6616229250042809,9.591294575092431E-5,9.770311332041616E-5,9.9096869700826E-5,9.598288447041165E-5,9.57176291904507E-5,9.810518571767659E-5,9.640352263767846E-5,9.610443108424024E-5,9.61840845705322E-5,9.711472200185192E-5,9.649903413394055E-5,9.66089129238258E-5,9.67129981919312E-5,9.745522076705169E-5,0.12283054939183984,1.010209644617143E-4,9.594145979027375E-5,9.594402644900629E-5,9.618710009744987E-5,9.823153439237732E-5,9.639793687675664E-5,1.0347501920206172E-4,9.666909004807603E-5,9.60458877546547E-5,9.648920284074351E-5,9.594964737495536E-5,9.600634655708865E-5,9.571714829734255E-5,9.574198174159822E-5,9.595748530668804E-5,9.696963344863414E-5,9.647688999137418E-5,9.60954473374043E-5,9.726310778478383E-5,9.613232929520353E-5,9.932632922315876E-5,9.786570659996807E-5,9.576577885807839E-5,9.597742708583404E-5,9.594413849815473E-5,9.864436721355819E-5,9.597885504697626E-5,9.573348204142887E-5,9.678429401200143E-5,9.600357665213934E-5,1.0324129562338945E-4,9.592445723051647E-5,9.576467138178496E-5,9.622191958070248E-5,9.717636015423058E-5,9.621555395340288E-5,9.574695470348551E-5,9.596988682316678E-5,9.57183060131947E-5,9.793302921983731E-5,0.20808660586258776,9.633722383000112E-5,9.6252972573755E-5,9.660382995906482E-5,9.571481405758699E-5,9.625499047223577E-5,9.781618251933938E-5,9.588634032094491E-5,9.825947728393588E-5,9.613985406320008E-5,9.689229276862055E-5,9.630012969959451E-5,9.568480464435683E-5,9.580341253140158E-5]}}

{"value":"Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3d animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Didn't Bug's Life also do that? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I'm saying before they go and use that as there logo. Also, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a \"theater\" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flyes were. I liked IQ. I agree with animaster, they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure. I recommend it to families and kids.","finished_norm":["actual","thi","be","a","lie","shrek","have","be","actual","the","have","anim","movi","i","bui","it","on","dvd","about","year","ago","do","not","bug","life","conjur","do","that","i","think","it","be","at","disneyworld","in","that","tree","so","i","be","sai","befor","thei","go","and","us","that","a","there","logo","conjur","shrek","have","be","a","motion","simul","at","univers","studio","thei","should","still","consid","it","a","a","movi","becaus","it","appear","in","a","theater","and","you","can","bui","it","for","dvd","the","movi","be","cute","at","littl","the","littl","flye","be","i","like","iq","i","agre","with","animast","thei","do","a","god","job","out","of","make","a","movi","out","of","someth","that","be","just","a","outandback","adventur","i","recommend","it","to","famili","and","kid"],"filtered":["actual","thi","lie","shrek","actual","anim","movi","bui","dvd","year","ago","bug","life","conjur","think","disneyworld","tree","sai","befor","thei","go","us","logo","conjur","shrek","motion","simul","univers","studio","thei","still","consid","movi","becaus","appear","theater","bui","dvd","movi","cute","littl","littl","flye","like","iq","agre","animast","thei","god","job","make","movi","someth","outandback","adventur","recommend","famili","kid"],"filtered2":["actual","lie","shrek","actual","anim","bui","dvd","year","ago","bug","life","conjur","think","disneyworld","tree","befor","go","us","logo","conjur","shrek","motion","simul","univers","studio","still","consid","becaus","appear","theater","bui","dvd","cute","littl","littl","flye","like","iq","agre","animast","god","job","make","someth","outandback","adventur","recommend","famili","kid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,12,14,22,39,52,53,56,57,64,75,79,114,169,182,247,277,289,298,317,347,352,424,610,622,650,855,913,932,1021,1076,1351,2039,3339,4148,5949,6465],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,12,14,22,39,52,53,56,57,64,75,79,114,169,182,247,277,289,298,317,347,352,424,610,622,650,855,913,932,1021,1076,1351,2039,3339,4148,5949,6465],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,1.2979240167361772,3.1077880109725475,3.4244306149452273,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.4433074195966826,2.4214486257841834,2.7365296724240786,5.460751613699401,3.1163992333432793,2.8282659991423613,2.7819920465008363,2.8529247828056143,6.030397968308703,3.1236456418640466,3.212973749990824,3.477726550625732,3.4933926673701317,3.6621227969605474,3.9201351739255808,4.067587905068712,4.058285512406398,4.076977645418551,4.202455303235976,4.573751515728891,5.089758498236879,5.649374286172302,5.878215858601149,6.389041482367141,13.589013180950609]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.175780936212754E-5,9.113906500237402E-5,9.184758432718994E-5,0.02116575057580693,9.1318384130861E-5,9.119073927874605E-5,9.146195331436604E-5,9.115218843221388E-5,9.135713178072332E-5,0.06721162822490254,0.7344249498022828,9.10050487032466E-5,9.270361280815532E-5,9.402605021518737E-5,9.107140863540546E-5,9.081972655555017E-5,9.308511102832195E-5,9.147052260900782E-5,9.11867356689418E-5,9.126231326008582E-5,9.214532966730006E-5,9.15611467505249E-5,9.166540300651489E-5,9.176416219714406E-5,9.246840499845369E-5,9.198482127216003E-5,9.585168841296543E-5,9.103210366980408E-5,9.103453899176329E-5,9.126517448149716E-5,9.32049943996928E-5,9.146522267331348E-5,0.1108881411814945,9.17225008474824E-5,9.113118802082746E-5,9.155181852784123E-5,9.103987229307884E-5,9.109367015937391E-5,9.081927026990087E-5,9.084283297862868E-5,9.104730915526134E-5,9.200766534317266E-5,9.154013573103251E-5,9.117821162339254E-5,9.228612250081032E-5,9.121320631925462E-5,9.424376821813083E-5,9.285788613600063E-5,9.086541238881486E-5,9.106623050699547E-5,9.103464530731988E-5,9.359670242934115E-5,9.106758539889537E-5,9.083476821091856E-5,9.183180978660167E-5,9.109104199137384E-5,9.79584044972604E-5,9.101597113663375E-5,9.086436158244842E-5,9.1298212240315E-5,0.05943080608223334,9.129217234426247E-5,9.084755147241708E-5,9.105907608205421E-5,9.082036874505127E-5,9.292176383522113E-5,9.160274358883804E-5,9.14076163331719E-5,9.132767624147772E-5,9.16605801387361E-5,9.081705547396298E-5,9.132959088342812E-5,9.28108962189012E-5,9.097980468188858E-5,9.323150744428013E-5,9.122034604239259E-5,9.193428221124743E-5,9.13724203216447E-5,9.078858165229913E-5,9.090112033466978E-5]}}
{"value":"They really can't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.<br /><br />Trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out of all that. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense.<br /><br />It really can't get much worse than this awful

{"value":"I couldn't wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it. Then after I started it, I couldn't wait to get it OUT of my DVD player. Actually I watched all of the movie. My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny ever does. The box read like the it would be really funny. The premise of the movie sound good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie miss? Well....it does miss! This is the unfunniest \"comedy\" I have ever watched. Nobody I have talked with thought it was even slightly funny. It is just a really lame movie. Trust me.

{"value":"Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made. Some of the actors are terrible. They over do it & seem fake. I can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear. It's not very well written either. I love to watch it to laugh at it. You know the saying \"It's so bad that it's good?\" Well, that saying applies to this show. I also like to watch just to see if I'm right when I guess how it's all going to end. So far I've been right every time. It's like a little game that I play. It's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something.","finished_norm":["person","i","think","thi","show","look","pretti","cheapli","make","some","of","the","actor","be","terribl","thei","over","do","it","seem","fake","i","can","alwai","tell","how","it","go","to","end","within","the","minut","or","littl","of","watch","becaus","thei","make","it","so","transpar","clear","it","not","veri","good","write","either","i","love","to","watch","it","to","laugh","at","it","you","know","the","sai","it","so","bad","that","it","good","good","that","sai","appli","to","thi","show","i","conjur","like","to","watch","just","to","see","if","i","be","right","when","i","guess","how","it","all","go","to","end","so","far","i","have","be","right","everi","time","it","like","a","littl","game","that","i","plai","it","nice","when","you","be","bore","you","feel","like","laugh","at","someth"],"filtered":["person","think","thi","show","look","pretti","cheapli","make","actor","terribl","thei","seem","fake","alwai","tell","go","end","within","minut","littl","watch","becaus","thei","make","transpar","clear","veri","good","write","either","love","watch","laugh","know","sai","bad","good","good","sai","appli","thi","show","conjur","like","watch","see","right","guess","go","end","far","right","everi","time","like","littl","game","plai","nice","bore","feel","like","laugh","someth"],"filtered2":["person","think","show","look","pretti","cheapli","make","actor","terribl","seem","fake","alwai","tell","go","end","within","minut","littl","watch","becaus","make","transpar","clear","veri","good","write","either","love","watch","laugh","know","bad","good","good","appli","show","conjur","like","watch","see","right","guess","go","end","far","right","everi","time","like","littl","game","plai","nice","bore","feel","like","laugh","someth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9,12,14,15,16,22,24,26,28,35,39,40,41,43,53,54,59,65,78,85,90,101,108,121,133,153,166,197,207,243,262,374,590,639,672,2353,3935,4073],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9,12,14,15,16,22,24,26,28,35,39,40,41,43,53,54,59,65,78,85,90,101,108,121,133,153,166,197,207,243,262,374,590,639,672,2353,3935,4073],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,1.9416538289407692,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,1.3324924169710188,3.0904588387038183,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.0477128419653545,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,4.438119011878839,4.642472950759303,2.3409902041158843,2.4423870329693536,2.558331832813986,2.5531798379045583,2.627841366673578,2.726701583487816,3.4572130107926293,3.4986697244709752,3.616452760127359,3.616452760127359,5.089758498236879,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1393513332042862E-4,1.1316684208058917E-4,1.1404660636762022E-4,1.1338764386104891E-4,1.1338950158993335E-4,1.1323100572626263E-4,1.1356777060242465E-4,1.131831373663945E-4,1.1343761431934141E-4,1.2585284077193287E-4,0.9529248939433533,1.1300043482855972E-4,1.151095319080498E-4,1.1675159467442953E-4,1.130828335668275E-4,1.1277032140549738E-4,1.155832360088599E-4,1.1357841104528462E-4,1.1322603446746753E-4,1.1331987871879493E-4,1.1441631500884443E-4,1.136909385098958E-4,1.1382039289103549E-4,1.1394302159838122E-4,1.1481747575127518E-4,1.1421701267668919E-4,1.1901847890918505E-4,1.1303402882173737E-4,1.130370527467202E-4,1.133234314806277E-4,1.1573209448744601E-4,1.1357183014624046E-4,1.2190973879679696E-4,1.1389129094503403E-4,1.1315706127883606E-4,1.1367935571054069E-4,1.1304367507566038E-4,1.1311047557047705E-4,1.1276975483828479E-4,1.1279901251541283E-4,1.1305290938378236E-4,1.1424537802558428E-4,1.1366484925031448E-4,1.1321545021014017E-4,1.1459113664384275E-4,1.1325890291859377E-4,1.1702193384080743E-4,1.1530109219374137E-4,1.1282704923651311E-4,1.130764039151734E-4,1.1303718475812282E-4,1.1621847604876396E-4,1.130780862764931E-4,1.1278899854068263E-4,1.1402701921315907E-4,1.1310721218969715E-4,1.2163437590586628E-4,1.1301399714998828E-4,1.1282574445641552E-4,1.1336445427183953E-4,1.1448893438223855E-4,1.1335695456836176E-4,1.128048714414551E-4,1.1306752030771612E-4,1.1277111880843163E-4,1.1538040875793883E-4,1.137425890598802E-4,1.135003006918021E-4,1.1340103954914688E-4,1.1381440436442198E-4,1.1276700473916826E-4,1.1340341694881887E-4,1.1524274508948226E-4,1.1296908947540707E-4,1.1576501557929408E-4,1.132677682709082E-4,1.1415425862138866E-4,0.03817165211462751,1.1273164896193289E-4,1.1287138758329645E-4]}}

I have no clue what this was supposed to represent.","finished_norm":["i","find","the","pace","to","be","glacial","and","the","origin","stori","blow","wai","out","of","proport","to","the","content","my","wife","sleep","through","much","of","it","and","i","do","not","try","to","wake","her","becaus","i","feel","she","be","not","miss","anythingbr","br","when","holm","and","watson","enter","the","hous","and","then","be","potenti","catch","it","be","unclear","how","thei","can","hide","all","of","their","entri","and","burglari","tool","so","quickli","it","be","conjur","unclear","how","the","door","to","the","studi","be","lock","prevent","the","servant","from","get","inbr","br","the","thing","that","puzzl","me","be","right","at","the","end","when","there","be","a","glint","in","the","ey","of","the","break","statut","i","have","no","clue","what","thi","be","suppos","to","repres"],"filtered":["find","pace","glacial","origin","stori","blow","wai","proport","content","wife","sleep","much","try","wake","becaus","feel","miss","anythingbr","br","holm","watson","enter","hous","potenti","catch","unclear","thei","hide","entri","burglari","tool","quickli","conjur","unclear","door","studi","lock","prevent","servant","get","inbr","br","thing","puzzl","right","end","glint","ey","break","statut","clue","thi","suppos","repres"],"filtered2":["find","pace","glacial","origin","stori","blow","wai","proport","content","wife","sleep","try","wake","becaus","feel","miss","anythingbr","holm","watson","enter","hous","potenti","catch","unclear","hide","entri","burglari","tool","quickli","conjur","unclear","door","studi","lock","prevent","servant","get","inbr","thing","puzzl","right","end","glint","ey","break","statut","clue","suppos","repres"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,17,22,24,29,33,36,38,39,43,69,121,149,213,255,263,281,360,512,546,547,707,732,754,771,838,1038,1142,1170,1171,1318,1349,1375,1651,2305,2535,2565,2800,3295,3443,4519,4809,5281,7482,8602],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,17,22,24,29,33,36,38,39,43,69,121,149,213,255,263,281,360,512,546,547,707,732,754,771,838,1038,1142,1170,1171,1318,1349,1375,1651,2305,2535,2565,2800,3295,3443,4519,4809,5281,7482,8602],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,2.127032521151058,2.2190595059394194,2.3253197803590226,2.8432628718938773,2.6754694156628323,2.902686292364678,2.832333801361687,3.028335462059722,3.369778711402955,3.4572130107926293,3.432149042129413,3.6375061693251913,3.7099788181381825,3.7465885637507435,3.7264536553416874,3.9363956947973615,4.165705761027235,4.263079925052412,4.2860694432771105,4.297765483040301,4.436351646326448,4.470719289830655,4.390138803171316,4.646072177308517,5.089758498236879,5.274680836730892,5.274680836730892,5.322690055917252,5.626901430320244,6.255510089742618,5.967828017290836,12.202718819830718,6.214688095222362,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.23483003277409E-5,7.186043882497906E-5,7.241908521438324E-5,7.200064696850819E-5,7.200182661804508E-5,7.190118245314729E-5,7.211502664405092E-5,7.187078625861968E-5,7.203237798613812E-5,0.11510370987413163,0.23074632754911253,7.175477096384019E-5,0.07805291979026938,7.413674069694349E-5,7.180709379428844E-5,7.160864996888478E-5,7.339483816728723E-5,7.212178327770041E-5,7.18980257260357E-5,7.195761640611128E-5,7.265384854883097E-5,7.219323771469057E-5,7.227544066800696E-5,0.10051649604411321,7.290858382694272E-5,7.252729245886499E-5,7.557620205223124E-5,7.177610299933085E-5,7.177802317817692E-5,7.195987239399298E-5,7.348936263573885E-5,7.211760443622635E-5,7.741213915590067E-5,7.232046061535642E-5,7.18542280595895E-5,7.218588268887932E-5,7.178222832744976E-5,7.182464634303627E-5,7.160829020123753E-5,7.162686869542158E-5,7.178809207182656E-5,0.09352921805172483,7.217667115148474E-5,7.189130476994823E-5,7.276485950553978E-5,7.191889704556715E-5,0.18275523549803863,7.321567810597057E-5,7.16446718879861E-5,7.180301099423093E-5,7.177810700482745E-5,7.379821275287649E-5,7.180407928614818E-5,7.162050986623395E-5,0.19401501900396056,7.182257411082953E-5,7.723728495113012E-5,7.176338297731891E-5,7.164384335845695E-5,7.198592168302597E-5,7.269996152630171E-5,7.198115940484394E-5,7.163058908726693E-5,7.179736994320846E-5,7.160915631618334E-5,7.326604376966259E-5,7.222603558303426E-5,7.20721835524202E-5,7.200915317056688E-5,7.227163798037824E-5,7.160654390059247E-5,7.201066280873076E-5,7.317862795559843E-5,7.173486680471319E-5,7.351026738189334E-5,7.192452650465552E-5,7.248744391428219E-5,7.204443254539408E-5,7.158409314010096E-5,7.167282653998529E-5]}}
{"value":"Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show.<br /><br />Mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. Over and over again the same footage. How boring this is.<br /><br />The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.<br /><br />I have seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would.

{"value":"Dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti all of whom were superb.<br /><br />But then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too. Pyare Mohan is one such movie.<br /><br />Though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh. Comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb.<br /><br />If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please don't watch this. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.<br /><br />In short, the movie is worth a miss.","finished_norm":["dil","be","a","memor","movi","that","bring","to","the","celluloid","a","great","director","like","indra","kumar","the","movi","follow","with","beta","ishq","raja","masti","all","of","whom","be","superbbr","br","but","then","everi","success","director","give","a","few","horribl","movi","alongwith","some","hit","too","pyar","mohan","be","on","such","moviebr","br","though","the","comedi","be","tell","nice","but","then","thei","fail","the","viewer","to","laugh","compar","with","the","kind","of","comedi","movi","be","make","todai","thi","be","a","dumbbr","br","if","you","realli","want","to","watch","a","movi","and","laugh","pleas","do","not","watch","thi","becaus","the","pathet","comedi","will","make","you","cry","onlybr","br","in","short","the","movi","be","worth","a","miss"],"filtered":["dil","memor","movi","bring","celluloid","great","director","like","indra","kumar","movi","follow","beta","ishq","raja","masti","superbbr","br","everi","success","director","give","horribl","movi","alongwith","hit","pyar","mohan","moviebr","br","though","comedi","tell","nice","thei","fail","viewer","laugh","compar","kind","comedi","movi","make","todai","thi","dumbbr","br","realli","want","watch","movi","laugh","pleas","watch","thi","becaus","pathet","comedi","make","cry","onlybr","br","short","movi","worth","miss"],"filtered2":["dil","memor","bring","celluloid","great","director","like","indra","kumar","follow","beta","ishq","raja","masti","superbbr","everi","success","director","give","horribl","alongwith","hit","pyar","mohan","moviebr","though","comedi","tell","nice","fail","viewer","laugh","compar","kind","comedi","make","todai","dumbbr","realli","want","watch","laugh","pleas","watch","becaus","pathet","comedi","make","cry","onlybr","short","worth","miss"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,13,22,30,37,51,58,85,86,90,122,127,133,215,219,230,250,255,260,262,272,279,346,388,465,482,532,601,789,856,1074,2595,3441,5891],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,13,22,30,37,51,58,85,86,90,122,127,133,215,219,230,250,255,260,262,272,279,346,388,465,482,532,601,789,856,1074,2595,3441,5891],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.7139899308309823,3.731402629253362,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,2.2489347673732487,7.30790381132591,4.642472950759303,2.605934685587711,2.5792094178355414,2.7121382192999195,2.6812935439488212,2.6754694156628323,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.8028805344481915,2.7910771187233068,3.023389038124396,3.0914425013694116,3.2681460658591432,3.3154667220492153,3.4446025032006995,3.506637894120152,3.8059428063999263,3.900174431363043,4.110553940952155,5.185068678041204,5.907203395474402,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1273523846051517E-4,1.1197503839222864E-4,1.1284553754202608E-4,1.1219351482392447E-4,1.1219535298834907E-4,1.1203852630578688E-4,1.1237174458107057E-4,1.1199116206609032E-4,1.1224295902403561E-4,1.245274359354541E-4,0.7765153330798809,1.1181038363919177E-4,1.138972690033752E-4,1.1552203857304189E-4,1.1189191460454675E-4,1.1158269362939523E-4,0.04957801071626149,1.1238227296532032E-4,1.120336074012367E-4,1.1212646334253611E-4,1.1321135263886812E-4,1.1249361535977404E-4,1.1262170640686569E-4,1.1274304366396834E-4,1.1360828860270062E-4,1.1301414923648943E-4,0.1099050677393217,1.1184362384106235E-4,1.1184661591992417E-4,1.1212997868886291E-4,1.1451327513598258E-4,0.05542414528438465,1.206258602889773E-4,1.1269185780609593E-4,1.1196536059587349E-4,1.1248215454334908E-4,1.1185316850656252E-4,1.11919265499588E-4,1.115821330289206E-4,1.1161108258215941E-4,1.1186230556462188E-4,1.130422158589483E-4,1.1246780085625397E-4,1.1202313461080804E-4,1.1338433315975948E-4,1.1206612970201923E-4,1.1578953069332686E-4,1.140868118937694E-4,1.1163882403772959E-4,1.1188555266603562E-4,1.1184674654106375E-4,1.1499453442536936E-4,1.1188721730975898E-4,1.1160117406846178E-4,1.1282615666744781E-4,1.1191603648673054E-4,1.2035339735092163E-4,1.1182380313057926E-4,1.1163753299877476E-4,1.121705694532286E-4,1.1328320722961508E-4,1.121631487320225E-4,1.116168798055904E-4,1.1187676261527692E-4,1.1158348263457143E-4,1.141652931446187E-4,1.1254472195788308E-4,1.1230498522211541E-4,1.1220676943686129E-4,1.126157809477371E-4,1.1157941189215922E-4,1.1220912179921982E-4,1.1402907926538312E-4,1.1177936839605027E-4,1.1454584952310718E-4,1.1207490168988703E-4,1.1295205606836393E-4,1.1226174279098107E-4,1.1154442846025874E-4,1.116826954402715E-4]}}
{"value":"This film is just a kids against evil genre. Thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it, but are almost incidental in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a ploy to pull in the public. It was interesting to note what the film makers view of future London will be and how the World all fits together.<br /><br />The best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by Lady Penelope which are highly comical. These provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the TV series.<br /><br />Having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a 'fun' way and so may just be worth watching.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","just","a","kid","against","evil","genr","thunderbird","be","just","the","hook","to","get","peopl","to","see","it","but","be","almost","incident","in","us","the","fact","that","the","action","take","place","on","traci","island","be","just","a","ploi","to","pull","in","the","public","it","be","interest","to","note","what","the","film","maker","view","of","futur","london","will","be","and","how","the","world","all","fit","togetherbr","br","the","well","part","of","thi","film","be","some","of","the","line","deliv","by","ladi","penelop","which","be","highli","comic","thi","provid","some","light","relief","for","that","expect","a","rerun","of","the","tv","seriesbr","br","have","sai","that","it","pass","or","so","minut","in","a","fun","wai","and","so","mai","just","be","worth","watch"],"filtered":["thi","film","kid","evil","genr","thunderbird","hook","get","peopl","see","almost","incident","us","fact","action","take","place","traci","island","ploi","pull","public","interest","note","film","maker","view","futur","london","world","fit","togetherbr","br","well","part","thi","film","line","deliv","ladi","penelop","highli","comic","thi","provid","light","relief","expect","rerun","tv","seriesbr","br","sai","pass","minut","fun","wai","mai","worth","watch"],"filtered2":["kid","evil","genr","thunderbird","hook","get","peopl","see","almost","incident","us","fact","action","take","place","traci","island","ploi","pull","public","interest","note","maker","view","futur","london","world","fit","togetherbr","well","part","line","deliv","ladi","penelop","highli","comic","provid","light","relief","expect","rerun","tv","seriesbr","pass","minut","fun","wai","mai","worth","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,20,23,31,33,46,56,59,60,61,97,107,114,129,130,131,164,165,172,219,259,312,321,353,467,472,480,487,517,544,560,676,694,720,762,780,844,896,1092,1748,1972,2449,2494,3187,3418,3980,4774,4868,8081],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,20,23,31,33,46,56,59,60,61,97,107,114,129,130,131,164,165,172,219,259,312,321,353,467,472,480,487,517,544,560,676,694,720,762,780,844,896,1092,1748,1972,2449,2494,3187,3418,3980,4774,4868,8081],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.0545557924622586,2.1439533986393955,2.4433074195966826,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,2.5001408943598484,2.5792094178355414,2.7464553122240485,2.8824835850471584,3.09496984188738,3.0266839340212486,3.342254038012865,3.4222967456864013,3.43462735814388,3.3220965805878846,3.4198487640477615,3.4222967456864013,3.4623020803001006,3.6105180246075443,3.6715125373103863,4.072271754381138,3.749984152751882,3.7775721092707104,3.8690435127678695,3.8844878351953436,4.550761997504193,4.751432692966343,4.9227044135737135,6.389041482367141,5.672363804397,5.501738287366237,5.626901430320244,5.878215858601149,6.0662680901040895,6.2980697041614135,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.442046473187895E-5,0.08173614902119265,7.449327700440026E-5,7.406285405626538E-5,7.406406749274363E-5,7.396054072721747E-5,7.418050973817098E-5,7.392927393984889E-5,7.409549389808251E-5,0.10804010599155191,0.5608691497299871,7.380993579210549E-5,7.518756164153395E-5,7.626012872976662E-5,7.386375722730725E-5,7.365962967154144E-5,7.549697699306155E-5,7.418745989199547E-5,7.395729358668186E-5,7.401859103368233E-5,7.47347643147097E-5,0.06278048387011355,0.18098915089781592,7.442561721903598E-5,7.499679559526228E-5,7.460458346751284E-5,7.774081842860975E-5,7.383187880925587E-5,7.383385398491923E-5,7.402091163645842E-5,7.559420878480838E-5,7.418316136220096E-5,7.962933953905233E-5,7.43918276481566E-5,7.391224148903296E-5,7.425339520695608E-5,7.383817957600754E-5,7.388181250751597E-5,7.365925959960633E-5,7.367837020987545E-5,7.384421126686432E-5,7.462311122436478E-5,7.424391983724187E-5,7.395038013227857E-5,7.48489547925948E-5,7.397876269227331E-5,7.64367096123333E-5,7.531268551746118E-5,7.369668331271767E-5,7.385955748970028E-5,7.383394021249141E-5,7.591190483496791E-5,7.386065637910874E-5,7.367182925423237E-5,7.448048301280791E-5,7.387968092345442E-5,7.94494772462217E-5,7.381879446663495E-5,7.36958310528536E-5,7.404770701640498E-5,7.478219803738178E-5,7.404280833939551E-5,7.368219715935264E-5,7.385375487047125E-5,7.366015052139008E-5,7.536449372969991E-5,7.429469814053992E-5,7.413643955579951E-5,7.407160388877621E-5,7.434160665930059E-5,7.365746328227782E-5,7.407315676525327E-5,7.527457419492023E-5,7.37894615478507E-5,7.561571227441175E-5,7.39

{"value":"Spoilers... if such a thing is possible... . . . . . . . As a rabid Robin Williams fan, I felt it necessary to buy this film as first on-screen appearance. Wow... I could not imagine a more mind-numbing movie. Essentially, the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit.<br /><br />I'm all for bawdy humor, but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar, or ribald... it was just mind-numbing. There are no redeeming qualities to this film, other than Robin Williams fanatics, like me, who simply have to own every piece of film.","finished_norm":["spoiler","if","such","a","thing","be","possibl","a","a","rabid","robin","william","fan","i","feel","it","necessari","to","bui","thi","film","a","onscreen","appear","wow","i","can","not","imagin","a","much","mindnumb","movi","essenti","the","movi","take","on","bad","joke","after","anoth","that","your","uncl","arti","would","tell","you","after","dinner","and","dramat","them","robin","william","plai","a","lawyer","in","a","sec","skitbr","br","i","be","all","for","bawdi","humor","but","thi","humor","be","not","pleasantli","vulgar","or","ribald","it","be","just","mindnumb","there","be","no","redeem","qualiti","to","thi","film","other","than","robin","william","fanat","like","me","who","simpli","have","to","own","everi","piec","of","film"],"filtered":["spoiler","thing","possibl","rabid","robin","william","fan","feel","necessari","bui","thi","film","onscreen","appear","wow","imagin","much","mindnumb","movi","essenti","movi","take","bad","joke","anoth","uncl","arti","tell","dinner","dramat","robin","william","plai","lawyer","sec","skitbr","br","bawdi","humor","thi","humor","pleasantli","vulgar","ribald","mindnumb","redeem","qualiti","thi","film","robin","william","fanat","like","simpli","everi","piec","film"],"filtered2":["spoiler","thing","possibl","rabid","robin","william","fan","feel","necessari","bui","onscreen","appear","wow","imagin","mindnumb","essenti","take","bad","joke","anoth","uncl","arti","tell","dinner","dramat","robin","william","plai","lawyer","sec","skitbr","bawdi","humor","humor","pleasantli","vulgar","ribald","mindnumb","redeem","qualiti","robin","william","fanat","like","simpli","everi","piec"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,9,29,31,40,43,73,85,90,140,169,201,214,218,319,340,347,369,402,490,634,719,756,1003,1197,1627,1670,1769,1971,2419,2753,3158,3208,3248,5674,5680,6737],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,9,29,31,40,43,73,85,90,140,169,201,214,218,319,340,347,369,402,490,634,719,756,1003,1197,1627,1670,1769,1971,2419,2753,3158,3208,3248,5674,5680,6737],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.0683570856722073,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.8950689206770979,2.011190219103739,2.0477128419653545,2.317169775997098,2.4214486257841834,2.561435818751577,2.7303758068497004,2.5940874818617203,2.9056060024680126,2.948928684455311,3.0151989841543516,6.243658221875298,3.084424928710765,3.3490645070153917,3.5119855004467477,11.57284445083274,3.7636829971100436,4.035401218572811,4.240607069200353,14.83478265107527,4.9227044135737135,4.724033718778229,5.116075806554253,5.259176650194926,5.390512652256013,5.521540914662417,5.521540914662417,5.521540914662417,12.685042933464494,6.2980697041614135,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.80716924990058E-5,7.754523682481325E-5,7.814807709793188E-5,7.769653667592069E-5,7.769780964619758E-5,7.758920363530134E-5,7.781996479816621E-5,7.755640283222027E-5,7.773077789844924E-5,0.07244033788078899,0.27131817574643174,7.7431209698751E-5,7.887642482986787E-5,0.19442953370707294,7.748767172910871E-5,7.72735292372318E-5,7.920102076280063E-5,7.782725594145806E-5,7.758579718308003E-5,7.765010201442495E-5,7.840141229411501E-5,7.790436305810233E-5,7.799306899403662E-5,7.807709777824422E-5,7.867629939182564E-5,7.826484449507976E-5,8.155494987630166E-5,7.74542292874305E-5,7.745630136945225E-5,7.765253647095515E-5,7.930302295498977E-5,7.782274651656367E-5,8.353612588673843E-5,7.804165041847736E-5,7.75385347328017E-5,7.789642618452193E-5,7.74608391833256E-5,7.750661284012592E-5,7.727314100877309E-5,7.729318922660905E-5,7.746716680188479E-5,0.12074969436840079,7.788648593282762E-5,7.757854453976176E-5,7.852120520199162E-5,7.76083196090821E-5,0.3352083177418819,7.900768755176659E-5,7.731240080959166E-5,7.748326594335866E-5,7.745639182753423E-5,7.963630585540652E-5,7.748441874664063E-5,7.728632735763987E-5,7.813465540564562E-5,7.75043766759742E-5,8.334743916368946E-5,7.744050299887086E-5,7.731150673602901E-5,7.768064648976676E-5,7.845117321705309E-5,7.767550747314663E-5,7.729720393444336E-5,7.747717863517308E-5,7.727407564109219E-5,7.906203758612067E-5,7.793975552869737E-5,7.777373243803683E-5,7.770571579399882E-5,7.798896548009262E-5,7.727125656026007E-5,7.770734485792957E-5,7.89677064059236E-5,7.740973094411854E-5,7.932558145195721E-5,7.76143944083088E-5,7.822184357722672E-5,7.774378608024727E-5,7.724702974551084E-5,7.734278274425135E-5]}}
