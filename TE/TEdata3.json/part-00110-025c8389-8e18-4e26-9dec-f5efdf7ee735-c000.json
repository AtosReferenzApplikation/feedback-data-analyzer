{"value":"I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was... well pretty boring. For about 50min we have the outline of the plot... In War of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real action! This is something like:\"Let's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets!\". And maybe deliver a message, like \"Don't kill elephants!\". Very ecological. I would have expected this out of a \"new\" Steven Segal movie, not from this... The leading actress makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just doesn't look like a 19 century woman! And in the bar, where they seek up our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years. Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900.. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions. The movie stank. Way too long and increasingly boring. don't watch it! Don't buy it! It's a waste of your money!","finished_norm":["i","give","star","onli","for","the","beauti","pictur","of","africa","the","rest","be","good","pretti","bore","for","about","min","we","have","the","outlin","of","the","plot","in","war","of","the","world","the","introductori","part","last","oh","about","min","then","be","real","action","thi","be","someth","likelet","take","a","walk","in","the","savanna","and","gasp","at","the","beauti","sunset","and","mayb","deliv","a","messag","like","do","not","kill","eleph","veri","ecolog","i","would","have","expect","thi","out","of","a","new","steven","segal","movi","not","from","thi","the","lead","actress","make","me","think","about","artifici","suntan","dye","hair","and","too","much","foundat","and","i","do","not","see","on","scene","where","her","hair","be","mess","up","or","she","sweat","or","her","cloth","be","dusti","she","just","doe","not","look","like","a","centuri","woman","and","in","the","bar","where","thei","seek","up","our","hero","swayz","make","a","comment","about","the","command","that","he","look","like","dracula","hmmm","bram","stoker","write","hi","book","and","publish","it","in","and","it","becom","famou","in","the","next","year","livingston","and","other","explor","go","to","central","africa","from","to","so","unless","the","action","take","place","between","and","houston","we","have","a","problem","swayz","make","a","nice","impress","a","a","nutshel","hard","on","the","outsid","but","soft","and","cuddli","on","the","insid","not","that","i","would","cuddl","with","a","nut","but","you","get","the","point","he","realli","manag","to","have","that","beat","puppi","look","on","hi","face","on","sever","occas","the","movi","stink","wai","too","long","and","increasingli","bore","do","not","watch","it","do","not","bui","it","it","a","wast","of","your","monei"],"filtered":["give","star","onli","beauti","pictur","africa","rest","good","pretti","bore","min","outlin","plot","war","world","introductori","part","last","oh","min","real","action","thi","someth","likelet","take","walk","savanna","gasp","beauti","sunset","mayb","deliv","messag","like","kill","eleph","veri","ecolog","expect","thi","new","steven","segal","movi","thi","lead","actress","make","think","artifici","suntan","dye","hair","much","foundat","see","scene","hair","mess","sweat","cloth","dusti","doe","look","like","centuri","woman","bar","thei","seek","hero","swayz","make","comment","command","look","like","dracula","hmmm","bram","stoker","write","hi","book","publish","becom","famou","next","year","livingston","explor","go","central","africa","unless","action","take","place","houston","problem","swayz","make","nice","impress","nutshel","hard","outsid","soft","cuddli","insid","cuddl","nut","get","point","realli","manag","beat","puppi","look","hi","face","sever","occas","movi","stink","wai","long","increasingli","bore","watch","bui","wast","monei"],"filtered2":["give","star","onli","beauti","pictur","africa","rest","good","pretti","bore","min","outlin","plot","war","world","introductori","part","last","oh","min","real","action","someth","likelet","take","walk","savanna","gasp","beauti","sunset","mayb","deliv","messag","like","kill","eleph","veri","ecolog","expect","new","steven","segal","lead","actress","make","think","artifici","suntan","dye","hair","foundat","see","scene","hair","mess","sweat","cloth","dusti","doe","look","like","centuri","woman","bar","seek","hero","swayz","make","comment","command","look","like","dracula","hmmm","bram","stoker","write","book","publish","becom","famou","next","year","livingston","explor","go","central","africa","unless","action","take","place","houston","problem","swayz","make","nice","impress","nutshel","hard","outsid","soft","cuddli","insid","cuddl","nut","get","point","realli","manag","beat","puppi","look","face","sever","occas","stink","wai","long","increasingli","bore","watch","bui","wast","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,30,31,32,33,53,57,61,65,66,70,76,78,80,87,89,99,100,108,115,126,129,130,144,151,157,163,164,165,167,171,226,234,251,262,280,294,297,311,314,316,325,345,347,355,375,407,418,460,517,569,678,791,813,865,879,890,1070,1163,1194,1230,1238,1263,1291,1409,1772,1826,1990,2129,2145,2411,2418,2631,3221,3624,3625,3647,3720,3818,3962,4040,4615,4874,5307,5924,6359,6739,6939],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,7,11,12,13,15,16,18,19,30,31,32,33,53,57,61,65,66,70,76,78,80,87,89,99,100,108,115,126,129,130,144,151,157,163,164,165,167,171,226,234,251,262,280,294,297,311,314,316,325,345,347,355,375,407

{"value":"Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one time military man who has retreated into a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he?s going to hang it up. Things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery. Its Dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death. Jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair. What a stupid movie. Watchable in a I can?t believe people made this sort of way, this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget, fake breakaway sets and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye. Watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school (don?t ask) they crash into the security turret (don?t ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school) and smash its barely constructed form apart(it doesn't look like it did in earlier shots). What hath the gods of bad movies wrought? Actually I?m perplexed since this was directed (?) by Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made films like The Boys in Company C.

{"value":"I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool and I've been wanting to see a really kick-butt Viking movie for awhile now... alas, this film was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead, was delivered a boring Nordic soap-opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time. The film's premise is intriguing enough: It's about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane, and violent lifetime after lifetime. The movie is filmed competently enough, with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore... I mean, we are talking about \"Berserkers\" here, aren't we? Vikings were supposed to be BAD enough, what with all the raping and pillaging, so aren't Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme? All in all, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc...) or, are yourself, in fact, an insane Berserker who likes self torture, I'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid.","finished_norm":["i","have","no","background","knowledg","of","thi","movi","befor","i","bui","it","but","it","sound","cool","and","i","have","be","want","to","see","a","realli","kickbutt","vike","movi","for","awhil","now","ala","thi","film","be","not","what","i","be","look","for","i","have","hope","for","the","well","but","instead","be","deliv","a","bore","nordic","soapopera","that","seem","to","drag","on","too","long","despit","it","minut","run","time","the","film","premis","be","intrigu","enough","it","about","a","vike","warlord","who","defi","hi","god","and","odin","be","so","enrag","that","he","curs","the","warlord","son","name","barek","to","death","and","rebirth","a","a","berserk","thi","barek","gui","be","then","forc","to","live","enrag","insan","and","violent","lifetim","after","lifetim","the","movi","be","film","compet","enough","with","some","rich","cinematographi","and","quasigood","perform","by","the","actor","but","again","i","find","myself","bore","and","question","when","thi","dribbl","would","end","the","filmmak","have","a","chanc","to","make","someth","rather","entertain","and","semiuniqu","but","thei","drop","the","ball","perhap","it","can","have","be","improv","with","some","cheap","exploit","tactic","throw","in","such","a","gratuit","nuditi","and","lot","of","gore","i","mean","we","be","talk","about","berserk","here","be","not","we","vike","be","suppos","to","be","bad","enough","what","with","all","the","rape","and","pillag","so","be","not","berserk","suppos","to","be","even","much","extrem","all","in","all","unless","you","re","a","fan","of","the","young","and","restless","etc","or","be","yourself","in","fact","a","insan","berserk","who","like","self","tortur","i","have","probabl","steer","clear","of","thi","drab","piec","of","celluloid"],"filtered":["background","knowledg","thi","movi","befor","bui","sound","cool","want","see","realli","kickbutt","vike","movi","awhil","ala","thi","film","look","hope","well","instead","deliv","bore","nordic","soapopera","seem","drag","long","despit","minut","run","time","film","premis","intrigu","enough","vike","warlord","defi","hi","god","odin","enrag","curs","warlord","son","name","barek","death","rebirth","berserk","thi","barek","gui","forc","live","enrag","insan","violent","lifetim","lifetim","movi","film","compet","enough","rich","cinematographi","quasigood","perform","actor","find","bore","question","thi","dribbl","end","filmmak","chanc","make","someth","rather","entertain","semiuniqu","thei","drop","ball","perhap","improv","cheap","exploit","tactic","throw","gratuit","nuditi","lot","gore","mean","talk","berserk","vike","suppos","bad","enough","rape","pillag","berserk","suppos","even","much","extrem","unless","re","fan","young","restless","etc","fact","insan","berserk","like","self","tortur","probabl","steer","clear","thi","drab","piec","celluloid"],"filtered2":["background","knowledg","befor","bui","sound","cool","want","see","realli","kickbutt","vike","awhil","ala","look","hope","well","instead","deliv","bore","nordic","soapopera","seem","drag","long","despit","minut","run","time","premis","intrigu","enough","vike","warlord","defi","god","odin","enrag","curs","warlord","son","name","barek","death","rebirth","berserk","barek","gui","forc","live","enrag","insan","violent","lifetim","lifetim","compet","enough","rich","cinematographi","quasigood","perform","actor","find","bore","question","dribbl","end","filmmak","chanc","make","someth","rather","entertain","semiuniqu","drop","ball","perhap","improv","cheap","exploit","tactic","throw","gratuit","nuditi","lot","gore","mean","talk","berserk","vike","suppos","bad","enough","rape","pillag","berserk","suppos","even","extrem","unless","re","fan","young","restless","etc","fact","insan","berserk","like","self","tortur","probabl","steer","clear","drab","piec","celluloid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,9,13,16,20,24,35,37,38,41,53,55,59,68,72,79,88,93,97,99,105,108,116,135,137,140,143,148,149,152,160,178,181,186,195,218,245,310,318,323,329,338,347,351,352,358,378,391,429,434,460,481,484,486,517,590,612,629,746,764,801,802,904,918,937,966,1017,1108,1117,1285,1309,1321,1361,1559,1566,1631,2041,2602,3048,3286,3693,3792,4018,5113,5566,6002,6313,7606,8332],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,9,13,16,20,24,35,37,38,41,53,55,59,68,72,79,88,93,97,99,105,108,116,135,137,140,143,148,149,152,160,178,181,186,195,218,245,310,318,323,329,338,347,351,352,358,378,391,429,434,460,481,484,486,517,590,612,629,746,764,801,802,904,918,937,966,1017,1108,1117,1285,1309,1321,1361,1559,1566,1631,2041,

{"value":"There isn't more I can say that saying this film was awful. The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell. But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just laughable. That is like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino, etc, etc. It just isn't believable.<br /><br />The story is flat out hideous. It talked about Shin being from a Monastery in China - later identifying it from Bejing. However, the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on Mongolia. I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own, granted. But its a distinct nation and it even labels \"Mongolia\" on the map. Did Disney Studios fail 5th Grade Geography? <br /><br />The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him. Her training is just cheesy as well. And, lets cut to the chase: everything about this film is bad. Its bad enough to laugh at and cry over. The Taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances.<br /><br />The evil eyes thing was cheesy. However, the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it. They should have left the evil eyes ending in it. But instead somehow evil is defeated. Yey! <br /><br />Overall,not worth the time of the dog in the film. Brenda Song should get on with another studio.

{"value":"Now I get it. The title refers to each audience member's immediate post-reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying too hard to be terrifying, lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes The Screaming Skull more like A Snoring Dull. Albeit, the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie, but that's about it. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this! Remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning? That may be the funniest thing I have ever witnessed on screen. Sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director Alex Nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin, nailed shut, and buried alive for his lame effort. Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted, cranial receptacle. Also, her husband John comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker, but this doesn't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around! Ah, Mickeythe days before you could get a restraining order against estate caretakers like him. This guy's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue. Still, despite his strange persona, Mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and I can't get enough of a guy saying \"It was Mary!\" and

{"value":"This film should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it dragged on, had unlovable characters and had no target audience.<br /><br />Some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs (named, appropriately, Jinx). The space scenes are then long, repetitive (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view. Adults will be bored and cheesed out, kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it.<br /><br />There is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle -- this never takes off. Why it is included in the first place is unclear, except maybe to add extra tension between the characters - but it failed if that was the idea.<br /><br />A young Lea Thompson should be quirky and attractive, right? I mean, \"Back to the Future\" is great. But no, she was irritating and average-looking. Not someone you'd want to date, have as a friend or even consider as a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance. Maybe he can act like Mikey in the Life Cereal commercials, but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy. He doesn't fit in on screen and I don't think we can identify with him at home. I actually would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth.<br /><br />I don't recommend this film to

{"value":"What can I say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.<br /><br />The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne attempts (and fails) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is not handsome, nor charismatic nor charming, the character is left wholly unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... However, Adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two good actors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a 2, not a 1.<br /><br />The film itself is a poor version of the original, with such lows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the

{"value":"A truly, truly dire Canadian-German co-production, the ever-wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term \"problem child\" - a few uears prior to the \"action\" the child murdered her father, and mum took the fall for the offspring. Now she's moved up to the Northwest US to start over, but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother. So devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond.<br /><br />Unfortunately Mandy Schaeffer (as the daughter) murders more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie, though the incoherent script, useless direction and appalling music (check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini-clad bod) don't help any; we're supposed to find her sexy and scary, but she fails on both counts. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer don't really convince as mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette

{"value":"First, let's all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even decent, sometimes just plain lousy. However, in this piece of @*!^ called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank.<br /><br />First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some, which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor), gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped. Therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. Had some potential, but still pretty thin to begin with.<br /><br />Now, the acting. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was some of the WORST acting in the history of the art!!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. The jackasses playing the Clampets/Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere, especially talented ones who never get their big break!<br /><br />Finally, the action. The gunfighting is so-so at BEST, and the fist-fighting is deplorable. I've seen more real-looking fights at the Renaissance Festival (and those were pretty fake-looking)!<br /><br />Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS PIECE OF CACA AT ALL COSTS!

{"value":"TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />In late 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school at Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (Stephen Fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie).<br /><br />Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably Gordon Parry's superior 1951 version - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV's \"Where the Heart Is\") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions', and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old Pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is typical UK TV fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this. The UK publication 'Radio Times' described it as \"daintily odd\" and raised a querulous eyebrow over \"all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys\".

{"value":"I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some porno movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this ain't. With some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the utter crappiness of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. <br /><br />By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute worst thing I have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!","finished_norm":["i","be","recent","onlin","look","at","a","site","that","featur","public","domain","movi","in","their","long","list","of","film","be","thi","film","and","i","think","i","must","be","hallucin","at","such","a","offens","titl","and","premis","but","no","that","realli","what","it","be","and","sinc","the","film","be","onli","about","minut","long","i","decid","to","give","it","a","try","if","it","have","turn","out","to","be","some","porno","movi","i","would","have","stop","watch","instead","it","turn","out","to","be","the","much","bizarr","film","i","have","ever","see","the","danish","product","crow","try","with","a","budget","of","about","to","make","a","star","trekstyl","film","about","a","crow","of","veri","gai","man","travel","about","the","galaxi","wipe","out","femal","oppress","by","kill","all","the","womenlik","thei","proce","to","do","on","the","earth","and","in","everi","case","thei","be","meet","with","cheer","and","thank","from","the","now","gai","man","of","the","planetbr","br","subtl","thi","have","not","with","some","of","the","much","obscen","and","juvenil","name","of","charact","i","have","ever","hear","i","do","not","even","think","i","can","write","them","on","imdb","without","have","my","review","remov","howev","despit","the","utter","crappi","of","it","all","it","be","strang","watchabl","and","worth","a","peek","but","a","i","mention","alreadi","due","to","the","crude","name","and","odd","subject","matt","though","no","nuditi","it","a","film","for","adult","onli","br","br","by","the","wai","thi","movi","leav","me","with","question","a","to","who","would","make","thi","why","make","it","and","who","be","the","intend","audienc","it","mai","not","be","the","absolut","wrong","thing","i","have","ever","see","but","it","probabl","be","the","weird","and","possibli","the","much","offens"],"filtered":["recent","onlin","look","site","featur","public","domain","movi","long","list","film","thi","film","think","must","hallucin","offens","titl","premis","realli","sinc","film","onli","minut","long","decid","give","try","turn","porno","movi","stop","watch","instead","turn","much","bizarr","film","ever","see","danish","product","crow","try","budget","make","star","trekstyl","film","crow","veri","gai","man","travel","galaxi","wipe","femal","oppress","kill","womenlik","thei","proce","earth","everi","case","thei","meet","cheer","thank","gai","man","planetbr","br","subtl","thi","much","obscen","juvenil","name","charact","ever","hear","even","think","write","imdb","without","review","remov","howev","despit","utter","crappi","strang","watchabl","worth","peek","mention","alreadi","due","crude","name","odd","subject","matt","though","nuditi","film","adult","onli","br","br","wai","thi","movi","leav","question","make","thi","make","intend","audienc","mai","absolut","wrong","thing","ever","see","probabl","weird","possibli","much","offens"],"filtered2":["recent","onlin","look","site","featur","public","domain","long","list","think","must","hallucin","offens","titl","premis","realli","sinc","onli","minut","long","decid","give","try","turn","porno","stop","watch","instead","turn","bizarr","ever","see","danish","product","crow","try","budget","make","star","trekstyl","crow","veri","gai","man","travel","galaxi","wipe","femal","oppress","kill","womenlik","proce","earth","everi","case","meet","cheer","thank","gai","man","planetbr","subtl","obscen","juvenil","name","charact","ever","hear","even","think","write","imdb","without","review","remov","howev","despit","utter","crappi","strang","watchabl","worth","peek","mention","alreadi","due","crude","name","odd","subject","matt","though","nuditi","adult","onli","wai","leav","question","make","make","intend","audienc","mai","absolut","wrong","thing","ever","see","probabl","weird","possibli","offens"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,10,11,12,13,15,16,25,29,30,33,36,44,45,46,59,65,74,76,85,86,96,99,100,113,125,141,143,148,152,162,168,176,190,216,219,222,249,256,264,285,288,305,315,330,350,378,391,408,417,422,484,522,550,558,562,568,591,601,612,625,640,651,734,768,772,780,823,926,1024,1032,1077,1145,1178,1511,1527,1793,1878,2003,2183,2313,2552,2597,3488,3639,3724,4235,5407,6457,6929,7061],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,10,11,12,13,15,16,25,29,30,33,36,44,45,46,59,65,74,76,85,86,96,99,100,113,125,141,143,148,152,162,168,176,190,216,219,222,249,256,264,285,288,305,315,330,350,378,391,408,417,422,484,522,550,558,562,568,591,601,612,625,640,651,734,768,772,780,823,926,1024,1032,1077,1145,1178,1511,1527,1793,1878,2003,2183,2313,2552,2597,3

{"value":"Some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential. But it never comes together as anything more than a student's graduate thesis in film school.<br /><br />There are two primary reasons for this. Fist, there is not a single likable character, not even a villain we might admire for his/her chutzpah. Secondly, all the acting is awful - even from veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so plentiful here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up.<br /><br />All right, I'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as I said, the camera work is quite good.<br /><br />But I feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a \"Modern western\", and the DVD packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making.<br /><br />That betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we don't like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly muddled, and in the last analysis, we just don't care.<br /><br />I took it out of the DVD player about half way through. but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back.<br /><br />Now, that really

{"value":"This is shallow hedonism and/or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancée. Is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? All of the characters, except for Anne (Deborah Kerr) are vacuous and vile. Seberg is poor (I agree with the \"boys with breasts\" comment of an earlier review). The plot plodded. This predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see great gowns and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend \"To Catch a Thief\" - in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters. <br /><br />I like for films to entertain me. I personally don't really care where a film is set. Whatever the time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some enjoyable characters. It doesn't hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a typically good performance, and so does David Niven in a despicable role.<br /><br />The \"2\" rating is solely for Kerr and Niven, and for the cinematography - the rich color scenes and the murky, foreboding black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un-enjoyable characters. A sow's ear is still a sow's ear. Consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time.","finished_norm":["thi","be","shallow","hedon","andor","social","commentari","wrap","in","a","tragic","tale","about","a","jealou","young","woman","scheme","to","drive","apart","her","father","and","hi","fiancé","be","it","incest","or","just","a","view","through","the","ey","of","a","daughter","with","a","electra","complex","who","care","all","of","the","charact","except","for","ann","deborah","kerr","be","vacuou","and","vile","seberg","be","poor","i","agre","with","the","boi","with","breast","comment","of","a","earli","review","the","plot","plod","thi","predict","materi","be","suffici","for","about","minut","of","film","that","unfortun","be","stretch","over","a","hour","and","a","half","if","you","want","to","see","great","gown","and","jewel","on","the","riviera","i","recommend","to","catch","a","thief","in","which","you","will","get","the","add","bonu","of","a","entertain","stori","and","likabl","charact","br","br","i","like","for","film","to","entertain","me","i","person","do","not","realli","care","where","a","film","be","set","whatev","the","time","or","place","i","want","a","good","stori","comedi","or","drama","i","conjur","want","to","see","some","enjoy","charact","it","doe","not","hurt","if","i","can","relat","to","them","poor","deborah","kerr","give","a","typic","good","perform","and","so","doe","david","niven","in","a","despic","rolebr","br","the","rate","be","sole","for","kerr","and","niven","and","for","the","cinematographi","the","rich","color","scene","and","the","murki","forebod","black","and","white","scene","unfortun","all","the","great","cinematographi","in","the","world","cannot","salvag","a","poor","stori","with","unenjoy","charact","a","sow","ear","be","still","a","sow","ear","consequ","watch","thi","mess","be","a","seriou","wast","of","my","time"],"filtered":["thi","shallow","hedon","andor","social","commentari","wrap","tragic","tale","jealou","young","woman","scheme","drive","apart","father","hi","fiancé","incest","view","ey","daughter","electra","complex","care","charact","except","ann","deborah","kerr","vacuou","vile","seberg","poor","agre","boi","breast","comment","earli","review","plot","plod","thi","predict","materi","suffici","minut","film","unfortun","stretch","hour","half","want","see","great","gown","jewel","riviera","recommend","catch","thief","get","add","bonu","entertain","stori","likabl","charact","br","br","like","film","entertain","person","realli","care","film","set","whatev","time","place","want","good","stori","comedi","drama","conjur","want","see","enjoy","charact","doe","hurt","relat","poor","deborah","kerr","give","typic","good","perform","doe","david","niven","despic","rolebr","br","rate","sole","kerr","niven","cinematographi","rich","color","scene","murki","forebod","black","white","scene","unfortun","great","cinematographi","world","salvag","poor","stori","unenjoy","charact","sow","ear","still","sow","ear","consequ","watch","thi","mess","seriou","wast","time"],"filtered2":["shallow","hedon","andor","social","commentari","wrap","tragic","tale","jealou","young","woman","scheme","drive","apart","father","fiancé","incest","view","ey","daughter","electra","complex","care","charact","except","ann","deborah","kerr","vacuou","vile","seberg","poor","agre","boi","breast","comment","earli","review","plot","plod","predict","materi","suffici","minut","unfortun","stretch","hour","half","want","see","great","gown","jewel","riviera","recommend","catch","thief","get","add","bonu","entertain","stori","likabl","charact","like","entertain","person","realli","care","set","whatev","time","place","want","good","stori","comedi","drama","conjur","want","see","enjoy","charact","doe","hurt","relat","poor","deborah","kerr","give","typic","good","perform","doe","david","niven","despic","rolebr","rate","sole","kerr","niven","cinematographi","rich","color","scene","murki","forebod","black","white","scene","unfortun","great","cinematographi","world","salvag","poor","stori","unenjoy","charact","sow","ear","still","sow","ear","consequ","watch","mess","seriou","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,10,13,17,18,19,30,32,37,39,51,59,64,70,89,105,109,127,135,146,153,164,165,174,176,195,202,205,206,227,229,232,266,280,281,282,298,299,312,337,343,359,407,426,461,463,493,512,537,557,572,613,622,629,675,737,820,863,875,903,937,975,1150,1220,1287,1439,1457,1467,1472,1669,1788,1989,2078,2114,2306,2435,2440,3053,3494,3649,3735,3742,4017,4094,4171,4275,4729,4766,4939,5100,5219,5421,5530,6434,6789],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,10,13,17,1

{"value":"Sly Stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world but compared to his brother, Frank...well, roll out those awards now! Mullet haired, muppet Frank seems to think that every part he plays, calls for him doing the role as an American/Italian Wise-guy refugee from the 'Godfather.' Please, somebody make him an acting offer 'he can refuse!' This film just stinks the place out, even by the terrible overacting in this, Frank still steals the acting dishonours. All the people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms about, gesticulating wildly in a style that went out of fashion back with silent films.<br /><br />The plot, what there, is, makes no sense as a meteor lands and turns all the women into sex-crazed nymphets but as this is 15 certificate film, that just means they strip to their underwear and make moaning sounds like dogs on heat. What happens in the end, I'm not quite sure as I was losing the will to live long before the film finished.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague and watch 'Deep Impact' for a reasonable film about a meteor about to hit the earth.<br /><br />N.B. Point of order: when one of the female leads strips down to her underwear, she has her knickers/panties under her suspenders/garter belt, it's knickers over the suspenders to allow women to go to the toilet with less fuss. A trivial point, perhaps, but shows how dumb this film is when they can't even get this

{"value":"A wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue! No exaggeration - that's the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This TV mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes up.<br /><br />That alone makes this completely unwatchable, despite the fact it's one of the best filmed WWII 'global' dramas TV has ever produced. If you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /><br />I'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the film with their eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their \"selective memories\" and \"selective vision\". I'm a Boomer myself so don't think for a second I'm some hubristic young punk. 45 WILL ALWAYS LOOK 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit.<br /><br />The Winds Of War could have been... so good. How much more would we be talking about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, had an ACTUAL ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role? Right now, with the constant haggard old biddy distraction, that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.","finished_norm":["a","wonder","televis","miniseri","complet","ruin","by","a","year","old","woman","try","desper","to","pass","herself","off","a","a","year","old","ingenu","no","exagger","that","the","actual","ag","of","the","charact","plai","by","ali","macgraw","when","the","film","open","just","prior","to","the","surpris","attack","at","pearl","harbor","thi","tv","miniseri","realli","be","the","much","classic","exampl","of","the","titl","of","thi","post","and","on","i","refer","to","whenev","the","topic","come","upbr","br","that","alon","make","thi","complet","unwatch","despit","the","fact","it","on","of","the","well","film","wwii","global","drama","tv","have","ever","produc","if","you","have","the","stomach","or","a","decent","fastforward","abil","you","mai","be","abl","to","enjoi","the","late","robert","mitchum","in","a","veri","strong","perform","br","br","i","be","stun","at","some","of","the","comment","refer","to","the","love","stori","pun","intend","do","thei","watch","the","film","with","their","ey","close","or","be","thei","ag","boomer","who","never","ceas","to","amaz","me","with","their","select","memori","and","select","vision","i","be","a","boomer","myself","so","do","not","think","for","a","i","be","some","hubrist","young","punk","will","alwai","look","get","us","to","it","deal","with","it","ag","gracefulli","damnitbr","br","the","wind","of","war","can","have","be","so","good","how","much","much","would","we","be","talk","about","thi","miniseri","todai","some","year","late","have","a","actual","ingenu","be","cast","in","such","a","import","critic","role","right","now","with","the","constant","haggard","old","biddi","distract","that","alon","cancel","out","much","of","the","wonder","aspect","of","the","wind","of","war"],"filtered":["wonder","televis","miniseri","complet","ruin","year","old","woman","try","desper","pass","year","old","ingenu","exagger","actual","ag","charact","plai","ali","macgraw","film","open","prior","surpris","attack","pearl","harbor","thi","tv","miniseri","realli","much","classic","exampl","titl","thi","post","refer","whenev","topic","come","upbr","br","alon","make","thi","complet","unwatch","despit","fact","well","film","wwii","global","drama","tv","ever","produc","stomach","decent","fastforward","abil","mai","abl","enjoi","late","robert","mitchum","veri","strong","perform","br","br","stun","comment","refer","love","stori","pun","intend","thei","watch","film","ey","close","thei","ag","boomer","never","ceas","amaz","select","memori","select","vision","boomer","think","hubrist","young","punk","alwai","look","get","us","deal","ag","gracefulli","damnitbr","br","wind","war","good","much","much","talk","thi","miniseri","todai","year","late","actual","ingenu","cast","import","critic","role","right","constant","haggard","old","biddi","distract","alon","cancel","much","wonder","aspect","wind","war"],"filtered2":["wonder","televis","miniseri","complet","ruin","year","old","woman","try","desper","pass","year","old","ingenu","exagger","actual","ag","charact","plai","ali","macgraw","open","prior","surpris","attack","pearl","harbor","tv","miniseri","realli","classic","exampl","titl","post","refer","whenev","topic","come","upbr","alon","make","complet","unwatch","despit","fact","well","wwii","global","drama","tv","ever","produc","stomach","decent","fastforward","abil","mai","abl","enjoi","late","robert","mitchum","veri","strong","perform","stun","comment","refer","love","stori","pun","intend","watch","ey","close","ag","boomer","never","ceas","amaz","select","memori","select","vision","boomer","think","hubrist","young","punk","alwai","look","get","us","deal","ag","gracefulli","damnitbr","wind","war","good","talk","miniseri","todai","year","late","actual","ingenu","cast","import","critic","role","right","constant","haggard","old","biddi","distract","alon","cancel","wonder","aspect","wind","war"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,10,12,13,15,16,17,20,34,36,40,42,44,46,52,54,56,57,67,70,92,97,103,105,121,128,135,150,172,175,186,197,200,242,261,264,280,281,295,307,309,314,326,332,391,442,454,457,463,468,487,495,539,579,600,631,645,663,685,710,715,788,789,847,926,1009,1068,1223,1356,1458,1498,1510,1556,1825,1836,1883,2046,2073,2087,2598,2795,2822,2890,3031,3113,3172,3248,3252,4557,4593,4826,5476,6676,7124,8571],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,10,12,13,15,16,17,20,34,36,40,42,44,46,52,54,56,57,67,70,92,97,103,105,121,128,135,150,172,175,186,197,200,242,261,264,280,281,295,307,309,314,326,332,391,442,454,457,463,468,487,495,539,579,600,631,645,663,685,71

{"value":"This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts.<br /><br />It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I am not sure what the purpose of that was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.<br /><br />Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) whines incessantly.<br /><br />The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a video nasty! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortably undressed. Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman).<br /><br />Blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, \"They tore her heart out,\" which is hilarious if you see the

{"value":"The original \"Vanishing Point\" was a great flick. Subtle motives, characters that seemed real and spontaneous.The remake was terrible. Preachy, overtly obvious; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. The black Charger was cool, but even that couldn't rescue this flick. Why stick with a white Challenger? I didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his \"Dream Quest\". His Indian pal was standing next to him. Vigo was only wearing his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized, but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. It would promptly roll over about 30 times.

{"value":"Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning...which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself \"The Devil\" (hence the title). The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest. It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap. I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it. But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one.","finished_norm":["devil","hunter","gain","notorieti","for","the","fact","that","it","on","the","dpp","video","nasti","list","but","it","realli","ne","not","have","be","mani","film","on","the","list","where","there","for","god","and","dpp","onli","know","reason","and","while","thi","be","not","the","tame","of","the","bunch","there","be","not","a","lot","here","that","warrant","banningwhich","be","a","shame","becaus","i","never","would","have","sit","through","it","where","it","not","for","the","fact","that","it","on","the","shop","list","the","plot","actual","give","the","film","a","decent","base","or","at","littl","much","of","a","decent","base","than","much","cannib","film","and","it","follow","a","actress","who","be","kidnap","and","drag","off","into","the","amazon","jungl","a","hunter","be","then","hire","to","find","her","but","along","the","wai","he","have","to","brave","the","nativ","lead","by","a","man","who","call","himself","the","devil","henc","the","titl","the","film","basic","just","plod","along","for","eighti","five","minut","and","there","realli","be","not","mani","scene","of","interest","it","a","real","shame","that","jess","franco","end","up","make","film","like","thi","becaus","the","man","clearli","have","talent","a","see","by","film","such","a","the","diabol","dr","z","venu","in","fur","faceless","and","she","kill","in","ecstasi","but","unfortun","hi","good","film","be","just","gem","amongst","heap","of","crap","and","devil","hunter","be","veri","much","a","part","of","the","crap","i","see","thi","film","pure","becaus","i","want","to","be","abl","to","sai","i","have","see","everyth","on","the","dpp","list","just","two","much","to","go","and","i","be","guess","that","why","much","other","peopl","who","have","see","it","see","it","but","if","you","re","not","on","the","lookout","for","nasti","there","realli","be","no","reason","to","bother","with","thi","on"],"filtered":["devil","hunter","gain","notorieti","fact","dpp","video","nasti","list","realli","ne","mani","film","list","god","dpp","onli","know","reason","thi","tame","bunch","lot","warrant","banningwhich","shame","becaus","never","sit","fact","shop","list","plot","actual","give","film","decent","base","littl","much","decent","base","much","cannib","film","follow","actress","kidnap","drag","amazon","jungl","hunter","hire","find","along","wai","brave","nativ","lead","man","call","devil","henc","titl","film","basic","plod","along","eighti","five","minut","realli","mani","scene","interest","real","shame","jess","franco","end","make","film","like","thi","becaus","man","clearli","talent","see","film","diabol","dr","z","venu","fur","faceless","kill","ecstasi","unfortun","hi","good","film","gem","amongst","heap","crap","devil","hunter","veri","much","part","crap","see","thi","film","pure","becaus","want","abl","sai","see","everyth","dpp","list","two","much","go","guess","much","peopl","see","see","re","lookout","nasti","realli","reason","bother","thi"],"filtered2":["devil","hunter","gain","notorieti","fact","dpp","video","nasti","list","realli","ne","mani","list","god","dpp","onli","know","reason","tame","bunch","lot","warrant","banningwhich","shame","becaus","never","sit","fact","shop","list","plot","actual","give","decent","base","littl","decent","base","cannib","follow","actress","kidnap","drag","amazon","jungl","hunter","hire","find","along","wai","brave","nativ","lead","man","call","devil","henc","titl","basic","plod","along","eighti","five","minut","realli","mani","scene","interest","real","shame","jess","franco","end","make","like","becaus","man","clearli","talent","see","diabol","dr","z","venu","fur","faceless","kill","ecstasi","unfortun","good","gem","amongst","heap","crap","devil","hunter","veri","part","crap","see","pure","becaus","want","abl","see","everyth","dpp","list","two","go","guess","peopl","see","see","re","lookout","nasti","realli","reason","bother"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,11,13,14,15,19,22,23,24,26,30,32,33,37,38,42,45,47,50,52,59,60,61,68,72,76,80,95,97,110,142,157,193,227,240,243,244,260,264,276,286,309,313,324,334,352,355,419,454,494,496,504,574,601,726,739,764,1014,1052,1260,1365,1370,1411,1433,1729,1755,1936,2015,2090,2195,2262,2296,2348,2440,2811,3413,3456,3535,4067,4785,6042,6230,6276,6394,7337,8266],"values":[1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,11,13,14,15,19,22,23,24,26,30,32,33,37,38,42,45,47,50,52,59,60,61,68,72,76,80,95,97,110,142,157,193,227,240,243,244,260,264,276,286,309,313,324,334,352,355,419,454,494,496,504,574,601,726,739,764,1014,1052,1260,1365,1370,1411,1433,1729,1755,1936,2015,2090,2195,

{"value":"Oh man is this movie bad. It flows horribly. The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself, and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this, doesn't love himself. He tries getting out of the contract and horrible, painfully unfunny gags ensue. Jim Nabors seems as if he's sleepwalking, not acting. You'll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is downright scary, proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of, Burt's wig wasn't bad in this film. His worst \"wig day\" was in \"Smokey and the Bandit 2\". Anyhow, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie, ever, ever, right up there with \"Cannonball Run 2\". The original \"Smokey\" and \"Cannonball\" (and \"Hooper\" which, thankfully, had no sequel) are great, funny films. This one isn't. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You'll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate. And mind you, this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on. It's lousy, pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. And least I forget, \"Stroker Ace\" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in \"Boogie Nights\", another film that, like \"Deliverance\" years earlier, shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.","finished_norm":["oh","man","be","thi","movi","bad","it","flow","horribli","the","stori","be","about","a","race","car","driver","who","be","in","love","with","himself","and","then","have","to","promot","a","chicken","fast","food","chain","and","while","do","thi","doe","not","love","himself","he","try","get","out","of","the","contract","and","horribl","painfulli","unfunni","gag","ensu","jim","nabor","seem","a","if","he","sleepwalk","not","act","you","will","miss","such","burt","sidekick","a","dom","deluis","and","jerri","re","while","watch","thi","stinker","loni","anderson","hair","be","downright","scari","prove","that","ton","of","hairsprai","do","not","go","out","in","the","sixti","or","mayb","that","be","a","wig","speak","of","burt","wig","be","not","bad","in","thi","film","hi","wrong","wig","dai","be","in","smokei","and","the","bandit","anyhow","thi","movi","be","the","wrong","reynold","car","movi","ever","ever","right","up","there","with","cannonbal","run","the","origin","smokei","and","cannonbal","and","hooper","which","thankfulli","have","no","sequel","be","great","funni","film","thi","on","be","not","even","ned","beatti","who","be","a","great","actor","stink","you","will","long","for","a","jacki","gleason","typ","villain","who","be","fun","to","hate","and","mind","you","thi","be","not","on","of","that","fun","movi","to","bag","on","it","lousi","pure","and","simpl","even","the","outtak","at","the","end","be","tiresom","and","bore","and","wrong","of","all","unfunni","and","littl","i","forget","stroker","ac","be","on","of","the","heavi","nail","to","seal","burt","coffin","befor","hi","somewhatreviv","year","late","in","boogi","night","anoth","film","that","like","deliver","year","earli","show","that","the","man","can","act","quit","good","when","he","have","a","decent","platform","to","do","so"],"filtered":["oh","man","thi","movi","bad","flow","horribli","stori","race","car","driver","love","promot","chicken","fast","food","chain","thi","doe","love","try","get","contract","horribl","painfulli","unfunni","gag","ensu","jim","nabor","seem","sleepwalk","act","miss","burt","sidekick","dom","deluis","jerri","re","watch","thi","stinker","loni","anderson","hair","downright","scari","prove","ton","hairsprai","go","sixti","mayb","wig","speak","burt","wig","bad","thi","film","hi","wrong","wig","dai","smokei","bandit","anyhow","thi","movi","wrong","reynold","car","movi","ever","ever","right","cannonbal","run","origin","smokei","cannonbal","hooper","thankfulli","sequel","great","funni","film","thi","even","ned","beatti","great","actor","stink","long","jacki","gleason","typ","villain","fun","hate","mind","thi","fun","movi","bag","lousi","pure","simpl","even","outtak","end","tiresom","bore","wrong","unfunni","littl","forget","stroker","ac","heavi","nail","seal","burt","coffin","befor","hi","somewhatreviv","year","late","boogi","night","anoth","film","like","deliver","year","earli","show","man","act","quit","good","decent","platform"],"filtered2":["oh","man","bad","flow","horribli","stori","race","car","driver","love","promot","chicken","fast","food","chain","doe","love","try","get","contract","horribl","painfulli","unfunni","gag","ensu","jim","nabor","seem","sleepwalk","act","miss","burt","sidekick","dom","deluis","jerri","re","watch","stinker","loni","anderson","hair","downright","scari","prove","ton","hairsprai","go","sixti","mayb","wig","speak","burt","wig","bad","wrong","wig","dai","smokei","bandit","anyhow","wrong","reynold","car","ever","ever","right","cannonbal","run","origin","smokei","cannonbal","hooper","thankfulli","sequel","great","funni","even","ned","beatti","great","actor","stink","long","jacki","gleason","typ","villain","fun","hate","mind","fun","bag","lousi","pure","simpl","even","outtak","end","tiresom","bore","wrong","unfunni","littl","forget","stroker","ac","heavi","nail","seal","burt","coffin","befor","somewhatreviv","year","late","boogi","night","anoth","like","deliver","year","earli","show","man","act","quit","good","decent","platform"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,14,17,18,21,24,25,28,35,36,41,44,45,51,54,57,62,68,69,73,79,99,108,120,121,132,137,150,163,210,230,234,238,255,259,266,284,309,339,344,372,384,387,396,520,540,542,726,736,813,948,998,1116,1123,1177,1241,1276,1358,1390,1409,1431,1476,1557,1735,1843,1896,1899,1929,1955,2266,2301,2375,2387,2504,2737,2923,2977,3036,3076,3146,3305,3337,3453,3557,3676,3834,4084,4088,4092,4530,4749,5209,5464,5849,6539,7079,7943],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,14,17,18,21,24,25,28

{"value":"I wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face. I've read criticism of the early 90's version, \"Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights\" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","expect","much","of","thi","film","a","fun","littl","divers","wuther","height","can","be","turn","into","a","plausibl","modern","stori","nice","and","soapi","melodramat","and","intrigu","but","thi","film","decid","to","throw","awai","the","talent","of","the","peopl","involv","in","a","simper","version","so","water","down","from","the","sourc","materi","that","it","amaz","thei","have","the","gut","to","call","it","wuther","height","at","all","it","ignor","the","fact","that","it","be","a","stori","of","peopl","who","be","in","essenc","unlik","mostli","unsympathet","and","frequent","cruel","to","on","anoth","it","chang","the","veri","natur","of","certain","charact","isabel","for","instanc","in","the","novel","have","not","a","conniv","bone","in","her","bodi","thei","have","strip","her","blind","ideal","and","turn","her","into","a","scheme","whore","heathcliff","be","a","aw","person","who","psycholog","tortur","much","peopl","in","hi","path","but","in","thi","version","catherin","end","up","leav","her","daughter","in","hi","care","the","dialog","be","trite","and","on","wonder","how","the","actor","manag","to","deliv","ani","of","it","with","straight","face","in","place","of","depth","or","actual","emot","we","know","thei","mean","someth","when","thei","scream","it","in","someon","face","i","have","read","critic","of","the","earli","version","emili","bront","wuther","height","which","featur","ralph","fienn","and","juliett","binoch","sai","that","it","turn","a","intens","dark","gothic","stori","into","a","sudsi","bodiceripp","slightli","valid","comment","but","the","mtv","version","go","a","step","far","us","the","basic","stori","structur","to","deliv","chipper","beach","bum","cavort","to","realli","bad","music"],"filtered":["expect","much","thi","film","fun","littl","divers","wuther","height","turn","plausibl","modern","stori","nice","soapi","melodramat","intrigu","thi","film","decid","throw","awai","talent","peopl","involv","simper","version","water","sourc","materi","amaz","thei","gut","call","wuther","height","ignor","fact","stori","peopl","essenc","unlik","mostli","unsympathet","frequent","cruel","anoth","chang","veri","natur","certain","charact","isabel","instanc","novel","conniv","bone","bodi","thei","strip","blind","ideal","turn","scheme","whore","heathcliff","aw","person","psycholog","tortur","much","peopl","hi","path","thi","version","catherin","end","leav","daughter","hi","care","dialog","trite","wonder","actor","manag","deliv","ani","straight","face","place","depth","actual","emot","know","thei","mean","someth","thei","scream","someon","face","read","critic","earli","version","emili","bront","wuther","height","featur","ralph","fienn","juliett","binoch","sai","turn","intens","dark","gothic","stori","sudsi","bodiceripp","slightli","valid","comment","mtv","version","go","step","far","us","basic","stori","structur","deliv","chipper","beach","bum","cavort","realli","bad","music"],"filtered2":["expect","fun","littl","divers","wuther","height","turn","plausibl","modern","stori","nice","soapi","melodramat","intrigu","decid","throw","awai","talent","peopl","involv","simper","version","water","sourc","materi","amaz","gut","call","wuther","height","ignor","fact","stori","peopl","essenc","unlik","mostli","unsympathet","frequent","cruel","anoth","chang","veri","natur","certain","charact","isabel","instanc","novel","conniv","bone","bodi","strip","blind","ideal","turn","scheme","whore","heathcliff","aw","person","psycholog","tortur","peopl","path","version","catherin","end","leav","daughter","care","dialog","trite","wonder","actor","manag","deliv","ani","straight","face","place","depth","actual","emot","know","mean","someth","scream","someon","face","read","critic","earli","version","emili","bront","wuther","height","featur","ralph","fienn","juliett","binoch","turn","intens","dark","gothic","stori","sudsi","bodiceripp","slightli","valid","comment","mtv","version","go","step","far","us","basic","stori","structur","deliv","chipper","beach","bum","cavort","realli","bad","music"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,9,10,13,14,15,17,23,24,26,27,41,52,53,56,73,74,88,96,97,101,118,130,138,139,142,145,153,155,164,175,205,220,241,249,251,259,262,266,276,278,280,286,305,310,345,368,376,426,432,456,474,506,510,517,526,537,548,579,615,685,729,762,774,802,830,914,965,1017,1060,1216,1350,1493,1588,1614,1752,1763,1846,1851,1872,1881,1984,2096,2416,2435,2484,2705,2750,2803,3128,3213,3495,3664,3830,3870,3967,4021,4079,4109,4827,5135,5539,6456,8167,8228,8470],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"Having seen men Behind the Sun I guess I hoped for an evolution in style & technique to match the larger scale of this movie. I was also quite interested to see someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of Japanese atrocities, but this is not it. This plays like a bottom-to-mid tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e.g. SS Experiment Camp etc (perhaps more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually). Granted it has a greater scope and more people running around, but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non-actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots, spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock' sequence. The admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power. Watch channel 4's 'The Holocaust' (aired recently (still running?), as of 1 No 2006) for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war (featuring excellent in-context use of actual footage). This is the type of treatment the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this hackneyed exploitation garbage (a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine, but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as a treatment of the

{"value":"I saw this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting is fair, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the \"energy used to make the movie\" and if the film is burned the killer will die? How unbelievable is that? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least...for example, all of a sudden the man mentions \"Aren't you trying to complete the film because your mother couldn't?\" So we're supposed to go along with this? We had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film. The movie really didn't spotlight on anyone, we didn't know anything about the main people who survived except Ringwald's character was a whiney actress, the guy was on the set when the people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. Not truly diving in to know who they are. Seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings. The whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap, obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making. I can't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture. It's not funny, it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film. I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which believe you me wasn't hard at all to do. It's a disgrace and I'm deeply sorry I wasted an hour and a half watching the mess.

{"value":"I feel the movie did not portray Smith historically. The goal of this movie was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be \"comfortable\" to the LDS Church leaders, historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The movie was designed to be a \"faith promoting\" experience, not a balanced view of Smith \"as a man.\" I have taken it upon myself to study Smith's life and have read both LDS works and none LDS works. The movie, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and well acted. However, this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life.<br /><br />A significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that Smith had when he was seven. While this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook, it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is in portraying Smith's teen years the film is silent regarding the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820's. Another problem is while the movie shows Joseph Smith good-naturedly entering into wrestling contests, it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent.<br /><br />I could go on and on. This movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then

{"value":"KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963; which I recall having rated BOMB) had been my introduction to cult director Honda's work; this one isn't necessarily better  it's just that I've learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare! <br /><br />Here, we actually get two Kongs for the price of one: an ugly and dopey-looking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo(!)  where it's shown fighting a couple of other monsters, and befriends a trio of humans. Naturally, it falls for the blonde (and bland) heroine; in fact, more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the film's villainous mad genius  called Dr. Who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampire!!<br /><br />He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the Element X, which is embedded in the icy wastes of the North Pole; apparently, the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure its full co-operation, Who even captures its three 'companions')! The female agent then has a change of heart, helps the heroes (one of whom, typically, is a nondescript American) and is killed by Who. Kong eventually escapes and makes it to Tokyo, where it has a final showdown with the robot. The doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub  which, on a request by Kong's dreamgirl, is summarily trashed by the giant

{"value":"Tim (Gary Daniels) wants desperately to break into serious television reporting. When a job he begged for goes awry, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara, too. Coming home, Tim is startled to discover his house has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But, Martin gets in trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case, either. Soon everyone in television is stalking Tim, hoping for a story about a true alien. What's a man to do? For those who loved the old television show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots. Its truly, undeniably awful, with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat, too. Daniels is okay as the earthling but Lloyd is simply terrible as the alien, overacting up a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, set, and production details. Even if your children see the cover and beg for this film, convince them to pick out another flick at the video store. Be assured, kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore, so opt for A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 Days

{"value":"The film portrays France's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in Western (Francophone) Africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman, France (herein symbolically representing her nation). It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded. This is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities.<br /><br />The characters all play a symbolic, albeit a limited and unconvincing role. France, meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is just forgettable. The black Africans are, to say the least, offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material. They are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like France wonders seeking a world she never knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.","finished_norm":["the","film","portrai","franc","unresolv","problem","with","it","coloni","legaci","in","western","francophon","africa","through","the","befuddl","and","complex","psychoanalyt","prism","of","a","young","woman","franc","herein","symbol","repres","her","nation","it","be","a","often","engag","and","challeng","portrait","of","a","young","woman","desir","to","come","to","term","with","a","traumat","moment","in","her","past","in","particular","and","a","nation","desir","to","reach","out","to","the","other","it","onc","own","and","mould","thi","be","reflect","in","the","wai","in","which","it","centr","entir","around","the","notion","of","travel","or","be","in","transit","from","the","present","to","the","past","rememb","realiti","to","undeni","contemporari","polit","and","econom","actualitiesbr","br","the","charact","all","plai","a","symbol","albeit","a","limit","and","unconvinc","role","franc","mean","to","be","a","visual","a","good","a","a","totem","represent","of","contemporari","french","societi","leav","on","indiffer","to","her","plight","a","she","seem","still","to","be","imbu","with","the","same","naiveté","she","enjoi","a","a","childin","fact","a","a","child","she","seem","much","in","possess","of","her","realiti","the","rest","of","the","ragtag","ensembl","be","just","forgett","the","black","african","be","to","sai","the","littl","offenc","impressionist","portrait","of","former","colonis","peopl","now","colonis","by","the","director","poor","handl","of","her","materi","thei","be","no","much","than","a","dark","and","moribund","backdrop","against","which","the","blythelik","franc","wonder","seek","a","world","she","never","know","and","hope","for","on","that","can","never","be","find","in","cameroon"],"filtered":["film","portrai","franc","unresolv","problem","coloni","legaci","western","francophon","africa","befuddl","complex","psychoanalyt","prism","young","woman","franc","herein","symbol","repres","nation","often","engag","challeng","portrait","young","woman","desir","come","term","traumat","moment","past","particular","nation","desir","reach","onc","mould","thi","reflect","wai","centr","entir","around","notion","travel","transit","present","past","rememb","realiti","undeni","contemporari","polit","econom","actualitiesbr","br","charact","plai","symbol","albeit","limit","unconvinc","role","franc","mean","visual","good","totem","represent","contemporari","french","societi","leav","indiffer","plight","seem","still","imbu","naiveté","enjoi","childin","fact","child","seem","much","possess","realiti","rest","ragtag","ensembl","forgett","black","african","sai","littl","offenc","impressionist","portrait","former","colonis","peopl","colonis","director","poor","handl","materi","thei","much","dark","moribund","backdrop","blythelik","franc","wonder","seek","world","never","know","hope","never","find","cameroon"],"filtered2":["portrai","franc","unresolv","problem","coloni","legaci","western","francophon","africa","befuddl","complex","psychoanalyt","prism","young","woman","franc","herein","symbol","repres","nation","often","engag","challeng","portrait","young","woman","desir","come","term","traumat","moment","past","particular","nation","desir","reach","onc","mould","reflect","wai","centr","entir","around","notion","travel","transit","present","past","rememb","realiti","undeni","contemporari","polit","econom","actualitiesbr","charact","plai","symbol","albeit","limit","unconvinc","role","franc","mean","visual","good","totem","represent","contemporari","french","societi","leav","indiffer","plight","seem","still","imbu","naiveté","enjoi","childin","fact","child","seem","possess","realiti","rest","ragtag","ensembl","forgett","black","african","littl","offenc","impressionist","portrait","former","colonis","peopl","colonis","director","poor","handl","materi","dark","moribund","backdrop","blythelik","franc","wonder","seek","world","never","know","hope","never","find","cameroon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,23,26,33,34,35,38,40,42,58,64,70,74,88,97,98,128,135,146,165,167,175,180,181,188,198,200,226,229,236,290,368,400,411,440,469,537,575,635,656,769,832,858,899,934,943,945,1027,1032,1039,1049,1055,1182,1238,1305,1349,1391,1399,1462,1472,1737,1842,2057,2232,2269,2411,2639,3001,3022,3148,3601,3822,3864,3906,3927,4133,4343,4481,4652,4783,5350,6653,7808,7841],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,23,26,33,34,35,38,40,42,58,64,70,74,88,97,98,128,135,146,165,167,175,180,181,188,198,200,226,229,236,290,368,400,411,440,469,537,575,635,656,769,832,858,899,934,943,945,1027,1032,1039,1049,1055,1182,1238,1305,1349,1391,13

{"value":"1st watched 6/18/2009  2 out of 10 (Dir- Pete Riski): Weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital, the power flickers, and then all hell breaks loose. I'm honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one. What we get for the next 1 hour and a half(at least it wasn't longer) was a twisted horror/twilight zone/zombiefest/ghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end. Initially, after the power goes out, everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father. There is the typical annoying character, a creepy old man, and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and, of course, the young girl the main character gets attracted to. Random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing, a hinting that time has stopped, and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever they're in. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and I really hate how they used this girl's affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame. We never really find out the answer to what was going onwhich is very strange, so please avoid this dog.

{"value":"In THE FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard . Or is it Travis Bickle ? or Rupert Pupkin ? Or Max Cady ? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro has played very very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER , THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts . I found it slightly difficult to believe that Renard would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho<br /><br />The character arc isn't the only problem with this script - It also lacks a character focus ( A problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat ) , for several stretches of the movie I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character then the story switches back to Renard . It also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball . I'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should

{"value":"The only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves. For viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.<br /><br />The story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave, but for any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard. The trouble is, there are no waves until the very end of the film, so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.<br /><br />The acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few comical moments, but mostly his acting was mundane. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man, by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch. Probably the funniest performance was turned in by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability.<br /><br />There is really not much here on which to comment. I rated it a 3/10.

{"value":"This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke. I personally don't care one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her. Just as a movie this is something that wouldn't even get a passing grade in film school. The script is a mess, the acting is atrocious, and the fact Luke Wilson (co-writer of \"Bottle Rocket\") did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He did \"Old School\" for crying out loud! This doesn't even belong in the same state as my \"Old School\" DVD! Please for whatever reason DO NOT WATCH THIS! I see there is a comment that this is so bad it's good, but that frankly is too kind. When will we stop seeing singers that obviously can't act keep trying to, I hope ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook, & Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As far as the plot, well it is almost non-existent and so poorly done and written (yes I know it's another rehash) I very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this. Please whatever you do don't waste your time, but if you do, feel sorry for the ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb. Jessica Simpson you're pretty, but stick to singing, although I'm not much a fan of that either. And whoever did this film, I wouldn't put this on your resume. 1/10 because you can't give a

{"value":"Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the super government computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, tracks him because Will borrowed (by hacking) some money from his next door neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia. The next door neighbor whose computer Will was fixing, has relatives in the mid-east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor's bank , and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to call up missile strikes. Oh, oh!<br /><br />This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s. Well, the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days. Makes sense. So the movie dazzles us with fantastic CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, the forerunner to Ripley, is found operational, we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing, hoping, praying.sort of, oh-oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more cringing hoping things will go their way. In other words we are now experiencing a made-for-TV type movie, and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie.

{"value":"...for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be compared.<br /><br />First off, the beginning did have elements of style....and if handled well, could have become a cult classic, a-la pulp fiction or a Desi desperado...but the plot (was there one?) begins to meander and at one point completely loses it.<br /><br />Throw in a deranged don with an obsession for English, a call center smart Alec, a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a Saree with the same aplomb, a levitating, gravity defying hit-man and a cop with a hundred (or was it a thousand) black cat commandos on their trail....good ingredients in competent hands. But this is where I would like to ask the director: Sir, what were you smoking?<br /><br />Im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers. <br /><br />Possibly the only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music...watch the videos...hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed.
