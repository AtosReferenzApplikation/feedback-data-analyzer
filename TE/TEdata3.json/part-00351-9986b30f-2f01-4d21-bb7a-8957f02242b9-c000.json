{"value":"This movie displayed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have<br /><br />have ever encountered in an American film. The sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died.

{"value":"Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. Ahh...if only everything in life were that easy. The fact that this \"film\" looks as if it was made with about $500 certainly doesn't help. 1/10","finished_norm":["definit","a","odd","debut","for","michael","madsen","madsen","plai","cecil","moe","a","alcohol","famili","man","whose","life","be","crumbl","all","around","him","cecil","grab","a","phone","book","look","up","the","name","of","a","preacher","and","call","him","in","the","middl","of","the","night","he","go","to","the","preacher","home","and","discuss","hi","problem","the","preacher","teach","cecil","to","respect","the","word","of","god","and","have","jesu","in","hi","heart","that","make","everyth","all","well","ahhif","onli","everyth","in","life","be","that","easi","the","fact","that","thi","film","look","a","if","it","be","make","with","about","certainli","doe","not","help"],"filtered":["definit","odd","debut","michael","madsen","madsen","plai","cecil","moe","alcohol","famili","man","whose","life","crumbl","around","cecil","grab","phone","book","look","name","preacher","call","middl","night","go","preacher","home","discuss","hi","problem","preacher","teach","cecil","respect","word","god","jesu","hi","heart","make","everyth","well","ahhif","onli","everyth","life","easi","fact","thi","film","look","make","certainli","doe","help"],"filtered2":["definit","odd","debut","michael","madsen","madsen","plai","cecil","moe","alcohol","famili","man","whose","life","crumbl","around","cecil","grab","phone","book","look","name","preacher","call","middl","night","go","preacher","home","discuss","problem","preacher","teach","cecil","respect","word","god","jesu","heart","make","everyth","well","ahhif","onli","everyth","life","easi","fact","look","make","certainli","doe","help"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,11,16,18,20,40,45,75,97,98,142,143,151,167,182,185,193,210,258,302,352,389,392,466,554,598,614,695,744,768,983,1111,1141,1326,1550,1905,2255,3514,5246,5338,5670,7238],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,11,16,18,20,40,45,75,97,98,142,143,151,167,182,185,193,210,258,302,352,389,392,466,554,598,614,695,744,768,983,1111,1141,1326,1550,1905,2255,3514,5246,5338,5670,7238],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,3.948450049740535,2.0545557924622586,2.0881990796736947,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.8002454868101863,2.4609576687888097,2.7365296724240786,2.518833027372001,5.035680942918498,2.687151791517189,2.7061321952397077,2.902686292364678,3.1236456418640466,3.0914425013694116,3.0670934723591254,3.4446025032006995,3.439602492783994,3.5642670069567886,3.553030933689863,3.6284289511740746,3.700222643192818,3.8059428063999263,4.165705761027235,4.268777946167049,4.770124825978496,4.456830177669989,4.558366596889411,5.00274712124725,5.051537285416681,12.202718819830718,19.167124447101422,20.845971810907688,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.818241445225234E-5,6.772264449185352E-5,6.82491234759079E-5,6.785477931338184E-5,6.785589103754494E-5,6.776104206207246E-5,6.796257289536567E-5,6.773239611014734E-5,6.788468322798987E-5,7.531435036260829E-5,0.3325641941895016,6.762306108948171E-5,6.888521199063876E-5,6.986787467624814E-5,0.014521153345501562,6.748535388429385E-5,6.916869161968638E-5,6.796894047544295E-5,6.775806710239462E-5,6.78142264928433E-5,6.847036890800508E-5,6.803628049608263E-5,6.81137501229685E-5,6.818713504914816E-5,0.04167235393143445,6.835110004144667E-5,0.12157654531834242,6.764316480551022E-5,6.764497441858078E-5,6.781635257873687E-5,6.925777327681795E-5,6.796500225574705E-5,7.29546724892336E-5,6.815617777772878E-5,6.771679134840801E-5,6.802934897984938E-5,6.764893743124667E-5,6.768891297601912E-5,6.748501483241952E-5,6.750252355874229E-5,6.765446353548865E-5,6.836807477011978E-5,6.802066785178507E-5,6.775173314553046E-5,6.857498774527939E-5,0.14528458934197322,7.002965424807536E-5,0.04531118400232704,6.751930162607087E-5,6.766852341175317E-5,6.76450534184108E-5,6.954883950221524E-5,6.766953019037723E-5,6.749653087715698E-5,0.12458391776920762,6.768696006496907E-5,7.278988656054729E-5,6.763117721480345E-5,6.751852080408215E-5,6.784090192423617E-5,6.851382665514351E-5,6.783641386268844E-5,6.750602972678736E-5,6.766320717796442E-5,6.748583107561987E-5,6.904731332941293E-5,6.806718983109713E-5,6.792219675084328E-5,6.786279572000858E-5,6.811016639781173E-5,6.748336908547314E-5,6.786421843173086E-5,6.896493100339832E-5,6.760430303129965E-5,6.927747430724807E-5,0.16957046078647203,6.831354601502511E-5,6.789604367393684E-5,6.746221106172322E-5,6.754583510567815E-5]}}
{"value":"Usually, any film with Sylvester Stallone is usually going to suck ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in that were good were Rocky and First Blood. This film is extreamly unrealistic, and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I didn't enjoy watching it, and I would never ever watch this again. No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture. I would give this a 3/10, the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action, but not good enough.","finished_norm":["usual","ani","film","with","sylvest","stallon","be","usual","go","to","suck","ass","rambo","blood","part","ii","be","no","except","to","thi","the","onli","movi","that","sylvest","stallon","be","in","that","be","good","be","rocki","and","blood","thi","film","be","extreamli","unrealist","and","bore","it","have","action","but","not","veri","good","action","i","do","not","enjoi","watch","it","and","i","would","never","ever","watch","thi","again","no","wonder","why","it","win","the","razzi","award","for","wrong","pictur","i","would","give","thi","a","the","onli","reason","why","it","get","the","be","becaus","it","have","somewhat","good","action","but","not","good","enough"],"filtered":["usual","ani","film","sylvest","stallon","usual","go","suck","ass","rambo","blood","part","ii","except","thi","onli","movi","sylvest","stallon","good","rocki","blood","thi","film","extreamli","unrealist","bore","action","veri","good","action","enjoi","watch","never","ever","watch","thi","wonder","win","razzi","award","wrong","pictur","give","thi","onli","reason","get","becaus","somewhat","good","action","good","enough"],"filtered2":["usual","ani","sylvest","stallon","usual","go","suck","ass","rambo","blood","part","ii","except","onli","sylvest","stallon","good","rocki","blood","extreamli","unrealist","bore","action","veri","good","action","enjoi","watch","never","ever","watch","wonder","win","razzi","award","wrong","pictur","give","onli","reason","get","becaus","somewhat","good","action","good","enough"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,7,11,15,22,25,27,30,42,44,61,93,95,108,129,175,200,233,265,311,355,421,489,596,1004,1169,1264,1661,2128,3971,4530,4955],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,7,11,15,22,25,27,30,42,44,61,93,95,108,129,175,200,233,265,311,355,421,489,596,1004,1169,1264,1661,2128,3971,4530,4955],"values":[2.714457859969082,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.982619630677639,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.8818517047392527,2.035389827120098,2.0323326556775485,2.138507503627933,7.232087502023765,2.3791142619576227,2.5308211829319704,2.6102777977348763,5.4705917319503,2.9203338091782562,6.371042091164268,3.2597778161886266,3.3956930001684253,3.485528930909917,4.176068548062782,4.528289141652134,4.327618446189983,4.688631791727313,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,12.429376190444724,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0760887319514624E-4,1.0688324140629047E-4,1.0771415668980088E-4,1.0709178314492988E-4,1.0709353772322482E-4,1.0694384235886579E-4,1.0726190833026005E-4,1.0689863189465697E-4,1.0713897898832945E-4,1.1886484870113028E-4,0.935786070385286,1.0672607393423399E-4,1.0871806317906868E-4,1.1026895023959354E-4,1.0680389747399113E-4,1.0650873758291578E-4,0.05580684943486228,1.0727195796142375E-4,1.0693914712973221E-4,1.0702778066924617E-4,1.0806333722027658E-4,1.0737823732686113E-4,1.0750050374002659E-4,1.0761632347564526E-4,1.0844222347076873E-4,1.0787510117083892E-4,1.124099654914899E-4,1.0675780261744714E-4,1.0676065863868085E-4,1.0703113616360873E-4,1.0930605790650609E-4,1.0726574246748335E-4,1.1514068787319144E-4,1.0756746517220443E-4,1.0687400368457177E-4,1.0736729766364466E-4,1.0676691326211799E-4,1.0683000465251365E-4,1.0650820247440656E-4,1.065358356159697E-4,1.0677563483432127E-4,1.0790189153078703E-4,1.0735359667613098E-4,1.0692915056439357E-4,1.0822845186581261E-4,1.0697019055669182E-4,1.1052427879564681E-4,1.0889898705997763E-4,1.0656231559521545E-4,1.0679782482941373E-4,1.0676078332013661E-4,1.0976543308105496E-4,1.0679941377744619E-4,1.065263776682277E-4,1.0769565711412798E-4,1.068269224712909E-4,1.1488061453541359E-4,1.0673888320635493E-4,1.0656108326316845E-4,1.0706988116007274E-4,1.081319243954116E-4,1.0706279787841044E-4,1.0654136922453422E-4,1.0678943448518428E-4,1.0650949070996918E-4,1.0897389956370021E-4,1.074270199746867E-4,1.0719818469344076E-4,1.0710443503605324E-4,1.0749484772697602E-4,1.0650560507482947E-4,1.0710668043036121E-4,1.088438796847498E-4,1.0669646903507462E-4,1.0933715105130596E-4,1.069785636593971E-4,1.0781583154098452E-4,1.0715690860841065E-4,1.064722124308016E-4,1.0660419205068308E-4]}}
{"value":"Truly terrible, pretentious, endless film. Director Bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good, engaging film. I hate it when a sex film poses as an \"art film\" just to become more \"respectable\". The frequent, occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence. Whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste.

{"value":"I'm getting a little tired of people misusing God's name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world. Well I don't dismiss the idea of Armageddon, or the coming of the anti-Christ, I do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives(They seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to Heaven, while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of Hell on Earth, just because we weren't good enough. God may be a judge, but I don't think He is going to measure every level of goodness. Give the Creator some credit.","finished_norm":["i","be","get","a","littl","tire","of","peopl","misus","god","name","to","perpetu","their","own","bigot","view","on","the","world","good","i","do","not","dismiss","the","idea","of","armageddon","or","the","come","of","the","antichrist","i","do","dismiss","the","idea","that","onli","certain","peopl","who","live","truli","good","livesthei","seem","to","be","mostli","white","christian","child","will","go","to","heaven","while","the","rest","of","u","must","suffer","through","a","millenium","of","hell","on","earth","just","becaus","we","be","not","good","enough","god","mai","be","a","judg","but","i","do","not","think","he","be","go","to","measur","everi","level","of","good","give","the","creator","some","credit"],"filtered":["get","littl","tire","peopl","misus","god","name","perpetu","bigot","view","world","good","dismiss","idea","armageddon","come","antichrist","dismiss","idea","onli","certain","peopl","live","truli","good","livesthei","seem","mostli","white","christian","child","go","heaven","rest","u","must","suffer","millenium","hell","earth","becaus","good","enough","god","mai","judg","think","go","measur","everi","level","good","give","creator","credit"],"filtered2":["get","littl","tire","peopl","misus","god","name","perpetu","bigot","view","world","good","dismiss","idea","armageddon","come","antichrist","dismiss","idea","onli","certain","peopl","live","truli","good","livesthei","seem","mostli","white","christian","child","go","heaven","rest","u","must","suffer","millenium","hell","earth","becaus","good","enough","god","mai","judg","think","go","measur","everi","level","good","give","creator","credit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,11,12,14,22,23,30,34,35,46,85,93,112,116,123,141,143,165,180,226,312,343,352,356,359,394,445,510,522,633,684,774,900,1023,1543,2080,2459,3680,4249,5122,5146,5591,7701],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,6,11,12,14,22,23,30,34,35,46,85,93,112,116,123,141,143,165,180,226,312,343,352,356,359,394,445,510,522,633,684,774,900,1023,1543,2080,2459,3680,4249,5122,5146,5591,7701],"values":[2.714457859969082,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.655771293751733,2.011190219103739,2.035389827120098,2.2466628996789315,2.2466628996789315,4.523814194644097,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.448847599972298,2.7097314792693545,2.5940874818617203,2.8824835850471584,2.9705344631698933,6.247291283728093,3.028335462059722,3.2189558216683714,3.0967381889441223,3.241201430615691,3.374440724508766,3.604618302480356,3.550241531602284,4.1302590120314875,3.753391311073496,3.9201351739255808,4.1302590120314875,4.706176101378222,5.00274712124725,5.102830579804232,5.672363804397,6.214688095222362,12.429376190444724,6.255510089742618,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.987259173236718E-5,7.93339921736282E-5,7.995073831391773E-5,7.948878209619618E-5,7.949008443039644E-5,7.937897317751681E-5,7.961505736577016E-5,7.934541575011738E-5,7.952381316955833E-5,8.822732967770921E-5,0.6120824430939074,7.921733475536484E-5,8.06958870249292E-5,8.184703158513356E-5,7.927509920948115E-5,7.905601703925084E-5,0.04232978427496674,7.962251669568569E-5,7.937548814781119E-5,7.944127631476423E-5,8.020991725635493E-5,7.97014024614511E-5,7.979215459936854E-5,7.987812169653204E-5,8.049114524341587E-5,8.007019921378438E-5,8.343619827771076E-5,7.924088534264674E-5,7.92430052219021E-5,7.944376692751134E-5,8.113232559556847E-5,7.961790325076077E-5,8.546307457008255E-5,7.98418566636626E-5,7.932713548278601E-5,7.969328250602518E-5,7.924764771066163E-5,7.929447723983774E-5,7.905561985542928E-5,7.907613053051416E-5,7.925412128997876E-5,8.00900843349548E-5,7.968311296006195E-5,7.936806820595777E-5,8.033247345716207E-5,0.09702700664468923,8.203654898188461E-5,8.08301776168237E-5,0.08202392425323797,7.927059179437062E-5,7.924309776660326E-5,8.147329641590397E-5,7.927177118965386E-5,7.906911037709936E-5,0.09856385794079345,7.929218949352891E-5,8.527003536325866E-5,7.922684242636005E-5,7.909487057449967E-5,7.947252536714883E-5,8.02608260269328E-5,7.946726780754859E-5,7.908023784661698E-5,7.926436406872649E-5,7.905657604714557E-5,8.088578135699699E-5,7.973761133900649E-5,7.956775855224073E-5,7.949817295128398E-5,7.978795642864333E-5,7.905369193787167E-5,7.949983959323938E-5,0.06205205650038771,7.919536054493382E-5,8.115540445502063E-5,7.940474503237794E-5,8.00262063830175E-5,7.953712141433537E-5,7.902890627713471E-5,7.912686803421649E-5]}}

{"value":"Jameson Parker And Marilyn Hassett are the screen's most unbelievable couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly think it's the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film. Normally, I don't like to let myself get so ascerbic, but The Bell Jar is one of my all-time favorite books, and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy.","finished_norm":["jameson","parker","and","marilyn","hassett","be","the","screen","much","unbeliev","coupl","sinc","john","travolta","and","lili","tomlin","larri","peerc","direct","waver","uncontrol","between","black","farc","and","roman","tragedi","robert","klein","certainli","think","it","the","former","and","hi","selfcent","perform","in","a","minor","role","underscor","the","total","lack","of","balanc","and","chemistri","between","the","player","in","the","film","normal","i","do","not","like","to","let","myself","get","so","ascerb","but","the","bell","jar","be","on","of","my","alltim","favorit","book","and","to","watch","what","thei","do","with","it","make","me","liter","crazi"],"filtered":["jameson","parker","marilyn","hassett","screen","much","unbeliev","coupl","sinc","john","travolta","lili","tomlin","larri","peerc","direct","waver","uncontrol","black","farc","roman","tragedi","robert","klein","certainli","think","former","hi","selfcent","perform","minor","role","underscor","total","lack","balanc","chemistri","player","film","normal","like","let","get","ascerb","bell","jar","alltim","favorit","book","watch","thei","make","liter","crazi"],"filtered2":["jameson","parker","marilyn","hassett","screen","unbeliev","coupl","sinc","john","travolta","lili","tomlin","larri","peerc","direct","waver","uncontrol","black","farc","roman","tragedi","robert","klein","certainli","think","former","selfcent","perform","minor","role","underscor","total","lack","balanc","chemistri","player","normal","like","let","get","ascerb","bell","jar","alltim","favorit","book","watch","make","liter","crazi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,12,102,105,124,128,151,162,183,184,192,229,253,291,389,539,571,700,712,822,897,999,1040,1097,1132,1880,1947,2023,2237,2639,2732,2854,3627,3911,4860,4880,5104,5978,7125],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,12,102,105,124,128,151,162,183,184,192,229,253,291,389,539,571,700,712,822,897,999,1040,1097,1132,1880,1947,2023,2237,2639,2732,2854,3627,3911,4860,4880,5104,5978,7125],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,2.8002454868101863,2.3586007221245198,2.4885128563647294,2.496249838866882,2.5318267134339894,2.8432628718938773,2.7073305177318163,3.016831637578237,3.0914425013694116,3.6105180246075443,3.467417180966871,3.616452760127359,3.7165362186843414,3.813163054373413,3.8844878351953436,4.1302590120314875,4.105687751300982,4.186539847930077,4.218628162481577,4.911775343041523,5.089758498236879,5.259176650194926,5.290429193699031,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,5.3560264761848435,5.822646007446338,5.770002273960917,6.1754673820690815,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.876584254318649E-5,7.823470605296698E-5,7.884290629189171E-5,7.838735113939555E-5,7.838863542788966E-5,7.827906378060398E-5,7.851187668419934E-5,7.824597133943774E-5,7.842189680704846E-5,8.700481362474867E-5,0.6319334425980881,7.811966509036476E-5,7.957772989996306E-5,8.071292370308037E-5,0.1652098226398269,7.796058266232188E-5,7.990521187614627E-5,7.851923265441215E-5,7.82756270409778E-5,7.834050361862526E-5,7.909849393876464E-5,7.859702534487596E-5,7.868651998190507E-5,0.07560341629784857,7.937582510915914E-5,0.12125564018968099,8.228007021438718E-5,7.814288935051974E-5,7.814497985581094E-5,7.834295972036454E-5,8.000812098893553E-5,7.85146831353762E-5,8.427886123189187E-5,7.873553335289188E-5,7.822794437139976E-5,7.858901790306564E-5,7.814955801623757E-5,7.819573865519588E-5,7.796019098205121E-5,7.798041745234783E-5,7.81559418948388E-5,7.898032147417105E-5,7.857898927073128E-5,7.826830991304906E-5,7.921935194782752E-5,7.829834971808888E-5,8.089981506478435E-5,7.971015970331333E-5,7.79997998491139E-5,7.817218417679557E-5,7.814507111817269E-5,8.034436717005804E-5,7.817334722986748E-5,7.797349457321614E-5,7.882936526482487E-5,7.819348260888974E-5,8.408849685983917E-5,7.812904101895701E-5,7.799889782617572E-5,7.837131967061962E-5,7.914869729539091E-5,7.836613496203997E-5,7.798446785570164E-5,7.81660427452125E-5,7.796113392436135E-5,7.976499297400495E-5,7.863273249655759E-5,7.846523326349474E-5,7.839661187073217E-5,7.868237998284982E-5,7.795828977855342E-5,7.839825541897552E-5,7.966982307761247E-5,7.809799536410096E-5,8.003088005772569E-5,7.830447852949355E-5,7.891732864277358E-5,7.843502064702785E-5,7.793384755865553E-5,7.803045191524649E-5]}}

{"value":"The danish movie \"Slim Slam Slum\" surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date. I didn't think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b-movies but this one deserves the gold. It's not funny. It's bad acting, It's bad filmed and the storyline is bad. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it. I truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie \"Stjerner uden hjerner\" as the badest danish film ever made! And that's truly something.

{"value":"If it wasn't for the bad dialogues and script. I mean, the direction was really in touch with it's subject. The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life. But in the end, the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together. I would highly suggest not to watch this. Unless you're a Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and will watch everything he is playing in. Even if the result lately are rather poor. This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles.","finished_norm":["if","it","be","not","for","the","bad","dialogu","and","script","i","mean","the","direct","be","realli","in","touch","with","it","subject","the","actor","be","do","good","at","bring","their","charact","to","life","but","in","the","end","the","thing","that","be","realli","miss","be","a","solid","script","to","hold","all","the","piec","togeth","i","would","highli","suggest","not","to","watch","thi","unless","you","re","a","al","pacino","enthusiast","like","i","be","and","will","watch","everyth","he","be","plai","in","even","if","the","result","late","be","rather","poor","thi","be","after","smne","a","veri","bad","movi","for","thi","actor","that","onc","know","how","to","choos","role"],"filtered":["bad","dialogu","script","mean","direct","realli","touch","subject","actor","good","bring","charact","life","end","thing","realli","miss","solid","script","hold","piec","togeth","highli","suggest","watch","thi","unless","re","al","pacino","enthusiast","like","watch","everyth","plai","even","result","late","rather","poor","thi","smne","veri","bad","movi","thi","actor","onc","know","choos","role"],"filtered2":["bad","dialogu","script","mean","direct","realli","touch","subject","actor","good","bring","charact","life","end","thing","realli","miss","solid","script","hold","piec","togeth","highli","suggest","watch","unless","re","al","pacino","enthusiast","like","watch","everyth","plai","even","result","late","rather","poor","smne","veri","bad","actor","onc","know","choos","role"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,9,10,13,15,24,26,29,40,41,68,75,77,88,102,128,146,150,160,193,218,236,248,250,255,270,414,447,460,550,584,646,745,896,1312,1520,2295,3059],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,9,10,13,15,24,26,29,40,41,68,75,77,88,102,128,146,150,160,193,218,236,248,250,255,270,414,447,460,550,584,646,745,896,1312,1520,2295,3059],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,2.0064197866819473,1.9742250248702675,3.8927804517536475,2.0317223413467334,2.087553710177271,2.3409902041158843,2.326138445979858,2.332712011146513,2.3722295531801256,2.517840471459249,2.5940874818617203,2.617923930016232,2.689504733779216,2.6812935439488212,2.6754694156628323,2.731603554088023,3.1254654785810323,3.2070272508030975,3.216957819005698,3.4751392270607813,3.5146700658174166,3.5900195030592035,3.6969916226113715,3.8844878351953436,4.646072177308517,4.550761997504193,5.521540914662417,5.426230734858092]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1406396494856731E-4,1.1329480496694095E-4,1.1417556404339448E-4,1.1351585641799873E-4,1.1351771624750155E-4,1.1335904116536174E-4,1.1369618683685906E-4,1.1331111867856577E-4,1.1356588338015718E-4,0.9909521494589821,1.4673931914640652E-4,1.131282095506764E-4,1.1523969148199167E-4,1.1688361100329443E-4,1.132107014609386E-4,1.1289783592791898E-4,1.1571393122153571E-4,1.1370683931135086E-4,1.1335406428533861E-4,1.134480146506217E-4,1.1454569073096487E-4,1.1381949401587527E-4,1.1394909477696123E-4,1.1407186214615395E-4,1.1494730508406062E-4,1.1434616303861392E-4,1.1915305850697547E-4,1.1316184153010737E-4,1.1316486887437947E-4,1.1345157142972359E-4,1.1586295802116204E-4,1.1370025097098538E-4,1.2204758767341155E-4,1.1402007299860833E-4,1.1328501310559123E-4,1.1380789811932306E-4,1.1317149869148765E-4,1.1323837472065669E-4,1.128972687200631E-4,1.1292655948017503E-4,1.1318074344126108E-4,1.1437456046149686E-4,1.1379337525598363E-4,1.1334346805991094E-4,1.1472071004472316E-4,1.1338696990231484E-4,1.1715425585444173E-4,1.1543146837359551E-4,1.1295462790366879E-4,1.1320426453898547E-4,1.1316500103505337E-4,1.1634988955619412E-4,1.1320594880262749E-4,1.1291653418218895E-4,1.1415595474084848E-4,1.1323510764982399E-4,1.2177191341715804E-4,1.1314178720763756E-4,1.1295332164819709E-4,1.1349264060726796E-4,1.1461839221838156E-4,1.1348513242353496E-4,1.12932425031171E-4,1.131953708864299E-4,1.1289863423251292E-4,1.1551087462463325E-4,1.1387120296948158E-4,1.136286406349453E-4,1.1352926725320941E-4,1.1394309947884877E-4,1.1289451551128465E-4,1.1353164734111514E-4,1.1537305529361654E-4,1.130968287539098E-4,1.1589591633838335E-4,1.1339584527908563E-4,1.142833380244539E-4,1.1358488853740637E-4,1.1285911975566673E-4,1.129990163858339E-4]}}

{"value":"A low budget effort from Texas that's at least filmed well, but that is little consolation. Bad acting, or, should I say, bad over-acting, a pretty limp story line that's nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots, of which there are a lot. Putrid, puerile, definitely avoidable, at all costs.","finished_norm":["a","low","budget","effort","from","texa","that","at","littl","film","good","but","that","be","littl","consol","bad","act","or","should","i","sai","bad","overact","a","pretti","limp","stori","line","that","noth","new","bad","special","effect","bad","bad","bad","seem","like","a","bunch","of","young","folk","be","putt","togeth","a","haunt","hous","for","halloween","which","be","do","everi","year","but","thi","year","thing","be","differ","have","a","long","extend","lesbian","theme","that","be","not","onli","annoi","but","definit","fill","out","the","empti","spot","of","which","there","be","a","lot","putrid","pueril","definit","avoid","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["low","budget","effort","texa","littl","film","good","littl","consol","bad","act","sai","bad","overact","pretti","limp","stori","line","noth","new","bad","special","effect","bad","bad","bad","seem","like","bunch","young","folk","putt","togeth","haunt","hous","halloween","everi","year","thi","year","thing","differ","long","extend","lesbian","theme","onli","annoi","definit","fill","empti","spot","lot","putrid","pueril","definit","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["low","budget","effort","texa","littl","good","littl","consol","bad","act","bad","overact","pretti","limp","stori","line","noth","new","bad","special","effect","bad","bad","bad","seem","like","bunch","young","folk","putt","togeth","haunt","hous","halloween","everi","year","year","thing","differ","long","extend","lesbian","theme","onli","annoi","definit","fill","empti","spot","lot","putrid","pueril","definit","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,9,11,14,17,21,29,35,49,57,72,78,85,87,99,106,107,135,203,204,213,217,256,270,271,335,392,401,419,533,553,837,1005,1006,1144,1213,1239,1262,1415,1950,2004,2430,4182,5290,5615,6519],"values":[1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,9,11,14,17,21,29,35,49,57,72,78,85,87,99,106,107,135,203,204,213,217,256,270,271,335,392,401,419,533,553,837,1005,1006,1144,1213,1239,1262,1415,1950,2004,2430,4182,5290,5615,6519],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,6.410142514033244,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.6920303308087352,3.668325173349496,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.056430207256609,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.366244071437088,2.569760528637609,2.624524614047584,2.8432628718938773,2.6113665294700725,2.748952192422636,2.731603554088023,2.757740698455715,2.908534262247101,6.134186944718251,3.0879275592619675,3.1758963322079246,3.4933926673701317,3.454678155189441,3.7881170224473255,4.086456389373095,4.062925891962901,4.229557233013768,4.251780369798478,4.573751515728891,4.528289141652134,4.4919214974812585,5.014723312293965,5.014723312293965,5.129498826886393,5.907203395474402,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.997788069632547E-5,7.943857114948798E-5,8.005613029159362E-5,7.959356511790227E-5,7.959486916885439E-5,7.948361144785038E-5,7.972000684498088E-5,7.945000978466633E-5,7.9628642369626E-5,0.7344745082015881,1.0288875864908936E-4,7.932175995208159E-5,8.080226126615853E-5,8.195492327828828E-5,7.9379600551962E-5,7.916022958510915E-5,8.11347824907873E-5,7.972747600787041E-5,7.948012182413873E-5,7.95459967138059E-5,8.031565088667708E-5,7.980646576175451E-5,7.989733753017812E-5,0.07621535846518702,8.05972495916871E-5,8.01757486661848E-5,8.35461848285756E-5,7.9345341584017E-5,7.934746425772146E-5,7.954849060970723E-5,8.123927515511335E-5,7.972285648144964E-5,0.1831316388520129,7.99471051123018E-5,7.94317054200775E-5,7.979833510251048E-5,7.935211286626277E-5,7.939900412665983E-5,7.915983187771535E-5,7.91803695902067E-5,7.93585949791262E-5,8.019566000014938E-5,7.978815215093544E-5,7.94726921012331E-5,8.043836864246984E-5,7.950319415473806E-5,8.214469049903931E-5,8.09367288814472E-5,7.920005024067795E-5,7.937508719512532E-5,7.93475569244161E-5,8.158069544708404E-5,7.937626814510091E-5,7.917334018274539E-5,8.004238089703007E-5,7.939671336461766E-5,8.538243929914404E-5,7.933128015619745E-5,7.919913433753254E-5,7.957728695904877E-5,8.03666267657786E-5,7.957202246887332E-5,7.918448232062058E-5,7.936885126002203E-5,7.916078932989449E-5,8.099240591910674E-5,7.984272237026643E-5,7.967264568161448E-5,7.960296835212266E-5,7.989313382537624E-5,7.915790141875476E-5,7.960463719106455E-5,8.089577156119475E-5,7.929975677499506E-5,8.1262384437382E-5,7.950941727546536E-5,8.013169784356522E-5,7.964196815748352E-5,7.913308308527632E-5,7.923117397666672E-5]}}
{"value":"Well here I go with another B industry movie. It's sad enough to see some badly made films but I don't care if a B industry or C industry produces the film. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. The acting isn't in question in this one (surprise), but plot is. How can a tight-knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered, and then go on as if nothing happened. What sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was.

{"value":"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to \"grace\" the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.","finished_norm":["if","you","like","the","grinch","movi","go","watch","that","again","becaus","thi","be","no","where","near","a","good","a","seussian","movi","translat","mike","myer","cat","be","probabl","the","much","annoi","charact","to","grace","the","screen","in","recent","time","hi","voiceacc","be","terribl","and","he","laugh","at","hi","own","joke","with","a","aw","weas","sound","which","be","about","the","onli","laugh","i","hear","at","the","theater","not","even","the","kid","like","thi","on","folk","and","kid","laugh","at","anyth","now","save","your","monei","and","go","see","loonei","tune","back","in","action","if","you","re","realli","look","for","a","fun","holidai","famili","movi"],"filtered":["like","grinch","movi","go","watch","becaus","thi","near","good","seussian","movi","translat","mike","myer","cat","probabl","much","annoi","charact","grace","screen","recent","time","hi","voiceacc","terribl","laugh","hi","joke","aw","weas","sound","onli","laugh","hear","theater","even","kid","like","thi","folk","kid","laugh","anyth","save","monei","go","see","loonei","tune","back","action","re","realli","look","fun","holidai","famili","movi"],"filtered2":["like","grinch","go","watch","becaus","near","good","seussian","translat","mike","myer","cat","probabl","annoi","charact","grace","screen","recent","time","voiceacc","terribl","laugh","joke","aw","weas","sound","onli","laugh","hear","theater","even","kid","like","folk","kid","laugh","anyth","save","monei","go","see","loonei","tune","back","action","re","realli","look","fun","holidai","famili"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,13,16,22,63,68,104,114,126,129,133,138,148,166,178,182,189,192,214,216,259,271,424,555,562,792,1005,1149,1327,1389,1430,2031,3039,3533,6153],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,13,16,22,63,68,104,114,126,129,133,138,148,166,178,182,189,192,214,216,259,271,424,555,562,792,1005,1149,1327,1389,1430,2031,3039,3533,6153],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,2.0728240170322856,4.886614839193365,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,6.963709426138955,2.2907365189289424,2.3018654096236517,2.4423870329693536,2.532833256045391,2.7365296724240786,2.498193474075453,2.5318267134339894,2.7303758068497004,2.6070186965339692,2.7464553122240485,2.757740698455715,3.212973749990824,3.432149042129413,3.432149042129413,4.115443926246347,4.086456389373095,4.297765483040301,4.613282354485526,4.449957298382227,4.558366596889411,5.156897801074508,5.7446844659766265,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.861750988272324E-5,9.795250895869229E-5,9.871399631331492E-5,0.09838667780475152,9.814523376379236E-5,9.800804634015581E-5,9.829953600216954E-5,9.796661347994148E-5,9.818687814011077E-5,1.0893298148596219E-4,0.5792806682180365,9.780847376653239E-5,9.963402042644876E-5,1.0105532162101601E-4,9.787979468527475E-5,9.76092971639196E-5,1.000440389824612E-4,9.830874592669692E-5,9.800374342542645E-5,9.808497110395725E-5,9.903400072738023E-5,9.840614501712642E-5,9.851819534207317E-5,9.86243376478408E-5,9.938122877134067E-5,9.886149292282364E-5,1.0301744227606693E-4,9.783755132898083E-5,9.784016871260244E-5,9.808804622674812E-5,1.0017288468663751E-4,9.83030497743547E-5,1.0551999651224093E-4,9.857956174712403E-5,9.79440431037322E-5,9.83961194280339E-5,9.784590072493852E-5,9.79037204532854E-5,9.760880676691862E-5,9.763413099465446E-5,9.785389355775435E-5,9.888604478837615E-5,9.83835632397623E-5,9.799458213275786E-5,0.31472532040595985,9.803219298886932E-5,1.0128931595301001E-4,9.979982703777905E-5,9.765839841366392E-5,9.787422944637907E-5,9.784028297617876E-5,1.0059387632488091E-4,9.787568562832432E-5,9.762546331486912E-5,9.86970424875515E-5,9.790089580669104E-5,1.0528165385334115E-4,9.782021274755198E-5,9.765726905031111E-5,9.812355384761842E-5,9.909685703486558E-5,9.81170624163954E-5,9.763920223721185E-5,9.786654016546385E-5,9.76099873627148E-5,9.986848015491378E-5,9.845085158370592E-5,9.824113685535947E-5,9.81552205411244E-5,9.851301192265477E-5,9.760642639557136E-5,9.815727831934271E-5,9.974932421250287E-5,9.778134253331027E-5,1.002013798136985E-4,9.803986646889258E-5,9.880717562412549E-5,9.820330963347234E-5,9.757582390616087E-5,9.769677584145692E-5]}}

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.","finished_norm":["i","realli","want","to","like","thi","movi","it","have","a","nice","prison","set","conspiraci","theori","bloodthirsti","zombi","a","perfectli","hideou","stouch","and","it","be","a","directori","effort","by","actor","john","saxon","who","conjur","plai","a","bad","you","guess","it","a","bad","gui","it","remind","me","of","some","belov","italian","horror","flick","but","the","direct","be","veri","wooden","and","there","be","no","nightmarishfrighten","moment","in","there","it","just","go","on","and","on","and","on","and","then","it","logic","have","to","end","much","suspens","and","much","dare","visual","and","it","destini","a","a","cult","classic","would","have","be","seal"],"filtered":["realli","want","like","thi","movi","nice","prison","set","conspiraci","theori","bloodthirsti","zombi","perfectli","hideou","stouch","directori","effort","actor","john","saxon","conjur","plai","bad","guess","bad","gui","remind","belov","italian","horror","flick","direct","veri","wooden","nightmarishfrighten","moment","go","logic","end","much","suspens","much","dare","visual","destini","cult","classic","seal"],"filtered2":["realli","want","like","nice","prison","set","conspiraci","theori","bloodthirsti","zombi","perfectli","hideou","stouch","directori","effort","actor","john","saxon","conjur","plai","bad","guess","bad","gui","remind","belov","italian","horror","flick","direct","veri","wooden","nightmarishfrighten","moment","go","logic","end","suspens","dare","visual","destini","cult","classic","seal"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,9,13,15,24,37,39,40,41,55,83,102,109,188,243,257,262,268,291,332,401,529,635,644,852,890,933,973,1030,1475,1523,1741,2130,2298,2486,3115,4055,5086,5294],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,9,13,15,24,37,39,40,41,55,83,102,109,188,243,257,262,268,291,332,401,529,635,644,852,890,933,973,1030,1475,1523,1741,2130,2298,2486,3115,4055,5086,5294],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.9536997889255368,2.292318797740072,2.087553710177271,2.125691139326857,2.5378812223426954,2.627841366673578,2.7602659523229094,2.726701583487816,3.6746621462132825,3.016831637578237,2.9705344631698933,3.0879275592619675,3.4648563601051974,3.587125145032839,3.5670958631572662,4.2078172463773615,3.8767358583910254,4.091229668125752,4.072271754381138,4.297765483040301,4.4919214974812585,4.733083554298147,4.751432692966343,5.185068678041204,5.064116067623542,5.185068678041204,5.482320201509136,5.9370563586240825,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.437322913291521E-5,9.373684838621206E-5,9.446556299972319E-5,9.391973997033543E-5,9.392127873953303E-5,9.378999556091289E-5,9.406894014890555E-5,9.375034587988475E-5,9.396113083347729E-5,1.0424474552370878E-4,0.6603172713853844,9.359901215196648E-5,9.534599129830668E-5,9.67061228151265E-5,9.366726357521219E-5,9.340840767230922E-5,9.573836355736417E-5,9.407775369853536E-5,9.37858778341707E-5,9.386360965205008E-5,9.477179512754759E-5,9.417096094630881E-5,0.03656866803710446,9.437976304603745E-5,9.51040792401055E-5,9.460671167952709E-5,9.858379811219852E-5,9.362683828007331E-5,9.36293430172599E-5,9.386655242831872E-5,9.586166402578487E-5,9.407230269606322E-5,0.24130592984128396,9.433691420161823E-5,9.37287468830317E-5,9.416136683652297E-5,9.363482833639063E-5,9.369015963078421E-5,9.34079383809167E-5,9.343217270958278E-5,9.364247717525957E-5,9.463020688677966E-5,9.414935103898153E-5,9.377711082339143E-5,9.491660105120143E-5,9.381310299096808E-5,9.693004654566212E-5,9.550466195772035E-5,9.345539571224598E-5,9.366193785195973E-5,9.362945236318317E-5,9.626453710974566E-5,9.366333136303643E-5,9.34238780676738E-5,9.444933882933647E-5,9.368745655076743E-5,1.0075056300254722E-4,9.361024591305887E-5,9.345431495420822E-5,9.390053187927365E-5,9.483194623778974E-5,9.389431982497476E-5,9.343702569701297E-5,9.365457950078516E-5,9.340906816646612E-5,9.557036039567269E-5,9.421374344057955E-5,9.401305437294519E-5,9.39308357079312E-5,9.427322853524049E-5,9.34056604555174E-5,9.393280492390038E-5,9.545633266298034E-5,9.357304858735637E-5,9.588893278524247E-5,9.382044622128634E-5,0.05462917529999482,9.397685515150004E-5,9.337637502995141E-5,9.349212145994482E-5]}}

{"value":"This is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not a part). I went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect - I ultimately found it disappointing. The history of a dreadfully dysfunctional (oftentimes downright \"twisted\") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end. Ultimately, pictures such as this are about the human condition - this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","film","of","immens","appeal","to","a","rel","welldefin","group","of","which","i","be","not","a","part","i","go","to","a","preview","of","thi","movi","not","know","what","to","expect","i","ultim","find","it","disappoint","the","histori","of","a","dreadfulli","dysfunct","oftentim","downright","twist","hungarian","jewish","famili","be","not","my","cup","of","tea","a","epic","saga","like","thi","should","realli","provid","it","viewer","with","someth","much","in","the","end","ultim","pictur","such","a","thi","be","about","the","human","condit","thi","pictur","cast","almost","no","new","light","on","ani","of","it","much","meaning","facet"],"filtered":["thi","film","immens","appeal","rel","welldefin","group","part","go","preview","thi","movi","know","expect","ultim","find","disappoint","histori","dreadfulli","dysfunct","oftentim","downright","twist","hungarian","jewish","famili","cup","tea","epic","saga","like","thi","realli","provid","viewer","someth","much","end","ultim","pictur","thi","human","condit","thi","pictur","cast","almost","new","light","ani","much","meaning","facet"],"filtered2":["immens","appeal","rel","welldefin","group","part","go","preview","know","expect","ultim","find","disappoint","histori","dreadfulli","dysfunct","oftentim","downright","twist","hungarian","jewish","famili","cup","tea","epic","saga","like","realli","provid","viewer","someth","end","ultim","pictur","human","condit","pictur","cast","almost","new","light","ani","meaning","facet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,13,24,26,27,38,53,61,87,92,130,131,182,187,279,292,311,353,410,435,499,689,694,735,1165,1556,1567,1974,1980,2317,2524,2721,3070,3101,3568,4153,4623],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,13,24,26,27,38,53,61,87,92,130,131,182,187,279,292,311,353,410,435,499,689,694,735,1165,1556,1567,1974,1980,2317,2524,2721,3070,3101,3568,4153,4623],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.1317941569733974,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.519311641348122,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,2.115024371522662,2.0489535369135887,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.7365296724240786,2.4732161909892554,2.7910771187233068,2.9752256367457734,5.8406676183565125,3.0266839340212486,3.2070272508030975,3.2829611516442836,3.3814747511661465,3.634471265630037,3.6715125373103863,7.426504286966303,4.246178114249808,4.550761997504193,4.679973728984199,4.9909126636002465,4.900964426937307,5.3560264761848435,5.2288713006995975,5.322690055917252,5.426230734858092,5.501738287366237,5.672363804397,5.9370563586240825,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.241736583468934E-5,9.179417393144963E-5,9.250778610351055E-5,9.197327512988602E-5,9.197478200844868E-5,9.184621964327422E-5,9.21193831693396E-5,9.180739169269466E-5,9.201380817698359E-5,1.020842973364844E-4,0.6332400850726314,9.165919432120859E-5,9.336996772968769E-5,9.470191083609757E-5,9.17260312495281E-5,9.147254007521043E-5,9.375420816462743E-5,9.212801406019631E-5,9.184218725546426E-5,9.19183080994362E-5,9.280767164146988E-5,9.221928960936494E-5,9.232429526084422E-5,9.242376433397666E-5,9.313306924281793E-5,9.264600950964354E-5,0.09818656219422939,9.168644375926046E-5,9.168889658634944E-5,9.192118988734881E-5,9.387495325942096E-5,9.212267602848686E-5,9.888588884614842E-5,9.238180352192574E-5,9.178624033004477E-5,9.220989433528051E-5,9.169426822351268E-5,9.174845278965567E-5,9.147208050977324E-5,9.14958125875952E-5,9.170175854196906E-5,9.266901778417195E-5,0.14330807667265774,9.183360193895123E-5,9.294947649592176E-5,9.186884817719778E-5,9.492119379922299E-5,9.35253499764646E-5,9.151855429891125E-5,9.172081590065555E-5,9.168900366610381E-5,9.426947689210195E-5,9.17221805315382E-5,9.14876898502171E-5,9.249189817529437E-5,9.174580573034565E-5,9.866253093812835E-5,9.167019526520632E-5,9.151749593933331E-5,9.195446512205908E-5,9.286657613389519E-5,9.19483818111456E-5,9.15005649979858E-5,9.171361004960342E-5,9.147318688077904E-5,9.358968682951916E-5,9.226118544635883E-5,9.206465561313181E-5,9.198414091089208E-5,9.231943772622146E-5,9.146984979384983E-5,9.198606931531676E-5,9.347802229515542E-5,9.163376884545672E-5,0.1182339379765053,9.187603922076983E-5,9.259510717322368E-5,9.202920661216017E-5,9.144117130194039E-5,9.1554518914002E-5]}}

I hope i will get the Chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie!!!<br /><br />My ASIAN-Tips: \"MUSA - THE WARRIOR\", \"STORMRIDERS\", \"SHAOLIN SOCCER\", \"BATTLE ROYAL\", \"VERSUS\", etc.<br /><br />Sorry for my bad English!","finished_norm":["sorri","thi","movi","be","just","a","cheap","tvproduct","i","see","veri","much","promot","materi","and","expect","a","professionel","movi","like","stormrid","what","i","be","present","be","a","lowbudgetmovi","like","xena","or","hercul","on","tv","no","atmospher","veri","bore","much","then","wrong","fightscen","some","good","idea","not","much","i","hope","i","will","get","the","chanc","to","make","a","movi","like","thi","and","then","i","show","how","to","do","such","a","moviebr","br","my","asiantip","musa","the","warrior","stormrid","shaolin","soccer","battl","royal","versu","etcbr","br","sorri","for","my","bad","english"],"filtered":["sorri","thi","movi","cheap","tvproduct","see","veri","much","promot","materi","expect","professionel","movi","like","stormrid","present","lowbudgetmovi","like","xena","hercul","tv","atmospher","veri","bore","much","wrong","fightscen","good","idea","much","hope","get","chanc","make","movi","like","thi","show","moviebr","br","asiantip","musa","warrior","stormrid","shaolin","soccer","battl","royal","versu","etcbr","br","sorri","bad","english"],"filtered2":["sorri","cheap","tvproduct","see","veri","promot","materi","expect","professionel","like","stormrid","present","lowbudgetmovi","like","xena","hercul","tv","atmospher","veri","bore","wrong","fightscen","good","idea","hope","get","chanc","make","like","show","moviebr","asiantip","musa","warrior","stormrid","shaolin","soccer","battl","royal","versu","etcbr","sorri","bad","english"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,15,25,28,108,123,130,172,181,351,411,437,465,486,537,588,786,835,1477,1775,3153,3481,3625,7434,8085],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,15,25,28,108,123,130,172,181,351,411,437,465,486,537,588,786,835,1477,1775,3153,3481,3625,7434,8085],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,2.4001215597131385,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,2.138507503627933,2.2619070973220485,2.2642139034199635,2.5001408943598484,2.4442286541160034,3.0135689919434205,3.229006157521873,6.390478590102111,3.2681460658591432,3.3066947359763783,3.424750734647968,3.6375061693251913,3.900174431363043,3.8614098879127985,4.589376833631972,5.089758498236879,5.463272006538442,5.695894301807195,5.907203395474402,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.2607220689423695E-4,1.2522207252987314E-4,1.2619555473839268E-4,1.2546639547870796E-4,1.254684511043385E-4,1.2529307128308198E-4,1.2566571043226178E-4,1.2524010369009193E-4,1.2552168909862004E-4,1.3925946209589156E-4,0.6471515741462058,1.2503793855034325E-4,1.2737170966743756E-4,1.291886950939972E-4,1.2512911491075095E-4,1.2478331202526722E-4,1.2789587565262161E-4,1.256774843607647E-4,1.2528757045511893E-4,1.2539141157527552E-4,1.2660464702580785E-4,1.258019989453911E-4,1.2594524360616232E-4,1.2608093548024108E-4,1.2704854188636273E-4,1.2638411377919887E-4,1.3169706182794948E-4,1.2507511118300596E-4,1.2507845723514068E-4,1.2539534279922527E-4,1.2806059145505533E-4,1.256702024237391E-4,0.18007601984755972,1.260236941584337E-4,1.2521124981675319E-4,1.2578918227476322E-4,1.2508578501543055E-4,1.2515970151122716E-4,1.2478268510381844E-4,1.2481505948928355E-4,1.25096003019045E-4,1.2641550078012047E-4,1.2577313049686432E-4,1.252758586973783E-4,1.2679809174031143E-4,1.253239402565131E-4,1.2948783245682766E-4,1.27583676137012E-4,1.2484608285494943E-4,1.251220003329208E-4,1.2507860330921266E-4,1.2859878538208194E-4,1.251238619097513E-4,1.248039787641619E-4,1.2617388103935246E-4,0.0940101261094351,1.3459162031722696E-4,1.2505294561395284E-4,1.2484463908162314E-4,1.2544073559133702E-4,1.2668500226304028E-4,1.2543243697315894E-4,1.2482154254428733E-4,1.251121703887703E-4,1.2478419437248335E-4,1.2767144199114517E-4,1.2585915163073109E-4,1.2559105321035622E-4,1.254812181581762E-4,1.259386171447346E-4,1.2477964204717128E-4,1.254838488131338E-4,1.275191135391069E-4,1.2500325409671895E-4,1.280970195047859E-4,1.2533375000087026E-4,0.06917119947828555,1.2554269505013032E-4,1.2474051995433984E-4,1.2489514439607474E-4]}}
{"value":"Bela Lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife. The midget in this film is hilarious!! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch.<br /><br />Usually I'd score bore flicks like this one low, but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more

{"value":"I liked the first movie, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board. The general idea in the first movie was, if not great, then at least very interesting. This sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie, and though Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous. If you haven't seen any of these movies, then get the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can take away all of the joy from the original.","finished_norm":["i","like","the","movi","but","thi","be","a","textbook","exampl","of","a","sequel","that","would","have","be","well","of","leav","on","the","draw","board","the","gener","idea","in","the","movi","be","if","not","great","then","at","littl","veri","interest","thi","sequel","try","to","build","upon","the","idea","and","the","charact","from","the","movi","and","though","christoph","walken","be","still","good","a","gabriel","the","whole","idea","suddenli","get","a","bite","ridicul","if","you","have","not","see","ani","of","thi","movi","then","get","the","movi","and","forget","about","the","sequel","thei","can","take","awai","all","of","the","joi","from","the","origin"],"filtered":["like","movi","thi","textbook","exampl","sequel","well","leav","draw","board","gener","idea","movi","great","littl","veri","interest","thi","sequel","try","build","upon","idea","charact","movi","though","christoph","walken","still","good","gabriel","whole","idea","suddenli","get","bite","ridicul","see","ani","thi","movi","get","movi","forget","sequel","thei","take","awai","joi","origin"],"filtered2":["like","textbook","exampl","sequel","well","leav","draw","board","gener","idea","great","littl","veri","interest","sequel","try","build","upon","idea","charact","though","christoph","walken","still","good","gabriel","whole","idea","suddenli","get","bite","ridicul","see","ani","get","forget","sequel","take","awai","joi","origin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,10,14,15,20,27,31,36,51,60,64,69,74,86,111,123,154,155,225,274,307,373,387,477,576,630,785,1162,1333,2184,2322,2784,5828],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,10,14,15,20,27,31,36,51,60,64,69,74,86,111,123,154,155,225,274,307,373,387,477,576,630,785,1162,1333,2184,2322,2784,5828],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.4680183469605717,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,1.9486336368009016,2.031112399272319,2.1183455303375887,6.785721291966146,2.348499626138016,2.3074766467914385,2.641219492619754,2.748952192422636,2.8767855639325206,3.0316467233633775,10.081558157970473,3.351345009714117,3.587125145032839,3.558633189238533,3.7952092507568174,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,5.0768550934009715,5.521540914662417,6.0662680901040895,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1665401235942866E-4,1.1586738708260721E-4,1.1676814553192656E-4,1.1609345794307037E-4,1.1609536000367213E-4,1.1593308189067285E-4,1.1627788311994372E-4,1.1588407122924692E-4,1.1614462086612471E-4,1.2885611676592394E-4,0.7739726543743435,1.1569700878866737E-4,1.1785643608389972E-4,1.1953768404194176E-4,1.1578137384053647E-4,1.1546140407820033E-4,1.1834144437256519E-4,1.1628877747988979E-4,1.1592799200076772E-4,1.1602407569449035E-4,1.1714667667632312E-4,1.1640399023178618E-4,1.1653653383389863E-4,1.1666208887847033E-4,1.175574104758266E-4,1.1694261831398186E-4,1.2185866382957985E-4,1.1573140444855857E-4,1.1573450053465634E-4,1.1602771323728047E-4,1.1849385511975722E-4,1.1628203953825529E-4,1.2481891899262292E-4,1.1660912375613222E-4,1.1585737287772289E-4,1.1639213102752011E-4,1.1574128089484483E-4,1.1580967547622513E-4,1.1546082399077079E-4,1.1549077985539163E-4,1.1575073556490488E-4,1.1697166055638906E-4,1.1637727839391007E-4,1.1591715516713178E-4,1.1732567014897248E-4,1.1596164480471128E-4,0.060879065320892496,0.15615406271300414,1.1551948562782928E-4,1.1577479075556817E-4,1.1573463569629914E-4,1.1899184339617248E-4,1.157765132637398E-4,1.1548052691323147E-4,1.167480909614705E-4,1.1580633422010214E-4,1.2453698500838282E-4,1.1571089475312313E-4,1.1551814971124942E-4,1.1606971497154433E-4,1.172210289944762E-4,1.160620362996835E-4,1.1549677859529766E-4,1.1576569515508115E-4,1.154622205098754E-4,1.1813377697493086E-4,1.1645687333922334E-4,1.1620880314822406E-4,1.1610717329775862E-4,1.165304024007118E-4,1.1545800826495402E-4,1.1610960743025697E-4,1.1799282818403935E-4,1.1566491542898528E-4,1.1852756182060893E-4,1.1597072171442576E-4,1.1687836673390038E-4,1.1616405757297285E-4,1.1542180877885702E-4,1.1556488203807541E-4]}}

{"value":"How did I ever appreciate this dud of a sequel? All it does is throw balls! Worst of all, it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series! The comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laughter go? Enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long. Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout. What's next, MAJOR LEAGUE 4: RETURN TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE? Ehh, could be! Leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game.
