{"value":"1) I am not weapon expert, but even i can see difference between U.S. army riffles in WWI and WWII. In movie we can see privates, armed with \"M1 Garand\" (invented in year 1932!), not authentic \"1903 Springfield\" (aka \"Silent Death\"), who privates use until WWII. Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 was semi - automatic, Springfield requires reloading after every shot. Little difference?! 2) German army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 Year too. Especially - helmets. German helmets until end of WWI have significant pike on top, we cannot see even one in movie. And if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this \"True Story\"? I am surprised, how much \"truthful\" can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","weapon","expert","but","even","i","can","see","differ","between","u","armi","riffl","in","wwi","and","wwii","in","movi","we","can","see","privat","arm","with","be","garand","invent","in","year","not","authent","springfield","aka","silent","death","who","privat","us","until","wwii","differ","be","can","load","time","much","ammunit","and","time","much","fire","rate","be","be","semi","automat","springfield","requir","reload","after","everi","shoot","littl","differ","german","armi","uniform","have","borrow","from","year","too","especi","helmet","german","helmet","until","end","of","wwi","have","signific","pike","on","top","we","cannot","see","even","on","in","movi","and","if","we","make","littl","addit","search","in","archiv","how","much","truth","be","thi","true","stori","i","be","surpris","how","much","truth","can","be","film","director","in","a","pursuit","of","cheap","propag"],"filtered":["weapon","expert","even","see","differ","u","armi","riffl","wwi","wwii","movi","see","privat","arm","garand","invent","year","authent","springfield","aka","silent","death","privat","us","wwii","differ","load","time","much","ammunit","time","much","fire","rate","semi","automat","springfield","requir","reload","everi","shoot","littl","differ","german","armi","uniform","borrow","year","especi","helmet","german","helmet","end","wwi","signific","pike","top","see","even","movi","make","littl","addit","search","archiv","much","truth","thi","true","stori","surpris","much","truth","film","director","pursuit","cheap","propag"],"filtered2":["weapon","expert","even","see","differ","u","armi","riffl","wwi","wwii","see","privat","arm","garand","invent","year","authent","springfield","aka","silent","death","privat","us","wwii","differ","load","time","ammunit","time","fire","rate","semi","automat","springfield","requir","reload","everi","shoot","littl","differ","german","armi","uniform","borrow","year","especi","helmet","german","helmet","end","wwi","signific","pike","top","see","even","make","littl","addit","search","archiv","truth","true","stori","surpris","truth","director","pursuit","cheap","propag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,8,14,17,24,56,57,58,85,112,117,202,204,245,267,304,326,351,364,551,758,924,982,989,992,1089,1185,1225,1279,1296,1636,1689,1714,1746,1940,1962,2263,2389,2713,3172,4417,4443,4567,4996,5015,6418],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,8,14,17,24,56,57,58,85,112,117,202,204,245,267,304,326,351,364,551,758,924,982,989,992,1089,1185,1225,1279,1296,1636,1689,1714,1746,1940,1962,2263,2389,2713,3172,4417,4443,4567,4996,5015,6418],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,1.852034211452262,1.8837873718108231,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.8610609350701788,3.668325173349496,1.865701314626681,2.011190219103739,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.597304642813496,7.873573842142752,2.7502029743242886,2.7085302779237206,2.871119826396843,2.942840385588056,3.0135689919434205,2.9878441007049847,3.528202072035993,7.648184249811207,8.679627438567602,8.310898521720091,4.044492190274062,4.091229668125752,4.2078172463773615,4.235066888824737,4.470719289830655,4.470719289830655,4.370968887063596,4.679973728984199,9.48443207572284,4.724033718778229,4.74221603786142,4.8796870284900224,4.8796870284900224,5.064116067623542,5.170884043049248,5.408212229355414,11.253802860640487,5.967828017290836,6.2980697041614135,6.032366538428407,6.2980697041614135,12.596139408322827,13.451027437976705]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9201271465378624E-4,1.918425624800675E-4,1.9188992989069276E-4,1.9185135387677748E-4,1.9186951033173366E-4,1.918415047180535E-4,1.919011700894163E-4,1.9181296183106016E-4,1.9184260302403192E-4,1.9204085156612047E-4,0.09160431931223519,1.9184291989840296E-4,1.920246072667787E-4,1.920446129179041E-4,1.9195737206466524E-4,1.918521095514928E-4,1.9191811409701812E-4,1.920084314139817E-4,1.9186201404870204E-4,1.9186131258214274E-4,1.9203392099871166E-4,1.9188053512690645E-4,1.9188082552146747E-4,1.9200374643273224E-4,1.9186208325816162E-4,1.9204690832504064E-4,1.919100960016601E-4,1.9184213252107849E-4,1.9192910554560405E-4,1.9198768507521278E-4,1.9188147633198644E-4,1.9198424387219213E-4,1.9207850334308129E-4,1.9225678197762143E-4,1.9190976437561888E-4,1.9185199319014703E-4,1.9192116666833794E-4,1.9187147755165315E-4,1.9181316655584118E-4,1.918619546321585E-4,1.9205423309796694E-4,1.9194887926185606E-4,1.919846813712058E-4,1.9182271307573018E-4,1.9186200341779318E-4,1.918519210464725E-4,1.9191686118228806E-4,1.9195013980589327E-4,1.9191110782963277E-4,1.9188068957998294E-4,1.918523954815312E-4,1.9224546988352674E-4,1.9190067107067942E-4,1.9186195944326557E-4,1.9189964337150986E-4,1.918423288016594E-4

{"value":"This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded.

{"value":"Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was \"Return To Cabin By The Lake\" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original \"Cabin By The Lake\" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone.

{"value":"I watched 'Envy' two nights ago, on DVD, at a friends house. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but it completely fails to deliver. I watched it with about five friends and no-one laughed for the entire film. The jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way... the story line is crap, and they never answer the question... WHERE DOES THE SH*T GO? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any sort of comedy value, and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J-man.

{"value":"I was glad to watch this movie free of charge as I am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and directing. How can a movie as this one ever be made. The director should be blacklisted, and for all the poor actors, it is for sure not a jumping board into a career. Please make sure that you'll not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and directing awful. There are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the \"LOW 10\". Another example would be \"Dracula 3000\".

But imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thriller/giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation. If you want to hear \"You're OK. It's good to be you.\" after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters' negative emotions, then this is for you. If you want a good sci-fi flick that is simply fun to watch, forget this one. Both the original, and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me. All that, AND this movie was too preachy.","finished_norm":["thi","anim","seri","start","out","great","interest","stori","excit","event","interest","charact","beautifulli","render","and","execut","not","everyth","be","explain","right","awai","dangl","a","proverbi","carrot","befor","the","viewer","entic","the","viewer","to","watch","each","succ","episod","but","imagin","the","disappoint","to","find","that","the","scifi","thrillergi","robot","adventur","be","onli","a","backdrop","for","psychobabbl","and","quasireligi","preachi","exploit","if","you","want","to","hear","you","re","okai","it","good","to","be","you","after","be","embattl","with","neg","slogan","and","the","charact","neg","emot","then","thi","be","for","you","if","you","want","a","good","scifi","flick","that","be","simpli","fun","to","watch","forget","thi","on","both","the","origin","and","the","altern","end","be","grossli","disappoint","to","me","all","that","and","thi","movi","be","too","preachi"],"filtered":["thi","anim","seri","start","great","interest","stori","excit","event","interest","charact","beautifulli","render","execut","everyth","explain","right","awai","dangl","proverbi","carrot","befor","viewer","entic","viewer","watch","succ","episod","imagin","disappoint","find","scifi","thrillergi","robot","adventur","onli","backdrop","psychobabbl","quasireligi","preachi","exploit","want","hear","re","okai","good","embattl","neg","slogan","charact","neg","emot","thi","want","good","scifi","flick","simpli","fun","watch","forget","thi","origin","altern","end","grossli","disappoint","thi","movi","preachi"],"filtered2":["anim","start","great","interest","stori","excit","event","interest","charact","beautifulli","render","execut","everyth","explain","right","awai","dangl","proverbi","carrot","befor","viewer","entic","viewer","watch","succ","imagin","disappoint","find","scifi","thrillergi","robot","adventur","onli","backdrop","psychobabbl","quasireligi","preachi","exploit","want","hear","re","okai","good","embattl","neg","slogan","charact","neg","emot","want","good","scifi","flick","simpli","fun","watch","forget","origin","altern","end","grossli","disappoint","preachi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,10,11,17,24,37,38,51,60,68,69,71,79,121,155,187,191,193,201,216,257,259,277,279,340,372,395,470,506,524,662,781,918,1076,1139,1147,1154,1786,2443,2778,3001,4102,5698,5748,5957,6022],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,10,11,17,24,37,38,51,60,68,69,71,79,121,155,187,191,193,201,216,257,259,277,279,340,372,395,470,506,524,662,781,918,1076,1139,1147,1154,1786,2443,2778,3001,4102,5698,5748,5957,6022],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.9218995441445863,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,2.975308642954861,1.519311641348122,1.7139899308309823,3.676353282473182,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,1.9214926742550966,1.9469506069506084,2.2190595059394194,2.3074766467914385,4.946432381978511,2.5460113484259455,2.517840471459249,2.561435818751577,2.6070186965339692,2.7602659523229094,2.7464553122240485,3.1163992333432793,5.5821542374466135,2.948928684455311,3.0316467233633775,3.153168081130368,3.3814747511661465,3.449627639403373,3.4028786598293,3.616452760127359,7.872791389594723,4.039936373738201,4.202455303235976,4.186539847930077,8.492356228499617,4.589376833631972,4.798834931860927,5.185068678041204,5.339219357868463,5.444579873526289,11.874112717248165,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.437831646536572,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961301E-4,2.116930065387446E-4,2.1174527517734903E-4,2.117027076039157E-4,2.1172274275403085E-4,2.116918393273706E-4,2.117576784283853E-4,2.1166034303434365E-4,2.1169305127789745E-4,2.119118131072543E-4,2.1359327166514615E-4,2.1169340094007584E-4,2.1189388796842007E-4,2.119159636557949E-4,2.1181969576676975E-4,2.117035414702402E-4,2.1177637567609546E-4,2.118760383584709E-4,2.1171447081128614E-4,2.1171369676217526E-4,2.1190416541618502E-4,2.1173490831315615E-4,2.1173522875559035E-4,2.1187086861014468E-4,2.1171454718202677E-4,2.1191849657462003E-4,2.1176752792775898E-4,2.1169253209079157E-4,2.1178850443817667E-4,2.1185314534259426E-4,2.1173594690714997E-4,2.1184934806943375E-4,2.1195336081055499E-4,2.1215008639459396E-4,2.1176716198751712E-4,2.1170341306868626E-4,2.117797441048321E-4,2.1172491352726227E-4,2.1166056894252505E-4,2.1171440524675981E-4,2.1192657926066708E-4,2.1181032419177943E-4,2.118498308375972E-4,2.1167110326541545E-4,2.1171445908036977E-4,2.117033334601199E-4,2.117749931190512E-4,2.1181171516755485E-4,2.117686444521781E-4,2.117350787478903E-4,2.1170385698619613E-4,2.1213760380898734E-4,2.1175712777489442E-4,2.1171441055568453E-4,2.117559937370448E-4,2.1169274868102977E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850268E-4,2.1170415419131505E-4,2.1169262784

{"value":"This should be a great film... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols directing. Uh uh. It's dull dull dull! Pointless and predictable! Slow and unfocused!<br /><br />It's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy' story. Now theres an original concept! After squirming through two hours (was it only two? It felt like six.)I wasn't sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget. I hope the damage to the reputations of Streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade. It's not that it's such a bad picture.

{"value":"Boy oh boy oh golly gee,<br /><br />The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create Mom's \"invisibility.\" They looked like they were shot on cheap video, and it looks totally unreal, and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie...<br /><br />I did NOT end up loving this movie. The attempted \"steadicam\" shots were really pathetic as well. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget flick, that's fine. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, a BAD movie and a low budget AND effects. That makes for a bad combination.

Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and, Mary Beth Hughes (as the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as the brunette Betty) are pretty women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are quite tuneful; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film doesn't exactly \"rock\". There are a few laughs; but the Stooges' brand of humor is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /><br />**** Rockin' in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth

{"value":"If utterly facile, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilisation juvenilia appeals to you, then this is the ideal film. Very poorly scripted, with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand-held camera throughout, this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic, Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive and bumbling at best, and predatory monsters at worst. The only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming (yawn) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the woods, with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again, in the woods (naturally...).

{"value":"I was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of Tigerland. It was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be. The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things Colin Farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers.<br /><br />I kept thinking, \"Hey, there's a reason why boot camp is tough. It's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit. There's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders.\" I was rooting for Bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers.

{"value":"Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last flick, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of. I missed part of this early '90s low-budget quickie, but it was pleasing to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various, gruesome ways. Problem is, the overall film is pretty static, and Cordell simply ain't Jason or Freddy. The interest wanes pretty fast, even with that grand B-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled.

{"value":"I am a great fan of David Lynch and have everything that he's made on DVD except for Hotel Room & the 2 hour Twin Peaks movie. So, when I found out about this, I immediately grabbed it and...and...what IS this? It's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. Maybe I don't know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks, too. Let me make it clear that I didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. All in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity.

{"value":"I did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the TMNT to be four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like Leonardo , Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello so Venus here doesn't have any meaning or playing any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much more better than that new one which contains Venus As a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the TMNT we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we wish to see more new of TMNT series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","like","the","idea","of","the","femal","turtl","at","all","sinc","we","know","the","tmnt","to","be","four","brother","with","their","teacher","splinter","and","their","enemi","and","each","on","of","the","four","brother","be","name","after","the","great","artist","name","like","leonardo","michelangleo","raphel","and","donatello","so","venu","here","doe","not","have","ani","mean","or","plai","ani","import","part","and","i","believ","that","the","old","tmnt","seri","be","much","much","well","than","that","new","on","which","contain","venu","a","a","femal","turtl","will","not","add","ani","action","to","the","stori","we","like","the","stori","of","the","tmnt","we","know","in","to","have","new","enemi","in","everi","part","be","a","good","point","to","have","some","action","but","to","have","a","femal","turtl","be","a","veri","weak","point","to","have","some","action","we","wish","to","see","much","new","of","tmnt","seri","but","just","a","the","same","charact","we","know","in","without","that","femal","turtl"],"filtered":["like","idea","femal","turtl","sinc","know","tmnt","four","brother","teacher","splinter","enemi","four","brother","name","great","artist","name","like","leonardo","michelangleo","raphel","donatello","venu","doe","ani","mean","plai","ani","import","part","believ","old","tmnt","seri","much","much","well","new","contain","venu","femal","turtl","add","ani","action","stori","like","stori","tmnt","know","new","enemi","everi","part","good","point","action","femal","turtl","veri","weak","point","action","wish","see","much","new","tmnt","seri","charact","know","without","femal","turtl"],"filtered2":["like","idea","femal","turtl","sinc","know","tmnt","four","brother","teacher","splinter","enemi","four","brother","name","great","artist","name","like","leonardo","michelangleo","raphel","donatello","venu","doe","ani","mean","plai","ani","import","part","believ","old","tmnt","well","new","contain","venu","femal","turtl","add","ani","action","stori","like","stori","tmnt","know","new","enemi","everi","part","good","point","action","femal","turtl","veri","weak","point","action","wish","see","new","tmnt","charact","know","without","femal","turtl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,10,15,17,18,20,26,27,40,51,61,66,67,85,87,88,91,123,125,129,143,162,299,379,381,399,422,600,606,711,724,1114,1564,3526,6230],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,10,15,17,18,20,26,27,40,51,61,66,67,85,87,88,91,123,125,129,143,162,299,379,381,399,422,600,606,711,724,1114,1564,3526,6230],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,3.9974772509130565,3.9008101766037884,1.6284968758320737,1.7139899308309823,3.7637034094785053,3.859446346783224,1.9570915389266579,2.011190219103739,6.345073114567986,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,7.232087502023765,4.681980408231769,2.3586007221245198,2.7949961309240425,3.1272886331425473,6.49883005830616,3.129115117668582,12.836021963260814,3.558633189238533,7.168478280287408,3.6375061693251913,3.7987743169213135,4.364659717870332,9.448067437556459,25.192278816645654,13.321950395701563]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079207E-4,1.9803239209117206E-4,1.980812878185436E-4,1.9804146714364108E-4,1.9806020941939256E-4,1.9803130020030492E-4,1.9809289068399759E-4,1.9800183637269856E-4,1.9803243394329368E-4,1.9823707900490487E-4,1.9981003252786668E-4,1.9803276104166475E-4,1.982203105807611E-4,1.9824096171727892E-4,1.9815090602457122E-4,1.9804224720031664E-4,1.981103813925954E-4,1.9820361281160033E-4,1.9805247126764271E-4,1.9805174716815764E-4,1.9822992482167894E-4,1.9807158993126727E-4,1.9807188969545318E-4,1.9819877666871452E-4,1.980525427101561E-4,1.982433311860777E-4,1.981021045921647E-4,1.9803194825949053E-4,1.9812172748195054E-4,1.9818219708903892E-4,1.9807256150447308E-4,1.9817864485507664E-4,1.9827594562220628E-4,1.9845997644414863E-4,1.9810176226615854E-4,1.9804212708455425E-4,1.9811353245559562E-4,1.9806224011196353E-4,1.9800204770295594E-4,1.980524099340153E-4,1.9825089229392242E-4,1.9814213920018084E-4,1.9817909647006288E-4,1.9801190224276883E-4,1.9805246029372595E-4,1.9804205261315304E-4,1.9810908805238003E-4,1.9814344041586414E-4,1.9810314906692163E-4,1.980717493677959E-4,1.9804254235593146E-4,1.9844829936360836E-4,1.9809237556434487E-4,1.9805241490035352E-4,1.9809131470630446E-4,1.980321508730944E-4,0.9843481445040683,1.9806304719570568E-4,1.9804282038231316E-4,1.980320378312925E-4,1.9819046821197678E-4,1.981109095898442E-4,1.9803195504870095E-4,1.9801182156824228E-4,1.9799190929230994E-4,1.9817092532011682E-4,1.9804165649106446E-4,1.9813167886213596E-4,1.9818982548702854E-4,1.9809991061988E-

{"value":"The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting. <br /><br />I even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in England. Can he not insinuate himself on the Australian police? It seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation.<br /><br />The latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on silliness, and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one.

{"value":"As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies. For example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from the truth! But of course Hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they *add* some more blood and guts. Some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what Hollywood has always done so why complain?

{"value":"I have seen many good Korean Movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone, but this one sucks. The director seems to be a sadist, who happened to get someone to produce some junk. The movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can't believe someone really made such a movie. Even though acting is OK, the story line and the feeling it leaves is awful.<br /><br />I am sure, I am not going to see any movies of this director. No sense of movie making, and utter disappointment in having thriller moments. All this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling.

{"value":"One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called \"Pon\". One Missed Call was just as boring as that one. Maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was dull and drab. No tension or thrills for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. The movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, and felt too long. Didn't keep my attention. It seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie. And it is ridiculous to compare this with \"The Ring\", it seems every Asian horror movie is compared to it and so far I haven't seen any that measure up in the least.

{"value":"Designed only to annoy (or amuse) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character, then it would have been okay, but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who'd make a critique of America's pro-Marxist 60s movement, especially not a filmmaker from the 70s. There is so much idiotic dialog going on here, that sometimes I wondered if I wasn't actually watching a comedy. You wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  that's how naïve the movie appears. Spacek has been in her share of Leftist movies which brings me to the obvious, inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those Hollywood liberal morons. But, I mean, aren't they all?

{"value":"I think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. Hydrogen filled flying bladders? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just don't try to pass it off as fact. Some folks will always misunderstand. All in all the film is entertaining, but I constantly found myself saying \"oh brother, what a load of ....\". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead.

{"value":"I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while. The plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way. The only plus to be found anywhere in the film are Corey Savier's impressive abs. Alexandra Paul (i think that's her name) is horrendous as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is gross and his character's a twit on top of it all. And as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son isn't enough, they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity! The end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable.

{"value":"If it wasn't for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />The plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion, which takes place in a supposed abandon high school(looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick), and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on. This student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge.<br /><br />John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much, as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady(Goonies' Anne Ramsey). We're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed, but never see a blasted thing! This is a horrible movie that continued National Lampoon's downward spiral throughout the 80s and

{"value":"I can't understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splatter, you will love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - don't watch this. Personally i really disliked the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street. The Dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next. The overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind, that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort. Another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recored with a single

{"value":"I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there's really not much to talk of. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better sword & sorcery epics. Lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality. Even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.Mildly amusing in it's ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it's worst. Lucio Fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it shows.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Posters & Stills galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US & International Theatrical

{"value":"I have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show. I had it set to record all episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new things. I probably could if I could get past Rachelle.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer. It doesn't work for someone who's really interested in improving the planet.<br /><br />This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle.<br /><br />Since Ed is such a great font of information, maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea.

{"value":"This series had potential, but I suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential. An interesting setup, not dissimilar to \"lost\" it falls flat after the 1st episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90 minute film, but the makers chose to drag it on and on. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work overall. There were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well, one grew a bit. The ending was as terrible as the rest of series.

{"value":"From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. Sound familiar? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés (deformed hicks, a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show, the rebellious daughter, the one 'freak' who's good at heart, etcetera...), but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. This is forgettable dreck, but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called \"Films that Suck\" earlier in his career, quite an ironic omen indeed.<br /><br />My Grade:
