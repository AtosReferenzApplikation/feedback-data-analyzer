{"value":"Considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. This could be quite possibly the most worthless movie I have ever watched. There was no real advancement of anything. Character development, minimal. Plot advancement, maybe. Enjoyment, none. I'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, American CIA bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. For those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. In summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.","finished_norm":["consid","how","much","monei","be","budget","for","thi","film","you","would","expect","much","from","the","stori","a","a","whole","thi","can","be","quit","possibli","the","much","worthless","movi","i","have","ever","watch","there","be","no","real","advanc","of","anyth","charact","develop","minim","plot","advanc","mayb","enjoy","none","i","be","not","sure","what","point","be","even","try","to","be","make","if","you","want","to","see","a","movi","where","terrorist","be","kinda","good","gui","american","cia","bomb","everyth","that","doe","not","agre","with","our","opinion","all","capitalist","be","corrupt","and","you","like","to","see","anyth","resembl","a","storyboard","advanc","accompani","by","a","death","have","at","for","that","of","u","who","realiz","that","it","doe","not","take","kill","off","a","good","gui","to","make","a","point","we","will","stick","to","other","movi","in","summari","thi","be","a","horribl","attempt","at","a","ocean","styl","hidetheplotsopersonhasto","think","movi","becaus","not","onli","do","you","not","know","what","go","on","nobodi","who","make","the","movi","do","either","home","alon","be","a","well","cinemat","piec"],"filtered":["consid","much","monei","budget","thi","film","expect","much","stori","whole","thi","quit","possibli","much","worthless","movi","ever","watch","real","advanc","anyth","charact","develop","minim","plot","advanc","mayb","enjoy","none","sure","point","even","try","make","want","see","movi","terrorist","kinda","good","gui","american","cia","bomb","everyth","doe","agre","opinion","capitalist","corrupt","like","see","anyth","resembl","storyboard","advanc","accompani","death","u","realiz","doe","take","kill","good","gui","make","point","stick","movi","summari","thi","horribl","attempt","ocean","styl","hidetheplotsopersonhasto","think","movi","becaus","onli","know","go","nobodi","make","movi","either","home","alon","well","cinemat","piec"],"filtered2":["consid","monei","budget","expect","stori","whole","quit","possibli","worthless","ever","watch","real","advanc","anyth","charact","develop","minim","plot","advanc","mayb","enjoy","none","sure","point","even","try","make","want","see","terrorist","kinda","good","gui","american","cia","bomb","everyth","doe","agre","opinion","capitalist","corrupt","like","see","anyth","resembl","storyboard","advanc","accompani","death","u","realiz","doe","take","kill","good","gui","make","point","stick","summari","horribl","attempt","ocean","styl","hidetheplotsopersonhasto","think","becaus","onli","know","go","nobodi","make","either","home","alon","well","cinemat","piec"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,12,17,18,20,22,26,31,32,36,37,44,55,66,76,80,104,111,112,119,120,126,130,163,177,193,207,218,223,230,245,256,302,317,320,370,380,405,416,457,538,558,622,737,866,1053,1079,1093,1397,1747,1783,1812,1838,1890,2066,2314,2910,3325,5044],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,12,17,18,20,22,26,31,32,36,37,44,55,66,76,80,104,111,112,119,120,126,130,163,177,193,207,218,223,230,245,256,302,317,320,370,380,405,416,457,538,558,622,737,866,1053,1079,1093,1397,1747,1783,1812,1838,1890,2066,2314,2910,3325,5044],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,3.9073995778510735,3.859446346783224,2.1337665533324026,1.9951803900462557,4.145648034064571,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.4000574358028657,2.458149992634611,2.517840471459249,2.5531798379045583,2.5940874818617203,2.825563294794476,2.7121382192999195,2.7502029743242886,2.748952192422636,2.902686292364678,2.8529247828056143,2.938298364153555,2.9958122703541616,3.102062070196872,3.109204957709252,3.1401446412440817,3.3243163373261977,3.43462735814388,3.4572130107926293,3.4933926673701317,3.68099128126493,3.8962296530720266,4.067587905068712,4.280272325592784,4.150360191352575,4.422928625994308,14.22664811358426,4.869215728622727,5.014723312293965,4.760735085628657,4.85885294158718,4.933754249760298,5.039114765418124,5.850044981634453,5.649374286172302,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.575428747215113E-4,1.5740326801559032E-4,1.57442132098375E-4,1.57410481193702E-4,1.5742537822858695E-4,1.5740240014145625E-4,1.574513544731669E-4,1.5737898123152684E-4,1.574033012811619E-4,1.575659605367549E-4,1.5881

{"value":"Miraculously, this is actually quite watchable. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But whereas the original was so-bad-it's-ruining-my-life bad, this is so-bad-it's-mildly-entertaining bad. Right, that's enough faint praise. Production values are rotten across the board, the acting is excruciating and the Romero-wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence it's mocking. Internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges, virus incubation times fluctuating as the 'plot' requires, bullets working against the zombies or not, zombies having the power of speech or not. Gore is the draw, obviously, but the framework is so slapdash it's annoying. The dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals, and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of Romero's films. It's all topped off with a horrendous synth score.

{"value":"This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? No. the Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.<br /><br />Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />The show is also extremely cheesy. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's overkill.<br /><br />For kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it.

{"value":"Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched 'special effects'. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release.

{"value":"What can I say. A Kamal Hassan movie being horrible. He acts very well, but it is a horrible story, along with horrible direction. In my kind opinion, the director Gautham Menon must give up directing. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. Apart from that, one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes. There was no practicality in the movie. Gautham is just running out of stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika act really well. The villains look too ugly, though their performance was not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa which you can see with the family. You will not get sleep seeing this movie!! However, Harris Jayaraj again did a great job, and that is why I have given this movie 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is soulful and soothing. Apart from that, great cinematography. On the whole, this is just a bad, bad movie.

{"value":"This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but \"white\" as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. The bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie.

{"value":"If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins, too (see my remarks on My Girl 1 for the reference).<br /><br />Indulgent admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just viewed its predecessor. But as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother, My Girl 2 made me look, with its theme of searching for mother.<br /><br />Put another way, anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with My Girl 2, but relating to a protagonist who asks, like so many adoptees, \"who's my mama\"? And if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe, I'll be sure to make my own movie about it.<br /><br />People are listless. Movies should not be listless.

{"value":"About time they released this movie on DVD. I know some say WB rush the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls movie. But, how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound. come on WB, you can do much better then this. The audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help.<br /><br />Seem WB didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales. They could have kept the CD which by the way dose not have all the songs the original CD has. <br /><br />Would I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it is a classic film. But WB need to go add some more special feature. Take notes from other group movies, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation were you may view just the performance, and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this

{"value":"They screwed up this story! In the end Nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads getting chopped, wires cutting peoples faces, and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is that about??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person. They cannot kill us, they cannot throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us mad. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have taken a crap on this great story!

{"value":"Well let me say that I have always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest. This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like it all. The biggest reason I don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense. The acting is very bad even Steven seagal does not do good acting, The rest of the actors I can see because they just do direct to video movies. It does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense. Ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it. The special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake. So all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist.

{"value":"This movie is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script. He has little to add to his Arnie-act.<br /><br />Michael York is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat. Watching him revisit his D'Artagnan-act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy. Come on, you can do better than that!<br /><br />The story is full of holes and unexplained relations; top of this bill is the informer of Vlad, who sounds like an American woman, but from the context appears to be working for a Russian government-department.<br /><br />Although the story takes place well after the end of the Communist-regime, all the Russian characters are still very communist-like. In contradiction to that, Vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police-car.

{"value":"I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And this went on and on. If Mr. McElwee's family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee's family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwee's continual focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco. The countless references to the movie \"Bright Leaves\" are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee's great grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film?

{"value":"This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story. Stella is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither ever learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /><br />Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. \"I can't have our child living this way!\" Spare me. <br /><br />This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes.

{"value":"Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a stereotype. We had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors.

{"value":"I was not expecting much going in to this, but still came away disappointed. This was my least favorite Halestorm production I have seen. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over? What was up with the janitor in Heaven scene? Fred Willard has been hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but this did not work. They must have spent all the budget on getting \"known\" actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. Does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket? I try not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny go to a real Church basketball game instead of this movie.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","expect","much","go","in","to","thi","but","still","come","awai","disappoint","thi","be","my","littl","favorit","halestorm","product","i","have","see","i","think","it","be","suppos","to","be","a","comedi","but","i","onli","snicker","at","or","joke","be","it","realli","a","funni","gag","to","see","a","fat","gui","eat","donut","and","fall","down","over","and","over","what","be","up","with","the","janitor","in","heaven","scene","fred","willard","have","be","hilari","with","some","of","hi","christoph","guest","collabor","but","thi","do","not","work","thei","must","have","spend","all","the","budget","on","get","know","actor","to","appear","in","thi","becaus","there","be","no","light","budget","it","look","like","it","be","film","with","a","video","camera","and","much","scene","be","veri","dark","doe","it","realli","take","that","much","film","to","show","someon","actual","shoot","and","make","a","basket","a","oppos","to","cut","awai","and","edit","a","ball","swish","through","a","basket","i","try","not","to","be","too","critic","of","low","budget","comedi","but","if","you","want","to","see","someth","funni","go","to","a","real","church","basketbal","game","instead","of","thi","movi"],"filtered":["expect","much","go","thi","still","come","awai","disappoint","thi","littl","favorit","halestorm","product","see","think","suppos","comedi","onli","snicker","joke","realli","funni","gag","see","fat","gui","eat","donut","fall","janitor","heaven","scene","fred","willard","hilari","hi","christoph","guest","collabor","thi","work","thei","must","spend","budget","get","know","actor","appear","thi","becaus","light","budget","look","like","film","video","camera","much","scene","veri","dark","doe","realli","take","much","film","show","someon","actual","shoot","make","basket","oppos","cut","awai","edit","ball","swish","basket","try","critic","low","budget","comedi","want","see","someth","funni","go","real","church","basketbal","game","instead","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["expect","go","still","come","awai","disappoint","littl","favorit","halestorm","product","see","think","suppos","comedi","onli","snicker","joke","realli","funni","gag","see","fat","gui","eat","donut","fall","janitor","heaven","scene","fred","willard","hilari","christoph","guest","collabor","work","must","spend","budget","get","know","actor","appear","becaus","light","budget","look","like","video","camera","scene","veri","dark","doe","realli","take","show","someon","actual","shoot","make","basket","oppos","cut","awai","edit","ball","swish","basket","try","critic","low","budget","comedi","want","see","someth","funni","go","real","church","basketbal","game","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,22,26,28,31,34,36,37,41,48,52,53,55,62,64,80,117,127,130,139,141,149,152,155,169,170,187,190,214,217,231,240,256,283,303,348,353,368,374,579,599,632,822,998,1130,1151,1162,1309,1496,1543,2018,2356,3218,3408,4580,7129,7585,7651],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,22,26,28,31,34,36,37,41,48,52,53,55,62,64,80,117,127,130,139,141,149,152,155,169,170,187,190,214,217,231,240,256,283,303,348,353,368,374,579,599,632,822,998,1130,1151,1162,1309,1496,1543,2018,2356,3218,3408,4580,7129,7585,7651],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,2.62476135602347,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,4.045224089013853,1.883428577602134,1.9951803900462557,2.2797301185117202,4.871935874217273,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.3253197803590226,2.3131195476980753,4.614953293582877,2.4071371113909277,2.4214486257841834,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.7303758068497004,2.6113665294700725,2.7049353070058615,2.7666071276613566,8.24685657726791,2.7678802023081546,2.868298950055202,3.0103169565570433,3.0266839340212486,3.1346146732346205,3.4572130107926293,3.5642670069567886,3.6254214301101193,3.541919708264792,3.813163054373413,4.135246553542527,4.416284083275639,4.3336974922663645,4.383707912841026,4.506310234933358,4.9676558014359795,4.706176101378222,4.979216623837056,5.129498826886393,5.695894301807195,12.778082964734281,6.032366538428407,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.4985657968503763E-4,1.4972378419373153E-

{"value":"The script for \"Scary Movie 2\" just wasn't ready to go. This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident, to the actors and the audience alike. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans, and many of the actors are funny people; and so the movie isn't completely humorless. To their credit, the film has several funny moments. But as a whole, \"Scary Movie 2\" is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original.<br /><br />The first \"Scary Movie\" was a laugh a minute film. It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold. The humor in \"Scary Movie 2\" is as heavy handed as it is un-original. They even miss obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the movies stars are former cast members of \"Beverly Hills 90210,\" and this was a show that was begging to be parodied! In the final analysis, \"Scary Movie 2\" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon.

{"value":"The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />While I have scored many episodes 10, this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The writing was in fact embarrassingly bad. Two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode. After a while, it's apparent that they are the only two people left on Earth--as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion.

{"value":"The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick, a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very loud over acting by both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie, Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again!<br /><br />summarising it: a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance, the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! movie shot all in one room, new comers (female cast) were okay as it was their first film but

{"value":"I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out.<br /><br />Well my guess is that Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film.<br /><br />Apparently, if your script and dialogs are terrible, even good actors cannot save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film. Too many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers, reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie. It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound. The music is awful and totally out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play.<br /><br />I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies.

{"value":"Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have his chilly, detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely

{"value":"Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to make a connect. <br /><br />Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law. <br /><br />Maybe it is because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been cast the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be).<br /><br />Either way this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation (that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin), which while having promise fails to deliver.<br /><br />There are some laughs to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic. So instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie Animal House or American Pie) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or

By night an alleged space port and by day (night and day on a space station?) a warehouse!??!? People Please! The only thing I will commend this movie for, is the wardrobe dept. for continuously, keeping Natassia in those tight shape revealing outfits! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into, each day of filming! The Sci-fi channel would have been better off showing SpaceBalls! At least there would have been some real humor in watching something so unbelievable.<br /><br />P.S. Michael Ironside, please Fire Your Agent ASAP!

{"value":"This is meant to be a comedy but mainly bad taste, and nothing remotely causing a smile in the film. The movie is about a couple trying for a child, and those people in real life who are in that situation will wince at the depictions that are portrayed. For instance scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing. The male lead who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat comes across as a poor excuse for a reject from Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. Both leads come across as unappealing,unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are various ridiculous and totally unassuming gratuitous scenes in the film, for example with a budget airline, which is devoid of any humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is one mark for Shirley Maclaine, who is a a class above anything else in the pic, and one mark for some half decent(albeit old)

{"value":"Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about black, gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay. Hence, when they discover women or \"female creatures\" live on Earth, they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population.<br /><br />An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist storyline, albeit probably intended as a satire, give this film some shock value. However, there's little substance underneath. As another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes besides the characters' names (eg. ArmInAss); I think I laughed once at one small gay joke. I think I got the point of the film quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had had enough; I kept wanting the film to end already (and it is a short film!).

{"value":"Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is a over-hyped, stylized, product. Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland. Thumbs down! <br /><br />Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he okay a role like this? Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he's the sole saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his due in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.<br /><br />'Tashan' is a boring film.

{"value":"Well this is a typical \"straight to the toilet\" slasher film.<br /><br />Long story short, a bunch of teenagers/young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons.<br /><br />This movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage:<br /><br />-Naked women, -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky, -gory death scenes, -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff, but never bra less, -a creepy, crazy man who knows about the evil, -lesbian kiss scene, -sex being a killer, -no plot<br /><br />Even then for a cheesy slasher film, it was really terrible. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested.

{"value":"I first saw this when I was around 7. I remembered what I believed to be a vague outline of what took place. Turns out now, 15 years later, that I remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story. There is no plot to this movie/cartoon. There is no character development, no back story, no character arcs, nothing. The good guys do things because they are good, while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad. One unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least. They just shrug their shoulders and move on. There's barely any dialogue either. If you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie.<br /><br />Watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason.

{"value":"A friend of mine bought this film for £1, and even then it was grossly overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.<br /><br />Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all

{"value":"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like \"Sling Blade\", \"A Simple Plan\" and \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: \"Knock Knock\", \"Who's there?\", \"The big stinking man\", \"The big stinking man who?\", \"The big stinking man - is YOU!\". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it.

Turkish people and persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not arabic..<br /><br />I suppose for making a film like this- documentary type- a

{"value":"In this paranoia-driven potboiler, our reporter hero battles hindersome authorities, duplicitous co-workers, renegade UFO debunkers, and silent, skulking aliens. (Though capable of mind control and zapping objects from afar, it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The script clomps from event to event,leaving puzzlers aplenty. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why do they fry the soldiers with radiation when they're only patrolling an empty landing site? And what space dudes worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model? Inquiring minds want to know! Writer-director Mario Gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming a stack of UFO-themed tabloids as he took in a Sunn Classics double feature.

{"value":"Surely no Saturday morning TV kids' show was ever done this poorly. After all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well, in this awful offering, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial, with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline, so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history.
