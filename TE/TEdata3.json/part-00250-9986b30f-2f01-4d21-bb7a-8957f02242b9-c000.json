{"value":"Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder, just who in the world greenlit this crap. A newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon, get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people. And where exactly are they? They're in the desert, then they're skiing, then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy. The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this movie. I guess you have to start somewhere.","finished_norm":["watch","it","live","by","night","make","you","wonder","just","who","in","the","world","greenlit","thi","crap","a","newlyw","coupl","go","spelunk","on","their","honeymoon","get","attack","by","bat","and","the","husband","start","to","run","around","in","hi","pajama","attack","variou","peopl","and","where","exactli","be","thei","thei","re","in","the","desert","then","thei","re","ski","then","thei","re","in","a","small","town","that","look","like","it","have","mountain","nearbi","the","town","be","run","by","a","sheriff","who","like","to","watch","and","have","a","person","vendetta","against","whini","doctor","boi","the","ski","hospit","be","run","by","a","realli","groovi","gui","with","a","nice","thick","mustach","and","the","wife","look","like","mari","tyler","moor","or","marilyn","quayl","there","no","dramat","tension","and","the","end","will","leav","you","fill","with","anger","special","effect","and","makeup","guru","stan","winston","do","the","effect","for","thi","movi","i","guess","you","have","to","start","somewher"],"filtered":["watch","live","night","make","wonder","world","greenlit","thi","crap","newlyw","coupl","go","spelunk","honeymoon","get","attack","bat","husband","start","run","around","hi","pajama","attack","variou","peopl","exactli","thei","thei","re","desert","thei","re","ski","thei","re","small","town","look","like","mountain","nearbi","town","run","sheriff","like","watch","person","vendetta","whini","doctor","boi","ski","hospit","run","realli","groovi","gui","nice","thick","mustach","wife","look","like","mari","tyler","moor","marilyn","quayl","dramat","tension","end","leav","fill","anger","special","effect","makeup","guru","stan","winston","effect","thi","movi","guess","start","somewher"],"filtered2":["watch","live","night","make","wonder","world","greenlit","crap","newlyw","coupl","go","spelunk","honeymoon","get","attack","bat","husband","start","run","around","pajama","attack","variou","peopl","exactli","re","desert","re","ski","re","small","town","look","like","mountain","nearbi","town","run","sheriff","like","watch","person","vendetta","whini","doctor","boi","ski","hospit","run","realli","groovi","gui","nice","thick","mustach","wife","look","like","mari","tyler","moor","marilyn","quayl","dramat","tension","end","leav","fill","anger","special","effect","makeup","guru","stan","winston","effect","guess","start","somewher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,7,13,16,23,24,55,68,71,74,98,106,116,137,153,165,175,203,210,243,253,262,263,282,313,363,450,462,495,536,553,693,756,804,886,923,942,960,1143,1187,1474,1644,1667,1756,2456,2491,3043,3060,3319,4154,4750,4846,4860,6668,6799,6901,7261],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,7,13,16,23,24,55,68,71,74,98,106,116,137,153,165,175,203,210,243,253,262,263,282,313,363,450,462,495,536,553,693,756,804,886,923,942,960,1143,1187,1474,1644,1667,1756,2456,2491,3043,3060,3319,4154,4750,4846,4860,6668,6799,6901,7261],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,2.393227744058217,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.9536997889255368,6.019259360045842,3.8429853485101932,1.9486336368009016,2.0881990796736947,4.318168722633384,2.2466628996789315,6.8817107523769305,2.3409902041158843,2.448847599972298,2.3791142619576227,2.569760528637609,2.687151791517189,2.627841366673578,2.7073305177318163,2.726701583487816,2.902686292364678,2.918851229218033,2.907069060519773,3.0349689855553557,6.939969152944234,3.2639531875991072,7.0347237149662565,3.6254214301101193,3.454678155189441,3.8463152616903136,3.7636829971100436,3.7740817043309423,3.944626193933877,4.3521595551061,3.9739784059464043,4.058285512406398,4.436351646326448,4.436351646326448,5.089758498236879,4.890269137820559,4.8796870284900224,5.185068678041204,5.156897801074508,6.032366538428407,5.408212229355414,5.444579873526289,5.583416318380505,6.489124940924123,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815,6.1754673820690815,13.321950395701563,6.868614562629026,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.106030760703298E-5,5.071599601591329E-5,5.1110264524742365E-5,5.0814948871822523E-5,5.081578141754854E-5,5.074475111006026E-5,5.0895673109859185E-5,5.0723298787951346E-5,5.083734325446219E-5,5.640125723960192E-5,0.23829462464575735,5.0641420200455484E-5,5.158661719556489E-5,5.2322511625298013E-5,5.067834739577944E-5,5.053829430922555E-5,5.179890884255013E-5,5.0900441650252926E-5,5.074252322831847E-5,5.0784579758207744E-5,5.127595035312329E-5,5.095087110769805E-5,5.100888640402882E-5,5.1063842758017684E-5,5.145573151729477E-5,5.118663252735637E-5,5.3338421318497075E-5,5.0656475430351735E-5,5.0

{"value":"This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator. Every episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period. As for the cast, I've seen better actors on a cereal box. From the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'Knots' stunk up U.K-Gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies. I regret to announce that I had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. Though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'.

{"value":"Have to admit, this version disgraces Shakespeare upfront! None can act except the nurse who was my fav! Juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her. She's worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion...god stop whining! I would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up! Anthony Andrews...yikes! Considering his other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he's quite a shocker in this one. And don't get me started on Romeo...puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of film.

{"value":"Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same year's THE PUBLIC ENEMY. She will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hood's girl who finds that her past will always be with her.<br /><br />In some ways, this looks a bit antique for 1931, almost as if you are looking at 1928's famously inert LIGHTS OF NEW YORK. But don't be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photography is still in the big scenes, there's lots of movement, indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set-ups to them. But in competition with the fast-paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at Warner's, this attempt to bring the woman's viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker doesn't work, nor is Mae

{"value":"Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but overall this felt like crashing a wake. Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage. I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now (FU Mick Jones), but this doc left me wanting..to relate more. Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed on their own. Even using Strummer's 'radio DJ voice' did little to glue the film together. And can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes? After the awesome \"Filth And The Fury\" I hoped Temple could deliver.

{"value":"'The Curse of Frankenstein' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley's story for one word of the title, which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all. The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with... nothing. The heart and moral centre of the story is gone. It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving, devious murderer; he deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés. Even taken on its own terms, this is rubbish: a bland, rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut. As it's the first of Hammer's horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in horror history is secure.

{"value":"I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br

{"value":"I went to see this film with fairly low expectations, figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff. Sadly, it wasn't even that. I could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out.

Even the reliable Fred Willard couldn't save the trite dialogue, the state jokes, and the banal plot. I'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie (I use the term loosely) should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class. At the least, there are many books on directing, screen writing, and producing movies that would teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.","finished_norm":["i","go","to","see","thi","film","with","fairli","low","expect","figur","it","would","be","a","nice","piec","of","fluff","sadli","it","be","not","even","that","i","can","bare","sit","through","the","film","without","want","to","walk","out","i","go","with","my","two","kid","ag","and","and","even","thei","keep","ask","how","much","long","after","last","until","the","end","i","just","keep","wonder","who","would","approv","thi","script","even","the","reliabl","fred","willard","can","not","save","the","trite","dialogu","the","state","joke","and","the","banal","plot","i","have","suggest","that","whoever","write","and","direct","thi","movi","i","us","the","term","loos","should","take","a","onlin","screen","write","class","or","drop","by","their","local","commun","colleg","for","a","film","class","at","the","littl","there","be","mani","book","on","direct","screen","write","and","produc","movi","that","would","teach","them","someth","about","structur","plot","dialogu","and","pace"],"filtered":["go","see","thi","film","fairli","low","expect","figur","nice","piec","fluff","sadli","even","bare","sit","film","without","want","walk","go","two","kid","ag","even","thei","keep","ask","much","long","last","end","keep","wonder","approv","thi","script","even","reliabl","fred","willard","save","trite","dialogu","state","joke","banal","plot","suggest","whoever","write","direct","thi","movi","us","term","loos","take","onlin","screen","write","class","drop","local","commun","colleg","film","class","littl","mani","book","direct","screen","write","produc","movi","teach","someth","structur","plot","dialogu","pace"],"filtered2":["go","see","fairli","low","expect","figur","nice","piec","fluff","sadli","even","bare","sit","without","want","walk","go","two","kid","ag","even","keep","ask","long","last","end","keep","wonder","approv","script","even","reliabl","fred","willard","save","trite","dialogu","state","joke","banal","plot","suggest","whoever","write","direct","us","term","loos","take","onlin","screen","write","class","drop","local","commun","colleg","class","littl","mani","book","direct","screen","write","produc","teach","someth","structur","plot","dialogu","pace"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,14,24,31,32,37,47,50,53,56,65,77,99,102,114,125,130,134,144,151,175,189,192,214,217,218,244,248,261,262,294,306,415,442,475,498,546,589,628,646,705,814,819,858,904,940,1061,1111,1496,1609,1614,1753,2663,3518,3908,4251,4714,7596],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,14,24,31,32,37,47,50,53,56,65,77,99,102,114,125,130,134,144,151,175,189,192,214,217,218,244,248,261,262,294,306,415,442,475,498,546,589,628,646,705,814,819,858,904,940,1061,1111,1496,1609,1614,1753,2663,3518,3908,4251,4714,7596],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.7780513171783934,1.9416538289407692,1.1175081997259209,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,5.722155020233252,1.9463902258768238,2.056430207256609,4.175107420354542,2.4433074195966826,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,4.488792363340481,2.2931108769894046,2.8002454868101863,2.3791142619576227,2.498193474075453,5.063653426867979,2.7303758068497004,2.6113665294700725,2.5940874818617203,2.634508058031767,5.379009467558432,2.7085302779237206,2.726701583487816,2.886778509330039,2.8739486825973213,3.1588018988486244,3.257696649984802,3.3721070011625462,3.386191741044285,3.4572130107926293,3.496027715008137,7.215127625420226,3.5900195030592035,3.6284289511740746,3.9363956947973615,3.835141961092188,3.8767358583910254,3.9121030022283168,3.952924996748572,4.218628162481577,4.268777946167049,4.9676558014359795,4.621379564718146,4.662879295624898,4.715065048795469,5.243909178064138,5.626901430320244,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.999304088445996E-5,5.958849378454802E-5,6.0051737503165564E-5,5.970475792411969E-5,5.970573611935822E-5,5.96222794317492E-5,5.979960444463367E-5,5.959707413829012E-5,5.9731070086663315E-5,0.20817081078897554,0.6377649579783607,5.9500871320927454E-5,6.061142557782458E-5,0.14944408212216423,5.954425873558755E-5,5.9379704095371E-5,6.0860856536114784E-5,5.980520721618379E-5,5.9619661793770026E-5,5.96690758932017E-5,6.024640919908507E-5,5.986445904297595E-5,5.993262381141962E-5,5.9997194491586466E-5,6.0457642135936974E-5,6.014146568769485E-5,6.266969865321358E-5,5.951856038440984E-5,5.95201526452853E-5,5.967094661542473E-5,6.093923861661579E-5,5.9801742015118E-5,6.41921041447425E-5,5.996995549066732E-5,5.9583343660768315E-5,5.98583600695073E-5,5.952363966144335E-5,5.955881375305009E-5,5.937940576693657E-5,5.939

{"value":"One previous reviewer called this film \"pure visual joy\" I am wondering if s/he saw the same film that I did. \"High Art\" had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since \"Seven\". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the cliché of going to a B&B for their First Time. Of course, before they do that, one has to watch opium-den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit. Not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types, the Girlfriend/Boyfriend At Start, who are well aware they're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so. The movie also states that the Sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now.

{"value":"To start with, I have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yeah, some things happen, but you don't know why or what for. When you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons... The characters are rather poor and the actors (specially the young ones) don't help that much to make'em look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she's a superb actress, no matter if the movie is pure rubbish.<br /><br />The only positive things to say about \"Frío Sol De Invierno\" is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense...

{"value":"So i had low expectations for this movie to start with, but it failed to meet even those. while there were some funny parts, even one or two laugh out loud parts, this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly, leaving us sitting there going \"WTF just happened?\" in addition, there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on. the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning. also, the editing was really lacking. there were some poor scene transitions, but that seems to be the style nowadays. It made me laugh, but i wouldn't watch it again, and I'm very glad i waited for it to rent. give it a chance, you might enjoy it, but don't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year

{"value":"Well what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the \"keeping it real\" black cab driver. Plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel. Then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once.

{"value":"If you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense...then look elsewhere, kids, cause Sleepwalkers really sucks. Usually I'm more eloquent than that, but...wow...this was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen WALKING HOME. Where's his car?? Anyway, just don't see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jumping on people. A guy getting stabbed by corn. Cheesey lines up the proverbial \"wazoo\". Just don't see it. Wait, I take that back! See it for writer Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard. He's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film.

{"value":"The 3-D featured in \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy features lousy 3-D effects that makes the 3-D effects in \"Jaws 3\", \"Amityville 3\", and \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" look better by comparison. Not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme. This was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got trapped in this mess, but at least it didn't kill their careers. Tambor would go on to star on HBO's \"The Larry Sanders Show\" and Ron Howard's box office smash \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\", while Guttenberg followed this flop with \"Police Academy\" and \"Cocoon\". What them in those projects instead of them here in \"The Man Who Wasn't There\".

{"value":"I bought this DVD for £1 and now i realise why. The acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. The lighting and sound are shoddy at best. The plot makes little sense even when sober (WARNING: I don't advise watching this film when sober.) This film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much. It really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste, I look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career, other than eva longoria who is the only \"star\" of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick. I'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but I will say one thing to James Cahill, don't try it again.

{"value":"What the heck was this. Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music, CGI, or acting.<br /><br />The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work feels like that at times, and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long. And sadly this is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />The cast was attractive, and that is about the limit to this. I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have, but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates...whatever they were.

{"value":"The main character Lance Barton gets killed and to heaven before his time. When heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white Mr. Wellington.<br /><br />A young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor. In this movie I ended up reminding myself several times: \"Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white guy\".<br /><br />The whole concept does not play as intended: The \"illusion\" is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes, is to much of a challenge for the viewers

{"value":"I have always been interested in anything about Bigfoot, so when I was browsing around looking for a movie to rent, this one caught my eye. It was the WORST $4.50 I've ever spent and I want my money back! Please don't waste your money on this!! This was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The entire movie was so incredibly boring and I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and I didn't even watch it all the way through. I just got fed up with it. The acting was horrible, the effects were horrible, everything was just really bad and tasteless. It all added up to be a really bad, boring movie and total waste of time and money.

Indeed, directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward.<br /><br />How is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a \"style\"? How is it propelling the story forward? Of course there's also the \"editing by random numbers\" nonsense. Apparently it's become hip to just cut randomly.<br /><br />I guess it's too much work to do good editing.<br /><br />Well, that made it too much work for most people to watch The Shield which

Talking in a low monotone throughout, Keith gets to dally with a prostitute (something of a shock after his run on TV's \"Family Affair\"), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes Keith's amiable talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who doesn't seem to notice or care. Hack direction, poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from

{"value":"I can't believe that the City of Muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law-enforcement officers. I have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life. If they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie. I only saw it once and was appalled at what I saw. I wanted to see the little guy get into a foot-chase with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world.

{"value":"Whoever wrote up \"Redline\" as a great car movie must be getting paid off by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming, steaming pile of amateur crap. Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made. This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Take every cheesy cliché out of an 80s action TV series, put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business.<br /><br />This is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever. What offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this

{"value":"I was never quite sure where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain. They investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleepwalk, get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc., etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. She gets taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again. You get the point. The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual.

I watched it despite the fact that I don't like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor's new clothes with this author's work). I admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production. The 'explicit' gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV - several times - so it was nothing very shocking I'm afraid. Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline/content I'm afraid.","finished_norm":["i","decid","to","watch","thi","serial","after","see","the","endless","advert","for","it","on","the","bbc","in","the","week","prior","to","it","start","i","watch","it","despit","the","fact","that","i","do","not","like","the","pretenti","kind","of","stuff","that","alan","hollinghurst","write","sorri","to","hi","fan","but","i","think","we","have","a","case","of","the","emperor","new","cloth","with","thi","author","work","i","admit","that","the","act","be","excel","it","be","beautifulli","shoot","and","i","be","reason","entertain","by","it","howev","i","find","that","the","storylin","be","extrem","thin","and","after","watch","all","three","episod","feel","veri","unsatisfi","with","thi","rather","empti","product","the","explicit","gai","sex","that","the","medium","drone","on","about","have","all","be","do","befor","on","tv","sever","time","so","it","be","noth","veri","shock","i","be","afraid","full","mark","for","product","valu","but","low","on","for","storylinecont","i","be","afraid"],"filtered":["decid","watch","thi","serial","see","endless","advert","bbc","week","prior","start","watch","despit","fact","like","pretenti","kind","stuff","alan","hollinghurst","write","sorri","hi","fan","think","case","emperor","new","cloth","thi","author","work","admit","act","excel","beautifulli","shoot","reason","entertain","howev","find","storylin","extrem","thin","watch","three","episod","feel","veri","unsatisfi","thi","rather","empti","product","explicit","gai","sex","medium","drone","befor","tv","sever","time","noth","veri","shock","afraid","full","mark","product","valu","low","storylinecont","afraid"],"filtered2":["decid","watch","serial","see","endless","advert","bbc","week","prior","start","watch","despit","fact","like","pretenti","kind","stuff","alan","hollinghurst","write","sorri","fan","think","case","emperor","new","cloth","author","work","admit","act","excel","beautifulli","shoot","reason","entertain","howev","find","storylin","extrem","thin","watch","three","feel","veri","unsatisfi","rather","empti","product","explicit","gai","sex","medium","drone","befor","tv","sever","time","noth","veri","shock","afraid","full","mark","product","valu","low","storylinecont","afraid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,12,15,21,38,43,48,49,65,71,79,87,95,97,113,117,122,140,160,172,190,195,217,224,249,254,288,316,329,336,361,391,437,451,508,515,580,640,691,717,857,879,980,1047,1112,1133,1144,1244,1245,1321,1605,2074,2212,2779,3111,3317,3635,4096,7392],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,12,15,21,38,43,48,49,65,71,79,87,95,97,113,117,122,140,160,172,190,195,217,224,249,254,288,316,329,336,361,391,437,451,508,515,580,640,691,717,857,879,980,1047,1112,1133,1144,1244,1245,1321,1605,2074,2212,2779,3111,3317,3635,4096,7392],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,2.4001215597131385,1.162015545335049,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,1.9469506069506084,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.1521782565202803,2.2797301185117202,2.2489347673732487,2.317169775997098,2.3722295531801256,2.5001408943598484,5.116663665627972,2.51289241584188,2.6113665294700725,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.889652074525771,2.8015621426949333,2.878207028279898,2.951986790814132,2.9233055795674137,3.0399731661399314,3.109204957709252,3.1952392950510555,3.216957819005698,3.4149707055943286,3.3956930001684253,3.5039747767006686,3.9998419165363233,3.5929222627171646,3.7398317812878634,3.9612932464190886,3.8962296530720266,4.081705786614497,4.140259095366071,4.2574141875167335,4.403125998698128,4.229557233013768,8.679627438567602,4.409683399244287,4.370968887063596,4.869215728622727,4.933754249760298,5.3064295350454715,5.339219357868463,5.463272006538442,5.695894301807195,5.9370563586240825,5.907203395474402,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.055694434550366E-5,6.014859471272403E-5,6.061619268197438E-5,6.0265951674892E-5,6.026693906465831E-5,6.018269792748154E-5,6.036168970349421E-5,6.0157255717339976E-5,6.029251115811328E-5,6.689124989142375E-5,0.6567122143390041,6.0060148643402326E-5,0.03274559570187978,6.205390396186559E-5,6.010394387725165E-5,5.993784250878493E-5,0.05838223388139875,6.0367345138190285E-5,6.018005568506334E-5,0.029880605446788375,6.081269419084348E-5,6.042715390141555E-5,6.049595938331998E-5,6.0561136994382335E-5,6.1025912607718093E-5,6.0706764264888935E-5,6.325876130868345E-5,6.007800397490469E-5,6.0079611202206344E-5,6.023182255743598E-5,6.151203584547202E-5,6.0363847366032164E-5,0.17357438570425865,6.0533641960985636E-5,6.014339618045258

{"value":"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.<br /><br />Instead, \"Doctor Detroit\" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon.

{"value":"The book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life. But saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting, directing, cinematography, and storyline were all horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they have left out too many key components of the book. The movie tried, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy. While putting myself in the position who had not read the book, I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S.

If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing....but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.....<br /><br />Sorry, Im even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all.<br /><br />I will end with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES!

{"value":"I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more of Hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should of gave Nic Cage a hat and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin'. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this \"lemon\". People who are completely and totally marketed(and most of them are) should love this movie. If this film had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that FACT.<br /><br />All the SHEEP seem to love it

{"value":"A never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. The \"Blonde Wig\" half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers.<br /><br /> The Wong Faye half (featuring a very playful, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing.<br /><br /> For music lovers, Wong Faye's \"Mung Jung Yun\" (Cantonese version of the Cranberry's smash hit \"Dreams\") is used effectively in Chungking Express.

{"value":"Lately they have been trying to hock this film late-night on cable TV commercials. Don't believe the hype. I was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres. This is, in my opinion, the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time, just behind Mac & Me (#1 Worst), and Jack Frost (#2 Worst), but I must admit, they are all close and all TERRIBLE! Really, nothing of this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money. The only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy. I'm not lying about that. Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film. It is that awful. If you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this, which I doubt you can finish.
