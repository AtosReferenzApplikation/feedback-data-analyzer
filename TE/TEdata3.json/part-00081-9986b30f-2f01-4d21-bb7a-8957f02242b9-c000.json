{"value":"** HERE BE SPOILERS **<br /><br />The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before. However the government is downsizing, the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his own safety. He activates and controls the UniSols and start to run mayhem. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /><br />This movie is about one thing. Choreographed fighting. The story is bad, and is soon drowned in all fights. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible. Normally you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants. Not where one is indestructible and can't lose. Then the fights just become a tool to stretch time. You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are. Well, there aren't really that lot of them, because the characters are most men (there are at least one woman UniSol though), but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once. The female leads get by with this, but we also pass through a strip-club (to use a computer no less) with much more undressed women. These moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, boring fights. No more, no less. Well, maybe less...<br /><br

{"value":"\"Magnolia\" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" \"Magnolia\" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked \"Shine\" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with them?<br /><br />Having said that, there is nothing held back about \"Magnolia.\" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.<br /><br />\"Magnolia\" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, \"This is stupid!\" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.","finished_norm":["magnolia","be","a","preposter","bewild","act","showcas","that","add","up","to","veri","littl","like","ey","wide","shut","magnolia","be","a","aimless","seri","of","episod","without","ani","concern","for","coher","the","camera","swoop","through","hallwai","and","corridor","catch","glimps","of","sad","charact","where","be","the","reason","to","care","for","thi","peopl","the","common","theme","seem","to","be","peopl","who","yell","a","lot","who","ca","not","care","for","other","except","for","john","c","reilli","and","philip","seymour","hoffman","charact","and","be","selfdestruct","jerk","who","be","either","fall","to","piec","or","dye","i","be","remind","of","how","much","i","dislik","shine","becaus","of","the","irredeem","monster","of","a","father","plai","by","armin","muellerstahl","there","be","so","mani","unattract","unapp","charact","here","why","would","we","want","to","spend","time","with","thembr","br","have","sai","that","there","be","noth","hold","back","about","magnolia","paul","thoma","anderson","idea","be","splash","onto","hi","canva","with","abandon","there","be","two","idea","in","particular","that","bomb","both","happen","in","the","last","hour","of","thi","minut","film","on","have","the","camera","flip","from","on","charact","to","anoth","while","each","on","sing","on","of","aime","mann","coffeehous","folk","song","sweet","but","ineffectu","sinc","we","ca","not","see","what","string","them","all","togeth","the","other","idea","i","refer","to","cannot","be","reveal","other","than","to","sai","it","be","complet","unexpect","and","complet","ridiculousbr","br","magnolia","have","a","lot","of","great","act","particularli","tom","cruis","who","unleash","a","perform","i","do","not","know","he","have","in","him","and","john","c","reilli","plai","mayb","the","much","decent","and","truli","good","cop","in","recent","memori","but","it","all","add","up","to","noth","when","the","secret","unexpect","event","happen","a","girl","behind","me","in","the","theatr","can","not","hold","it","in","ani","much","and","sai","thi","be","stupid","my","feel","be","the","major","of","moviego","will","agre"],"filtered":["magnolia","preposter","bewild","act","showcas","add","veri","littl","like","ey","wide","shut","magnolia","aimless","seri","episod","without","ani","concern","coher","camera","swoop","hallwai","corridor","catch","glimps","sad","charact","reason","care","thi","peopl","common","theme","seem","peopl","yell","lot","ca","care","except","john","c","reilli","philip","seymour","hoffman","charact","selfdestruct","jerk","either","fall","piec","dye","remind","much","dislik","shine","becaus","irredeem","monster","father","plai","armin","muellerstahl","mani","unattract","unapp","charact","want","spend","time","thembr","br","sai","noth","hold","back","magnolia","paul","thoma","anderson","idea","splash","onto","hi","canva","abandon","two","idea","particular","bomb","happen","last","hour","thi","minut","film","camera","flip","charact","anoth","sing","aime","mann","coffeehous","folk","song","sweet","ineffectu","sinc","ca","see","string","togeth","idea","refer","reveal","sai","complet","unexpect","complet","ridiculousbr","br","magnolia","lot","great","act","particularli","tom","cruis","unleash","perform","know","john","c","reilli","plai","mayb","much","decent","truli","good","cop","recent","memori","add","noth","secret","unexpect","event","happen","girl","behind","theatr","hold","ani","much","sai","thi","stupid","feel","major","moviego","agre"],"filtered2":["magnolia","preposter","bewild","act","showcas","add","veri","littl","like","ey","wide","shut","magnolia","aimless","without","ani","concern","coher","camera","swoop","hallwai","corridor","catch","glimps","sad","charact","reason","care","peopl","common","theme","seem","peopl","yell","lot","ca","care","except","john","c","reilli","philip","seymour","hoffman","charact","selfdestruct","jerk","either","fall","piec","dye","remind","dislik","shine","becaus","irredeem","monster","father","plai","armin","muellerstahl","mani","unattract","unapp","charact","want","spend","time","thembr","noth","hold","back","magnolia","paul","thoma","anderson","idea","splash","onto","canva","abandon","two","idea","particular","bomb","happen","last","hour","minut","camera","flip","charact","anoth","sing","aime","mann","coffeehous","folk","song","sweet","ineffectu","sinc","ca","see","string","togeth","idea","refer","reveal","complet","unexpect","complet","ridiculousbr","magnolia","lot","great","act","particularli","tom","cruis","unleash","perform","know","john","c","reilli","plai","mayb","decent","truli","good","cop","recent","memori","add","noth","secret","unexpect","event","happen","girl","behind","theatr","hold","ani","stupid","feel","major","moviego","agre"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,10,14,15,21,22,23,26,27,35,37,40,43,47,49,50,51,59,63,72,73,81,84,94,95,103,105,123,125,136,144,162,163,170,174,205,207,218,231,233,270,281,283,291,299,309,328,342,

{"value":"Where to start? OK, don't compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on fight club, the violence, blood, gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. Secondly, this film is no football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor, seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some American/Geordie was playing the role. Don't get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward' situation. Also, when the GSE are going to play United up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - doesn't make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs, which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically, a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism. If you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism,, you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence.

{"value":"Very, very humdrum movie fare here with Stella Stevens taking directions from someone in disguise(it didn't take me long to guess who it was) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for a money heist in the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her girl gang of three, and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated. Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70's, very average yet credible acting from most involved, and a plot line with potential, Las Vegas Lady lays one big boring egg. It seems forever for the film to kick into gear,and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up. I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Sure, I wasn't expecting anything great, but I at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70's or something like it. Not even close. No one dies. There is a lame gunfight between creaky Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo, one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. The gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. There is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument. Beyond that nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, don't expect much there either. Stella and her girls(both very mediocre yet pretty talents, get in a sauna and a bath. What do we see? Nothing but a fleeting side profile. Stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents, but I wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance. That way I could write one thing that would recommend the film. Alas, it was not to be, and I have little to say in this film's favor. It isn't a horrible film in any way, it just has nothing going for it either.

{"value":"Man, what the hell were the people who made this film on? And more importantly where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf. And this is no Rick Baker 'American werewolf' transformation, folks. We're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here. I can just imagine some stoned Italian spreading glue on naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the film's protagoness (is that a word?)), and asking her to roll in fur. That's how bad it is.<br /><br />From here on in it doesn't get much better. Minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about Daniela and her condition or something (I can't remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it you'll cry).<br /><br />The funny thing is Daniela isn't even a werewolf, she's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around (understandable, as she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor (the opening scene). She can't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets, and she only wants to be loved! Things start looking up for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who doesn't trigger her 'episodes'. Check out the montage here, one of the cheesiest you'll ever see (laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window).<br /><br />Daniela's luck doesn't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn, she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman.

{"value":"At the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50% of IMDb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1. I can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members. <br /><br />They say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, just by random proddings at the keyboard, would eventually type out the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10.<br /><br />I patiently watched the first half, foolishly assuming that the film would, on some level, develop either the plot or the characters, or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought. Failing that, I was quite prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention. Ultimately, I was disappointed and consequently, much of the second half was viewed at double speed as I searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption. Sadly, there was none.<br /><br />If \"The Choke\", was put up against an episode of Scooby Doo then I'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor with Brooke Bailey's portrayal of the freaky, death obsessed pseudo goth, London, being so bad I almost felt sorry for her.<br /><br />I would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack, a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock, failed even to entertain, let alone serve to enhance a very poor

{"value":"I've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time, and while this isn't the worst of the bunch, it's certainly in the lower half. The script starts off OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife. Cute huh? The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. Turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls. It's the job of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects. At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid, I was begging for it to be over. There was still an hour to go. It looked like a half an hour \"Tales From the Crypt\" episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap-fest. From Tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey (The Green Mile) impersonation to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet, this movie fails in every possible level. I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason. 1) His fiancé is pretty hot, she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2) The movie actually looks OK, a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal-mart quality home cameras.<br /><br />In the end, avoid this turd even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass (which I do, and I still felt cheated). As a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies take a shot every time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while talking. You'll be drunk 15 minutes into the

{"value":"Seriously crappy movie.<br /><br />First off, the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse/furniture store. The \"bad\" cop takes a girl, which they had pulled over, into the warehouse's attic, while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there. The \"bad\" cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag, and the newbie cop doesn't think there are any problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a bullshit response, and then he thinks everything is OK (for now).<br /><br />The \"bad\" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene (made it slightly better). But eventually people start to catch on, which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was. One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies, like ya do. Now, the \"bad\" cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged body.<br /><br />Since she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her, she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on, which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie... also, the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become \"eye-shadow monsters\". Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they look normal to him apparently). But when the girls see other people, such as the one girls husband, he freaks out because she is hideous (some people freak out, but others don't even notice).... massive plot hole.<br /><br />So, to wrap it up, the eye-shadow monsters kill the \"bad\" cop, who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene.

{"value":"The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, albeit an understatement. This movie doesn't just cry -- it shrieks loud enough to shatter glass.<br /><br />Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill, humorless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi-documentary feel. Here, they shot on actual New York locations with tinny \"real-life\" acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude. But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the Stones' maladroit dialog and the mouth-frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens.<br /><br />In a performance completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the wife of electronics whiz James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger (looking bloated and bored) and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason has unwittingly helped construct.<br /><br />Here is another credibility-straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug-addicted degenerate as an underling. The Stones' idea of nail-biting tension is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine-popping rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work is so leaden and Brand so (uncharacteristically) demure that the effect is hardly lurid, much less suspenseful. The Stones, a square pair at heart, don't even have the courage of their own lack of convictions.<br /><br />The film, which ends with the portly Steiger chasing the fleet-footed Stevens on a subway train track, is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey, and Barney Philips.","finished_norm":["the","exclam","point","in","the","titl","be","appropri","albeit","a","understat","thi","movi","doe","not","just","cry","it","shriek","loud","enough","to","shatter","glassbr","br","filmmak","andrew","and","virginia","stone","make","shrill","humorless","suspens","thriller","that","strive","for","a","semidocumentari","feel","here","thei","shoot","on","actual","new","york","locat","with","tinni","reallif","acoust","to","jack","up","the","verisimilitud","but","the","natur","of","the","sound","record","onli","serv","to","amplifi","the","stone","maladroit","dialog","and","the","mouthfroth","histrion","of","tortur","butterfli","inger","stevensbr","br","in","a","perform","complet","devoid","of","modul","steven","plai","the","wife","of","electron","whiz","jame","mason","look","haggard","and","bore","both","be","hold","captiv","by","extortionist","rod","steiger","look","bloat","and","bore","and","hi","slimi","cohort","in","a","scheme","to","blackmail","a","airlin","with","a","deadli","bomb","that","mason","have","unwittingli","help","constructbr","br","here","be","anoth","credibilitystrain","instanc","of","a","crimin","mastermind","so","brilliantli","attent","to","everi","detail","yet","knucklehead","enough","to","hire","a","drugaddict","degener","a","a","underl","the","stone","idea","of","nailbit","tension","be","to","trap","the","hyster","steven","alon","with","benzedrinepop","rapist","nevil","brand","fill","the","frame","with","hi","sweati","drool","kisser","but","the","camera","work","be","so","leaden","and","brand","so","uncharacterist","demur","that","the","effect","be","hardli","lurid","much","littl","suspens","the","stone","a","squar","pair","at","heart","do","not","even","have","the","courag","of","their","own","lack","of","convictionsbr","br","the","film","which","end","with","the","portli","steiger","chase","the","fleetfoot","steven","on","a","subwai","train","track","be","a","clumsi","a","it","ungainli","heavi","with","angi","dickinson","a","steiger","amor","girlfriend","jack","klugman","kenneth","tobei","and","barnei","philip"],"filtered":["exclam","point","titl","appropri","albeit","understat","thi","movi","doe","cry","shriek","loud","enough","shatter","glassbr","br","filmmak","andrew","virginia","stone","make","shrill","humorless","suspens","thriller","strive","semidocumentari","feel","thei","shoot","actual","new","york","locat","tinni","reallif","acoust","jack","verisimilitud","natur","sound","record","onli","serv","amplifi","stone","maladroit","dialog","mouthfroth","histrion","tortur","butterfli","inger","stevensbr","br","perform","complet","devoid","modul","steven","plai","wife","electron","whiz","jame","mason","look","haggard","bore","hold","captiv","extortionist","rod","steiger","look","bloat","bore","hi","slimi","cohort","scheme","blackmail","airlin","deadli","bomb","mason","unwittingli","help","constructbr","br","anoth","credibilitystrain","instanc","crimin","mastermind","brilliantli","attent","everi","detail","yet","knucklehead","enough","hire","drugaddict","degener","underl","stone","idea","nailbit","tension","trap","hyster","steven","alon","benzedrinepop","rapist","nevil","brand","fill","frame","hi","sweati","drool","kisser","camera","work","leaden","brand","uncharacterist","demur","effect","hardli","lurid","much","littl","suspens","stone","squar","pair","heart","even","courag","lack","convictionsbr","br","film","end","portli","steiger","chase","fleetfoot","steven","subwai","train","track","clumsi","ungainli","heavi","angi","dickinson","steiger","amor","girlfriend","jack","klugman","kenneth","tobei","barnei","philip"],"filtered2":["exclam","point","titl","appropri","albeit","understat","doe","cry","shriek","loud","enough","shatter","glassbr","filmmak","andrew","virginia","stone","make","shrill","humorless","suspens","thriller","strive","semidocumentari","feel","shoot","actual","new","york","locat","tinni","reallif","acoust","jack","verisimilitud","natur","sound","record","onli","serv","amplifi","stone","maladroit","dialog","mouthfroth","histrion","tortur","butterfli","inger","stevensbr","perform","complet","devoid","modul","steven","plai","wife","electron","whiz","jame","mason","look","haggard","bore","hold","captiv","extortionist","rod","steiger","look","bloat","bore","slimi","cohort","scheme","blackmail","airlin","deadli","bomb","mason","unwittingli","help","constructbr","anoth","credibilitystrain","instanc","crimin","mastermind","brilliantli","attent","everi","detail","yet","knucklehead","enough","hire","drugaddict","degener","underl","stone","idea","nailbit","tension","trap","hyster","steven","alon","benzedrinepop","rapist","nevil","brand","fill","frame","sweati","drool","kisser","camera","work","leaden","brand","uncharacterist","demur","effect","hardli","lurid","littl","suspens","stone","squar","pair","heart","even","courag","lack","convictionsbr","end","portli","steiger","chase","fleetfoot","steven","subwai","train","track","clumsi","ungainli","heavi","angi","

{"value":"What a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low-key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you're left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me by the end of WHITE NOISE.<br /><br />It wasn't Michael Keaton's fault; it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again, looking a bit wrinkled perhaps, but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there's nothing being broadcast.<br /><br />The idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real, so I'm not going to make any comments about what I think of that, or them. Let me just say that I'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this, but what I can't tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place, which is about where I was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll. Much static indeed.<br /><br />There are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled, but if a film fails to make itself clear for me, I tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker, not my own (unless I watched it while I was too tired to focus or something). Well, for WHITE NOISE I was wide awake, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed -- so guess who's to

{"value":"Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Slide down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.<br /><br />It really IS only a movie as they

{"value":"Somebody called Howard Koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for \"Casablanca\", didn't he? Or didn't he. Maybe there's more than one Koch slinking around in Hollywood, and I'm not too fond of \"Casablanca\" anyway. Wait a minute -- yes, there is another Howard Koch slinking around Hollwyood. That's the one who wrote \"Casablanca.\" No matter. I'll put as much care into this comment as \"Howard W. Koch\" put into this production, which is to say only a little.<br /><br />You know what this sounds like? Somebody read Cliff's Notes on Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" and decided, since no original thoughts were aboard the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollywoodize it with a happy ending.<br /><br />There are differences. Lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so, asks them how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on Lear. But in the play, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl. He winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Kids can do that to you. (Take my kid, for instance. After all the effort I squandered on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? No.) In the end, everybody in the play dies.<br /><br />In the movie, evidently, the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself, somebody jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy. That's the difference between Hollywood and a genuine tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself.","finished_norm":["somebodi","call","howard","koch","a","schlockmeist","but","he","do","write","the","screenplai","for","casablanca","do","not","he","or","do","not","he","mayb","there","much","than","on","koch","slink","around","in","hollywood","and","i","be","not","too","fond","of","casablanca","anywai","wait","a","minut","ye","there","be","anoth","howard","koch","slink","around","hollwyood","that","the","on","who","write","casablanca","no","matt","i","will","put","a","much","care","into","thi","comment","a","howard","w","koch","put","into","thi","product","which","be","to","sai","onli","a","littlebr","br","you","know","what","thi","sound","like","somebodi","read","cliff","note","on","shakespear","king","lear","and","decid","sinc","no","origin","thought","be","aboard","the","inbound","inspir","express","to","updat","it","and","hollywood","it","with","a","happi","endingbr","br","there","be","differ","lear","decid","to","divvi","up","hi","vast","estat","between","three","sister","and","befor","do","so","ask","them","how","much","thei","love","him","two","of","the","sister","throw","themselv","at","hi","foot","and","brown","nose","him","to","get","at","hi","monei","the","be","the","good","girl","and","refus","to","go","operat","on","lear","but","in","the","plai","lear","remain","aliv","to","regret","hi","decis","to","give","the","two","conniv","hi","stash","and","depriv","the","honest","girl","he","wind","up","crazi","and","nake","dure","a","gale","on","the","moor","putt","flower","in","hi","hair","and","hallucin","kid","can","do","that","to","you","take","my","kid","for","instanc","after","all","the","effort","i","squander","on","rais","him","doe","he","show","ani","interest","in","becom","a","doctor","or","a","lawyer","no","in","the","end","everybodi","in","the","plai","diesbr","br","in","the","movi","evid","the","good","sister","be","moros","and","suicid","but","when","she","try","to","off","herself","somebodi","jump","in","and","save","her","so","the","end","be","much","or","littl","happi","that","the","differ","between","hollywood","and","a","genuin","tragedi","unless","you","defin","hollywood","a","a","tragedi","suffici","unto","itself"],"filtered":["somebodi","call","howard","koch","schlockmeist","write","screenplai","casablanca","mayb","much","koch","slink","around","hollywood","fond","casablanca","anywai","wait","minut","ye","anoth","howard","koch","slink","around","hollwyood","write","casablanca","matt","put","much","care","thi","comment","howard","w","koch","put","thi","product","sai","onli","littlebr","br","know","thi","sound","like","somebodi","read","cliff","note","shakespear","king","lear","decid","sinc","origin","thought","aboard","inbound","inspir","express","updat","hollywood","happi","endingbr","br","differ","lear","decid","divvi","hi","vast","estat","three","sister","befor","ask","much","thei","love","two","sister","throw","themselv","hi","foot","brown","nose","get","hi","monei","good","girl","refus","go","operat","lear","plai","lear","remain","aliv","regret","hi","decis","give","two","conniv","hi","stash","depriv","honest","girl","wind","crazi","nake","dure","gale","moor","putt","flower","hi","hair","hallucin","kid","take","kid","instanc","effort","squander","rais","doe","show","ani","interest","becom","doctor","lawyer","end","everybodi","plai","diesbr","br","movi","evid","good","sister","moros","suicid","try","somebodi","jump","save","end","much","littl","happi","differ","hollywood","genuin","tragedi","unless","defin","hollywood","tragedi","suffici","unto"],"filtered2":["somebodi","call","howard","koch","schlockmeist","write","screenplai","casablanca","mayb","koch","slink","around","hollywood","fond","casablanca","anywai","wait","minut","ye","anoth","howard","koch","slink","around","hollwyood","write","casablanca","matt","put","care","comment","howard","w","koch","put","product","onli","littlebr","know","sound","like","somebodi","read","cliff","note","shakespear","king","lear","decid","sinc","origin","thought","aboard","inbound","inspir","express","updat","hollywood","happi","endingbr","differ","lear","decid","divvi","vast","estat","three","sister","befor","ask","love","two","sister","throw","themselv","foot","brown","nose","get","monei","good","girl","refus","go","operat","lear","plai","lear","remain","aliv","regret","decis","give","two","conniv","stash","depriv","honest","girl","wind","crazi","nake","dure","gale","moor","putt","flower","hair","hallucin","kid","take","kid","instanc","effort","squander","rais","doe","show","ani","interest","becom","doctor","lawyer","end","everybodi","plai","diesbr","evid","good","sister","moros","suicid","try","somebodi","jump","save","end","littl","happi","differ","hollywood","genuin","tragedi","unless","defin","hollywood","tragedi","suffici","unto"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,11,14,18,24,26,27,28,30,31,36,40,47,54,59,60,65,69,73,79,84,98,114,115,126,142,145,159,162,163,178,189,190,204,205,209,224,239,249,280,300,306,310

{"value":"First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian movies are continually getting better. From the tedious emotional films of the 70's and 80's, movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour. Imagine.. Actual comedies were made! Movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring.<br /><br />During the 90's and 00's several really great movies were made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers. Movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money. It became the norm!<br /><br />Then came United...<br /><br />*MINOR SPOILERS* It's just simply not funny. Not once. Not ever. But the thing is... We THINK its funny. Because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians. But.. They neither say nor do anything funny! Where's the humor? Show me the humor! Is it the awkward clerk played by Harald Eia? Is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Is it the commentaries by Arne Scheie? The movie is just not funny!<br /><br />But thats not my main rant about United. That namely is the predictability. (And it is here I fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since I have seen this in many other movies as well.) All the time you just know its going to end well. All characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie, and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There's absolutely no room for surprises at all!<br /><br />All in all I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making... again!<br /><br />Rating:

{"value":"I didn't agree with any of the theology in the Left Behind series, but nonetheless I found the books gripping and I read 8 of 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I didn't have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way mainstream Hollywood would have taken up a Christian series and produced a big-budget movie. So it was done independently... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show. It just didn't FEEL like a movie; it didn't have that movie \"experience\" to it, if anybody knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of that, and the low-budget, poor special effects were another detraction for me.<br /><br />On top of that, I feel that Gordon Currie was woefully miscast as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of an accent. So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil-neck who looks like an employee of the month from Best Buy, and gave him a really bad fake accent. So that lost a few stars for me right there. A movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to.<br /><br />The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (can't remember which one) - were real seat-squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was, was really out of place for some of the scenes, like in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom.<br /><br />In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't do it for me. Stick to the book, folks, it's much better.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","agre","with","ani","of","the","theologi","in","the","leav","behind","seri","but","nonetheless","i","find","the","book","grip","and","i","read","of","of","them","undeni","good","write","and","interest","stori","howev","i","do","not","have","veri","high","expect","for","the","movi","there","be","no","wai","mainstream","hollywood","would","have","take","up","a","christian","seri","and","produc","a","bigbudget","movi","so","it","be","do","independ","and","it","just","feel","like","i","be","watch","a","realli","long","tv","show","it","just","do","not","feel","like","a","movi","it","do","not","have","that","movi","experi","to","it","if","anybodi","know","what","i","be","talk","about","so","the","movi","suffer","becaus","of","that","and","the","lowbudget","poor","special","effect","be","anoth","detract","for","mebr","br","on","top","of","that","i","feel","that","gordon","curri","be","woefulli","miscast","a","nicoli","carpathia","read","the","book","my","impress","of","nc","be","that","he","be","suppos","to","be","thi","charm","dazzl","amazingli","handsom","gui","who","speak","english","with","almost","zero","trace","of","a","accent","so","i","imagin","somebodi","like","pierc","brosnan","in","the","role","instead","thei","find","some","clai","aiken","pencilneck","who","look","like","a","employe","of","the","month","from","well","bui","and","give","him","a","realli","bad","fake","accent","so","that","lose","a","few","star","for","me","right","there","a","movi","be","just","not","convinc","when","the","major","villain","doe","not","look","or","sound","the","wai","he","suppos","tobr","br","the","act","be","okai","but","noth","to","write","home","about","some","of","the","scene","like","on","of","the","convers","scene","ca","not","rememb","which","on","be","real","seatsquirm","for","me","and","some","of","the","christian","rock","music","or","whatev","it","be","be","realli","out","of","place","for","some","of","the","scene","like","in","the","on","with","kirk","cameron","prai","in","the","bathroombr","br","in","short","it","be","not","a","bad","movi","but","it","just","do","not","do","it","for","me","stick","to","the","book","folk","it","much","well"],"filtered":["agre","ani","theologi","leav","behind","seri","nonetheless","find","book","grip","read","undeni","good","write","interest","stori","howev","veri","high","expect","movi","wai","mainstream","hollywood","take","christian","seri","produc","bigbudget","movi","independ","feel","like","watch","realli","long","tv","show","feel","like","movi","movi","experi","anybodi","know","talk","movi","suffer","becaus","lowbudget","poor","special","effect","anoth","detract","mebr","br","top","feel","gordon","curri","woefulli","miscast","nicoli","carpathia","read","book","impress","nc","suppos","thi","charm","dazzl","amazingli","handsom","gui","speak","english","almost","zero","trace","accent","imagin","somebodi","like","pierc","brosnan","role","instead","thei","find","clai","aiken","pencilneck","look","like","employe","month","well","bui","give","realli","bad","fake","accent","lose","star","right","movi","convinc","major","villain","doe","look","sound","wai","suppos","tobr","br","act","okai","noth","write","home","scene","like","convers","scene","ca","rememb","real","seatsquirm","christian","rock","music","whatev","realli","place","scene","like","kirk","cameron","prai","bathroombr","br","short","bad","movi","stick","book","folk","much","well"],"filtered2":["agre","ani","theologi","leav","behind","nonetheless","find","book","grip","read","undeni","good","write","interest","stori","howev","veri","high","expect","wai","mainstream","hollywood","take","christian","produc","bigbudget","independ","feel","like","watch","realli","long","tv","show","feel","like","experi","anybodi","know","talk","suffer","becaus","lowbudget","poor","special","effect","anoth","detract","mebr","top","feel","gordon","curri","woefulli","miscast","nicoli","carpathia","read","book","impress","nc","suppos","charm","dazzl","amazingli","handsom","gui","speak","english","almost","zero","trace","accent","imagin","somebodi","like","pierc","brosnan","role","instead","find","clai","aiken","pencilneck","look","like","employe","month","well","bui","give","realli","bad","fake","accent","lose","star","right","convinc","major","villain","doe","look","sound","wai","suppos","tobr","act","okai","noth","write","home","scene","like","convers","scene","ca","rememb","real","seatsquirm","christian","rock","music","whatev","realli","place","scene","like","kirk","cameron","prai","bathroombr","short","bad","stick","book","folk","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,9,13,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,26,27,28,30,31,33,38,43,49,55,60,65,73,74,80,81,99,100,106,113,118,121,128,130,131,145,146,149,151,152,164,172,178,186,191,203,211,221,261,272,290,300,302,333,340,344,347,364,393,404,416,418,478,520,556,559,582,588,622,633,639,684,797,964,1005,1082,1209,1210,1222,1231,1305,1541,1696,2100

{"value":"If you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about, then you're in for quite the surprise. Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline, but the actual film is anything but.<br /><br />As the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice of all persons this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.<br /><br />What that translated to, is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce. Have shapes created, though credit goes to the stop motion style, and put it through a mind-numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the \"other\" world. It gets no better as well, when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence.<br /><br />Thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. While firmly dated, its dull colours, non-existent story, scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans.

{"value":"This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess. It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel slighted you'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, they've all seen better days, but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the film. I can't go on enough about this horrible movie, its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.<br /><br />To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you've never seen/heard, this thing has got to be five minutes long. On top of that it is narrated, as to suggest that you the viewer cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway, it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who I typically enjoy) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does. Then comes the ultimate insult, Tara Reid playing an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies, in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type. <br /><br />All in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of it, I mean lets all be honest here, sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","succ","at","be","on","of","the","much","uniqu","movi","you","have","see","howev","thi","come","from","the","fact","that","you","ca","not","make","head","or","tail","of","thi","mess","it","almost","seem","a","a","seri","of","challeng","set","up","to","determin","whether","or","not","you","be","will","to","walk","out","of","the","movi","and","give","up","the","monei","you","just","pai","if","you","do","not","want","to","feel","slight","you","will","sit","through","thi","horribl","film","and","develop","a","real","sens","of","piti","for","the","actor","involv","thei","have","all","see","well","dai","but","then","you","realiz","thei","actual","get","pai","quit","a","bite","of","monei","to","do","thi","and","you","will","lose","piti","for","them","just","like","you","have","alreadi","do","for","the","film","i","ca","not","go","on","enough","about","thi","horribl","movi","it","almost","someth","that","ed","wood","would","have","make","and","in","that","case","it","sure","would","have","be","hi","masterpiecebr","br","to","start","you","be","forc","to","sit","through","a","open","dialogu","the","like","of","which","you","have","never","seenheard","thi","thing","have","get","to","be","five","minut","long","on","top","of","that","it","be","narrat","a","to","suggest","that","you","the","viewer","cannot","read","then","we","meet","mr","slater","and","the","barrag","of","terribl","line","get","underwai","it","be","a","if","he","be","oper","sole","to","get","line","on","to","the","movi","poster","tag","line","soon","we","meet","stephen","dorff","who","i","typic","enjoi","and","he","doe","hi","well","not","to","drown","in","thi","but","ultim","he","doe","then","come","the","ultim","insult","tara","reid","plai","a","intellig","role","oh","help","u","tara","reid","be","not","a","veri","talent","actress","and","somehow","she","continu","get","role","in","movi","in","my","opinion","though","she","should","stick","to","movi","of","the","american","pie","typ","br","br","all","in","all","you","just","mai","want","to","see","thi","for","yourself","when","it","come","out","on","video","i","know","that","i","get","a","kick","out","of","it","i","mean","let","all","be","honest","here","sometim","it","comfort","to","revel","in","the","shortcom","of","other"],"filtered":["thi","movi","succ","much","uniqu","movi","see","howev","thi","come","fact","ca","make","head","tail","thi","mess","almost","seem","seri","challeng","set","determin","whether","walk","movi","give","monei","pai","want","feel","slight","sit","thi","horribl","film","develop","real","sens","piti","actor","involv","thei","see","well","dai","realiz","thei","actual","get","pai","quit","bite","monei","thi","lose","piti","like","alreadi","film","ca","go","enough","thi","horribl","movi","almost","someth","ed","wood","make","case","sure","hi","masterpiecebr","br","start","forc","sit","open","dialogu","like","never","seenheard","thi","thing","get","five","minut","long","top","narrat","suggest","viewer","read","meet","mr","slater","barrag","terribl","line","get","underwai","oper","sole","get","line","movi","poster","tag","line","soon","meet","stephen","dorff","typic","enjoi","doe","hi","well","drown","thi","ultim","doe","come","ultim","insult","tara","reid","plai","intellig","role","oh","help","u","tara","reid","veri","talent","actress","somehow","continu","get","role","movi","opinion","though","stick","movi","american","pie","typ","br","br","mai","want","see","thi","come","video","know","get","kick","mean","let","honest","sometim","comfort","revel","shortcom"],"filtered2":["succ","uniqu","see","howev","come","fact","ca","make","head","tail","mess","almost","seem","challeng","set","determin","whether","walk","give","monei","pai","want","feel","slight","sit","horribl","develop","real","sens","piti","actor","involv","see","well","dai","realiz","actual","get","pai","quit","bite","monei","lose","piti","like","alreadi","ca","go","enough","horribl","almost","someth","ed","wood","make","case","sure","masterpiecebr","start","forc","sit","open","dialogu","like","never","seenheard","thing","get","five","minut","long","top","narrat","suggest","viewer","read","meet","mr","slater","barrag","terribl","line","get","underwai","oper","sole","get","line","poster","tag","line","soon","meet","stephen","dorff","typic","enjoi","doe","well","drown","ultim","doe","come","ultim","insult","tara","reid","plai","intellig","role","oh","help","u","tara","reid","veri","talent","actress","somehow","continu","get","role","opinion","though","stick","american","pie","typ","mai","want","see","come","video","know","get","kick","mean","let","honest","sometim","comfort","revel","shortcom"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,15,18,20,26,29,30,34,35,37,40,41,42,43,46,52,53,59,71,80,81,86,88,93,97,99,107,109,112,113,119,120,124,126,128,131,132,145,154,166,173,185,200,208,221,223,230,234,240,241,242,244,248,276,279,288,294,320,322,330,338,350,354,357,364,384,405,407

{"value":"This movie is a waste of film stock. Do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this film. Do you believe that a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in Europe during WWII to serve in a \"Negro\" unit...cooking, supply services, burial detail, etc.? It happened in this film. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would select this same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier didn't realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers hold-up in a barn at a farmhouse that the Germans happened upon would SHOUT out their emotions at the sight of the German soldiers who were just 50' away? They did it in this film, and left any possible entrances to the barn the Germans might check totally unprotected. Would you believe that, over the airwaves and in clear English, the Captain mentioned the General's rank, if not his name, as the person he was speaking with and that the general, in plain English over open airwaves, said that the dam had to be protected the next day? Maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the American attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the Germans. This so-called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films. If it were, I'm sure it would do well.

{"value":"This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.<br /><br />In the Gangster / Drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not, i mean Sebastians motives for example couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché.) Then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /><br />Sure Tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again? what's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family. But this movie does not go in this direction. Even though there would be the potential judging by the random Backflashes. Wasn't he already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /><br />So there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama (but then again, this movie is just not, because of focusing on \"cool\" production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve.) <br /><br />It wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence (would be political incorrect these days, wouldn't it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.<br /><br />So all in all i .. just ... can't recommend it.<br /><br />1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.","finished_norm":["thi","be","realli","a","new","low","in","entertain","even","though","there","be","a","lot","wrong","movi","outbr","br","in","the","gangster","drug","scene","genr","it","be","hard","to","have","a","convinc","storylin","thi","movi","doe","not","i","mean","sebastian","motiv","for","exampl","can","not","be","much","far","fetch","and","wear","out","cliché","then","you","would","conjur","ne","a","set","of","charact","relationship","that","be","believ","thi","movi","doe","not","br","br","sure","tristan","be","draw","awai","from","hi","famili","but","why","be","that","again","what","the","deal","with","hi","father","again","that","he","have","to","ask","permiss","to","go","out","at","hi","ag","interest","pictur","though","to","ask","about","the","lack","and","ne","of","rebelli","behavior","of","kid","in","upper","class","famili","but","thi","movi","doe","not","go","in","thi","direct","even","though","there","would","be","the","potenti","judg","by","the","random","backflash","be","not","he","alreadi","down","and","out","why","doe","he","do","it","again","br","br","so","there","be","some","interest","question","bring","up","here","for","a","solid","social","critic","drama","but","then","again","thi","movi","be","just","not","becaus","of","focu","on","cool","product","techniqu","and","special","effect","a","not","give","the","charact","a","moment","to","reflect","and","much","of","all","forc","the","stori","along","the","path","where","thei","want","it","to","be","and","not","pai","attent","to","let","the","stori","breath","and","natur","evolv","br","br","it","want","to","be","a","drama","to","not","glorifi","abus","of","substanc","and","violenc","would","be","polit","incorrect","thi","dai","would","not","it","but","on","the","other","hand","it","be","noth","much","then","a","cheap","action","movi","like","there","be","so","so","mani","out","there","with","a","averag","set","of","actor","and","a","vinni","jone","who","be","manag","to","not","total","ruin","what","leav","of","hi","reput","by","do","what","he","alwai","doesbr","br","so","all","in","all","i","just","ca","not","recommend","itbr","br","for","vinni","and","for","the","edit"],"filtered":["thi","realli","new","low","entertain","even","though","lot","wrong","movi","outbr","br","gangster","drug","scene","genr","hard","convinc","storylin","thi","movi","doe","mean","sebastian","motiv","exampl","much","far","fetch","wear","cliché","conjur","ne","set","charact","relationship","believ","thi","movi","doe","br","br","sure","tristan","draw","awai","hi","famili","deal","hi","father","ask","permiss","go","hi","ag","interest","pictur","though","ask","lack","ne","rebelli","behavior","kid","upper","class","famili","thi","movi","doe","go","thi","direct","even","though","potenti","judg","random","backflash","alreadi","doe","br","br","interest","question","bring","solid","social","critic","drama","thi","movi","becaus","focu","cool","product","techniqu","special","effect","give","charact","moment","reflect","much","forc","stori","along","path","thei","want","pai","attent","let","stori","breath","natur","evolv","br","br","want","drama","glorifi","abus","substanc","violenc","polit","incorrect","thi","dai","hand","noth","much","cheap","action","movi","like","mani","averag","set","actor","vinni","jone","manag","total","ruin","leav","hi","reput","alwai","doesbr","br","ca","recommend","itbr","br","vinni","edit"],"filtered2":["realli","new","low","entertain","even","though","lot","wrong","outbr","gangster","drug","scene","genr","hard","convinc","storylin","doe","mean","sebastian","motiv","exampl","far","fetch","wear","cliché","conjur","ne","set","charact","relationship","believ","doe","sure","tristan","draw","awai","famili","deal","father","ask","permiss","go","ag","interest","pictur","though","ask","lack","ne","rebelli","behavior","kid","upper","class","famili","doe","go","direct","even","though","potenti","judg","random","backflash","alreadi","doe","interest","question","bring","solid","social","critic","drama","becaus","focu","cool","product","techniqu","special","effect","give","charact","moment","reflect","forc","stori","along","path","want","pai","attent","let","stori","breath","natur","evolv","want","drama","glorifi","abus","substanc","violenc","polit","incorrect","dai","hand","noth","cheap","action","like","mani","averag","set","actor","vinni","jone","manag","total","ruin","leav","reput","alwai","doesbr","ca","recommend","itbr","vinni","edit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,6,10,13,17,18,19,22,25,30,37,39,41,49,50,60,72,74,81,86,87,88,91,101,102,106,109,110,114,119,124,129,132,155,171,182,183,184,188,190,195,197,203,217,235,250,298,306,307,311,322,324,330,338,342,345,348,351,378,431,442,452,456,463,467,468,478,481,514,515,523,547,575,576,577,579,619,628,636,643,697,710,859,902,975,1023,1184,1195,1439,1494,1520,1705,1797,1806,1830,1843,2097,2121,3551,3709,3726,3889,3959,4044,4100,5422,6440,7598],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,

{"value":"After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel', in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy.<br /><br />Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives Tomas' story more significance than it does make it light.<br /><br />There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is Kundera's style. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. A film which is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who haven't read the book yet I recommend just reading that. For those who have, I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear

{"value":"**Spoilers contained**<br /><br />I'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. What I didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. What starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. They then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the ending. After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. I didn't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending.

{"value":"Following the success of the (awful) Gilligan's Island TV movie reruns, a number of TV movies were made in the 1980's reuniting casts from classic shows. Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode. And since the roles of \"Eddie\" and \"Marilyn\" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? With very little rewriting, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I didn't enjoy Sid Caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that very year, 1981, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum. Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a \"typical\" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's TV movie which featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest, and Patrick in cameo roles as a family

{"value":"I am very unpolitically correct guy, so when I say sexist I really mean it reduced the female guest lead, Dr Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her supposed brilliance and self control, to nothing more inside but a big, jealous unreasonable baby You prolly got the plot by now, after her technical sidekick Marvik, also a spurned lover, flips out when he tried to kill the Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, out of a jealous rage, but glimpsed first it instead. (You think he could have just walked in to the room with his eyes shut and phasered the box, too easy) he takes the Enterprise into un-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys could subdue him. Well, the ship is stuck in limbo, at that point they could have gone to the good lady doctor-liaison and discussed it. \"Spock has to make a mind meld with the Medusan so we can get home. I mean like beetch do you want to stay adrift until we run out of supplies and die?\" But the lady in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monsters who whines and wails when the idea is broached, even when her Medusan idol told her to shut up & go along with them. So the beetch out of spite messes with the melded Spock causing him to forget to put on his visor which makes Spock go insane. Kirk, naturally, figured out what a total twit she was and shamed her into fixing Spock up with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, at the end the Lady and Medusan leave and all is forgiven. You almost wish the President from Battle Star Galactica showed up to jettison the witch out of an airlock for her destructive stunt. But in Star Trek land, ladies are permitted to be totally unreasonable and cruel, yet at the same time supposedly there is sexual equality.

{"value":"2002's undeservedly popular \"I Love the 80's\" is an inane, idiotic, offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called \"humor\" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another! Altogether, I have no problem in saying that \"I Love the 80's\" was/is trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.","finished_norm":["undeservedli","popular","i","love","the","be","a","inan","idiot","offens","and","downright","disgust","popcultur","mess","of","a","show","that","be","the","in","a","longlin","of","horrid","televis","programm","that","ultim","spell","out","the","end","of","vh","which","be","at","on","time","the","onli","real","musicori","channel","leav","on","tv","i","us","to","practic","live","on","vh","up","until","the","spring","or","winter","i","forget","which","on","now","of","when","garbag","like","thi","start","to","appear","for","absolut","no","reason","whatsoev","out","of","sheer","morbid","curios","i","have","guess","that","what","you","have","call","it","i","have","decid","that","i","would","go","ahead","and","give","it","a","lookse","anyhow","the","night","it","come","on","even","though","the","advertis","look","like","complet","crap","at","littl","i","can","honestli","sai","that","i","be","not","a","bite","disappoint","by","it","becaus","my","expect","be","obvious","bottom","basementlevel","to","begin","with","the","emphasi","of","thi","show","i","find","out","within","the","minut","be","littl","on","each","year","of","the","and","what","be","and","be","not","cultur","signific","or","popular","which","be","what","i","be","expect","to","see","but","instead","much","of","a","impromptu","platform","for","a","whole","slai","of","realli","godaw","nonam","comedian","to","displai","what","thei","much","than","like","think","be","their","comed","skill","roll","eyesmor","like","lackthereof","if","you","ask","me","it","pretti","easi","now","to","see","why","no","on","have","ever","hear","of","ani","of","thi","idiot","befor","thei","appear","on","thi","show","becaus","thei","be","all","so","terribli","unfunni","and","pathet","in","their","attempt","at","socal","humor","that","i","swear","i","can","feel","my","intestin","knot","up","with","each","and","everi","rancid","onelin","thei","shoot","off","on","after","anoth","altogeth","i","have","no","problem","in","sai","that","i","love","the","wasi","trash","of","the","low","denomin","and","on","of","the","main","reason","why","i","almost","never","watch","vh","anymor"],"filtered":["undeservedli","popular","love","inan","idiot","offens","downright","disgust","popcultur","mess","show","longlin","horrid","televis","programm","ultim","spell","end","vh","time","onli","real","musicori","channel","leav","tv","us","practic","live","vh","spring","winter","forget","garbag","like","thi","start","appear","absolut","reason","whatsoev","sheer","morbid","curios","guess","call","decid","go","ahead","give","lookse","anyhow","night","come","even","though","advertis","look","like","complet","crap","littl","honestli","sai","bite","disappoint","becaus","expect","obvious","bottom","basementlevel","begin","emphasi","thi","show","find","within","minut","littl","year","cultur","signific","popular","expect","see","instead","much","impromptu","platform","whole","slai","realli","godaw","nonam","comedian","displai","thei","much","like","think","comed","skill","roll","eyesmor","like","lackthereof","ask","pretti","easi","see","ever","hear","ani","thi","idiot","befor","thei","appear","thi","show","becaus","thei","terribli","unfunni","pathet","attempt","socal","humor","swear","feel","intestin","knot","everi","rancid","onelin","thei","shoot","anoth","altogeth","problem","sai","love","wasi","trash","low","denomin","main","reason","almost","never","watch","vh","anymor"],"filtered2":["undeservedli","popular","love","inan","idiot","offens","downright","disgust","popcultur","mess","show","longlin","horrid","televis","programm","ultim","spell","end","vh","time","onli","real","musicori","channel","leav","tv","us","practic","live","vh","spring","winter","forget","garbag","like","start","appear","absolut","reason","whatsoev","sheer","morbid","curios","guess","call","decid","go","ahead","give","lookse","anyhow","night","come","even","though","advertis","look","like","complet","crap","littl","honestli","bite","disappoint","becaus","expect","obvious","bottom","basementlevel","begin","emphasi","show","find","within","minut","littl","year","cultur","signific","popular","expect","see","instead","impromptu","platform","whole","slai","realli","godaw","nonam","comedian","displai","like","think","comed","skill","roll","eyesmor","like","lackthereof","ask","pretti","easi","see","ever","hear","ani","idiot","befor","appear","show","becaus","terribli","unfunni","pathet","attempt","socal","humor","swear","feel","intestin","knot","everi","rancid","onelin","shoot","anoth","altogeth","problem","love","wasi","trash","low","denomin","main","reason","almost","never","watch","vh","anymor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,8,11,12,13,14,16,22,24,27,28,30,34,38,42,43,44,54,56,57,59,71,73,74,78,79,80,85,86,95,103,111,116,117,130,131,142,147,152,154,167,169,172,177,179,187,210,216,217,222,243,249,306,313,341,369,373,407,601,663,671,672,702,706,728,735,744,757,795,860,880,917,948,951,963,976,992,10

{"value":"Well, if you like pop/punk, punk, ska, and a tad bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching. This movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of goofy death scenes. Sounds like it may be good, right? Well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different bands of the Warp Tour and the fans at the event. Some of the deaths start of stylish, but then they are recycled over and over, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies of having their head smashed, or intestines being pulled from their stomach. The gore looks as if it was from Andreas Schnaas' \"Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence\"; with this being the \"watered-down type blood\", but now that movie is actually decent, and provides humor-something that this movie terribly lacks. Sure, the movie is made by Doug Sakmann from Troma, it's got great low-budget potential, and it tries...but just too hard. Everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie, and thats what brings it down. Everything tries to be too comic and goofy, by using intentional bad acting, an overuse of pointless deaths, and doing the same thing...over and over. It's basically \"Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker\", \"Chairman of the Board\", or any movie you have made with your friends: it's funny to those who made it, and that's about it.<br /><br />Great potential, great idea, great use of effects-but it's the same thing...over and over: A band plays, a band dies, fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated.<br /><br />The question is for these types of movies-which is basically 'bad slap-stick'-do they try too hard, or not at all?","finished_norm":["good","if","you","like","poppunk","punk","ska","and","a","tad","bite","of","modern","psycho","billi","then","see","the","live","perform","be","about","the","onli","thing","worth","watch","thi","movi","have","ton","and","ton","of","band","cameo","along","with","presid","of","troma","lloyd","kaufman","a","a","semimajor","role","and","lot","of","goofi","death","scene","sound","like","it","mai","be","good","right","good","the","death","keep","come","and","repeatedli","to","mani","differ","band","of","the","warp","tour","and","the","fan","at","the","event","some","of","the","death","start","of","stylish","but","then","thei","be","recycl","over","and","over","to","the","point","of","be","complet","repetit","almost","everyon","die","of","have","their","head","smash","or","intestin","be","pull","from","their","stomach","the","gore","look","a","if","it","be","from","andrea","schnaa","zombi","extrem","pestil","with","thi","be","the","watereddown","typ","blood","but","now","that","movi","be","actual","decent","and","provid","humorsometh","that","thi","movi","terribli","lack","sure","the","movi","be","make","by","doug","sakmann","from","troma","it","get","great","lowbudget","potenti","and","it","triesbut","just","too","hard","everyth","be","overli","mean","to","be","funni","in","thi","movi","and","that","what","bring","it","down","everyth","try","to","be","too","comic","and","goofi","by","us","intent","bad","act","a","overus","of","pointless","death","and","do","the","same","thingov","and","over","it","basic","mulva","zombi","asskick","chairman","of","the","board","or","ani","movi","you","have","make","with","your","friend","it","funni","to","that","who","make","it","and","that","about","itbr","br","great","potenti","great","idea","great","us","of","effectsbut","it","the","same","thingov","and","over","a","band","plai","a","band","die","fan","die","everyon","die","blood","be","sprai","everywher","the","process","be","repeatedbr","br","the","question","be","for","thi","typ","of","movieswhich","be","basic","bad","slapstickdo","thei","try","too","hard","or","not","at","all"],"filtered":["good","like","poppunk","punk","ska","tad","bite","modern","psycho","billi","see","live","perform","onli","thing","worth","watch","thi","movi","ton","ton","band","cameo","along","presid","troma","lloyd","kaufman","semimajor","role","lot","goofi","death","scene","sound","like","mai","good","right","good","death","keep","come","repeatedli","mani","differ","band","warp","tour","fan","event","death","start","stylish","thei","recycl","point","complet","repetit","almost","everyon","die","head","smash","intestin","pull","stomach","gore","look","andrea","schnaa","zombi","extrem","pestil","thi","watereddown","typ","blood","movi","actual","decent","provid","humorsometh","thi","movi","terribli","lack","sure","movi","make","doug","sakmann","troma","get","great","lowbudget","potenti","triesbut","hard","everyth","overli","mean","funni","thi","movi","bring","everyth","try","comic","goofi","us","intent","bad","act","overus","pointless","death","thingov","basic","mulva","zombi","asskick","chairman","board","ani","movi","make","friend","funni","make","itbr","br","great","potenti","great","idea","great","us","effectsbut","thingov","band","plai","band","die","fan","die","everyon","die","blood","sprai","everywher","process","repeatedbr","br","question","thi","typ","movieswhich","basic","bad","slapstickdo","thei","try","hard"],"filtered2":["good","like","poppunk","punk","ska","tad","bite","modern","psycho","billi","see","live","perform","onli","thing","worth","watch","ton","ton","band","cameo","along","presid","troma","lloyd","kaufman","semimajor","role","lot","goofi","death","scene","sound","like","mai","good","right","good","death","keep","come","repeatedli","mani","differ","band","warp","tour","fan","event","death","start","stylish","recycl","point","complet","repetit","almost","everyon","die","head","smash","intestin","pull","stomach","gore","look","andrea","schnaa","zombi","extrem","pestil","watereddown","typ","blood","actual","decent","provid","humorsometh","terribli","lack","sure","make","doug","sakmann","troma","get","great","lowbudget","potenti","triesbut","hard","everyth","overli","mean","funni","bring","everyth","try","comic","goofi","us","intent","bad","act","overus","pointless","death","thingov","basic","mulva","zombi","asskick","chairman","board","ani","make","friend","funni","make","itbr","great","potenti","great","idea","great","us","effectsbut","thingov","band","plai","band","die","fan","die","everyon","die","blood","sprai","everywher","process","repeatedbr","question","typ","movieswhich","basic","bad","slapstickdo","try","hard"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,11,16,19,21,27,29,34,36,40,46,50,51,52,56,62,66,71,72,88,103,105,116,119,121,123,128,131,134,140,154,161,171,178,183,193,204,208,219,245,246,250,268,286,293,309,324,329,355,358,378,384,431,470,480,534,544,547,694,729,811,927,1153,1199,122

{"value":"The spoilers in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, the Lady Barbara Skelton, gets raped and gunned down in the end. And not a moment too soon. I'd have shot the screen myself but I was afraid I'd hit James Mason.<br /><br />The original 1943 novel, called \"The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton\" (I guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then), was written by a woman, an English navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both. Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things do matter, such as the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide. She murders three men in five attempts. A serial femme fatale, she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either Bedlam or Newgate. <br /><br />Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp, wearing so much makeup that I thought of her as a Restoration-era Joan Rivers (or a restoration-era Joan Rivers, ha!). Yet Lady B. is irresistible to all three principal male characters-- Michael Rennie, James Mason, and Griffith Jones, all of whom do good work, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down - accidentally, in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts. Given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward, I presume we're meant to give a damn about her death. But hers is the first corpse we don't care

{"value":"Who were they kidding with this? There was just too much in this film that was hard to digest. Right from when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in London with his uncle(played by Om Puri) only to abandon him minutes later. The only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through London Heathrow knows that such a fête would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an Indian. But the film problems do not end there, there's the issue of the two main leads (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) passing as rock-stars on the verge of achieving their dreams. I mean yeah we saw success come to Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK achieving her dreams after age 50) but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just ill-conceived. They would never cast Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men well into their 40s) prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s? Let's not even talk about the most self-conscious actress on screen today, Asin. This is her second film (that I have seen) and she is just hopeless as an actress, so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance. It's just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress, nothing to write home about at all. And to top all of that, the film just boringly dragged on. There's nothing special about it at all, trust me you will predict every clichéd thing that is going to happen in it.","finished_norm":["who","be","thei","kid","with","thi","there","be","just","too","much","in","thi","film","that","be","hard","to","digest","right","from","when","arjun","ajai","devgan","unknowingli","wish","death","on","hi","father","to","when","he","arriv","in","london","with","hi","uncleplai","by","om","puri","onli","to","abandon","him","minut","late","the","onli","problem","with","that","theori","be","that","anybodi","who","have","ever","pass","through","london","heathrow","know","that","such","a","fête","would","be","imposs","to","pull","off","and","especi","not","by","a","indian","but","the","film","problem","do","not","end","there","there","the","issu","of","the","two","main","lead","salman","khan","and","ajai","devgan","pass","a","rockstar","on","the","verg","of","achiev","their","dream","i","mean","ye","we","see","success","come","to","susan","boyl","a","woman","in","the","uk","achiev","her","dream","after","ag","but","that","be","a","rare","case","it","be","realli","hard","for","me","to","suspend","my","disbelief","becaus","i","feel","that","the","cast","of","salman","and","ajai","be","just","illconceiv","thei","would","never","cast","madhuri","dixit","and","sridevi","to","plai","the","same","role","so","why","should","we","be","forc","to","watch","ajai","devgan","and","salman","khan","man","good","into","their","pranc","around","desper","try","to","hang","on","to","their","let","not","even","talk","about","the","much","selfconsci","actress","on","screen","todai","asin","thi","be","her","film","that","i","have","see","and","she","be","just","hopeless","a","a","actress","so","consciou","of","her","look","that","she","onli","concern","herself","with","look","good","and","vogu","for","the","camera","rather","than","give","in","a","good","act","perform","it","just","hard","to","believ","that","she","turn","down","all","that","other","movi","role","to","star","in","thi","fluff","and","then","be","so","fluffi","a","a","actress","noth","to","write","home","about","at","all","and","to","top","all","of","that","the","film","just","boringli","drag","on","there","noth","special","about","it","at","all","trust","me","you","will","predict","everi","clichéd","thing","that","be","go","to","happen","in","it"],"filtered":["thei","kid","thi","much","thi","film","hard","digest","right","arjun","ajai","devgan","unknowingli","wish","death","hi","father","arriv","london","hi","uncleplai","om","puri","onli","abandon","minut","late","onli","problem","theori","anybodi","ever","pass","london","heathrow","know","fête","imposs","pull","especi","indian","film","problem","end","issu","two","main","lead","salman","khan","ajai","devgan","pass","rockstar","verg","achiev","dream","mean","ye","see","success","come","susan","boyl","woman","uk","achiev","dream","ag","rare","case","realli","hard","suspend","disbelief","becaus","feel","cast","salman","ajai","illconceiv","thei","never","cast","madhuri","dixit","sridevi","plai","role","forc","watch","ajai","devgan","salman","khan","man","good","pranc","around","desper","try","hang","let","even","talk","much","selfconsci","actress","screen","todai","asin","thi","film","see","hopeless","actress","consciou","look","onli","concern","look","good","vogu","camera","rather","give","good","act","perform","hard","believ","turn","movi","role","star","thi","fluff","fluffi","actress","noth","write","home","top","film","boringli","drag","noth","special","trust","predict","everi","clichéd","thing","go","happen"],"filtered2":["kid","hard","digest","right","arjun","ajai","devgan","unknowingli","wish","death","father","arriv","london","uncleplai","om","puri","onli","abandon","minut","late","onli","problem","theori","anybodi","ever","pass","london","heathrow","know","fête","imposs","pull","especi","indian","problem","end","issu","two","main","lead","salman","khan","ajai","devgan","pass","rockstar","verg","achiev","dream","mean","ye","see","success","come","susan","boyl","woman","uk","achiev","dream","ag","rare","case","realli","hard","suspend","disbelief","becaus","feel","cast","salman","ajai","illconceiv","never","cast","madhuri","dixit","sridevi","plai","role","forc","watch","ajai","devgan","salman","khan","man","good","pranc","around","desper","try","hang","let","even","talk","selfconsci","actress","screen","todai","asin","see","hopeless","actress","consciou","look","onli","concern","look","good","vogu","camera","rather","give","good","act","perform","hard","believ","turn","role","star","fluff","fluffi","actress","noth","write","home","top","boringli","drag","noth","special","trust","predict","everi","clichéd","thing","go","happen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,6,7,11,13,16,21,22,24,26,29,30,34,36,40,42,43,44,45,47,49,59,65,70,85,88,91,92,94,96,98,100,105,114,121,124,128,150,157,160,167,171,179,186,192,203,209,231,245,267,288,302,337,338,342,354,364,399,442,487,532,544,607,764,788,789,806,848,874,901,1013,1025,1092,1101,1164,1209,1290,1487,1523,1534,1782,1838,2135,2696,2862,3289,

{"value":"This could be looked at in many different ways. This movie sucks, its good or its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. It has strange themes and just has a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be.<br /><br />The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller. Jack Black I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wise it is somewhat funny. This of course meaning that it does have its moments (though very few) but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way.<br /><br />The directing was average as well. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here. This movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it. Just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film.<br /><br />The writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously that means the writing here failed. At best it is below average. Considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible. That is never a good thing to say about a movie though. <br /><br />If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating. He is always quite a character in his movies. Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie.","finished_norm":["thi","can","be","look","at","in","mani","differ","wai","thi","movi","suck","it","good","or","it","just","plain","weird","the","on","probabl","explain","thi","movi","well","it","have","strang","theme","and","just","have","a","strang","plot","so","who","els","but","christoph","walken","would","plai","in","thi","no","matt","how","bad","averag","or","even","how","good","it","mai","bebr","br","the","act","be","what","you","would","expect","especi","out","of","ben","still","jack","black","i","have","alwai","like","so","you","know","what","you","will","get","out","of","him","but","thi","be","not","bad","christoph","walken","be","alwai","off","the","wall","he","be","alwai","enjoy","to","watch","no","matt","how","bad","the","movi","be","comedi","wise","it","be","somewhat","funni","thi","of","cours","mean","that","it","doe","have","it","moment","though","veri","few","but","can","get","a","littl","over","top","here","and","there","which","make","me","feel","like","the","movi","be","just","desper","for","laugh","but","of","cours","not","in","a","good","waybr","br","the","direct","be","averag","a","good","barri","levinson","be","a","slightli","overr","director","and","realli","do","not","do","a","good","job","here","thi","movi","seem","that","it","have","a","lot","much","potenti","and","he","do","not","do","much","to","reach","it","just","veri","averag","and","do","not","seem","like","a","lot","of","effort","be","put","into","make","thi","filmbr","br","the","write","be","the","kei","to","a","good","comedi","obvious","that","mean","the","write","here","fail","at","well","it","be","below","averag","consid","it","doe","have","it","moment","it","be","not","too","horribl","that","be","never","a","good","thing","to","sai","about","a","movi","though","br","br","if","not","for","christoph","walken","and","it","stupid","ridicul","end","i","would","have","give","it","a","low","rate","he","be","alwai","quit","a","charact","in","hi","movi","stil","thi","be","just","a","whack","out","strang","movi","with","strang","charact","that","realli","do","not","go","anywher","not","complet","horribl","but","i","would","not","realli","recommend","it","though","becaus","it","be","a","veri","forgett","movi"],"filtered":["thi","look","mani","differ","wai","thi","movi","suck","good","plain","weird","probabl","explain","thi","movi","well","strang","theme","strang","plot","els","christoph","walken","plai","thi","matt","bad","averag","even","good","mai","bebr","br","act","expect","especi","ben","still","jack","black","alwai","like","know","get","thi","bad","christoph","walken","alwai","wall","alwai","enjoy","watch","matt","bad","movi","comedi","wise","somewhat","funni","thi","cours","mean","doe","moment","though","veri","get","littl","top","make","feel","like","movi","desper","laugh","cours","good","waybr","br","direct","averag","good","barri","levinson","slightli","overr","director","realli","good","job","thi","movi","seem","lot","much","potenti","much","reach","veri","averag","seem","like","lot","effort","put","make","thi","filmbr","br","write","kei","good","comedi","obvious","mean","write","fail","well","averag","consid","doe","moment","horribl","never","good","thing","sai","movi","though","br","br","christoph","walken","stupid","ridicul","end","give","low","rate","alwai","quit","charact","hi","movi","stil","thi","whack","strang","movi","strang","charact","realli","go","anywher","complet","horribl","realli","recommend","though","becaus","veri","forgett","movi"],"filtered2":["look","mani","differ","wai","suck","good","plain","weird","probabl","explain","well","strang","theme","strang","plot","els","christoph","walken","plai","matt","bad","averag","even","good","mai","bebr","act","expect","especi","ben","still","jack","black","alwai","like","know","get","bad","christoph","walken","alwai","wall","alwai","enjoy","watch","matt","bad","comedi","wise","somewhat","funni","cours","mean","doe","moment","though","veri","get","littl","top","make","feel","like","desper","laugh","cours","good","waybr","direct","averag","good","barri","levinson","slightli","overr","director","realli","good","job","seem","lot","potenti","reach","veri","averag","seem","like","lot","effort","put","make","filmbr","write","kei","good","comedi","obvious","mean","write","fail","well","averag","consid","doe","moment","horribl","never","good","thing","though","christoph","walken","stupid","ridicul","end","give","low","rate","alwai","quit","charact","stil","whack","strang","strang","charact","realli","go","anywher","complet","horribl","realli","recommend","though","becaus","veri","forgett"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,13,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,24,26,29,30,32,33,35,40,42,43,46,50,58,62,64,65,72,86,88,102,103,120,127,130,133,136,148,159,188,196,197,199,202,204,215,217,229,230,267,274,289,298,317,341,364,395,401,408,417,421,533,547,566,586,596,625,643,736,777,788,854,934,965,1085,1162,1236,1292,1391,1635,2096,2111,2322,2796,3430,3711

{"value":"Can fake scenery ruin a picture? You wouldn't think so, but it actually for me in here. Listen, I have a lot of classic-era movies and I know pretty much what to except, such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen, etc. But a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in \"Brigadoon\" gets insulting after awhile. <br /><br />As far as the music entertainment went, this is always subjective. What songs one person likes, another may not so that shouldn't be a big part of judging a film (whether someone likes the songs). I could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs, dances, romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things. Musicals did very well in the '50s. Me, I liked the '30s and '40s with the great taps. By the '50s, tap was out and this new stuff - which I can stand - was it. Does that make this a lousy movie? No. It just makes one I didn't care for very much<br /><br />Despite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this film bombed at the box office, and with me. I should have liked it more, being a dreamer myself and that's a nice part of this story. I am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal. Then why couldn't I connect with this film? Part of it also was the dancing. I don't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen. But - no - the thing really turned me off what that staging. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a hokey- looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start. Score one point for today's realism where they \"go on location\" most of the

{"value":"The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.","finished_norm":["the","thing","viewer","will","rememb","much","be","the","bad","headach","the","movi","have","give","them","due","to","the","overli","flashi","shaki","camerawork","and","the","fast","confus","cut","i","be","not","against","that","kind","of","stylist","devic","if","thei","be","do","right","like","oliv","stone","and","steven","soderbergh","proof","with","much","of","their","movi","but","in","thi","case","there","be","wai","too","much","it","seem","like","the","jumpcut","and","light","flash","that","accompani","everi","flight","over","mexico","citi","and","everi","import","scene","be","there","to","distract","you","from","realiz","that","the","stori","be","quit","thin","and","the","whole","thing","be","veri","predict","the","big","disappoint","lie","in","the","fact","that","you","can","easili","figur","out","how","the","whole","thing","be","go","to","end","for","a","movi","that","pretend","to","be","violent","ruthless","and","moral","corrupt","it","be","inexcus","that","it","stori","have","be","tell","so","mani","time","and","with","a","lot","much","depth","and","charact","develop","that","be","anoth","disappoint","aspect","of","the","movi","if","i","want","to","watch","a","over","the","top","action","flick","i","do","not","ne","ani","justif","but","thi","movi","try","to","justifi","the","kill","spree","of","denzel","washington","charact","and","poorli","fail","in","deliv","ani","believ","perform","the","half","hour","or","so","noth","much","happen","except","that","dumb","archetyp","and","cliché","be","portrai","and","when","the","action","machin","start","roll","it","be","so","quickli","cut","that","you","do","not","know","what","realli","happen","so","the","movi","doe","not","work","either","on","the","level","of","a","believ","dramathril","nor","a","a","pure","action","movi","of","cours","the","movi","be","not","a","bad","a","some","oft","the","total","mess","up","blockbust","of","the","last","year","but","i","absolut","cannot","understand","why","so","mani","peopl","claim","thi","movi","to","be","someth","fresh","and","so","cool","for","a","video","clip","it","be","wai","too","long","and","for","a","movi","it","have","too","littl","substanc"],"filtered":["thing","viewer","rememb","much","bad","headach","movi","give","due","overli","flashi","shaki","camerawork","fast","confus","cut","kind","stylist","devic","thei","right","like","oliv","stone","steven","soderbergh","proof","much","movi","thi","case","wai","much","seem","like","jumpcut","light","flash","accompani","everi","flight","mexico","citi","everi","import","scene","distract","realiz","stori","quit","thin","whole","thing","veri","predict","big","disappoint","lie","fact","easili","figur","whole","thing","go","end","movi","pretend","violent","ruthless","moral","corrupt","inexcus","stori","tell","mani","time","lot","much","depth","charact","develop","anoth","disappoint","aspect","movi","want","watch","top","action","flick","ne","ani","justif","thi","movi","try","justifi","kill","spree","denzel","washington","charact","poorli","fail","deliv","ani","believ","perform","half","hour","noth","much","happen","except","dumb","archetyp","cliché","portrai","action","machin","start","roll","quickli","cut","know","realli","happen","movi","doe","work","either","level","believ","dramathril","pure","action","movi","cours","movi","bad","oft","total","mess","blockbust","last","year","absolut","understand","mani","peopl","claim","thi","movi","someth","fresh","cool","video","clip","wai","long","movi","littl","substanc"],"filtered2":["thing","viewer","rememb","bad","headach","give","due","overli","flashi","shaki","camerawork","fast","confus","cut","kind","stylist","devic","right","like","oliv","stone","steven","soderbergh","proof","case","wai","seem","like","jumpcut","light","flash","accompani","everi","flight","mexico","citi","everi","import","scene","distract","realiz","stori","quit","thin","whole","thing","veri","predict","big","disappoint","lie","fact","easili","figur","whole","thing","go","end","pretend","violent","ruthless","moral","corrupt","inexcus","stori","tell","mani","time","lot","depth","charact","develop","anoth","disappoint","aspect","want","watch","top","action","flick","ne","ani","justif","try","justifi","kill","spree","denzel","washington","charact","poorli","fail","deliv","ani","believ","perform","half","hour","noth","happen","except","dumb","archetyp","cliché","portrai","action","machin","start","roll","quickli","cut","know","realli","happen","doe","work","either","level","believ","dramathril","pure","action","cours","bad","oft","total","mess","blockbust","last","year","absolut","understand","mani","peopl","claim","someth","fresh","cool","video","clip","wai","long","littl","substanc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,17,18,19,23,24,26,27,29,30,33,35,36,37,48,49,50,53,57,71,72,73,76,82,85,90,91,94,97,99,105,110,111,120,121,122,129,144,174,184,187,199,206,207,212,215,222,233,240,257,279,288,290,

{"value":"'Blue Desert' may have had the potential to be even a half-way plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) not been so stupid. When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town out West. In her first days there, she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, playing this part well) who will eventually not leave her side. Fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before, she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop, Steve Smith (D.B. Sweeny, who's character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers). Smith needs Roberts cooperation because, as he tells her, Atkins is an ex-con and guilty of sexual assault. But, the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away before.<br /><br />The movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough, there is such confusion as to whom Roberts should trust. However, much of the intended suspense appears too forced because Roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might. And her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly, particularly in the finale. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too baby faced in ways that kind of recall Kevin Anderson's persona evident in his character in 'Sleeping With the Enemy.' Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, this might suffice as well. In the meantime, the film is not all that great, even as a low-budget

{"value":"Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of director Brian De Palma's career).<br /><br />Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. His story is chronicled by another smug guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis).<br /><br />Well, as I said in my summary...<br /><br />What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama, and satire, but it sure doesn't add up to much. It's undermined by unimaginably loathsome, one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life.<br /><br />I'm no big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty.<br /><br />I've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail. What a waste.<br /><br />The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Brit. Bruce Willis is badly, BADLY miscast in the role. What was the thinking there.<br /><br />Alas, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, being obliged to deliver a lame, heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax.<br /><br />This movie ends up turning into an absurd farce.<br /><br />I liked the assemblage of talent; for that I will give it four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say a MUCH better movie could have been made from the source

{"value":"Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst acting ever. No really worst acting ever. David Hess (Last House on the Left. No the one from the seventies. Rent it it's really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god-awful.) One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence. The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen.<br /><br />Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to ruin. It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike. No post production either. Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture. Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy's and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture. The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god-awful real life animal killings. And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement (Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy) What in the world is Lion's Gate is doing releasing this garbage? It would embarrass Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry . No the one from the seventies. Rent it it's really good) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman?
