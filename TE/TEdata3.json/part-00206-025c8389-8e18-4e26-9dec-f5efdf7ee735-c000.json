{"value":"I was watching this with one of my friends, who is a vampire freak, and I was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists. This film should be shown to prisoners of war, yes, it's that bad. Even John McCain wouldn't be able to sit through this. So why the 3/10 rating? Because it had a vampire midget. Come on, what's more entertaining than a vampire midget? There's one scene in this film where John Savage gets laid by saying \"I want to feel human again,\" and the chick, being the brainless stripper slut she is, lets him \"feel human\". I wish I could \"feel human\" with Jessica Alba or Megan Fox. This is a movie for stoners. There is bright flashy objects and random movements. All in all, don't waste your money on this garbage. I got it for free when I was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said \"free\". So, in a way, I didn't get ripped off, but

{"value":"This was a less than exciting short film I saw between features on Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film popped out due to its very intense Technicolor, the film itself just wasn't that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy--like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience WASN'T even a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated--such as when the characters talked to her, they usually said \"Clara Barton\" instead of \"ma'am\", \"Miss Barton\" or \"Clara\". Plus, one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a \"Johnny Reb, A Confederate a Rebel,...\"--almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls. This was just sloppy writing--period.<br /><br />It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, \"Perry White\" on the SUPERMAN TV show) in a beard as President Garfield.

{"value":"After watching Awake,I led to a conclusion:director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator,for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements.Awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements(for example,the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses...did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor ?).The concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film.With the exception of the great Lena Olin,all the actors bring bad performances.Hayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for Jessica Alba.The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is enormously wasted on his role.Awake makes a laugh of the spectator.It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously.My recommendation is:skip this crappy

{"value":"There's tons of good-looking women in this flick. But alas, this movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone?<br /><br />As you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I have ever seen. I'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there WAS no 3D, just double-vision blurs. I didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those ones sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />This thing is a big ball of nothing.<br /><br />And whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age.

{"value":"I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely tiresome. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they're all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and \"cute\" appeal to you, you'll love it.

To be honest I write this not even having watched the entire thing, but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we've got

{"value":"This Worldwide was the cheap man's version of what the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized \"Big 3\" Stations during the Saturday Morning/Afternoon Wrestling Craze. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's failed version of NWA he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and proceeded to drop all NWA references all together. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were relabeled with the WCW logo and moved off the road to Disney/MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for WCW's Nitro, Thunder, and Saturday Night. Worldwide was officially the last WCW program under Turner to air the weekend of the WCW buyout from Vince McMahon and WWF.

{"value":"This is the worst show. Buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has better humor and more adult than friends \"Friends\" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on television and I've been sitting in front of the tube observing Friends\" simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of \"Seinfeld\" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of \"Frasier\". The characters in \"Friends\" seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.<br /><br />The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so.

{"value":"Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. \"How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy\"? Gary Busey is know for his \"B\" movies, but this is a sure \"W\" movie. (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is \"confused\" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough.

{"value":"I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The saddles, costumes, accents--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the \"collector\" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. His only excuse was \"he only had 2 arrows left.\" We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, what's the point of that? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie.

{"value":"This is a low budget Roger Corman horror/creature flick. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. An engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. We only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best \"kill\" scenes in a small budget film.<br /><br />My favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. Nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. With no real stand out roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed with the alluring Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P.

{"value":"If there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse. The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine, but WHERES THE EXPERIMENT? All i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don't know or want to know about... The challenges are pathetic and silly. The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you set a 'challenge' don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in 'friday night games'. make them do an actual challenge. And as for 'earning' prize money, thats fine, if they actually earnt it! These people are nuts. If only they would make the show better, the actual idea would be glorious.

{"value":"With the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget, (truly) independent horror film. Make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective, the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor.<br /><br />The major problem with Frightworld is it's length, at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie, plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant.<br /><br />In places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour. However when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch.<br /><br />This could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal \"serial

{"value":"This is a classic example of an increasing problem with films. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? What sense does that make? This film isn't alone. Most films seem to do this now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV & there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue.<br /><br />It was even more distracting in this film because, in the English version anyway, the woman mumbles constantly. I kept hoping Jean Reno would say \"Excuse me, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth.\" If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles.<br /><br />I give it 4 because Reno was so good in Leon.

{"value":"I'm sorry to say this, but the acting in this film is horrible. The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever. Perhaps I got the \"dress rehearsal\" version by mistake. The director over-uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films. The fights seem pretty real. But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire, grenades, morter rounds, and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen, especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards, and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet.

{"value":"A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. \"Dressed To Kill\" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own \"Carrie\"--not to mention \"Psycho\". The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not an homage.

{"value":"I rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is THE worst movie I have ever seen. This isn't one of those \"it was so bad, it was funny\". This isn't one of those \"it was so gory, it leaves you with a bad feeling\" movies. It wasn't even one of those \"what the heck was that?\" movies. I can't recall the performance of the actors, but it was poorly shot, the story was disjointed, and it had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted the time.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of movies I didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and/or story-telling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. The incubus has none.<br /><br />I actually contemplated NOT making a comment on this \"piece\" for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity, but I am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","back","in","the","and","honestli","ca","not","rememb","anyth","specif","about","the","movi","onli","that","it","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","thi","be","not","on","of","that","it","be","so","bad","it","be","funni","thi","be","not","on","of","that","it","be","so","gori","it","leav","you","with","a","bad","feel","movi","it","be","not","even","on","of","that","what","the","heck","be","that","movi","i","ca","not","recal","the","perform","of","the","actor","but","it","be","poorli","shoot","the","stori","be","disjoint","and","it","have","no","defin","styl","when","it","be","over","i","be","angri","that","i","have","wast","the","timebr","br","i","have","see","plenti","of","movi","i","do","not","understand","becaus","of","unfamiliar","cultur","styl","andor","storytel","but","it","be","clear","that","that","movi","have","some","of","that","properti","the","incubu","have","nonebr","br","i","actual","contempl","not","make","a","comment","on","thi","piec","for","fear","that","someon","mai","watch","it","out","of","curios","but","i","be","compel","to","warn","anyon","who","appreci","film","to","skip","thi","movi"],"filtered":["rent","thi","back","honestli","ca","rememb","anyth","specif","movi","onli","wrong","movi","ever","see","thi","bad","funni","thi","gori","leav","bad","feel","movi","even","heck","movi","ca","recal","perform","actor","poorli","shoot","stori","disjoint","defin","styl","angri","wast","timebr","br","see","plenti","movi","understand","becaus","unfamiliar","cultur","styl","andor","storytel","clear","movi","properti","incubu","nonebr","br","actual","contempl","make","comment","thi","piec","fear","someon","mai","watch","curios","compel","warn","anyon","appreci","film","skip","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["rent","back","honestli","ca","rememb","anyth","specif","onli","wrong","ever","see","bad","funni","gori","leav","bad","feel","even","heck","ca","recal","perform","actor","poorli","shoot","stori","disjoint","defin","styl","angri","wast","timebr","see","plenti","understand","becaus","unfamiliar","cultur","styl","andor","storytel","clear","properti","incubu","nonebr","actual","contempl","make","comment","piec","fear","someon","mai","watch","curios","compel","warn","anyon","appreci","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,11,17,22,25,41,43,44,46,52,62,63,74,81,89,104,105,117,139,158,212,218,280,290,380,398,527,590,661,757,812,880,888,931,961,1161,1250,1253,1487,1546,1662,1703,2029,2114,2247,2373,2524,3316,3705,6830],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,11,17,22,25,41,43,44,46,52,62,63,74,81,89,104,105,117,139,158,212,218,280,290,380,398,527,590,661,757,812,880,888,931,961,1161,1250,1253,1487,1546,1662,1703,2029,2114,2247,2373,2524,3316,3705,6830],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.9486336368009016,3.899514464849456,1.9940046109572438,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.2797301185117202,2.2939035841256437,2.3106972614914807,2.5983793339432615,2.5940874818617203,2.8028805344481915,2.8612813773965557,6.204124140393744,3.143848349181566,3.439602492783994,3.4986697244709752,3.5727776966246974,3.7165362186843414,3.952924996748572,4.110553940952155,3.9323057095458362,3.9241755834625858,3.9954846111673676,4.327618446189983,4.280272325592784,4.34596758485818,4.581533656170946,4.566029469634981,4.688631791727313,4.6973654716960676,4.979216623837056,4.9676558014359795,5.064116067623542,5.116075806554253,5.170884043049248,5.626901430320244,5.672363804397,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.082887361285244E-4,2.0810416094933743E-4,2.0815554347424265E-4,2.0811369755170683E-4,2.0813339304459242E-4,2.081030135257753E-4,2.0816773645214093E-4,2.0807205119149436E-4,2.0810420493002445E-4,2.083192580755695E-4,2.0997222180929446E-4,2.081045486643567E-4,2.0830163682280357E-4,2.0832333825958525E-4,2.082287024064718E-4,2.081145172814402E-4,2.0818611672416976E-4,2.082840898184765E-4,2.0812526133664203E-4,2.081245004100371E-4,2.083117400363145E-4,2.0814535236018643E-4,2.081456673701388E-4,2.0827900771323678E-4,2.0812533641266444E-4,2.0832582823766943E-4,2.0817741897229803E-4,2.0810369454473204E-4,2.0819803986654246E-4,2.082615849094174E-4,2.0814637334682737E-4,2.082578520116808E-4,2.083601014178987E-4,2.0855349190005527E-4,2.0817705923586535E-4,2.0811439105668632E-4,2.0818942804771049E-4,2.0813552701656117E-4,2.0807227326983938E-4,2.0812519688363546E-4,2.083337738974035E-4,2.0821948970841425E-4,2.08258326595443

{"value":"Dear Richard, I know we all loved you on Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to Air Bud? I would have thought Tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant. I know that seems ironic, but the pay benefits are much more rewarding.<br /><br />Everybody would see you around Tim and instantly think \"Tool Time\". You would even get roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, you appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smiling. I know there wasn't much of a script, but you could have added to it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one.<br /><br />But seriously, this movie does nothing for the Air Bud line. Quite the contrary, the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports. The original was better.

{"value":"From the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims. When did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.<br /><br />Dr Suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the \"dirty ho\" \"S.H.I.T\" and fake erection scenes etc etc etc. Its shameful how they trade on the name of Suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed.<br /><br />Compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into. These guys should stick to making MTV videos. How on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me.

{"value":"The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved) is Father Pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine. The cast are not too bad, though most have now retired from acting. The film has terrible sound effects (mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems) and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky, for instance, for what feels like hours at a time. Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate. Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's assistant Bennah Burton.

{"value":"..IT'S THIS ONE! Very cool premise, right off the bat.<br /><br />Has an excellent first scene, gotta give credit where credit's due.<br /><br />Has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever the ghosts appeared, which I really liked by the way; how it was done, how it looked...the only thing was the ghost's relationship. Because of the way things went down in the first scene you'd think their dynamic would be different.<br /><br />Things slowed down a little too much in the middle I felt, and the crab/spider scene was just not good. BUT then the ending is actually very good! Sure, 'The Grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai's and that's what I liked about this movie comparatively.<br /><br />Please, someone one with a tempered style remake this movie.<br /><br />Fans of 'Silent Rage' would absolutely love this movie.","finished_norm":["it","thi","on","veri","cool","premis","right","off","the","batbr","br","have","a","excel","scene","gotta","give","credit","where","credit","duebr","br","have","solid","charact","and","a","decent","enough","script","for","a","ghost","stori","but","here","be","the","thing","that","bother","me","whenev","the","ghost","appear","which","i","realli","like","by","the","wai","how","it","be","do","how","it","lookedth","onli","thing","be","the","ghost","relationship","becaus","of","the","wai","thing","go","down","in","the","scene","you","have","think","their","dynam","would","be","differentbr","br","thing","slow","down","a","littl","too","much","in","the","middl","i","feel","and","the","crabspid","scene","be","just","not","good","but","then","the","end","be","actual","veri","good","sure","the","grudg","basic","tell","the","same","stori","with","a","polish","len","but","no","samurai","and","that","what","i","like","about","thi","movi","comparativelybr","br","pleas","someon","on","with","a","temper","styl","remak","thi","moviebr","br","fan","of","silent","rage","would","absolut","love","thi","movi"],"filtered":["thi","veri","cool","premis","right","batbr","br","excel","scene","gotta","give","credit","credit","duebr","br","solid","charact","decent","enough","script","ghost","stori","thing","bother","whenev","ghost","appear","realli","like","wai","lookedth","onli","thing","ghost","relationship","becaus","wai","thing","go","scene","think","dynam","differentbr","br","thing","slow","littl","much","middl","feel","crabspid","scene","good","end","actual","veri","good","sure","grudg","basic","tell","stori","polish","len","samurai","like","thi","movi","comparativelybr","br","pleas","someon","temper","styl","remak","thi","moviebr","br","fan","silent","rage","absolut","love","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["veri","cool","premis","right","batbr","excel","scene","gotta","give","credit","credit","duebr","solid","charact","decent","enough","script","ghost","stori","thing","bother","whenev","ghost","appear","realli","like","wai","lookedth","onli","thing","ghost","relationship","becaus","wai","thing","go","scene","think","dynam","differentbr","thing","slow","littl","middl","feel","crabspid","scene","good","end","actual","veri","good","sure","grudg","basic","tell","stori","polish","len","samurai","like","comparativelybr","pleas","someon","temper","styl","remak","moviebr","fan","silent","rage","absolut","love"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,19,22,24,29,30,33,43,52,54,77,90,93,119,121,139,140,170,222,286,309,346,356,380,390,465,481,483,484,496,554,577,580,727,1225,1498,1519,2417,2492,2953,2960,3126,3485,5649,5991],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,19,22,24,29,30,33,43,52,54,77,90,93,119,121,139,140,170,222,286,309,346,356,380,390,465,481,483,484,496,554,577,580,727,1225,1498,1519,2417,2492,2953,2960,3126,3485,5649,5991],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,2.5541073880211935,3.9371420340352055,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,5.2781539109352265,1.3364419891718522,2.803707089537043,1.6608112036218214,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.9463902258768238,2.0477128419653545,2.035389827120098,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.4214486257841834,2.5771019354959765,2.780700890737216,2.848772527704847,3.023389038124396,6.056670924119444,3.102062070196872,3.132778125427319,3.2681460658591432,3.353630724994973,3.613480989738201,3.291526514503207,3.293679367864308,3.439602492783994,3.604618302480356,3.5039747767006686,12.288077521167736,4.470719289830655,4.506310234933358,4.550761997504193,5.116075806554253,5.2288713006995975,5.822646007446338,5.521540914662417,5.463272006538442,5.878215858601149,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8071558619128756E-4,1.8055544497422936E-4,1.8060002550835148E-4,1.8056371912634865E-4,1.8058080734056656E-4,1.8055444944597616E-4,1.8061060438644765E-4,1.8052758588871698E-4,1.8055548313277686E-4,1.8074206765953437E-4,1.821762033794419E-4,1.8055578136374464E-4,1.8072677909865387E-4,1.8074560771100273E-4,1.80663499700805E-4,1.8056443034070442E-4,1.806265514880326E-4,1.8071155495724418E-4,1.8057375210370495E-4,1.8057309190815134E-4,1.8073554485423902E-4,1.8059118348844757E-4,1.8059145679755325E-4,1.8070714561834014E-4,1.8057381724120421E-4,1.8074776806713838E-4,1.8061900513983702E-4,1.805550403120127E-4,1.8063689625128374E-4,1.8069202923584227E-4,1.8059206931743066E-4,1.8068879049708375E-4,1.807775041823547E-4,1.8094529373735574E-4,1.8061869302511823E-4,1.80564320825515

{"value":"This is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be. I dread to think what the Blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like, because the director's cut on DVD was a bore of the epic proportions. Naturally, you don't expect it to be \"The Godfather\", but an acting class or two might have come in handy.<br /><br />Also, there were so many cute guys in this movie, but they were woefully under-exploited. I like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their BVDs as much as the next guy, but even I have a right to expect a little more. It wasn't a total loss, though; at least we got a peek a Drew Fuller's (covered) junk and truly upsetting haircut. And there's Huntley Ritter looking even cuter than he did in \"Bring It On\" (and acting about as well). There's always a silver lining, kids. You just have to look really hard for it.

{"value":"This really doesn't do the blues justice. It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians. Corny as it is, this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary. Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes, filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland raping the same songs afterwards. This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great, but it doesn't make for compelling viewing. There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play. Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues.

{"value":"You'd think the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it. However, this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light. It talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other. It makes the computer overload problem (the 1202 and 1201 alarms) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all. And it takes the \"thirty seconds\" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out, when it's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory.<br /><br />If you want to see a

{"value":"There is no way on earth you are going to care about any of these characters. A bunch of spoilt middle class overgrown kids take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and argue. I've just seen this on TV and I didn't think it was a 'film' as such, more a post-'This Life' indulgence that really has no resonance or proper drama to it. Stuff like this will get commissioned for time immemorial unfortunately, irrelevant middle class \"lifestyle\" crap that takes itself far too seriously. It's got David Baddiel in it and that bird out of \"Cold Feet\", you know what to expect. There was a lot of this stuff about in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise...\"they're educated and doing drugs? friends, but kinda dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? sounds great!\". This kind of nonsense, and post-Guy Ritchie comedy- gangster stuff...dark days.

{"value":"... so I thought I'd throw in a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities -- it's obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them -- or less. There's an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies. There's a nice bit where he has to chase after Miss Eleniak in the buff, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is naturally a little on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of a booty. Also, there's a moment when he's getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada. If you're inclined to do so, and come on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a \"road trip\" are. I'd just like thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity. Can William McNamara act?

{"value":"Predictable, told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between, a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia, 70's style incidental violin horror music that is comical at times, i couldn't help chuckling to myself.<br /><br />I usually like Defoe, and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad, the \"plot\" develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time. Its just that it's all too predictable, i felt like i was watching a made for TV drama instead of a new movie. Maybe thats the style the directors wanted, but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production.<br /><br />Don't expect too much, and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn't have gone to see it at the cinema.

{"value":"This \"film\" is a travesty. No, wait--an abomination. NO, WAIT--this is without a doubt the absolute WORST film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors.<br /><br />I thought \"Inspector Clouseau\" with Alan Arkin (!) instead of Peter Sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious, but even daring to \"remake\" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is asinine and money grubbing.<br /><br />Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. Why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for L & H would be in the persona of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and film-making.

{"value":"Absolute garbage. The reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /><br />The supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - it was just routine police work. Utterly tedious.<br /><br />You sat right till the end hoping for a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /><br />There was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap. Could the Lt's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement? <br /><br />All the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it. But surely a genius like Lt C, by constant conversation with the wronged husband, would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. It could have been good.

{"value":"the only thing that frequently pops into my head while i'm writing this review is,i'll never get that hour and a half back!!! to indicate that i'm not just blowing air, i'll compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy(cube and hypercube)!cube wasn't great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws!hypercube as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it beter than cube(the story was better)! but cube zero in comparison to it's predecessors really isn't worth sh*t!a complete lack of good fx, a very f*ck*d up script and just plain old bad acting don't combine well! example:all of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if ... should happen and then it would happen, so it's not very original neither! my advice: don't lose that hour and a half i lost!!!!!!!! oh and i hope this movie crashes and

{"value":"this film has it all; the deft camera work, reminiscent of martin scorcese, or oliver stone, the tight acting of 'heat', the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say, 'the godfather'<br /><br />the judge reinhold character displays a fiery temperememt, yet also shows real emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of robert de niro's portrayal of jake la motta in raging bull.<br /><br />the action scenes are truly breathtaking, not since bullit has a movie depicted such high octane, yet stylish car scenes. The special effects push the boundries of technology and filmmaking to their limits. Independance day set the standard that this movie clearly has matched, and greatly surpassed.<br /><br />overall, great acting from its a list cast (like an oscars night party invitation list!),
