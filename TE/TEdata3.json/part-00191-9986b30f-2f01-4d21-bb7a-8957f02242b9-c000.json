{"value":"I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! I haven't seen such a bad movie for years.Omg this was a really bad movie. Splatter, is not enough to describe the unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes). If you didn't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 time worse. The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps.!<br /><br />I can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible.Cliché all the time. (why i must write 10lines? i never understood this.)<br /><br />==Here comes spoilers==<br /><br />The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. Actually those people are just missing. And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!","finished_norm":["i","be","realli","surpris","that","thi","movi","get","a","rank","like","thi","i","have","not","see","such","a","bad","movi","for","yearsomg","thi","be","a","realli","bad","movi","splatter","be","not","enough","to","describ","the","unnecessari","nearli","funni","blood","scene","if","you","do","not","like","hostel","or","wolf","creek","or","halloween","good","thi","be","time","wrong","the","stori","remind","me","rl","stine","goosebumpsbr","br","i","ca","not","tell","about","the","act","sinc","the","script","be","so","terriblecliché","all","the","time","why","i","must","write","line","i","never","understand","thisbr","br","here","come","spoilersbr","br","the","stori","be","about","a","butcher","kill","peopl","all","the","time","in","metro","we","be","talk","about","thousand","of","kill","and","no","on","get","notic","actual","that","peopl","be","just","miss","and","there","be","the","good","gui","that","try","to","solv","the","mysteri","good","there","be","no","mysteri","for","u","becaus","we","know","from","the","begin","the","bad","gui","and","a","usual","no","on","believ","him","what","a","surpris","in","the","end","he","put","butcher","cloth","and","fight","to","death","with","the","killer","butcher"],"filtered":["realli","surpris","thi","movi","get","rank","like","thi","see","bad","movi","yearsomg","thi","realli","bad","movi","splatter","enough","describ","unnecessari","nearli","funni","blood","scene","like","hostel","wolf","creek","halloween","good","thi","time","wrong","stori","remind","rl","stine","goosebumpsbr","br","ca","tell","act","sinc","script","terriblecliché","time","must","write","line","never","understand","thisbr","br","come","spoilersbr","br","stori","butcher","kill","peopl","time","metro","talk","thousand","kill","get","notic","actual","peopl","miss","good","gui","try","solv","mysteri","good","mysteri","u","becaus","know","begin","bad","gui","usual","believ","surpris","end","put","butcher","cloth","fight","death","killer","butcher"],"filtered2":["realli","surpris","get","rank","like","see","bad","yearsomg","realli","bad","splatter","enough","describ","unnecessari","nearli","funni","blood","scene","like","hostel","wolf","creek","halloween","good","time","wrong","stori","remind","rl","stine","goosebumpsbr","ca","tell","act","sinc","script","terriblecliché","time","must","write","line","never","understand","thisbr","come","spoilersbr","stori","butcher","kill","peopl","time","metro","talk","thousand","kill","get","notic","actual","peopl","miss","good","gui","try","solv","mysteri","good","mysteri","u","becaus","know","begin","bad","gui","usual","believ","surpris","end","put","butcher","cloth","fight","death","killer","butcher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,8,9,13,17,19,21,22,23,24,25,26,34,36,42,52,55,62,65,76,77,81,90,91,93,107,112,141,147,159,162,186,212,232,245,252,255,265,326,355,403,611,644,668,688,879,1081,1269,1393,1654,1801,1857,2004,2336,2394,2738,3870,3964],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,8,9,13,17,19,21,22,23,24,25,26,34,36,42,52,55,62,65,76,77,81,90,91,93,107,112,141,147,159,162,186,212,232,245,252,255,265,326,355,403,611,644,668,688,879,1081,1269,1393,1654,1801,1857,2004,2336,2394,2738,3870,3964],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,2.825681057716235,3.205071257016622,2.2635883139467947,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,1.7122153074726136,3.9073995778510735,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,4.267533106664805,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.1439533986393955,2.2466628996789315,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.3586007221245198,2.571852579609833,2.5983793339432615,2.8377834061292515,2.7502029743242886,3.0433232530252132,2.6754694156628323,2.73529586597515,5.885680771176112,3.185521045582134,6.378794038853654,3.520060914452293,3.5670958631572662,3.5813614403160887,3.6016814428070463,3.8962296530720266,4.1302590120314875,4.3215761317340196,4.436351646326448,4.637773374493822,4.85885294158718,5.143104478942172,5.014723312293965,15.686613902098792,5.290429193699031,5.274680836730892,5.999576715605417,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.38948507725683E-5,0.034792825150001344,6.395736488483461E-5,6.358781854916942E-5,6.358886036398446E-5,6.349997584467794E-5,6.368883367001E-5,6.347313125669733E-5,6.361584199446312E-5,7.057830404087158E-5,0.9236641073005887,6.337067162856937E-5,6.455345378918597E-5,6.547432299220827E-5,6.34168808612444

{"value":"The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate, well-crafted independent film. Damn that opening shot for filling me hope. As the \"film\" progressed in a slow, plodding manner, my thoughts were varied in relation to this \"film\": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this \"film\"? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this film in the Theatre! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre, because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college \"nerd\" had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Other than that this \"film\" went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter. It succeeded on none of these fronts. Oh, and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad.

{"value":"OK. Not bad movie making if it were from an original script. BUT IT IS NOT!<br /><br />Which part of \"in this story there are no women, except for Foulata and Gagoola\" introduction by Haggard did the producers, directors and writers not understand? I mean, it is pretty plain English. I understood it at age 10!. The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with. But, nooo, they have to throw \"romance\" into it. Pathetic. Suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book. Give it up. Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes along and \"does it right\" you may as well keep re-reading the tome. BTW, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called Allan's wife. It gives background to the story of Quatermain.

{"value":"I thought this movie had absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fiancé left you on your wedding day for your cousin??? I would be heartbroken!! It's classified as a comedy but I didn't find it funny at all. I thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them. I normally love Julie Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee stars in another disgraceful show, which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society. It had a complete lack of taste and I despise movies like this. I understand that people will defend this movie and it's morals because it is 'Just a movie', but I still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn't be allowed on screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and parts of this movie were enjoyable, I'm just saying that in real life,

{"value":"I've read every book to date in the left behind series, and the movie hardly does any of them justice. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt like the actors were reading their lines, instead of actually saying them. The characters were stiff and unlikeable. The effects were cheesy, and looked terribly fake. The ending was awful. First of all, it didn't even go all the way through the first book. Second, it made no sense. If you hadn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on. It had to have been the most cheesy, film student-like ending I've ever seen in a movie. I'm upset that I actually paid money for this movie. If by some miracle, it does get wide release, they ought to totally overhaul it and let Hollywood take over.

{"value":"I gave this loooooooooooong film a \"2\" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can't read like a speed-reader you will NEVER get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speed talking! And, what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles. Endless stares and goof-eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good cinematography but also some so DARK you think your screen has burned out. How this won anything I will never understand. Difficult to talk about \"ACTING\" since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away. The character Geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that ANYONE would push him away. And what is with his mother?

{"value":"This is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older, married lover after she gets pregnant; she avenges herself against him, and his entire family, through black magic  which, disappointingly, she doesn't do herself but has someone else do for her. Good production values for a Thai horror flick. But the bland script never generates suspense, the director approaches the material entirely conventionally, and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds. At one point, a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead, and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun. Bad writing  you're soaking in it! <br /><br />Some icky gore effects, including a really tasteless late-term-fetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach.

{"value":"In a far away Galaxy is a planet called Ceta. It's native people worship cats. But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food. This is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie I've seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films. It's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are US the viewer. Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who STILL buy this crap.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary by Ted Mikels; the Story behind the Making of

{"value":"The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. However, once the action switched to the home of Ingrid's fiancé, it all completely fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film. The fiancé's boorish son and the military attaché's vying for the maid's attention looked stupid--sort of like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate (just as in the other film). I was not a huge fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film.","finished_norm":["the","half","hour","or","so","of","thi","movi","i","like","the","obviou","bud","romanc","between","ingrid","bergman","and","mel","ferrer","be","cute","to","watch","and","i","want","to","see","the","inevit","happen","between","them","howev","onc","the","action","switch","to","the","home","of","ingrid","fiancé","it","all","complet","fall","apart","instead","of","romanc","and","charm","we","see","some","excruciatingli","dopei","parallel","charact","emerg","who","ruin","the","film","the","fiancé","boorish","son","and","the","militari","attaché","vie","for","the","maid","attent","look","stupidsort","of","like","a","subplot","from","a","old","love","boat","episod","how","the","charm","and","eleg","of","the","portion","of","the","film","can","give","wai","to","dopi","be","beyond","me","thi","film","be","a","obviou","attempt","by","renoir","to","recaptur","the","success","he","have","with","the","rule","of","the","game","a","the","movi","be","veri","similar","onc","the","action","switch","to","the","countri","estat","just","a","in","the","other","film","i","be","not","a","huge","fan","of","the","rule","of","the","game","but","elena","and","her","man","have","me","appreci","the","artistri","and","nuanc","of","the","origin","film"],"filtered":["half","hour","thi","movi","like","obviou","bud","romanc","ingrid","bergman","mel","ferrer","cute","watch","want","see","inevit","happen","howev","onc","action","switch","home","ingrid","fiancé","complet","fall","apart","instead","romanc","charm","see","excruciatingli","dopei","parallel","charact","emerg","ruin","film","fiancé","boorish","son","militari","attaché","vie","maid","attent","look","stupidsort","like","subplot","old","love","boat","episod","charm","eleg","portion","film","give","wai","dopi","beyond","thi","film","obviou","attempt","renoir","recaptur","success","rule","game","movi","veri","similar","onc","action","switch","countri","estat","film","huge","fan","rule","game","elena","man","appreci","artistri","nuanc","origin","film"],"filtered2":["half","hour","like","obviou","bud","romanc","ingrid","bergman","mel","ferrer","cute","watch","want","see","inevit","happen","howev","onc","action","switch","home","ingrid","fiancé","complet","fall","apart","instead","romanc","charm","see","excruciatingli","dopei","parallel","charact","emerg","ruin","fiancé","boorish","son","militari","attaché","vie","maid","attent","look","stupidsort","like","subplot","old","love","boat","charm","eleg","portion","give","wai","dopi","beyond","obviou","attempt","renoir","recaptur","success","rule","game","veri","similar","onc","action","switch","countri","estat","huge","fan","rule","game","elena","man","appreci","artistri","nuanc","origin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,10,15,16,30,33,37,45,54,67,69,94,103,113,129,140,152,170,174,177,206,236,302,374,383,434,444,502,532,572,591,608,636,710,797,855,892,961,984,1289,1409,1450,1579,2009,2248,2414,2637,2774,3057,3129,3205,3322,3609,3662,4029,5004,5386,5926,6398,6864,7713],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,10,15,16,30,33,37,45,54,67,69,94,103,113,129,140,152,170,174,177,206,236,302,374,383,434,444,502,532,572,591,608,636,710,797,855,892,961,984,1289,1409,1450,1579,2009,2248,2414,2637,2774,3057,3129,3205,3322,3609,3662,4029,5004,5386,5926,6398,6864,7713],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.8162961064622165,1.8113893252729412,1.9570915389266579,2.127032521151058,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,4.821391668015843,2.317169775997098,2.3131195476980753,2.4071371113909277,2.456282578459816,2.458149992634611,2.597304642813496,5.235847860032464,2.902686292364678,6.914426021585259,6.0866465060504265,3.4101163271295305,3.2535472664379905,3.3132665011396125,3.4446025032006995,3.4933926673701317,3.530930586689197,3.616452760127359,3.530930586689197,3.6528204042982337,7.597548633842627,3.9201351739255808,7.965050933049725,3.9954846111673676,4.263079925052412,8.886262666623654,4.484804029712395,4.679973728984199,9.210500365576523,4.9676558014359795,5.014723312293965,5.170884043049248,5.408212229355414,5.7959777603641776,11.253802860640487,5.482320201509136,5.482320201509136,5.7959777603641776,5.770002273960917,5.672363804397,5.9370563586240825,6.1754673820690815,6.214688095222362,13.897314540605125,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.558399362815334E-5,4.527661010245094E-5,4.562859257252463E-5,4.5364950078542905E-5,4.536569333217471E-5,4.530228115869407E-5,4.5437016490297035E-5,4.528312963845946E-5,4.538494262154538E-5

{"value":"I rented this movie because I was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one's heard of and could be a possible gem. I saw this and, since I'm a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It got the rating of EM which means: Extremely Mature. Thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else, I got it. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge, and Nudity. The \"extreme violence\" struck my fancy. The movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick. It had one or two gory scenes but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course the amount of gore in a movie isn't all that counts, right? You have plot also. Well, the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it. Don't rent it. I speak the truth. I can't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say: \"I'm gonna rent that again.\" It had it's moments where it kept you going but I'm never going to see that film

{"value":"A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, Karen Black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. The acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. This film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. People looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of \"Friday the 13th: the Series\" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror.

{"value":"If you hate redneck accents, you'll hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, a has been trying to be a redneck. I really can't stand redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good in Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much more hickish can this movie get? The storyline was stupid. I'm usually not this judgemental of movies, but I couldn't stand this movie. If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade.<br /><br />My mom found this movie for $5.95 at Wal Mart...figures...I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my Grandma for Christmas. It could just be that I can't stand redneck accents usually, or that I can't stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze wasn't in it. I didn't laugh once in the movie.

{"value":"Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, a confusing movie. Granted, I had a few beers while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why I got so bored by this flick.<br /><br />Its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie. The inbetween stuff, which would be the movie, is just boring images and a waste of time. <br /><br />We never see actual murders, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you even just get a feeling that Dahmer's dreaming the entire thing, but you know he isn't, since it's<br /><br />based on a true story and this actually happened, at least most of it. But what happened? It's not easy to tell.<br /><br />I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie.

{"value":"I like Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be fun to watch this film, since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together. I thought I had seen all Billy's movies but couldn't remember this one, and now I know why. It's so full of clichés and phony emotion; you can smell each scene coming (and going!). Billy doesn't even get to be funny very often. He's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down. Alan King himself is fairly likable, as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place, etc. etc. Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA. And when the end comes, boy, does it come quickly! Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene.

{"value":"This is the first of these \"8 Films To Die For\" collection that I've seen and it's certainly not made me want to see any of the rest...although I've heard at least a couple of them are decent. I don't know, this wasn't terrible but it didn't really do much for me. Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing, mom & dad died, the family sold the farm & moved to San Francisco (?) where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible. The best part of this was the creepy Goth sister, who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves. Anyway, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on. This family is sort of like the white-bread version of the Sawyer Clan, they're nasty & they do bad things but they ain't go no soul. I see a lot of reviews from people that liked this, and I guess I don't know what I missed, but I found it to be very mediocre & I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of

{"value":"I started to watch this movie with high expectations. However, after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me. This already started in the opening sequence and only got worse.<br /><br />Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comediant present? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander? Why did he, upon being saved, not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comediant know about the Hollanders gold? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property? These and many more questions popped up, and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way.

{"value":"The film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt. Since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off. The deaths are cheesy and are dumb. But at least it had better effects then sabretooth. I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was okay but some deaths were off-screen. There was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out. Then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off. The end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics. Even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts doesn't find them, and seems like she doesn't need the.

{"value":"This is one lowly film. It has no real plot. We never are made privy to motivations, other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it's being controlled by these three older people. Why are they doing what they are doing; in order to strike fear into other members of the group? I don't know. There is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it. Does it do something? I don't know. There's some nudity for its own sake. I'm always surprised to see this in films this old. Things have actually settled down in this regard these days. Anyway, the people run around like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; no resources; no nothing. There are about five silly climaxes in the film. Who are these people and \"is\" there a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence.

{"value":"I watch lots of scary movies (or at least they try to be) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie I have ever had to make myself try to sit through. I never knew the depths of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive. I am a fan of Julian Sans, but this is worse than I would hope for him.<br /><br />On the other hand the story was promising and I was intrigued...for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and I had yet to see what pain looked like first hand. Perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but then again I know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me, especially when we had to turn the video off, and that simply is NOT done with our watching (we had to make one exception obviously). <br /><br />If it were up for a remake, I'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1% of the original incorporated into it.

{"value":"i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and... end.<br /><br />i really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away..

{"value":"Just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay/ movie. The Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. The key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived. The story attempts to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It hardly matters who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is not a strong character to cheer for.

{"value":"I can't believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage! The script is so poorly written and the directing so weak (both by the same person) that its hard to find more one-dimension characters in a film. The dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre. The setup it's tricky, inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film. Bassinger's character is so dumb, that she actually stops to scream to God \"Where are you!\" so the people after her can follow, and then takes a leak!!!! And then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her, and this happens in the middle of the night.

{"value":"Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the \"natural\" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk \"friend\" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause.

{"value":"This is a horrible little film--and unfortunately, the company that made this short made several others. The short is essentially a one-joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you. It certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (most appeared about 2 years-old) cavorting about and pretending to be adults--in this case, a dancehall girl and bar room patrons. It's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults, but I can't see anyone WANTING to see this--especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp!! And then, other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations. At the time, I am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles, but when looking at it today, that is what immediately comes to mind! Because of this, this boring film ALSO creeped me out and I hope to never see it again!!

{"value":"I thought I had seen this movie, twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews, and they didn't quite match up. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings. I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. Therefore I'm putting my review back: If you like the occasional 'B' movie, as I do, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night of improv. Look out! Is the legend true? I think we just might find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film? Does our blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair? Will the exceptionally high-tech Technicolor last the entire film?

{"value":"Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show ran for years, but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation, which most likely stems from the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, as far from B-way as you could get) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer). The slim story, about a grueling audition for a Broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-singers, is pushed right up on us, with loud, brassy talents playing to the rafters. Nothing is modulated or subtle, particularly a laughable subplot about a ex-dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old-flame Douglas. The over-eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache, but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing; this, matched with Attenborough's sluggish pacing, spells disaster, and

{"value":"Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. What happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy.

{"value":"Disowned by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster stunk up Japanese theaters before coming to the States and going immediately to video, where it was not seen again until the Turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am-6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin. The Smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one. The actors, mostly recent graduates of \"Overacting 101\", deliver one cornball line after another. The plot is convoluted. The special effects are unimpressive. The parts that aren't laughable are just plain boring. The script or the book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this dud? But something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid.

{"value":"First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all we're not a Hollywood film.<br /><br />Then get amateur actors. It will be good for the festival hype. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? Then, hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light. You see, if it's well-lit, it won't look \"real\" and the festival people won't like it. Who needs to have professional level photography anyway? Then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator. It will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for \"reality\" and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people, critics and a small sliver of the audience who over-intellectualize will scream \"genius\" because they won't believe this was just complete amateur-hour.<br /><br />Once you've done that, buy your ticket to the

{"value":"OK I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not, never has been, and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies America has ever produced. How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martin's unfunny attempt to be Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career. Some of your contributers say 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character', to that I would say 'balderdash' , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be

{"value":"The movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half. But later something happens and all the sudden Shannon turns into this straight faced, second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it's own context. The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichés, bad acting, a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang.<br /><br />\"Game of Death 2\" was bad and clownified Bruce, but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played Bruce Lee back then. I truly believe that she can do much better than this and I hope she participates in a better production next time.<br /><br />If you are a real hard core action fan and don't care about quality go ahead and see this movie.
