{"value":"A truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so I could stand. Not the actors' fault, but the writer/director, producers, financiers, etc., need a very stiff talking to. Maybe it thinks it is profound. It isn't. This rape and ultra-violence, unlike that central to Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding. It's no Straw Dogs, either, to which I have seen it compared. Rather it feels like something Pete Walker might have turned his hand to, yet even in saying that I'm probably being a bit unfair on Pete Walker.<br /><br />Revenge is a powerful human desire, but The Bedroom Window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort.<br /><br />I don't think it's particularly misogynistic, merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details -- the blood running down GA's leg post rape, par example. It's neither challenging nor confrontational, though I'm sure the film-makers consider themselves very 'daring', just deeply unpleasant.<br /><br />Is this as high as we can aim? Is this why those involved wanted to make films? ( I did write in here the Latin phrase which translates as Oh the Times! Oh the customs! But the new spell-check on IMDb wouldn't let me post until I had removed it. Likewise I had to remove square parentheses. Get it sorted IMDb.)<br /><br />Where is the lofty aspiration? The noble impulse? When you look at British film - the joyful comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man (a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation look at \"The Offence' Dir. Sidney Lumet, from an original play by John Hopkins; check out \"Tunes of Glory\" for something worth making, that has something to say.<br /><br />Unlike the foregoing, Straightheads is, alas, an altogether hateful waste of

{"value":"The movie was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably.<br /><br />Apparently the story writer just don't hold water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past. Accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment.<br /><br />The movie just lack any substance. The only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story. And a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the central theme.<br /><br />The movie fails to answer, why would I watch it anyway?<br /><br />At least some strange legendary Flying Elephants, psychic king, or the eccentric king such as \"The King and I\" would have been lovely, something would have added greatly to the movies' appeal. I guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie. <br /><br />Once you got the appeal, then the story is the next thing we concentrate on. In marketing terms, we call it \"must see\". Upon hearing the title of the movie people would say, Oh, I must see it. Now where's the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it, \"How NOT to be a King?\" and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days, to the style of \"Dr. Strangelove\". That would have been much more interesting. Narrative-like experiences of the foibles of the King from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny. <br /><br />Most movies today have that \"must see\" appeal, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they don't have familiar characters, some other movies such as, The Island, had an appeal itself when the advertising asks \"Do you still believe there is an Island?\". <br /><br />Or for the movie, retitled \"How NOT to be a King\" might ask the question, \"So do you still WANT to be a King?\" <br /><br

{"value":"I tried. I really did. I thought that maybe, if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie. I know that after seeing O FANTASMA I felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core, but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor, so I was like, \"What the hell. At least you didn't pay 10 dollars at the Quad. Give it a shot.\"<br /><br />Sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain. I often wonder if it wouldn't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat and that if I sail away far enough, I will not only get away from it all, but fall clear over, and that some evil, Lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995, still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of me.<br /><br />Is there a reason for Odete? I'd say not at all... just that maybe her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness (one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake) look not only creepy, but flat-out sick to the bone. She first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend (in shrieking hysterics) because she wants a child and he believes they're too young. She later crashes a funeral of a gay man, and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him, she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead man's mother and lover in the sickest of ways. Oh, of course, she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one, but a good three times on his grave. And there's this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes \"Pedro\" which sums up some weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no gender.

{"value":"Fox's \"The True Story Of Jesse James\" (1957) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power/Henry Fonda classic \"Jesse James\". I'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters, the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham-fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it.<br /><br />In the late thirties and forties Tyrone Power was Fox's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head Darryl Zanuck started to groom newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place. This was a major error on Zanuck's part as Wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement. With the possible exceptions of \"Broken Lance\" (1954) and \"Between Heaven & Hell\" (1956) it is hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James to Wagner's Jesse in \"The True Story Of Jesse James\". Borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford's classic \"The Searchers\". But his playing here, along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, is nothing short of boring. Neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles. They totally miss the mark, lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original. The movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay Wagner, as the Robin Hood of the American west, comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever. The supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely getting a look in as Ma James.<br /><br />The best aspects of this uninvolving so-so western is the wonderful Cinemascope/Colour cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer Leigh

That occurred to me when I went back to school..the National Lampoon's Class Reunion. The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head. You have the class president who believes he's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, he's a coward and joke), a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember his name..this is the one running joke I enjoyed). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from \"goonies\" and \"Throw Mama From The Train\")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened, trashed hallways of the old high school. They were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself. The film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on), but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute. The film's true problem is that it really doesn't know where to go. The film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction..if it really has any direction at all. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material they are to make funny just doesn't have the quality to hold any interest.

{"value":"You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of \"Jeopardy!\".<br /><br />The saddest thing about White Men Can't Jump is that it had tremendous potential. For several years, I lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this \"basketball culture\" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men Can't Job left something to be desired.<br /><br />The movie's sequence of events is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. He then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories build up to a climax of some kind, but the \"climax\" I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case being \"Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball\").<br /><br />In order for a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well. Apparently the writers of White Men Can't Jump forgot this rule, as the plot can be summarized as \"Billy needs to pay the bills.\" I appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies, but -- I'm sorry -- this was just plain awful. I could have cared less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment.<br /><br />Despite all this, White Men Can't Jump is a successful film. Apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, were lured by the big names playing the leading roles. This leaves me to wonder, if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone have bothered watching this movie? I really don't think so.<br /><br />I'll give this movie two stars out of ten; the extra star is for the \"Jeopardy!\" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes.

{"value":"Let's hope this is the final nightmare. This is the epitome of a good thing gone bad. Okay, there is still some enjoyment to be had, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise, had been on the production staff and produced even. I don't know what she was thinking, but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by<br /><br />Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote/directed this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror, with the contrived use of a 3D ending. Aren't those glasses nifty? And you get to KEEP them! It's the equivalent of, you just spent $9.00 making me rich. Here's 10 cents. Now, don't you feel special!? Sorry, but for me, it just did not make me feel special. <br /><br />And Freddy's had yet another face-lift. This one was for the worst, I think. All the beautiful artistry that went into his \"look\" in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. He looks ... less like the burn victim he is supposed to be, and more like he has a skin disorder. Changing the lead's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They've done that, and done that. So I guess it doesn't matter. But it mattered to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... another low-rent monster like the Leprechaun. <br /><br />It's more...a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee (sadly, it fell short on both accounts). <br /><br />So there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh, because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film. <br /><br />It rates a 3.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend

{"value":"Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intentions and failure.<br /><br />Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way).<br /><br />To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier. For this, the pair should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990's (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables).<br /><br />Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. I get it. But it doesn't happen at all until far into the film. At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. They're like some sort of un-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes.<br

{"value":"I wish I could give this movie a zero, or even lower, because sadly that's what it deserves. I honestly never walk out of a movie, but this one was so dreadfully awful that I couldn't stand another minute of it. Please,please, please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into, this isn't it.<br /><br />It has unattractive, unappealing leads, choppy structure, ridiculous dialog, and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way. On an absolutely basic level, it fails to entertain. Everything about \"Mango Kiss\" is so stagey, it is WORSE than any student film I have seen.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, the entire movie relies on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over narration. The script writer may as well have written a novel, because they insisted on TELLING everything, instead of SHOWING it. We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection, even though there is no character development to illustrate this. Also, this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a freeze-frame of the characters with their name written over the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. We don't really get to know any of them.<br /><br />This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am a gay woman, who watched this film with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema. I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it doesn't matter how atrocious it is, people will still flock to it, and champion it, no matter how poor the quality is. Please don't rent this!! Instead, let's encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting \"But I'm a Cheerleader\" or \"Fire\" or \"Heavenly Creatures\", instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they

{"value":"Really started the 80s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a \"horror film\". I was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and I was disgusted then as now.<br /><br />Oh, where do we start. Let's see, the setup: You can bring people back to live IF they died a violent death. So that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways, because, well, that's needed to bring them back to life! This might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la Re-Animator or something. But no, it's played straight. There is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down, one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen. However, just about everything else is on screen. There is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople, who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras. Then, there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly--and time consumingly--reveal in time-lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look \"normal\" again. This done, of course, by a slumming Jack Albertson as the mortician behind it all. He likes to drive around in a ambulance/hearse playing old Tommy Dorcey tunes, I guess that is supposed to be cute.<br /><br />In the end, of course, even the Sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands. Not clear why the Sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off, sticking needles in burn-victims eyes, etc.<br /><br />I wonder, really wonder, what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all. It's not scary, the twists are laughable, and overall it's kind of sick. It's not even well enough done to \"see it on a dare\" or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad HG Lewis film. It's just God-awful trash, made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore, and made by people slumming for a paycheck.<br /><br />Sad that Albertson was even involved.","finished_norm":["realli","start","the","trend","of","disgust","violenc","masquerad","a","a","horror","film","i","be","the","target","audienc","for","thi","repel","piec","of","trash","and","i","be","disgust","then","a","nowbr","br","oh","where","do","we","start","let","see","the","setup","you","can","bring","peopl","back","to","live","if","thei","die","a","violent","death","so","that","laughabl","weak","premis","be","the","excus","to","butcher","peopl","in","horribl","wai","becaus","good","that","ne","to","bring","them","back","to","life","thi","mai","have","work","if","plai","over","the","top","for","black","laugh","a","la","reanim","or","someth","but","no","it","plai","straight","there","be","a","whole","terrifi","famili","in","a","wagon","that","get","hunt","down","on","of","the","few","scene","at","littl","where","their","demis","be","off","screen","howev","just","about","everyth","els","be","on","screen","there","be","actual","a","scene","where","a","young","girl","walk","along","be","beat","and","kill","by","zombi","townspeopl","who","be","all","film","it","and","grin","with","sever","camera","then","there","be","a","closeup","of","her","face","a","the","filmmak","lovinglyand","time","consuminglyrev","in","timelaps","photographi","her","beat","face","be","carv","down","to","a","skull","and","rebuild","to","look","normal","again","thi","do","of","cours","by","a","slum","jack","albertson","a","the","mortician","behind","it","all","he","like","to","drive","around","in","a","ambulancehears","plai","old","tommi","dorcei","tune","i","guess","that","be","suppos","to","be","cutebr","br","in","the","end","of","cours","even","the","sheriff","be","undead","and","the","doctor","offer","kindli","to","fix","hi","rot","hand","not","clear","why","the","sheriff","be","not","out","with","the","other","townspeopl","kill","child","with","glee","and","slice","their","face","off","stick","needl","in","burnvictim","ey","etcbr","br","i","wonder","realli","wonder","what","peopl","see","in","a","geek","show","like","thi","to","give","it","ani","kind","of","rate","at","all","it","not","scari","the","twist","be","laughabl","and","overal","it","kind","of","sick","it","not","even","good","enough","do","to","see","it","on","a","dare","or","enjoi","on","a","level","you","mai","watch","a","bad","hg","lewi","film","it","just","godaw","trash","make","for","peopl","who","get","off","on","thi","typ","of","pointless","gore","and","make","by","peopl","slum","for","a","paycheckbr","br","sad","that","albertson","be","even","involv"],"filtered":["realli","start","trend","disgust","violenc","masquerad","horror","film","target","audienc","thi","repel","piec","trash","disgust","nowbr","br","oh","start","let","see","setup","bring","peopl","back","live","thei","die","violent","death","laughabl","weak","premis","excus","butcher","peopl","horribl","wai","becaus","good","ne","bring","back","life","thi","mai","work","plai","top","black","laugh","la","reanim","someth","plai","straight","whole","terrifi","famili","wagon","get","hunt","scene","littl","demis","screen","howev","everyth","els","screen","actual","scene","young","girl","walk","along","beat","kill","zombi","townspeopl","film","grin","sever","camera","closeup","face","filmmak","lovinglyand","time","consuminglyrev","timelaps","photographi","beat","face","carv","skull","rebuild","look","normal","thi","cours","slum","jack","albertson","mortician","behind","like","drive","around","ambulancehears","plai","old","tommi","dorcei","tune","guess","suppos","cutebr","br","end","cours","even","sheriff","undead","doctor","offer","kindli","fix","hi","rot","hand","clear","sheriff","townspeopl","kill","child","glee","slice","face","stick","needl","burnvictim","ey","etcbr","br","wonder","realli","wonder","peopl","see","geek","show","like","thi","give","ani","kind","rate","scari","twist","laughabl","overal","kind","sick","even","good","enough","see","dare","enjoi","level","mai","watch","bad","hg","lewi","film","godaw","trash","make","peopl","get","thi","typ","pointless","gore","make","peopl","slum","paycheckbr","br","sad","albertson","even","involv"],"filtered2":["realli","start","trend","disgust","violenc","masquerad","horror","target","audienc","repel","piec","trash","disgust","nowbr","oh","start","let","see","setup","bring","peopl","back","live","die","violent","death","laughabl","weak","premis","excus","butcher","peopl","horribl","wai","becaus","good","ne","bring","back","life","mai","work","plai","top","black","laugh","la","reanim","someth","plai","straight","whole","terrifi","famili","wagon","get","hunt","scene","littl","demis","screen","howev","everyth","els","screen","actual","scene","young","girl","walk","along","beat","kill","zombi","townspeopl","grin","sever","camera","closeup","face","filmmak","lovinglyand","time","consuminglyrev","timelaps","photographi","beat","face","carv","skull","rebuild","look","normal","cours","slum","jack","albertson","mortician","behind","like","drive","around","am

{"value":"This film is shoddily-made, unoriginal garbage. I like romantic comedies sometimes. Watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner. It's not something you are going to do all the time, but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being. This movie made me think about how stupid I was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time. Everything about it screamed made on the cheap. It actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out. It boasts cheesy CGI and lame sets, too.<br /><br />The writing was clunky. I know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy, but you usually don't really care because you are laughing. This movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved. Events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition. Sure, this is how all movies work, but you shouldn't notice that it's happening. Inelegant. That's the term I should use.<br /><br />There was almost no one in the movie who was really likable. I didn't care who ended up with whom, as long as they all stayed the hell away from me, and I didn't have to listen to them talk about it anymore. Why would the only really cool character in the movie, the Paul Rudd character, want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy, condescending, control freak played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out (and bathe with) with a woman he is attracted to? The best feel-good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with Rudd's equally annoying lying, kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, appealing women. Maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","shoddilymad","unorigin","garbag","i","like","romant","comedi","sometim","watch","a","good","on","be","like","eat","ic","cream","for","dinner","it","not","someth","you","be","go","to","do","all","the","time","but","the","experi","be","so","pleasur","that","you","can","ignor","how","unwis","you","be","be","thi","movi","make","me","think","about","how","stupid","i","be","for","continu","to","remain","seat","for","it","entir","run","time","everyth","about","it","scream","make","on","the","cheap","it","actual","look","like","thei","overexpos","the","film","at","certain","point","it","be","so","wash","out","it","boast","cheesi","cgi","and","lame","set","toobr","br","the","write","be","clunki","i","know","that","you","can","usual","expect","some","plot","problem","in","a","screwbal","comedi","but","you","usual","do","not","realli","care","becaus","you","be","laugh","thi","movi","be","so","unfunni","that","you","actual","sit","there","and","wonder","about","the","unlik","seri","of","coincid","and","complet","unbeliev","behavior","involv","event","be","place","in","the","film","just","to","move","the","charact","from","on","scene","to","the","next","or","to","provid","exposit","sure","thi","be","how","all","movi","work","but","you","should","not","notic","that","it","happen","ineleg","that","the","term","i","should","usebr","br","there","be","almost","no","on","in","the","movi","who","be","realli","likabl","i","do","not","care","who","end","up","with","whom","a","long","a","thei","all","stai","the","hell","awai","from","me","and","i","do","not","have","to","listen","to","them","talk","about","it","anymor","why","would","the","onli","realli","cool","charact","in","the","movi","the","paul","rudd","charact","want","to","have","anyth","to","do","with","the","complet","bitchi","condescend","control","freak","plai","by","eva","longoria","conjur","almost","all","of","the","charact","involv","consist","pick","the","sleazi","solut","to","ani","situat","a","straight","man","pretend","to","be","gai","for","five","year","just","to","hang","out","and","bath","with","with","a","woman","he","be","attract","to","the","well","feelgood","moment","thei","can","come","up","with","be","to","tack","on","a","happi","end","for","the","same","schmoe","where","he","get","togeth","with","rudd","equal","annoi","lie","kleptomaniac","sister","lake","bell","and","eva","longoria","be","veri","attract","appeal","woman","mayb","thei","will","find","someth","well","to","appear","in","down","the","road"],"filtered":["thi","film","shoddilymad","unorigin","garbag","like","romant","comedi","sometim","watch","good","like","eat","ic","cream","dinner","someth","go","time","experi","pleasur","ignor","unwis","thi","movi","make","think","stupid","continu","remain","seat","entir","run","time","everyth","scream","make","cheap","actual","look","like","thei","overexpos","film","certain","point","wash","boast","cheesi","cgi","lame","set","toobr","br","write","clunki","know","usual","expect","plot","problem","screwbal","comedi","usual","realli","care","becaus","laugh","thi","movi","unfunni","actual","sit","wonder","unlik","seri","coincid","complet","unbeliev","behavior","involv","event","place","film","move","charact","scene","next","provid","exposit","sure","thi","movi","work","notic","happen","ineleg","term","usebr","br","almost","movi","realli","likabl","care","end","long","thei","stai","hell","awai","listen","talk","anymor","onli","realli","cool","charact","movi","paul","rudd","charact","want","anyth","complet","bitchi","condescend","control","freak","plai","eva","longoria","conjur","almost","charact","involv","consist","pick","sleazi","solut","ani","situat","straight","man","pretend","gai","five","year","hang","bath","woman","attract","well","feelgood","moment","thei","come","tack","happi","end","schmoe","get","togeth","rudd","equal","annoi","lie","kleptomaniac","sister","lake","bell","eva","longoria","veri","attract","appeal","woman","mayb","thei","find","someth","well","appear","road"],"filtered2":["shoddilymad","unorigin","garbag","like","romant","comedi","sometim","watch","good","like","eat","ic","cream","dinner","someth","go","time","experi","pleasur","ignor","unwis","make","think","stupid","continu","remain","seat","entir","run","time","everyth","scream","make","cheap","actual","look","like","overexpos","certain","point","wash","boast","cheesi","cgi","lame","set","toobr","write","clunki","know","usual","expect","plot","problem","screwbal","comedi","usual","realli","care","becaus","laugh","unfunni","actual","sit","wonder","unlik","coincid","complet","unbeliev","behavior","involv","event","place","move","charact","scene","next","provid","exposit","sure","work","notic","happen","ineleg","term","usebr","almost","realli","likabl","care","end","long","stai","hell","awai","listen","talk","anymor","onli","realli","cool","charact","paul","rudd","charact","want","anyth","complet","bitchi","condescend","control","freak","pl

{"value":"I hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired. The only high points are a few of the supporting characters, 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put that into perspective).<br /><br />The whole storyline is centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with gay vampires, gay sex with straight vampires, sex to score vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we're scared of vampires, sex because we're mad at vampires, sex because we just became a vampire, etc.<br /><br />Nothing against sex, it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline. Perhaps HAVE a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it. But they didn't even bother to do that... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy gap-tooth bitch. Either she sucks or her character sucks, I can't figure out which.<br /><br />Another part of the storyline that I find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire Bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like Sookie. She's constantly flying off the handle at him for things he can't control. He leaves for two days and she already decides that he's \"not coming back\" and suddenly has feelings for dog-man? Give me a break. She's supposed to be a 25 year old woman, not a 14 year old girl. People close to her are dying all over, and she's got the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her V-card to some dude because she can't read his mind? As the main character of the story, I would've hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in, not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma.

{"value":"I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released. Many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed \"master\" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. \"Salem's Lot\" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series, directed by Tobe Hooper (he of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" fame) and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a \"Chiller Theatre\" vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed. It didn't happen.<br /><br />Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it's all downhill. Jack Nicholson cannot be anything but Jack Nicholson. He's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here. I don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this clinker, the \"Here's Johnny!\" bit notwithstanding...he's just awful in this movie. So is everyone else, for that matter. Scatman Crothers' character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest \"shock\" sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. King's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom.<br /><br />This movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond

{"value":"This is the page for \"House of Exorcism\", but most people have confused this film with the Mario Bava masterpiece, \"Lisa & the Devil\", which explains the ridiculously high rating for this, \"House of exorcism.\" When \"Lisa & the Devil\" was shown at film festivals in the early 70's, it was a critical success. Audiences responded well to that gorgeous, Gothic horror film. Unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time, and was considered too unusual, and not commercial enough for mass consumption. No distributor would buy it. So producer Alfredo Leone decided to edit 'Lisa', seemingly with a chainsaw, by removing just about half of the original film, and adding new scenes, which he filmed two years after the original product! It is important to note that Bava had little to do with these new, hideous additions, so technically \"House of Exorcism\" is not a Bava film. The original product is a slow, dreamy, classy production. A few minutes into the film, the viewer is jarred out of this dream world, as suddenly we see Lisa, (two years older, and with a very different haircut), begin to writhe on the ground, making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like \"suck my co@k\", etc. Subtle, huh? And the film continues like this, jumping back and forth between a beautiful, visual film, and a grade Z \"Exorcist\" rip-off. Leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes, while keeping some semblance of a story intact. He failed miserably. When the choice was made to basically destroy \"Lisa and the devil\", Bava himself refused, saying that his film was too beautiful to cut. He was right, and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet. It was many years before the original \"Lisa and the Devil\" was seen again, re-surfacing on late night television. I had seen \"lisa\" long before i saw this new version, and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films \"vandalised\" in this way. Worth seeing only for curiosity sake. Otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","page","for","hous","of","exorc","but","much","peopl","have","confus","thi","film","with","the","mario","bava","masterpiec","lisa","the","devil","which","explain","the","ridicul","high","rate","for","thi","hous","of","exorc","when","lisa","the","devil","be","show","at","film","festiv","in","the","earli","it","be","a","critic","success","audienc","respond","good","to","that","gorgeou","gothic","horror","film","unfortun","it","be","a","bite","ahead","of","it","time","and","be","consid","too","unusu","and","not","commerci","enough","for","mass","consumpt","no","distributor","would","bui","it","so","produc","alfredo","leon","decid","to","edit","lisa","seemingli","with","a","chainsaw","by","remov","just","about","half","of","the","origin","film","and","add","new","scene","which","he","film","two","year","after","the","origin","product","it","be","import","to","note","that","bava","have","littl","to","do","with","thi","new","hideou","addit","so","technic","hous","of","exorc","be","not","a","bava","film","the","origin","product","be","a","slow","dreami","classi","product","a","few","minut","into","the","film","the","viewer","be","jar","out","of","thi","dream","world","a","suddenli","we","see","lisa","two","year","old","and","with","a","veri","differ","haircut","begin","to","writh","on","the","grind","make","guttur","sound","and","croak","epitaph","like","suck","my","cok","etc","subtl","huh","and","the","film","continu","like","thi","jump","back","and","forth","between","a","beauti","visual","film","and","a","grade","z","exorcist","ripoff","leon","be","try","to","incorpor","thi","shock","scene","while","keep","some","semblanc","of","a","stori","intact","he","fail","miser","when","the","choic","be","make","to","basic","destroi","lisa","and","the","devil","bava","himself","refus","sai","that","hi","film","be","too","beauti","to","cut","he","be","right","and","it","must","have","be","quit","sad","for","thi","artist","to","see","all","hi","work","destroi","and","flush","down","the","toilet","it","be","mani","year","befor","the","origin","lisa","and","the","devil","be","see","again","resurfac","on","late","night","televis","i","have","see","lisa","long","befor","i","see","thi","new","version","and","it","be","downright","disturb","to","wit","on","of","my","favorit","film","vandalis","in","thi","wai","worth","see","onli","for","curios","sake","otherwis","avoid","thi","insidi","disast","like","the","plagu"],"filtered":["thi","page","hous","exorc","much","peopl","confus","thi","film","mario","bava","masterpiec","lisa","devil","explain","ridicul","high","rate","thi","hous","exorc","lisa","devil","show","film","festiv","earli","critic","success","audienc","respond","good","gorgeou","gothic","horror","film","unfortun","bite","ahead","time","consid","unusu","commerci","enough","mass","consumpt","distributor","bui","produc","alfredo","leon","decid","edit","lisa","seemingli","chainsaw","remov","half","origin","film","add","new","scene","film","two","year","origin","product","import","note","bava","littl","thi","new","hideou","addit","technic","hous","exorc","bava","film","origin","product","slow","dreami","classi","product","minut","film","viewer","jar","thi","dream","world","suddenli","see","lisa","two","year","old","veri","differ","haircut","begin","writh","grind","make","guttur","sound","croak","epitaph","like","suck","cok","etc","subtl","huh","film","continu","like","thi","jump","back","forth","beauti","visual","film","grade","z","exorcist","ripoff","leon","try","incorpor","thi","shock","scene","keep","semblanc","stori","intact","fail","miser","choic","make","basic","destroi","lisa","devil","bava","refus","sai","hi","film","beauti","cut","right","must","quit","sad","thi","artist","see","hi","work","destroi","flush","toilet","mani","year","befor","origin","lisa","devil","see","resurfac","late","night","televis","see","lisa","long","befor","see","thi","new","version","downright","disturb","wit","favorit","film","vandalis","thi","wai","worth","see","onli","curios","sake","otherwis","avoid","thi","insidi","disast","like","plagu"],"filtered2":["page","hous","exorc","peopl","confus","mario","bava","masterpiec","lisa","devil","explain","ridicul","high","rate","hous","exorc","lisa","devil","show","festiv","earli","critic","success","audienc","respond","good","gorgeou","gothic","horror","unfortun","bite","ahead","time","consid","unusu","commerci","enough","mass","consumpt","distributor","bui","produc","alfredo","leon","decid","edit","lisa","seemingli","chainsaw","remov","half","origin","add","new","scene","two","year","origin","product","import","note","bava","littl","new","hideou","addit","technic","hous","exorc","bava","origin","product","slow","dreami","classi","product","minut","viewer","jar","dream","world","suddenli","see","lisa","two","year","old","veri","differ","haircut","begin","writh","grind","make","guttur","sound","croak","epitaph","like","suck","cok","etc","subtl","huh","contin

{"value":"I just don't see how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad. It just boggles the mind, doesn't it?<br /><br />Well, let's make no mistake about it. \"Munchie Strikes Back\" is indeed a bad film. Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mom's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20,000. Ouch. She can't come up with the money because she just got fired. OK...JUST is the key word in that sentence. What the...? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? Maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think?<br /><br />Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was \"borrowing\" it from. The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Sadly, those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange. Hmm.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. You'll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, kicks a dog which is yapping at her. Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. \"Munchie Strikes Back\"'s credits promised another film to follow entitled, I believe, \"Munchie Hangs Ten\". To date, the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force.

{"value":"1975's MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE is an amazing and wonderful film to watch. This isn't because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all. It's because the film is so silly and so over-the-top that it is a camp classic--bad, but enjoyably bad. The film stars a blind guy who has a Frisbee-like device on a chain that chops off people's heads as he expertly throws this at his foes! Who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papier-mache arms or that the guy was blind! It's just a ball to watch from start to finish--and one of my favorite \"bad\" films and great to see with friends.<br /><br />Because of this film, I was eager to see THE FATAL FLYING GUILLOTINES (1977), though sadly it turned out NOT to be a sequel but a bit of a knock-off--taking many of the ideas from the original but neglecting to make the film as coherent or watchable. Sure, it's silly fun, but it never comes close to MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE in entertainment value. Like the original film, there are these weird flying devices that sever heads, but they are quite different--with circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own. There also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly what's occurring in this English-dubbed version, as the plot is completely incomprehensible. However, at the same time, some of the martial arts action is very good. While not up to the high standards of most Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba films, the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plot.<br /><br />Overall, this is a film that martial arts fans may like (despite its many, many, many, many shortcomings), but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous. BUT, most importantly, it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE. Too bad.","finished_norm":["master","of","the","fly","guillotin","be","a","amaz","and","wonder","film","to","watch","thi","be","not","becaus","the","fight","be","particularli","inspir","or","becaus","the","film","make","ani","sens","at","all","it","becaus","the","film","be","so","silli","and","so","overthetop","that","it","be","a","camp","classicbad","but","enjoy","bad","the","film","star","a","blind","gui","who","have","a","frisbeelik","devic","on","a","chain","that","chop","off","peopl","head","a","he","expertli","throw","thi","at","hi","foe","who","care","that","the","physic","be","imposs","or","that","the","film","featur","such","silli","thing","a","fighter","with","foot","long","papiermach","arm","or","that","the","gui","be","blind","it","just","a","ball","to","watch","from","start","to","finishand","on","of","my","favorit","bad","film","and","great","to","see","with","friendsbr","br","becaus","of","thi","film","i","be","eager","to","see","the","fatal","fly","guillotin","though","sadli","it","turn","out","not","to","be","a","sequel","but","a","bite","of","a","knockofftak","mani","of","the","idea","from","the","origin","but","neglect","to","make","the","film","a","coher","or","watchabl","sure","it","silli","fun","but","it","never","come","close","to","master","of","the","fly","guillotin","in","entertain","valu","like","the","origin","film","there","be","thi","weird","fly","devic","that","sever","head","but","thei","be","quit","differentwith","circular","see","blade","and","almost","a","mind","of","their","own","there","conjur","be","no","blind","gui","but","instead","be","a","bunch","of","baddi","who","realli","have","no","depth","nor","doe","the","audienc","understand","exactli","what","occur","in","thi","englishdub","version","a","the","plot","be","complet","incomprehens","howev","at","the","same","time","some","of","the","martial","art","action","be","veri","good","while","not","up","to","the","high","standard","of","much","bruce","lee","or","sonni","chiba","film","the","action","be","worthwhil","despit","the","ludicr","and","often","confus","plotbr","br","overal","thi","be","a","film","that","martial","art","fan","mai","like","despit","it","mani","mani","mani","mani","shortcom","but","conjur","on","that","other","will","probabl","turn","off","or","laugh","hyster","at","instead","of","enjoi","the","action","becaus","the","film","be","just","so","ludicr","but","much","importantli","it","never","come","close","to","be","a","funni","or","watchabl","a","master","of","the","fly","guillotin","too","bad"],"filtered":["master","fly","guillotin","amaz","wonder","film","watch","thi","becaus","fight","particularli","inspir","becaus","film","make","ani","sens","becaus","film","silli","overthetop","camp","classicbad","enjoy","bad","film","star","blind","gui","frisbeelik","devic","chain","chop","peopl","head","expertli","throw","thi","hi","foe","care","physic","imposs","film","featur","silli","thing","fighter","foot","long","papiermach","arm","gui","blind","ball","watch","start","finishand","favorit","bad","film","great","see","friendsbr","br","becaus","thi","film","eager","see","fatal","fly","guillotin","though","sadli","turn","sequel","bite","knockofftak","mani","idea","origin","neglect","make","film","coher","watchabl","sure","silli","fun","never","come","close","master","fly","guillotin","entertain","valu","like","origin","film","thi","weird","fly","devic","sever","head","thei","quit","differentwith","circular","see","blade","almost","mind","conjur","blind","gui","instead","bunch","baddi","realli","depth","doe","audienc","understand","exactli","occur","thi","englishdub","version","plot","complet","incomprehens","howev","time","martial","art","action","veri","good","high","standard","much","bruce","lee","sonni","chiba","film","action","worthwhil","despit","ludicr","often","confus","plotbr","br","overal","thi","film","martial","art","fan","mai","like","despit","mani","mani","mani","mani","shortcom","conjur","probabl","turn","laugh","hyster","instead","enjoi","action","becaus","film","ludicr","much","importantli","never","come","close","funni","watchabl","master","fly","guillotin","bad"],"filtered2":["master","fly","guillotin","amaz","wonder","watch","becaus","fight","particularli","inspir","becaus","make","ani","sens","becaus","silli","overthetop","camp","classicbad","enjoy","bad","star","blind","gui","frisbeelik","devic","chain","chop","peopl","head","expertli","throw","foe","care","physic","imposs","featur","silli","thing","fighter","foot","long","papiermach","arm","gui","blind","ball","watch","start","finishand","favorit","bad","great","see","friendsbr","becaus","eager","see","fatal","fly","guillotin","though","sadli","turn","sequel","bite","knockofftak","mani","idea","origin","neglect","make","coher","watchabl","sure","silli","fun","never","come","close","master","fly","guillotin","entertain","valu","like","origin","weird","fly","devic","sever","head","quit","differentwith","circular","see","blade","almost","min

{"value":"Never even knew this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it, hidden deep in my dusty horror closet. The title on the box said \"Insect\" and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. They can surely be fun, of course, as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in \"Blue Monkey\"! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense. Following the always-popular trend of \"big-bug\" movies, \"Blue Monkey\" handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. The makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! All we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. Other than this, there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! Like I said, don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. The first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. It is also near the end that \"Blue Monkey\" begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. Approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore. \"Blue Monkey\" is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made. Fans of B-cinema may recognize John Vernon (\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\", \"Curtains\") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, who's in charge of the clinic.","finished_norm":["never","even","know","thi","movi","exist","until","i","find","a","old","vh","copi","of","it","hide","deep","in","my","dusti","horror","closet","the","titl","on","the","box","sai","insect","and","the","illustr","on","the","back","make","clear","that","it","be","just","anoth","insignific","and","poorli","produc","horror","movi","thei","can","sure","be","fun","of","cours","a","long","a","do","not","expect","a","intellig","scenario","and","a","long","a","you","re","not","irrit","by","see","a","giant","amount","of","cheesi","makeup","effect","just","about","everi","import","aspect","that","make","a","horror","movi","worthi","view","be","substandard","here","in","blue","monkei","the","plot","be","ridicul","and","highli","unorigin","the","act","perform","be","pain","to","observ","and","there","a","total","lack","of","suspens","follow","the","alwayspopular","trend","of","bigbug","movi","blue","monkei","handl","about","a","new","and","unknown","insect","speci","that","wipe","out","the","doctor","and","patient","of","a","remot","hospit","the","maker","can","not","be","much","evas","about","the","actual","origin","of","thi","gigant","overs","critter","all","we","know","be","that","it","not","from","outer","space","and","it","initi","crawl","out","of","a","tropic","plant","other","than","thi","there","absolut","no","explan","for","where","thi","new","typ","of","insect","all","of","a","sudden","come","from","like","i","sai","do","not","get","your","hope","up","for","a","intellig","screenplai","the","half","of","the","film","be","entertain","enough","with","some","nice","gore","and","the","introduct","of","a","coupl","derang","charact","a","yearold","blind","and","alcohol","ladi","but","the","half","when","the","entir","hospit","be","put","to","quarantin","be","dreadfulli","bore","it","be","conjur","near","the","end","that","blue","monkei","begin","to","exaggeratedli","ripoff","old","and","well","film","approach","the","climax","thei","appar","run","out","of","budget","a","good","sinc","the","light","becom","veri","poor","and","the","gui","in","the","monster","suit","be","not","veri","good","camouflag","anymor","blue","monkei","be","worth","a","peek","in","case","you","re","realli","bore","or","if","you","realli","want","to","see","everi","horror","movi","ever","make","fan","of","bcinema","mai","recogn","john","vernon","killer","klown","from","outer","space","curtain","in","the","small","and","meaningless","role","of","roger","who","in","charg","of","the","clinic"],"filtered":["never","even","know","thi","movi","exist","find","old","vh","copi","hide","deep","dusti","horror","closet","titl","box","sai","insect","illustr","back","make","clear","anoth","insignific","poorli","produc","horror","movi","thei","sure","fun","cours","long","expect","intellig","scenario","long","re","irrit","see","giant","amount","cheesi","makeup","effect","everi","import","aspect","make","horror","movi","worthi","view","substandard","blue","monkei","plot","ridicul","highli","unorigin","act","perform","pain","observ","total","lack","suspens","follow","alwayspopular","trend","bigbug","movi","blue","monkei","handl","new","unknown","insect","speci","wipe","doctor","patient","remot","hospit","maker","much","evas","actual","origin","thi","gigant","overs","critter","know","outer","space","initi","crawl","tropic","plant","thi","absolut","explan","thi","new","typ","insect","sudden","come","like","sai","get","hope","intellig","screenplai","half","film","entertain","enough","nice","gore","introduct","coupl","derang","charact","yearold","blind","alcohol","ladi","half","entir","hospit","put","quarantin","dreadfulli","bore","conjur","near","end","blue","monkei","begin","exaggeratedli","ripoff","old","well","film","approach","climax","thei","appar","run","budget","good","sinc","light","becom","veri","poor","gui","monster","suit","veri","good","camouflag","anymor","blue","monkei","worth","peek","case","re","realli","bore","realli","want","see","everi","horror","movi","ever","make","fan","bcinema","mai","recogn","john","vernon","killer","klown","outer","space","curtain","small","meaningless","role","roger","charg","clinic"],"filtered2":["never","even","know","exist","find","old","vh","copi","hide","deep","dusti","horror","closet","titl","box","insect","illustr","back","make","clear","anoth","insignific","poorli","produc","horror","sure","fun","cours","long","expect","intellig","scenario","long","re","irrit","see","giant","amount","cheesi","makeup","effect","everi","import","aspect","make","horror","worthi","view","substandard","blue","monkei","plot","ridicul","highli","unorigin","act","perform","pain","observ","total","lack","suspens","follow","alwayspopular","trend","bigbug","blue","monkei","handl","new","unknown","insect","speci","wipe","doctor","patient","remot","hospit","maker","evas","actual","origin","gigant","overs","critter","know","outer","space","initi","crawl","tropic","plant","absolut","explan","new","typ","insect","sudden","

{"value":"I really, really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.","finished_norm":["i","realli","realli","want","to","like","julian","po","i","think","that","slater","be","underr","a","a","actor","and","that","mani","of","the","support","player","here","be","well","than","thei","be","give","a","chanc","to","demonstr","in","thi","film","i","realiz","thi","be","base","on","a","short","stori","which","i","have","not","read","so","i","do","not","know","if","what","i","see","a","the","film","fault","origin","with","the","stori","or","be","impos","on","it","by","the","directorscreenwrit","the","premis","be","wonder","and","i","love","the","voiceov","confession","tone","the","open","narrat","strike","but","then","noth","sever","of","the","clich","local","charact","ask","julian","pointblank","to","explain","hi","intent","to","commit","suicid","on","can","argu","that","he","doe","not","answer","becaus","it","none","of","their","busi","but","julian","be","the","on","who","under","onli","token","pressur","blurt","out","hi","intent","in","public","then","neither","julian","nor","the","directorwrit","despit","the","fact","that","the","julian","charact","be","keep","a","tape","record","journal","for","god","sake","seem","inclin","to","provid","anyth","beyond","the","scant","initi","inform","on","julian","life","he","sai","he","be","a","bookkeep","he","sai","hi","famili","move","around","when","he","be","a","child","due","to","hi","father","job","so","what","there","be","sever","interact","with","the","local","which","seem","design","to","illumin","julian","purpos","but","none","of","them","go","anywher","becaus","julian","seem","to","regard","all","thi","dopei","local","a","if","thei","be","alien","from","anoth","planet","a","if","he","be","the","ultim","and","onli","sane","on","among","them","thi","mai","work","a","a","allegori","if","julian","po","have","ani","defin","characterist","or","anyth","approach","wisdom","to","impart","the","close","he","come","to","reveal","anyth","about","himself","be","in","the","scene","in","which","he","purpos","humili","the","naiv","religi","wife","of","the","mechan","and","what","thi","scene","reveal","be","not","anyth","that","would","inspir","empathi","for","julian","i","can","onli","see","the","julian","charact","a","rendereda","selfish","petti","and","total","condescend","sort","of","match","the","attitud","of","the","director","of","thi","halfbak","contriv","film","and","poor","michael","park","a","actor","who","onc","have","so","much","promis","be","give","noth","to","work","with","here"],"filtered":["realli","realli","want","like","julian","po","think","slater","underr","actor","mani","support","player","well","thei","give","chanc","demonstr","thi","film","realiz","thi","base","short","stori","read","know","see","film","fault","origin","stori","impos","directorscreenwrit","premis","wonder","love","voiceov","confession","tone","open","narrat","strike","noth","sever","clich","local","charact","ask","julian","pointblank","explain","hi","intent","commit","suicid","argu","doe","answer","becaus","none","busi","julian","onli","token","pressur","blurt","hi","intent","public","neither","julian","directorwrit","despit","fact","julian","charact","keep","tape","record","journal","god","sake","seem","inclin","provid","anyth","beyond","scant","initi","inform","julian","life","sai","bookkeep","sai","hi","famili","move","around","child","due","hi","father","job","sever","interact","local","seem","design","illumin","julian","purpos","none","go","anywher","becaus","julian","seem","regard","thi","dopei","local","thei","alien","anoth","planet","ultim","onli","sane","among","thi","mai","work","allegori","julian","po","ani","defin","characterist","anyth","approach","wisdom","impart","close","come","reveal","anyth","scene","purpos","humili","naiv","religi","wife","mechan","thi","scene","reveal","anyth","inspir","empathi","julian","onli","see","julian","charact","rendereda","selfish","petti","total","condescend","sort","match","attitud","director","thi","halfbak","contriv","film","poor","michael","park","actor","onc","much","promis","give","noth","work"],"filtered2":["realli","realli","want","like","julian","po","think","slater","underr","actor","mani","support","player","well","give","chanc","demonstr","realiz","base","short","stori","read","know","see","fault","origin","stori","impos","directorscreenwrit","premis","wonder","love","voiceov","confession","tone","open","narrat","strike","noth","sever","clich","local","charact","ask","julian","pointblank","explain","intent","commit","suicid","argu","doe","answer","becaus","none","busi","julian","onli","token","pressur","blurt","intent","public","neither","julian","directorwrit","despit","fact","julian","charact","keep","tape","record","journal","god","sake","seem","inclin","provid","anyth","beyond","scant","initi","inform","julian","life","bookkeep","famili","move","around","child","due","father","job","sever","interact","local","seem","design","illumin","julian","purpos","none","go","anywher","becaus","julian",

{"value":"Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, many may assume that I'm some 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered \"classic\" horror. This is not the case, as I'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life. But admittedly, I'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal, etc...types of horror films - so I do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film...I just don't...<br /><br />THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls. The heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower (in their nightgowns no less (?!?)...), and meanwhile, girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus...<br /><br />I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake. I'm all for \"tension\" and \"suspense\" in horror films - but this film held neither for me. Luckily, I wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one, so I can't say I was really disappointed - THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's. This isn't a hard and fast rule, but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception. Probably a \"must-see\" for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as I don't really know too many fans of that sort of material, I can't really recommend this one...4/10","finished_norm":["read","my","review","of","the","hous","that","scream","mani","mai","assum","that","i","be","some","year","old","who","think","scream","be","consid","classic","horror","thi","be","not","the","case","a","i","be","year","old","and","have","be","watch","horror","film","for","much","of","my","life","but","admittedli","i","be","a","child","of","the","that","grow","up","on","slasherzombieghostcannib","etctyp","of","horror","film","so","i","do","typic","prefer","horror","film","that","be","much","graphic","and","fasterpac","just","like","someon","who","can","appreci","differ","music","paint","or","in","thi","case","film","but","not","necessarili","like","them","i","can","appreci","why","some","peopl","mai","enjoi","thi","sort","of","filmi","just","dontbr","br","the","hous","that","scream","be","a","exceedingli","dull","and","tediou","film","about","a","school","for","wayward","girl","the","heavyhand","mistress","of","the","school","rule","with","a","iron","hand","or","whip","in","some","case","to","keep","the","girl","in","line","she","have","a","young","son","who","creep","around","and","peep","on","the","girl","while","thei","shower","in","their","nightgown","no","littl","and","meanwhil","girl","be","disappear","from","the","school","a","thei","be","the","victim","of","a","murder","who","lurk","about","the","campusbr","br","i","can","see","why","the","hous","that","scream","be","often","compar","to","suspiria","which","be","a","masterpiec","of","a","film","in","my","opinion","in","term","of","the","atmospher","of","the","school","itself","and","the","interact","between","the","girl","and","their","guardian","but","thi","film","be","so","dull","and","unev","that","i","can","bare","stai","awak","i","be","all","for","tension","and","suspens","in","horror","film","but","thi","film","hold","neither","for","me","luckili","i","be","not","expect","a","whole","lot","go","into","thi","on","so","i","ca","not","sai","i","be","realli","disappoint","the","hous","that","scream","just","reinforc","the","fact","that","i","person","do","not","typic","enjoi","much","horror","film","much","old","than","from","the","thi","be","not","a","hard","and","fast","rule","but","that","that","i","have","enjoi","definit","seem","to","be","much","of","the","except","probabl","a","mustse","for","horror","fan","who","enjoi","much","underst","and","suggest","horror","film","but","a","i","do","not","realli","know","too","mani","fan","of","that","sort","of","materi","i","ca","not","realli","recommend","thi","on"],"filtered":["read","review","hous","scream","mani","mai","assum","year","old","think","scream","consid","classic","horror","thi","case","year","old","watch","horror","film","much","life","admittedli","child","grow","slasherzombieghostcannib","etctyp","horror","film","typic","prefer","horror","film","much","graphic","fasterpac","like","someon","appreci","differ","music","paint","thi","case","film","necessarili","like","appreci","peopl","mai","enjoi","thi","sort","filmi","dontbr","br","hous","scream","exceedingli","dull","tediou","film","school","wayward","girl","heavyhand","mistress","school","rule","iron","hand","whip","case","keep","girl","line","young","son","creep","around","peep","girl","thei","shower","nightgown","littl","meanwhil","girl","disappear","school","thei","victim","murder","lurk","campusbr","br","see","hous","scream","often","compar","suspiria","masterpiec","film","opinion","term","atmospher","school","interact","girl","guardian","thi","film","dull","unev","bare","stai","awak","tension","suspens","horror","film","thi","film","hold","neither","luckili","expect","whole","lot","go","thi","ca","sai","realli","disappoint","hous","scream","reinforc","fact","person","typic","enjoi","much","horror","film","much","old","thi","hard","fast","rule","enjoi","definit","seem","much","except","probabl","mustse","horror","fan","enjoi","much","underst","suggest","horror","film","realli","know","mani","fan","sort","materi","ca","realli","recommend","thi"],"filtered2":["read","review","hous","scream","mani","mai","assum","year","old","think","scream","consid","classic","horror","case","year","old","watch","horror","life","admittedli","child","grow","slasherzombieghostcannib","etctyp","horror","typic","prefer","horror","graphic","fasterpac","like","someon","appreci","differ","music","paint","case","necessarili","like","appreci","peopl","mai","enjoi","sort","filmi","dontbr","hous","scream","exceedingli","dull","tediou","school","wayward","girl","heavyhand","mistress","school","rule","iron","hand","whip","case","keep","girl","line","young","son","creep","around","peep","girl","shower","nightgown","littl","meanwhil","girl","disappear","school","victim","murder","lurk","campusbr","see","hous","scream","often","compar","suspiria","masterpiec","opinion","term","atmospher","school","interact","girl","guardian","dull","unev","bare","stai","awak","tension","suspens","horror","hold","neither","luckili","expect","whole","lot","

{"value":"Luckily I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I cannot even reveal any spoilers because I willingly WALKED OUT after forty minutes of the movie. It was that bad. I laughed once, when the Yahoo! billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song came on. However, that was only because I thought it was making fun of it, but then I realized it was yet ANOTHER product placement. <br /><br />I loved the cartoon. I used to watch it almost religiously. (although i missed the last episode. I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw, somebody comment on the show's page) The cartoon had Penny and Brain alot more than the movie had, as to that point. I hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was. Another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point I saw, except for the oil slick. He also screwed with the tone of \"Wowsers\" which used to be in an excited tone. I felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly. Everybody else felt that way too. Us 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon. I was taken aback at how retarded the movie was. It relied on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along. Product placement is pointless in this film, and it shows. The wise-cracking car is not that good at cracking wise. The gadgets look nice, but they were almost overly glossy. The cartoon was a better look. The silly scenes were crap. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right preview. This movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I highly recommend \"The Iron Giant,\" which was sad, but very very good. This movie is a travesty to the whole family drama.------------1","finished_norm":["luckili","i","do","not","pai","to","see","thi","movi","conjur","i","cannot","even","reveal","ani","spoiler","becaus","i","willingli","walk","out","after","forti","minut","of","the","movi","it","be","that","bad","i","laugh","onc","when","the","yahoo","billboard","fall","on","the","gui","and","the","theme","song","come","on","howev","that","be","onli","becaus","i","think","it","be","make","fun","of","it","but","then","i","realiz","it","be","yet","anoth","product","placem","br","br","i","love","the","cartoon","i","us","to","watch","it","almost","religi","although","i","miss","the","last","episod","i","hear","that","thei","show","dr","claw","and","it","be","noth","much","than","a","claw","somebodi","comment","on","the","show","page","the","cartoon","have","penni","and","brain","alot","much","than","the","movi","have","a","to","that","point","i","hate","the","setup","of","the","whole","thing","reminisc","of","robocop","then","broderick","screw","with","the","whole","feel","of","inspector","gadget","he","be","not","nearli","a","clumsi","a","the","cartoon","be","anoth","fact","be","hi","gadget","actual","work","to","the","point","i","see","except","for","the","oil","slick","he","conjur","screw","with","the","tone","of","wowser","which","us","to","be","in","a","excit","tone","i","feel","so","disappoint","that","thei","slaughter","the","cartoon","so","badli","everybodi","els","feel","that","wai","too","u","year","old","rememb","the","cartoon","fondli","and","we","love","everi","minut","of","itbr","br","i","go","into","the","movi","with","a","open","mind","know","that","thei","would","have","screw","with","the","cartoon","i","be","take","aback","at","how","retard","the","movi","be","it","reli","on","sight","gag","and","stupid","dialogu","for","humor","disnei","reli","on","pain","and","physic","humor","to","push","a","kid","movi","along","product","placem","be","pointless","in","thi","film","and","it","show","the","wisecrack","car","be","not","that","good","at","crack","wise","the","gadget","look","nice","but","thei","be","almost","overli","glossi","the","cartoon","be","a","well","look","the","silli","scene","be","crap","in","the","minut","i","watch","the","movi","not","on","laugh","be","hear","and","thei","laugh","at","the","dudleydoright","preview","thi","movi","should","not","be","watch","by","peopl","who","want","intellig","in","their","famili","entertain","i","highli","recommend","the","iron","giant","which","be","sad","but","veri","veri","good","thi","movi","be","a","travesti","to","the","whole","famili","drama"],"filtered":["luckili","pai","see","thi","movi","conjur","even","reveal","ani","spoiler","becaus","willingli","walk","forti","minut","movi","bad","laugh","onc","yahoo","billboard","fall","gui","theme","song","come","howev","onli","becaus","think","make","fun","realiz","yet","anoth","product","placem","br","br","love","cartoon","us","watch","almost","religi","although","miss","last","episod","hear","thei","show","dr","claw","noth","much","claw","somebodi","comment","show","page","cartoon","penni","brain","alot","much","movi","point","hate","setup","whole","thing","reminisc","robocop","broderick","screw","whole","feel","inspector","gadget","nearli","clumsi","cartoon","anoth","fact","hi","gadget","actual","work","point","see","except","oil","slick","conjur","screw","tone","wowser","us","excit","tone","feel","disappoint","thei","slaughter","cartoon","badli","everybodi","els","feel","wai","u","year","old","rememb","cartoon","fondli","love","everi","minut","itbr","br","go","movi","open","mind","know","thei","screw","cartoon","take","aback","retard","movi","reli","sight","gag","stupid","dialogu","humor","disnei","reli","pain","physic","humor","push","kid","movi","along","product","placem","pointless","thi","film","show","wisecrack","car","good","crack","wise","gadget","look","nice","thei","almost","overli","glossi","cartoon","well","look","silli","scene","crap","minut","watch","movi","laugh","hear","thei","laugh","dudleydoright","preview","thi","movi","watch","peopl","want","intellig","famili","entertain","highli","recommend","iron","giant","sad","veri","veri","good","thi","movi","travesti","whole","famili","drama"],"filtered2":["luckili","pai","see","conjur","even","reveal","ani","spoiler","becaus","willingli","walk","forti","minut","bad","laugh","onc","yahoo","billboard","fall","gui","theme","song","come","howev","onli","becaus","think","make","fun","realiz","yet","anoth","product","placem","love","cartoon","us","watch","almost","religi","although","miss","last","hear","show","dr","claw","noth","claw","somebodi","comment","show","page","cartoon","penni","brain","alot","point","hate","setup","whole","thing","reminisc","robocop","broderick","screw","whole","feel","inspector","gadget","nearli","clumsi","cartoon","anoth","fact","gadget","actual","work","point","see","except","oil","slick","conjur","screw","tone","wowser","us","excit","tone","feel","disappoint","slaughter","c

{"value":"The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About halfway through, F.Murray gets zapped, because The Darkling is some kind of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously. He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success. He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins. However, part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil. Otherwise he cannot \"pervert\" their natural goodness. That's what the little guy said in his Barry White voice, which I found both charming and amusing. Mostly amusing. Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen \"Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Here eet come, Dee Plane!\" All through the movie, Dee Dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice, saying things like \"It's OK to be bad, you know you want it.\" \"Now you've committed murder, you're really moving up in the world\" and other remarks that sound like commercials for \"Being Evil\" Stores or something. It really is hilarious in a sick way.<br /><br />Anyhow, Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham, and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe (or knifed?). F. Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film. He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face, and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp. class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical. If this movie were a parody, the ending was perfect. If it was not a parody, then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending. It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie

{"value":"The minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people baying for your ignorant, half-ass-ed, artistically retarded blood. I won't try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10. All I ask is that someone explain to me the point, purpose and message of this film.<br /><br />Here is how I would summarize the film: Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence. This followed by (in a nutshell, to save you 3 hours of pain) the following - A children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter, who he may or may not have raped when she was a child, and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues, while the game-show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy, a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s, who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while the game show's producer, himself dying of lung cancer, asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago, and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru, even as Mr. Producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man; and oh, eventually, it rains frogs (You read correctly). And I am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless, literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than, possibly, to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic'. <br /><br />You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie (and in turn of not confusing you) if I had written the damn thing a little more coherently, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one... Well, now you know how I feel.","finished_norm":["the","minut","you","give","a","art","film","you","have","peopl","bai","for","your","ignor","halfass","artist","retard","blood","i","wo","not","try","and","justifi","how","i","be","not","a","aesthet","challeng","retard","by","list","out","all","the","art","hous","cinema","i","have","like","or","mention","how","i","give","some","unknown","cult","classic","a","all","i","ask","be","that","someon","explain","to","me","the","point","purpos","and","messag","of","thi","filmbr","br","here","be","how","i","would","summar","the","film","open","montag","of","three","unrel","urban","legend","depict","almost","absurd","level","of","coincid","thi","follow","by","in","a","nutshel","to","save","you","hour","of","pain","the","follow","a","child","game","show","host","dye","of","lung","cancer","try","to","patch","thing","up","with","hi","cokeaddict","daughter","who","he","mai","or","mai","not","have","rape","when","she","be","a","child","and","who","be","be","court","by","a","bumbl","polic","offic","with","relationship","issu","while","the","gameshow","star","contest","decid","that","he","doe","not","want","to","be","a","fail","child","prodigi","a","fate","which","have","befal","anoth","on","of","the","game","show","contest","from","the","who","we","see","be","now","a","jobless","homosexu","in","love","with","a","bartend","with","brace","and","in","ne","of","monei","for","correct","oral","surgeri","while","the","game","show","produc","himself","dye","of","lung","cancer","ask","hi","male","nurs","to","help","him","patch","up","with","the","son","he","abandon","year","ago","and","who","have","subsequ","becom","a","woman","self","help","guru","even","a","mr","produc","wife","suffer","from","guilt","pang","over","have","cheat","a","dye","man","and","oh","eventu","it","rain","frog","you","read","correctli","and","i","be","spare","you","the","unbeliev","long","and","pointless","liter","rambl","monologu","each","charact","seem","to","come","up","with","on","the","fly","for","no","rhym","or","reason","other","than","possibli","to","make","sure","the","film","cross","hour","and","becom","classifi","a","a","modern","epic","br","br","you","be","probabl","think","that","i","can","have","do","a","well","job","of","summar","the","movi","and","in","turn","of","not","confus","you","if","i","have","write","the","damn","thing","a","littl","much","coher","mayb","in","a","few","sentenc","instead","of","just","on","good","now","you","know","how","i","feel"],"filtered":["minut","give","art","film","peopl","bai","ignor","halfass","artist","retard","blood","wo","try","justifi","aesthet","challeng","retard","list","art","hous","cinema","like","mention","give","unknown","cult","classic","ask","someon","explain","point","purpos","messag","thi","filmbr","br","summar","film","open","montag","three","unrel","urban","legend","depict","almost","absurd","level","coincid","thi","follow","nutshel","save","hour","pain","follow","child","game","show","host","dye","lung","cancer","try","patch","thing","hi","cokeaddict","daughter","mai","mai","rape","child","court","bumbl","polic","offic","relationship","issu","gameshow","star","contest","decid","doe","want","fail","child","prodigi","fate","befal","anoth","game","show","contest","see","jobless","homosexu","love","bartend","brace","ne","monei","correct","oral","surgeri","game","show","produc","dye","lung","cancer","ask","hi","male","nurs","help","patch","son","abandon","year","ago","subsequ","becom","woman","self","help","guru","even","mr","produc","wife","suffer","guilt","pang","cheat","dye","man","oh","eventu","rain","frog","read","correctli","spare","unbeliev","long","pointless","liter","rambl","monologu","charact","seem","come","fly","rhym","reason","possibli","make","sure","film","cross","hour","becom","classifi","modern","epic","br","br","probabl","think","well","job","summar","movi","turn","confus","write","damn","thing","littl","much","coher","mayb","sentenc","instead","good","know","feel"],"filtered2":["minut","give","art","peopl","bai","ignor","halfass","artist","retard","blood","wo","try","justifi","aesthet","challeng","retard","list","art","hous","cinema","like","mention","give","unknown","cult","classic","ask","someon","explain","point","purpos","messag","filmbr","summar","open","montag","three","unrel","urban","legend","depict","almost","absurd","level","coincid","follow","nutshel","save","hour","pain","follow","child","game","show","host","dye","lung","cancer","try","patch","thing","cokeaddict","daughter","mai","mai","rape","child","court","bumbl","polic","offic","relationship","issu","gameshow","star","contest","decid","doe","want","fail","child","prodigi","fate","befal","anoth","game","show","contest","see","jobless","homosexu","love","bartend","brace","ne","monei","correct","oral","surgeri","game","show","produc","dye","lung","cancer","ask","male","nurs","help","patch","son","abandon","year","ago","subsequ","becom","woman","self","help","guru","even","mr","produc","wife","

{"value":"No, this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy godmother and the glass slippers, but if I were to elaborate, I would have to spoil it for you, which I won't. But don't let curiosity get the better of you, as this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that start off promisingly, before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactics and an incoherent storyline. And that's real horror.<br /><br />Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One's a successful plastic surgeon, while the other your dutiful, obedient, and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like hand in glove, so close you'd think of them more as siblings rather than parent-child. But things start to go wrong (don't they always) when Hyun-soo's friends, whom Yoon-hee has operated on, start to go berserk.<br /><br />Perhaps it's a warning to audiences, and for those Koreans ladies who don't bat an eyelid when going under the knife, if news reports are to be believed. The only truly scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, though somehow, I thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually had more gore when featuring and describing what goes on during the surgery itself.<br /><br />It's a tale of two halves, the fist being an attempt to shock audiences with standard scare tactics, which, I admit, did get to me now and then. However, the second half degenerated the movie into mindless mumbo-jumbo melodramatics, and was quite contrived into its forcing its ideas down your throat. Some things begin not to make sense, and while attempts are always presented to explain, you probably won't buy it, not that horror movies are logical to begin with.<br /><br />The leads are all beautiful, and there is a distinct lack of male presence besides the negligible cop role. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the storyline could have been improved tremendously. I'd recommend you to watch this, only if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror, on VCD. Watch out for those face off-ish moments!","finished_norm":["no","thi","be","noth","about","that","fairi","tale","with","the","pumpkin","coach","fairi","godmoth","and","the","glass","slipper","but","if","i","be","to","elabor","i","would","have","to","spoil","it","for","you","which","i","wo","not","but","do","not","let","curios","get","the","well","of","you","a","thi","movi","be","not","fantast","it","on","of","that","movi","that","start","off","promisingli","befor","betrai","it","audienc","with","cheap","scare","tactic","and","a","incoher","storylin","and","that","real","horrorbr","br","yoonhe","to","jiwon","and","hyunsoo","shin","sekyeong","be","your","ideal","mother","and","daughter","on","a","success","plastic","surgeon","while","the","other","your","duti","obedi","and","beauti","teenag","daughter","their","relationship","be","like","hand","in","glove","so","close","you","have","think","of","them","much","a","sibl","rather","than","parentchild","but","thing","start","to","go","wrong","do","not","thei","alwai","when","hyunsoo","friend","whom","yoonhe","have","oper","on","start","to","go","berserkbr","br","perhap","it","a","warn","to","audienc","and","for","that","korean","ladi","who","do","not","bat","a","eyelid","when","go","under","the","knife","if","new","report","be","to","be","believ","the","onli","truli","scari","moment","be","that","scene","in","plastic","surgeri","though","somehow","i","think","kim","kiduk","time","actual","have","much","gore","when","featur","and","describ","what","go","on","dure","the","surgeri","itselfbr","br","it","a","tale","of","two","halv","the","fist","be","a","attempt","to","shock","audienc","with","standard","scare","tactic","which","i","admit","do","get","to","me","now","and","then","howev","the","half","degener","the","movi","into","mindless","mumbojumbo","melodramat","and","be","quit","contriv","into","it","forc","it","idea","down","your","throat","some","thing","begin","not","to","make","sens","and","while","attempt","be","alwai","present","to","explain","you","probabl","wo","not","bui","it","not","that","horror","movi","be","logic","to","begin","withbr","br","the","lead","be","all","beauti","and","there","be","a","distinct","lack","of","male","presenc","besid","the","neglig","cop","role","but","hei","i","be","not","complain","though","the","storylin","can","have","be","improv","tremend","i","have","recommend","you","to","watch","thi","onli","if","you","re","a","fan","of","mediocr","korean","horror","on","vcd","watch","out","for","that","face","offish","moment"],"filtered":["thi","noth","fairi","tale","pumpkin","coach","fairi","godmoth","glass","slipper","elabor","spoil","wo","let","curios","get","well","thi","movi","fantast","movi","start","promisingli","befor","betrai","audienc","cheap","scare","tactic","incoher","storylin","real","horrorbr","br","yoonhe","jiwon","hyunsoo","shin","sekyeong","ideal","mother","daughter","success","plastic","surgeon","duti","obedi","beauti","teenag","daughter","relationship","like","hand","glove","close","think","much","sibl","rather","parentchild","thing","start","go","wrong","thei","alwai","hyunsoo","friend","yoonhe","oper","start","go","berserkbr","br","perhap","warn","audienc","korean","ladi","bat","eyelid","go","knife","new","report","believ","onli","truli","scari","moment","scene","plastic","surgeri","though","somehow","think","kim","kiduk","time","actual","much","gore","featur","describ","go","dure","surgeri","itselfbr","br","tale","two","halv","fist","attempt","shock","audienc","standard","scare","tactic","admit","get","howev","half","degener","movi","mindless","mumbojumbo","melodramat","quit","contriv","forc","idea","throat","thing","begin","make","sens","attempt","alwai","present","explain","probabl","wo","bui","horror","movi","logic","begin","withbr","br","lead","beauti","distinct","lack","male","presenc","besid","neglig","cop","role","hei","complain","though","storylin","improv","tremend","recommend","watch","thi","onli","re","fan","mediocr","korean","horror","vcd","watch","face","offish","moment"],"filtered2":["noth","fairi","tale","pumpkin","coach","fairi","godmoth","glass","slipper","elabor","spoil","wo","let","curios","get","well","fantast","start","promisingli","befor","betrai","audienc","cheap","scare","tactic","incoher","storylin","real","horrorbr","yoonhe","jiwon","hyunsoo","shin","sekyeong","ideal","mother","daughter","success","plastic","surgeon","duti","obedi","beauti","teenag","daughter","relationship","like","hand","glove","close","think","sibl","rather","parentchild","thing","start","go","wrong","alwai","hyunsoo","friend","yoonhe","oper","start","go","berserkbr","perhap","warn","audienc","korean","ladi","bat","eyelid","go","knife","new","report","believ","onli","truli","scari","moment","scene","plastic","surgeri","though","somehow","think","kim","kiduk","time","actual","gore","featur","describ","go","dure","surgeri","itselfbr","tale","two","halv","fist","attempt","shock","audienc","standard","scare","tactic","admit","get","howev","half","deg

{"value":"This movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society. Therefore, can thieves, rapists and murderers (the Killer of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods), is all three and worse) be held fully accountable for their deeds? An interesting notion, but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And this is where Killer: A Journal of Murder falls very short. Although the film tries to put Panzram's behaviour into perspective, with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit. Sure, the system is corrupt, with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of Leavenworth Prison (where most of the movie takes place), most prison guards are sadistic bullies, and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot. But why on earth does new prison guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) take such pity on Panzram? Even after having read his gruesome diaries? The movie offers some explanation: Lesser witnesses Panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guard, and is impressed by Panzram's intelligence (though it isn't clear why exactly Lesser thinks this man is so smart). Surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram, even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality? Towards Lesser, Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer is given the impression that for Lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in Panzram's diaries. Does this man Lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him?

{"value":"For the first time in years, I've felt the need to log into IMDb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review, because it was just such a let-down to watch. The plot sounded awesome when I read it, I expected a minimal mystery thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane, tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth-gnashingly stupid \"no-one-says-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movies\"-dialogs that it's just agonizing.<br /><br />Here's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film: <br /><br />- The script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughable. No, actually, it's angering. And lazy.<br /><br />- Related to that: Cheap thrills. A long parade \"just in time\" moments.<br /><br />- The main characters. Alright, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life, but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies. Thus, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation clichés. They are mere plot-devices, place-holders without the slightest bit of personality. They are \"man and woman in break-up who still love each other\". Never seen that one before except in 100,000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable. Think of the blandest two-dimensional Hollywood fare and you've got it. There is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh, charming, or interesting.<br /><br />- The far-fetched, vague resolution that's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple, though the word \"resolution\" might be ill-fitting here, because the movie is a swampy mess that isn't going anywhere anyway. By the time you're through, though, you don't care anymore. The last third of the movie I just fast-forwarded, because it was just so unbearable to watch.<br /><br />Okay, that's it.

{"value":"Here's one you can watch with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell wouldn't be in it.<br /><br />There are two laughs in HOT ROD.<br /><br />1. The Punch-Dance. Rod \"needs to go to his quiet place\" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of Europe.<br /><br />2. John Farnham's You're The Voice. In one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist? A major Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who shot to fame in the early '70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy, it leveled mountains in Switzerland.<br /><br />Besides these two high points in the film - both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit.<br /><br />Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, someone actually thought that was funny.<br /><br />Without one jump under his starry belt, he plans for a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever... who watches these movies for plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), he scores a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher), who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance - then changed her mind and just hung up. Ian McShane must've lost a bet to be here.","finished_norm":["here","on","you","can","watch","with","a","straight","face","with","a","script","so","bad","even","will","ferrel","would","not","be","in","itbr","br","there","be","two","laugh","in","hot","rodbr","br","the","punchdanc","rod","ne","to","go","to","hi","quiet","place","and","befor","anyon","can","sai","kevin","bacon","he","be","footloos","a","passion","overwrought","bodyswerv","to","the","strain","of","a","band","who","wish","thei","have","the","bighair","fauxmet","chop","of","europebr","br","john","farnham","you","re","the","voic","in","on","of","that","epic","sequenc","where","the","star","and","hi","cohort","do","the","slomo","walk","down","main","street","and","the","townfolk","follow","on","their","heel","in","support","the","soundtrack","be","the","gag","how","do","the","filmmak","even","come","across","thi","aussi","record","artist","a","major","australian","vocalist","and","a","genuin","talent","who","shoot","to","fame","in","the","earli","cover","raindrop","keep","fallin","on","my","head","then","disappear","until","for","the","big","comeback","with","you","re","the","voic","john","farnham","anthem","be","so","bewitchingli","cheesi","it","level","mountain","in","switzerlandbr","br","besid","thi","two","high","point","in","the","film","both","ruin","anywai","with","the","slipshod","write","the","rest","of","the","film","be","like","choke","on","someon","els","vomitbr","br","andi","samberg","be","rod","a","fail","stunt","jumper","who","have","never","make","a","jump","mayb","it","get","someth","to","do","with","the","fact","he","drive","a","mope","into","the","heart","of","dark","or","hi","fake","mustach","yeh","someon","actual","think","that","be","funnybr","br","without","on","jump","under","hi","starri","belt","he","plan","for","a","bu","extravaganza","which","would","sure","kill","a","lesser","bad","comedian","like","jason","bigg","or","rob","schneider","to","win","the","dai","and","save","hi","stepfath","and","simultan","wipe","out","cancer","and","whatev","who","watch","thi","movi","for","plot","anywai","along","the","wai","a","usual","for","moron","lead","in","thi","comedi","he","score","a","salubri","chick","isla","fisher","who","must","sure","be","retard","to","consid","swap","chromosom","with","thi","loserbr","br","sissi","spacek","carri","have","so","littl","to","do","she","almost","phone","in","her","perform","then","chang","her","mind","and","just","hang","up","ian","mcshane","must","have","lose","a","bet","to","be","here"],"filtered":["watch","straight","face","script","bad","even","ferrel","itbr","br","two","laugh","hot","rodbr","br","punchdanc","rod","ne","go","hi","quiet","place","befor","anyon","sai","kevin","bacon","footloos","passion","overwrought","bodyswerv","strain","band","wish","thei","bighair","fauxmet","chop","europebr","br","john","farnham","re","voic","epic","sequenc","star","hi","cohort","slomo","walk","main","street","townfolk","follow","heel","support","soundtrack","gag","filmmak","even","come","across","thi","aussi","record","artist","major","australian","vocalist","genuin","talent","shoot","fame","earli","cover","raindrop","keep","fallin","head","disappear","big","comeback","re","voic","john","farnham","anthem","bewitchingli","cheesi","level","mountain","switzerlandbr","br","besid","thi","two","high","point","film","ruin","anywai","slipshod","write","rest","film","like","choke","someon","els","vomitbr","br","andi","samberg","rod","fail","stunt","jumper","never","make","jump","mayb","get","someth","fact","drive","mope","heart","dark","hi","fake","mustach","yeh","someon","actual","think","funnybr","br","without","jump","hi","starri","belt","plan","bu","extravaganza","sure","kill","lesser","bad","comedian","like","jason","bigg","rob","schneider","win","dai","save","hi","stepfath","simultan","wipe","cancer","whatev","watch","thi","movi","plot","anywai","along","wai","usual","moron","lead","thi","comedi","score","salubri","chick","isla","fisher","must","sure","retard","consid","swap","chromosom","thi","loserbr","br","sissi","spacek","carri","littl","almost","phone","perform","chang","mind","hang","ian","mcshane","must","lose","bet"],"filtered2":["watch","straight","face","script","bad","even","ferrel","itbr","two","laugh","hot","rodbr","punchdanc","rod","ne","go","quiet","place","befor","anyon","kevin","bacon","footloos","passion","overwrought","bodyswerv","strain","band","wish","bighair","fauxmet","chop","europebr","john","farnham","re","voic","epic","sequenc","star","cohort","slomo","walk","main","street","townfolk","follow","heel","support","soundtrack","gag","filmmak","even","come","across","aussi","record","artist","major","australian","vocalist","genuin","talent","shoot","fame","earli","cover","raindrop","keep","fallin","head","disappear","big","comeback","re","voic","john","farnham","anthem","bewitchingli","cheesi","level","mountain","switzerlandbr","besid","two","high","point","ruin","anywai","slipshod","write","rest","like","choke","someon",

{"value":"I saw this film at the London Premiere, and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining.<br /><br />The original \"Basic Instinct\" was no great film and is still something of a \"smut classic\" but it was entertaining. I can recall countless times flipping through channels on TV on a late Friday or Saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it.<br /><br />However, this lame-brain, waaay-belated sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous? Well, let's put it this way -- for a 47-year-old, she's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing. She doesn't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original -- which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress, and whatnot.<br /><br />The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible -- and Michael Caton-Jones (a typically safe director -- one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies) has officially delivered his first true turkey; a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious.<br /><br />I hear the film went through multiple editing sessions, and it's very clear from the start. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending -- oh my! Talk about stupid AND unbelievable. (Still predictable, though.) I saw \"Gigli,\" I saw \"Son of the Mask\" -- and although I'm not looking to \"smear\" this film, I can say with my own authority (which you don't have to agree with at all, mind you) that I prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure.<br /><br />By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub.<br /><br />\"Basic Instinct 2\" -- basically, it stinks, too.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","at","the","london","premier","and","i","have","to","sai","i","do","not","expect","much","but","i","do","expect","someth","that","be","at","littl","mildli","entertainingbr","br","the","origin","basic","instinct","be","no","great","film","and","be","still","someth","of","a","smut","classic","but","it","be","entertain","i","can","recal","countless","time","flip","through","channel","on","tv","on","a","late","fridai","or","saturdai","night","have","come","across","the","movi","and","find","myself","begin","to","actual","pai","attent","to","itbr","br","howev","thi","lamebrain","waaaybel","sequel","have","noth","be","sharon","stone","still","gorgeou","good","let","put","it","thi","wai","for","a","yearold","she","pretti","hot","be","she","a","beauti","a","she","be","in","the","origin","no","she","conjur","have","clearli","have","plastic","surgeri","on","her","face","and","her","haircut","in","thi","movi","be","somewhat","unapp","she","doe","not","look","a","soft","or","genuin","or","innoc","a","she","do","in","the","origin","which","be","sort","of","the","whole","point","of","be","a","evil","seductress","and","whatnotbr","br","the","rest","of","the","perform","rang","from","bad","to","terribl","and","michael","catonjon","a","typic","safe","director","on","who","doe","not","alwai","do","great","work","but","manag","to","make","worthwhil","movi","have","offici","deliv","hi","true","turkei","a","movi","so","bad","peopl","be","laugh","at","certain","moment","that","be","intend","to","be","seriousbr","br","i","hear","the","film","go","through","multipl","edit","session","and","it","veri","clear","from","the","start","noth","make","much","sens","the","whole","plot","be","a","cosmic","mess","and","the","end","oh","my","talk","about","stupid","and","unbeliev","still","predict","though","i","see","gigli","i","see","son","of","the","mask","and","although","i","be","not","look","to","smear","thi","film","i","can","sai","with","my","own","author","which","you","do","not","have","to","agre","with","at","all","mind","you","that","i","prefer","both","that","film","over","thi","catastroph","failurebr","br","by","the","wai","stone","leav","five","minut","befor","the","movi","begin","and","peopl","in","the","theater","begin","throw","thing","at","the","screen","dure","a","particularli","outrag","and","insult","scene","insid","a","orgytyp","nightclubbr","br","basic","instinct","basic","it","stink","too"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","london","premier","sai","expect","much","expect","someth","littl","mildli","entertainingbr","br","origin","basic","instinct","great","film","still","someth","smut","classic","entertain","recal","countless","time","flip","channel","tv","late","fridai","saturdai","night","come","across","movi","find","begin","actual","pai","attent","itbr","br","howev","thi","lamebrain","waaaybel","sequel","noth","sharon","stone","still","gorgeou","good","let","put","thi","wai","yearold","pretti","hot","beauti","origin","conjur","clearli","plastic","surgeri","face","haircut","thi","movi","somewhat","unapp","doe","look","soft","genuin","innoc","origin","sort","whole","point","evil","seductress","whatnotbr","br","rest","perform","rang","bad","terribl","michael","catonjon","typic","safe","director","doe","alwai","great","work","manag","make","worthwhil","movi","offici","deliv","hi","true","turkei","movi","bad","peopl","laugh","certain","moment","intend","seriousbr","br","hear","film","go","multipl","edit","session","veri","clear","start","noth","make","much","sens","whole","plot","cosmic","mess","end","oh","talk","stupid","unbeliev","still","predict","though","see","gigli","see","son","mask","although","look","smear","thi","film","sai","author","agre","mind","prefer","film","thi","catastroph","failurebr","br","wai","stone","leav","five","minut","befor","movi","begin","peopl","theater","begin","throw","thing","screen","dure","particularli","outrag","insult","scene","insid","orgytyp","nightclubbr","br","basic","instinct","basic","stink"],"filtered2":["see","london","premier","expect","expect","someth","littl","mildli","entertainingbr","origin","basic","instinct","great","still","someth","smut","classic","entertain","recal","countless","time","flip","channel","tv","late","fridai","saturdai","night","come","across","find","begin","actual","pai","attent","itbr","howev","lamebrain","waaaybel","sequel","noth","sharon","stone","still","gorgeou","good","let","put","wai","yearold","pretti","hot","beauti","origin","conjur","clearli","plastic","surgeri","face","haircut","somewhat","unapp","doe","look","soft","genuin","innoc","origin","sort","whole","point","evil","seductress","whatnotbr","rest","perform","rang","bad","terribl","michael","catonjon","typic","safe","director","doe","alwai","great","work","manag","make","worthwhil","offici","deliv","true","turkei","bad","peopl","laugh","certain","moment","intend","seriousbr","hear","go","multipl","edit","session","veri","clear","start","noth",

{"value":"A stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite an initially hostile response, he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor. And, as the doctor shows him about, he talks and talks and talks!!! And as he talks, loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive. While there is SOME action here and there (and some of it quite disturbing), it's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is--lacking life and energy, which is odd for a horror flick. Even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome. The further this tour takes the guest, the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers. Yet again, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many places--particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set. Only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell, starving, does the film have any real impact. Considering this plot, it sure is hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have! Now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and direction, this COULD have been an interesting and worthwhile film.<br /><br />You know, now that I think about it, this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original \"Star Trek\" TV show! You know, the one with \"Lord Garth--Master of the Universe\" and Kirk and Spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers.<br /><br />A final note: The film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be forewarned--it's not for kids. In fact, considering how worthless the film is, it isn't for anyone! However, with the version included in the \"50 Movie Pack--Chilling Classics\", the print is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark.","finished_norm":["a","stupid","rich","gui","circa","about","want","to","visit","a","nearbi","mental","asylum","to","see","how","a","famou","doctor","care","for","hi","patient","despit","a","initi","hostil","respons","he","be","soon","cordial","invit","in","and","give","a","tour","by","the","good","doctor","and","a","the","doctor","show","him","about","he","talk","and","talk","and","talk","and","a","he","talk","looni","run","amok","here","and","there","do","noth","especi","product","while","there","be","some","action","here","and","there","and","some","of","it","quit","disturb","it","amaz","how","dull","and","cerebr","the","whole","thing","islack","life","and","energi","which","be","odd","for","a","horror","flick","even","a","gui","who","think","he","a","chicken","and","dress","like","on","becom","rather","tiresom","the","far","thi","tour","take","the","guest","the","much","disturb","it","becom","until","ultim","you","realiz","that","the","inmat","have","take","over","the","hospit","and","be","tortur","their","keeper","yet","again","despit","thi","twist","the","film","be","amazingli","lifeless","in","mani","placesparticularli","when","it","move","veri","slowli","a","a","bizarr","ceremoni","be","take","place","or","peopl","be","just","wander","about","the","set","onli","when","the","worker","from","the","asylum","find","in","a","prison","cell","starv","doe","the","film","have","ani","real","impact","consid","thi","plot","it","sure","be","hard","to","imagin","make","it","bore","but","the","peopl","who","make","thi","cheap","exploit","film","have","now","with","the","same","plot","and","compet","write","act","and","direct","thi","can","have","be","a","interest","and","worthwhil","filmbr","br","you","know","now","that","i","think","about","it","thi","be","the","plot","of","on","of","the","episod","of","the","origin","star","trek","tv","show","you","know","the","on","with","lord","garthmast","of","the","univers","and","kirk","and","spock","be","hold","prison","by","thi","madman","and","hi","craze","followersbr","br","a","final","note","the","film","have","quit","a","bite","of","nuditi","here","and","there","and","includ","a","rape","scene","so","be","forewarnedit","not","for","kid","in","fact","consid","how","worthless","the","film","be","it","be","not","for","anyon","howev","with","the","version","includ","in","the","movi","packchil","classic","the","print","be","so","incredibli","bad","that","it","hard","to","see","all","thi","flesh","due","to","the","print","be","so","veri","dark"],"filtered":["stupid","rich","gui","circa","want","visit","nearbi","mental","asylum","see","famou","doctor","care","hi","patient","despit","initi","hostil","respons","soon","cordial","invit","give","tour","good","doctor","doctor","show","talk","talk","talk","talk","looni","run","amok","noth","especi","product","action","quit","disturb","amaz","dull","cerebr","whole","thing","islack","life","energi","odd","horror","flick","even","gui","think","chicken","dress","like","becom","rather","tiresom","far","thi","tour","take","guest","much","disturb","becom","ultim","realiz","inmat","take","hospit","tortur","keeper","yet","despit","thi","twist","film","amazingli","lifeless","mani","placesparticularli","move","veri","slowli","bizarr","ceremoni","take","place","peopl","wander","set","onli","worker","asylum","find","prison","cell","starv","doe","film","ani","real","impact","consid","thi","plot","sure","hard","imagin","make","bore","peopl","make","thi","cheap","exploit","film","plot","compet","write","act","direct","thi","interest","worthwhil","filmbr","br","know","think","thi","plot","episod","origin","star","trek","tv","show","know","lord","garthmast","univers","kirk","spock","hold","prison","thi","madman","hi","craze","followersbr","br","final","note","film","quit","bite","nuditi","includ","rape","scene","forewarnedit","kid","fact","consid","worthless","film","anyon","howev","version","includ","movi","packchil","classic","print","incredibli","bad","hard","see","thi","flesh","due","print","veri","dark"],"filtered2":["stupid","rich","gui","circa","want","visit","nearbi","mental","asylum","see","famou","doctor","care","patient","despit","initi","hostil","respons","soon","cordial","invit","give","tour","good","doctor","doctor","show","talk","talk","talk","talk","looni","run","amok","noth","especi","product","action","quit","disturb","amaz","dull","cerebr","whole","thing","islack","life","energi","odd","horror","flick","even","gui","think","chicken","dress","like","becom","rather","tiresom","far","tour","take","guest","disturb","becom","ultim","realiz","inmat","take","hospit","tortur","keeper","yet","despit","twist","amazingli","lifeless","mani","placesparticularli","move","veri","slowli","bizarr","ceremoni","take","place","peopl","wander","set","onli","worker","asylum","find","prison","cell","starv","doe","ani","real","impact","consid","plot","sure","hard","imagin","make","bore","peopl","make","cheap","exploit","plot","compet","write","act

{"value":"Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf films... but bear with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions of it over the years. If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though, the most workable edition I've seen of it goes by the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, and it's an unedited and complete European version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from FURY's print. It is also letterboxed.<br /><br />Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he's contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair. He takes care of her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doc attempts to \"tame\" the werewolf, and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and the hairy and fanged Daninsky who is under her trance, at least in the original version. Ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a she-wolf! <br /><br />The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS copy, it's not quite as difficult to make out what's going on, though the editing remains atrocious in spots. Worst of all is occasional non-matching footage of Naschy's ravenous werewolf swiped straight from another previous film (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka \"FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR\") and mixed into this one without any sensible reason! The wolf's clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again, as does his demeanor; one moment the wolf is walking around lethargically in a hypnotic trance from FURY, next he is growling and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR.

{"value":"This movie had potential and I was willing to give it a try but there are so many timeline problems that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot.<br /><br />Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the mid to late seventies. For this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not the late forties.<br /><br />Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando that Carlito supposedly ran with in his \"hey-day\". None of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie. We're supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the span of a few years.<br /><br />Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film. Also, the pre-quel creates the Rocco and Earl characters - what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in Carlito's Way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci's in this film? There is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole.<br /><br />It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into the story. The film had some good moments but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way.<br /><br />If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre-quel. Think of it like the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's man with no name, in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","potenti","and","i","be","will","to","give","it","a","try","but","there","be","so","mani","timelin","problem","that","be","so","obviou","it","hard","to","swallow","be","treat","like","such","a","idiotbr","br","rise","to","power","be","set","in","the","late","sixti","carlito","wai","be","set","in","the","mid","to","late","seventi","for","thi","movi","to","be","realist","it","would","have","to","be","set","in","the","fifti","if","not","the","late","fortiesbr","br","rise","to","power","have","no","sign","of","gail","pennelop","ann","miller","no","sign","of","kleinfeld","no","sign","of","rolando","that","carlito","supposedli","run","with","in","hi","heydai","none","of","the","primari","charact","in","the","origin","film","be","in","thi","movi","we","re","suppos","to","believ","that","carlito","meet","all","thi","peopl","in","the","spin","of","a","few","yearsbr","br","rise","to","power","end","with","carlito","walk","down","the","beach","talk","about","retir","in","paradis","which","be","what","he","want","to","do","in","the","origin","film","conjur","the","prequel","creat","the","rocco","and","earl","charact","what","suppos","to","happen","with","them","sinc","thei","be","clearli","not","in","carlito","wai","it","conjur","hard","to","understand","how","carlito","can","have","the","relationship","with","the","italian","he","have","in","the","origin","film","watch","the","event","of","rise","to","power","where","be","the","taglialucci","in","thi","film","there","be","probabl","seven","year","between","the","two","film","and","he","spend","five","of","them","in","prison","it","like","try","to","put","a","squar","plug","into","a","round","holebr","br","it","be","obviou","that","no","on","be","interest","in","tell","a","good","stori","and","that","thei","be","much","interest","in","make","some","buck","by","make","a","averag","gangster","film","and","throw","a","charact","call","carlito","brigant","into","the","stori","the","film","have","some","good","moment","but","i","think","thei","would","have","be","well","off","leav","thi","movi","to","stand","by","itself","instead","of","try","to","make","it","a","prequel","to","carlito","waybr","br","if","you","feel","determin","to","see","thi","movi","the","onli","advic","i","can","give","be","to","not","think","of","the","movi","a","a","linear","prequel","think","of","it","like","the","spaghetti","western","with","clint","eastwood","man","with","no","name","in","other","word","two","movi","that","have","the","same","charact","but","be","not","necessarili","connect","with","each","other"],"filtered":["thi","movi","potenti","give","try","mani","timelin","problem","obviou","hard","swallow","treat","like","idiotbr","br","rise","power","set","late","sixti","carlito","wai","set","mid","late","seventi","thi","movi","realist","set","fifti","late","fortiesbr","br","rise","power","sign","gail","pennelop","ann","miller","sign","kleinfeld","sign","rolando","carlito","supposedli","run","hi","heydai","none","primari","charact","origin","film","thi","movi","re","suppos","believ","carlito","meet","thi","peopl","spin","yearsbr","br","rise","power","end","carlito","walk","beach","talk","retir","paradis","want","origin","film","conjur","prequel","creat","rocco","earl","charact","suppos","happen","sinc","thei","clearli","carlito","wai","conjur","hard","understand","carlito","relationship","italian","origin","film","watch","event","rise","power","taglialucci","thi","film","probabl","seven","year","two","film","spend","five","prison","like","try","put","squar","plug","round","holebr","br","obviou","interest","tell","good","stori","thei","much","interest","make","buck","make","averag","gangster","film","throw","charact","call","carlito","brigant","stori","film","good","moment","think","thei","well","leav","thi","movi","stand","instead","try","make","prequel","carlito","waybr","br","feel","determin","see","thi","movi","onli","advic","give","think","movi","linear","prequel","think","like","spaghetti","western","clint","eastwood","man","name","word","two","movi","charact","necessarili","connect"],"filtered2":["potenti","give","try","mani","timelin","problem","obviou","hard","swallow","treat","like","idiotbr","rise","power","set","late","sixti","carlito","wai","set","mid","late","seventi","realist","set","fifti","late","fortiesbr","rise","power","sign","gail","pennelop","ann","miller","sign","kleinfeld","sign","rolando","carlito","supposedli","run","heydai","none","primari","charact","origin","re","suppos","believ","carlito","meet","peopl","spin","yearsbr","rise","power","end","carlito","walk","beach","talk","retir","paradis","want","origin","conjur","prequel","creat","rocco","earl","charact","suppos","happen","sinc","clearli","carlito","wai","conjur","hard","understand","carlito","relationship","italian","origin","watch","event","rise","power","taglialucci","probabl","seven","year","two","spend","five","prison","like","try","put","squar","plug","round",

{"value":"Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out \"he's lost his gun!\" or whatever it is to let everybody know. Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing. Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman. Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie. Very poor results.<br /><br />If anyone else out there also saw \"Sleepy Hollow\", they will probably have noticed, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films. I've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films. In \"Sleepy Hollow\", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know). The movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. \"Planet of the Apes\" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like \"Total Recall\" or \"Tango and Cash\" than like sci-fi. He's also fallen into the rut of so many other \"big\" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. Word to Burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in \"Mars Attacks\" or \"Beetlejuice\") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.","finished_norm":["absolut","the","wrong","film","yet","by","burton","who","seem","to","be","get","wrong","with","each","film","he","direct","a","miser","script","load","with","clich","be","onli","the","of","mani","objection","aspect","to","thi","film","thi","be","the","kind","of","movi","where","everi","time","someth","happen","you","will","be","sure","to","hear","someon","shout","out","he","lose","hi","gun","or","whatev","it","be","to","let","everybodi","know","carter","be","realli","aw","and","so","be","wahlberg","who","ca","not","plai","thi","straight","and","be","convinc","veri","nice","effect","and","photographi","but","poor","music","in","the","john","william","mold","by","burton","croni","elfman","heston","appear","in","a","nonsensich","scene","to","spout","out","hi","much","famou","catchphras","from","the","movi","veri","poor","resultsbr","br","if","anyon","els","out","there","conjur","see","sleepi","hollow","thei","will","probabl","have","notic","a","i","have","the","declin","qualiti","of","burton","film","i","have","hear","that","thi","particular","project","be","produc","by","other","and","that","burton","be","bring","in","a","director","in","which","case","hi","judgem","should","be","question","but","i","think","he","have","allow","ani","possibl","vision","he","mai","have","have","earli","in","hi","career","to","slip","the","evid","be","there","in","the","film","in","sleepi","hollow","he","can","not","decid","what","kind","of","movi","he","be","make","whether","it","be","a","comedi","or","a","real","horror","movi","and","the","popul","of","british","charact","actor","chri","lee","etc","make","you","conjur","think","it","be","kind","of","a","monster","ralli","film","that","be","never","scari","a","horror","fan","know","the","movi","can","not","succ","on","either","horror","or","comedi","becaus","it","be","so","schizophren","and","no","styl","have","be","develop","to","smooth","the","two","togeth","planet","of","the","ap","be","much","the","same","wai","and","the","result","come","off","much","like","total","recal","or","tango","and","cash","than","like","scifi","he","conjur","fall","into","the","rut","of","so","mani","other","big","director","of","try","to","satisfi","the","entir","possibl","audienc","word","to","burton","if","you","re","out","there","pick","someth","and","do","it","straight","or","us","some","styl","to","peic","it","all","togeth","a","in","mar","attack","or","beetlejuic","or","you","mai","a","good","retir","becaus","peopl","like","me","that","be","fan","of","your","movi","will","stop","go"],"filtered":["absolut","wrong","film","yet","burton","seem","get","wrong","film","direct","miser","script","load","clich","onli","mani","objection","aspect","thi","film","thi","kind","movi","everi","time","someth","happen","sure","hear","someon","shout","lose","hi","gun","whatev","let","everybodi","know","carter","realli","aw","wahlberg","ca","plai","thi","straight","convinc","veri","nice","effect","photographi","poor","music","john","william","mold","burton","croni","elfman","heston","appear","nonsensich","scene","spout","hi","much","famou","catchphras","movi","veri","poor","resultsbr","br","anyon","els","conjur","see","sleepi","hollow","thei","probabl","notic","declin","qualiti","burton","film","hear","thi","particular","project","produc","burton","bring","director","case","hi","judgem","question","think","allow","ani","possibl","vision","mai","earli","hi","career","slip","evid","film","sleepi","hollow","decid","kind","movi","make","whether","comedi","real","horror","movi","popul","british","charact","actor","chri","lee","etc","make","conjur","think","kind","monster","ralli","film","never","scari","horror","fan","know","movi","succ","either","horror","comedi","becaus","schizophren","styl","develop","smooth","two","togeth","planet","ap","much","wai","result","come","much","like","total","recal","tango","cash","like","scifi","conjur","fall","rut","mani","big","director","try","satisfi","entir","possibl","audienc","word","burton","re","pick","someth","straight","us","styl","peic","togeth","mar","attack","beetlejuic","mai","good","retir","becaus","peopl","like","fan","movi","stop","go"],"filtered2":["absolut","wrong","yet","burton","seem","get","wrong","direct","miser","script","load","clich","onli","mani","objection","aspect","kind","everi","time","someth","happen","sure","hear","someon","shout","lose","gun","whatev","let","everybodi","know","carter","realli","aw","wahlberg","ca","plai","straight","convinc","veri","nice","effect","photographi","poor","music","john","william","mold","burton","croni","elfman","heston","appear","nonsensich","scene","spout","famou","catchphras","veri","poor","resultsbr","anyon","els","conjur","see","sleepi","hollow","probabl","notic","declin","qualiti","burton","hear","particular","project","produc","burton","bring","director","case","judgem","question","think","allow","ani","possibl","vision","mai","earli","career","slip","evid","sleepi","hollow","decid","

{"value":"I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with those parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement. This might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be. That is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Granted, it is usually shaky and erratic. I guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.<br /><br />The camera goes to a person about to get eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. And so on.<br /><br />The costuming is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or so something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset. Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I don't care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half-person half-shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea. That is, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie.<br /><br />The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest. It might be a good one to MST3K with your friends, but past that, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, do yourself a favor and change the
