This is basically like a children's program but with swearing. Not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh. Anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded, disappointing, horribly acted program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting

{"value":"I don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, I was irritated. Of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? Why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I just can give this movie 1

{"value":"There are so many comments on this film, yet I found them to be misleading. This a corner-cutting, over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. Boy is intrigued. <br /><br />You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath... Toss in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from The Breakfast Club simply reeks as a lead character. And all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie.","finished_norm":["there","be","so","mani","comment","on","thi","film","yet","i","find","them","to","be","mislead","thi","a","cornercut","overus","scenario","where","a","normal","human","be","becom","a","partner","in","crime","to","someon","of","the","opposit","sex","for","no","appar","reason","boi","meet","girl","girl","hold","boi","up","at","gunpoint","for","someth","ridicul","boi","be","intrigu","br","br","you","know","the","drill","the","antagonist","turn","out","to","be","a","wild","free","spirit","instead","of","a","sociopath","toss","in","a","few","word","of","wisdom","from","alic","drummond","and","you","have","a","recip","for","love","sheedi","be","she","crazi","or","doe","she","just","ne","a","hug","role","from","the","breakfast","club","simpli","reek","a","a","lead","charact","and","all","that","be","leav","be","a","truli","ghastli","turkei","of","a","movi"],"filtered":["mani","comment","thi","film","yet","find","mislead","thi","cornercut","overus","scenario","normal","human","becom","partner","crime","someon","opposit","sex","appar","reason","boi","meet","girl","girl","hold","boi","gunpoint","someth","ridicul","boi","intrigu","br","br","know","drill","antagonist","turn","wild","free","spirit","instead","sociopath","toss","word","wisdom","alic","drummond","recip","love","sheedi","crazi","doe","ne","hug","role","breakfast","club","simpli","reek","lead","charact","leav","truli","ghastli","turkei","movi"],"filtered2":["mani","comment","yet","find","mislead","cornercut","overus","scenario","normal","human","becom","partner","crime","someon","opposit","sex","appar","reason","boi","meet","girl","girl","hold","boi","gunpoint","someth","ridicul","boi","intrigu","know","drill","antagonist","turn","wild","free","spirit","instead","sociopath","toss","word","wisdom","alic","drummond","recip","love","sheedi","crazi","doe","ne","hug","role","breakfast","club","simpli","reek","lead","charact","leav","truli","ghastli","turkei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,18,26,38,50,53,54,74,84,95,96,110,115,128,139,152,157,194,201,254,258,274,280,282,292,308,343,350,414,686,700,712,753,894,1017,1035,1106,1513,1521,1569,1652,1965,2199,2529,3497,3951,4043,4054,4313,4378,4765,4815,6088,6638,6721,7487],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,18,26,38,50,53,54,74,84,95,96,110,115,128,139,152,157,194,201,254,258,274,280,282,292,308,343,350,414,686,700,712,753,894,1017,1035,1106,1513,1521,1569,1652,1965,2199,2529,3497,3951,4043,4054,4313,4378,4765,4815,6088,6638,6721,7487],"values":[1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,1.519311641348122,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.9486336368009016,4.442538903180445,2.0323326556775485,2.0390708128715254,2.1290479736304078,2.201553588425805,2.3409902041158843,2.2939035841256437,2.3131195476980753,2.3360150694757706,2.5378812223426954,2.561435818751577,2.889652074525771,2.7061321952397077,2.748952192422636,2.8028805344481915,8.7565536876541,2.9752256367457734,2.8753661172782943,2.9705344631698933,3.0135689919434205,3.1254654785810323,3.6016814428070463,3.616452760127359,3.7165362186843414,3.8690435127678695,4.091229668125752,4.0536665665501035,4.2860694432771105,4.268777946167049,4.581533656170946,4.581533656170946,4.597282013139085,4.646072177308517,5.3560264761848435,4.979216623837056,5.185068678041204,5.604922523601468,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,5.999576715605417,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.0662680901040895,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.7398560631390434E-5,5.701150871836491E-5,5.7454718835374785E-5,5.7122744857858375E-5,5.712368074971984E-5,5.7043833259524316E-5,5.721348961221884E-5,5.7019718003096E-5,5.714791911531953E-5,6.34024966764601E-5,0.08387520174125769,5.69276756067798E-5,5.799020244171258E-5,5.8817445422080394E-5,5.696918667396846E-5,5.681174842189124E-5,5.822884642060905E-5,5.7218850084329975E-5,5.70413288248425E-5,5.7088605944662725E-5,5.764097169031793E-5,5.727553948567572E-5,5.7340756376447664E-5,5.740253461015488E-5,5.7843069572913865E-5,5.7540566603117846E-5,5.995946271210298E-5,0.9116391784074392,5.69461230841687E-5,5.7090395764971214E-5,5.830383876194938E-5,5.72155347405744E-5,6.141602971758912E-5,5.737647359669822E-5,5.7006581318658706E-5,5.726970427056963E-5,5.694945929959335E-5,5.6983112240000754E-5,5.6811462995073746E-5,5.6826202509617034E-5,5.695411138520717E-5,5.755485657804426E-5,5.726239616539983E-5,5.703599665803637E-5,5.772904382332636E-5,5.705788738522548E-5,5.8953637644621115E-5,5.808670721905735E-5,5.684032692751238E-5,5.696594752604674E-5,5.694618958924291E-5,5.854886942741395E-5,5.696679507074518E-5,5.682115764137524E-5,5.744485

{"value":"Weaker entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usual funny banter and antics, but not much plot. Barrymore gets something to do as the inspector, swapping disguises to follow Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on a wild goose chase (mostly in circles; perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to rescue poor Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom. For those keeping score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's christening.

{"value":"This is not a very good telling of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff! Bo Derek in '10' was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft porn. If you're into that, well, then fast forward to it and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show off her terrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; this was one of his few mistakes! don't waste your time on this movie...go buy the book instead.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","a","veri","good","tell","of","the","tarzan","epic","there","be","onli","on","reason","for","thi","movi","john","derek","want","to","show","off","hi","beauti","wife","in","the","buff","bo","derek","in","be","at","littl","a","humor","movi","and","there","be","a","reason","for","nuditi","and","sex","thi","movi","be","noth","much","than","soft","porn","if","you","re","into","that","good","then","fast","forward","to","it","and","skip","the","rest","thi","movi","like","bolero","be","again","a","vehicl","for","bo","derek","to","show","off","her","terribl","act","she","be","undoubtedli","a","beauti","woman","but","a","poster","of","her","be","much","excit","than","thi","movi","richard","harri","be","a","well","actor","than","thi","thi","be","on","of","hi","few","mistak","do","not","wast","your","time","on","thi","moviego","bui","the","book","instead"],"filtered":["thi","veri","good","tell","tarzan","epic","onli","reason","thi","movi","john","derek","want","show","hi","beauti","wife","buff","bo","derek","littl","humor","movi","reason","nuditi","sex","thi","movi","noth","much","soft","porn","re","good","fast","forward","skip","rest","thi","movi","like","bolero","vehicl","bo","derek","show","terribl","act","undoubtedli","beauti","woman","poster","much","excit","thi","movi","richard","harri","well","actor","thi","thi","hi","mistak","wast","time","thi","moviego","bui","book","instead"],"filtered2":["veri","good","tell","tarzan","epic","onli","reason","john","derek","want","show","beauti","wife","buff","bo","derek","littl","humor","reason","nuditi","sex","noth","soft","porn","re","good","fast","forward","skip","rest","like","bolero","vehicl","bo","derek","show","terribl","act","undoubtedli","beauti","woman","poster","excit","richard","harri","well","actor","mistak","wast","time","moviego","bui","book","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,11,14,15,20,21,28,37,41,49,68,70,89,90,95,151,152,166,226,254,263,291,325,347,369,524,542,593,612,641,699,931,971,1010,1424,1567,1678,1888,1948,1989,2076,2331,3488,3699],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,11,14,15,20,21,28,37,41,49,68,70,89,90,95,151,152,166,226,254,263,291,325,347,369,524,542,593,612,641,699,931,971,1010,1424,1567,1678,1888,1948,1989,2076,2331,3488,3699],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,3.0904588387038183,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.6920303308087352,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,4.064665311355097,2.8002454868101863,2.3131195476980753,2.4423870329693536,2.5940874818617203,2.889652074525771,2.902686292364678,3.016831637578237,5.947318931426056,3.0151989841543516,3.121829110937649,3.4028786598293,3.4471119148061256,3.5227672760500357,3.5929222627171646,3.7034641371169887,3.5813614403160887,3.9241755834625858,4.181290492043933,4.34596758485818,4.470719289830655,4.679973728984199,10.712052952369687,5.967828017290836,16.50521486209871,4.956227105612356,4.956227105612356,5.089758498236879,5.626901430320244,5.672363804397]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.037486565636997815,7.531316919805047E-5,7.589865727375719E-5,0.3233593838764666,7.546135035246362E-5,7.535587046473004E-5,7.55799893818267E-5,7.5324013802304E-5,7.549336964419139E-5,8.37557725995577E-5,0.5811222045910378,7.520242423691643E-5,7.660604019263633E-5,7.769884218909133E-5,7.525726106016584E-5,7.50492824610463E-5,7.69212929330876E-5,7.558707065633009E-5,7.53525620640724E-5,7.541501594056611E-5,7.614470045158724E-5,7.566195831623012E-5,7.574811093417857E-5,7.582972102786917E-5,7.64116751794743E-5,7.601206362981851E-5,0.052261533324085056,7.522478122811376E-5,7.522679366717884E-5,7.541738032352593E-5,7.702035908690266E-5,7.558269103104343E-5,8.113161608198784E-5,7.579529398743371E-5,7.530666001953332E-5,7.565424989818486E-5,7.523120086429407E-5,7.527565696889278E-5,7.504890540738323E-5,7.506837655588728E-5,7.523734634822939E-5,7.603094092887028E-5,7.564459576740418E-5,7.534551818135662E-5,7.626104523186072E-5,7.537443620295829E-5,7.787875442313406E-5,7.673352463898716E-5,7.50870351512953E-5,7.5252982090867E-5,7.522688152150895E-5,7.734404874854635E-5,7.525410171177708E-5,7.506171219944386E-5,7.588562191241883E-5,7.527348517064946E-5,8.094836053103097E-5,7.52114500380229E-5,7.508616681280983E-5,7.544468122155145E-5,7.619302905257086E-5,7.543969012675221E-5,7.5072275704085E-5,7.524707000019433E-5,7.5049813137179E-5,7.678631025807653E-5,7.56963320474276E-5,7.553508777724827E-5,7.546902892914272E-5,7.574412553607257E-5,7.504707520097059E-5,7.547061110198113E-5,7.669469431329731E-5,7.518156372828902E-5,7.704226825848467E-5,7.538033614473081E-5,7.59703004534

{"value":"When I was younger, I thought the first film was really good in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some films shouldn't have sequels, because the first film is usually best, and it is. Basically now that Ariel and Eric are married they have a daughter who isn't allowed outside the house because they are worried about the sister of Ursula (the octopus legged villain from film one), Morgana getting to her. When the kid gets out she asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, like her Mum was. This makes Ariel go back to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just the story that could have had a bit more thought.

In two words:Flat story,that has become a cliché,bad acting,bad special effects...Only the dumb Russian cop,Vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.The pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID,that it made me laugh at him for a moment.

I had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close-up of a smirking face. One of those 'housewife hacks corporate mainframe' tales where she defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on her home PC which is connected only to a power socket. The director obviously loves the rather large leading lady. Can't say I share his feelings. There's quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the adverts.

{"value":"I have read all of the Love Come Softly books. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book,but generally they at least have the main point of the book. I was highly disappointed in this movie. The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit,(although in the book both parents come). That is all. The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes, sad, from the book, that I just couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad. I do know that Pioneer life was rough,but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","all","of","the","love","come","softli","book","know","full","good","that","movi","can","not","us","all","aspect","of","the","bookbut","gener","thei","at","littl","have","the","main","point","of","the","book","i","be","highli","disappoint","in","thi","movi","the","onli","thing","that","thei","have","in","thi","movi","that","be","in","the","book","be","that","missi","father","come","to","visitalthough","in","the","book","both","parent","come","that","be","all","the","stori","line","be","so","twist","and","far","fetch","and","ye","sad","from","the","book","that","i","just","can","not","enjoi","it","even","if","i","do","not","read","the","book","it","be","too","sad","i","do","know","that","pioneer","life","be","roughbut","the","whole","movi","be","a","downer","the","rate","be","for","have","the","same","famili","orient","of","the","film","that","make","them","great"],"filtered":["read","love","come","softli","book","know","full","good","movi","us","aspect","bookbut","gener","thei","littl","main","point","book","highli","disappoint","thi","movi","onli","thing","thei","thi","movi","book","missi","father","come","visitalthough","book","parent","come","stori","line","twist","far","fetch","ye","sad","book","enjoi","even","read","book","sad","know","pioneer","life","roughbut","whole","movi","downer","rate","famili","orient","film","make","great"],"filtered2":["read","love","come","softli","book","know","full","good","us","aspect","bookbut","gener","littl","main","point","book","highli","disappoint","onli","thing","book","missi","father","come","visitalthough","book","parent","come","stori","line","twist","far","fetch","ye","sad","book","enjoi","even","read","book","sad","know","pioneer","life","roughbut","whole","downer","rate","famili","orient","make","great"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,11,14,17,26,29,34,51,54,56,66,75,101,107,111,145,151,179,182,187,200,202,209,225,336,342,435,455,645,670,896,3519,4044,7175,7963],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,11,14,17,26,29,34,51,54,56,66,75,101,107,111,145,151,179,182,187,200,202,209,225,336,342,435,455,645,670,896,3519,4044,7175,7963],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,2.6649848339420377,1.3195384777338066,4.194855026837689,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.929723173391612,1.9742250248702675,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,4.69198042906518,16.801472920861116,2.507968722980095,2.7365296724240786,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.597304642813496,2.6026896854443837,2.641219492619754,2.9233055795674137,3.112795625839981,3.2829611516442836,6.557411652148291,3.558633189238533,3.7264536553416874,3.8844878351953436,5.695894301807195,5.822646007446338,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0110525235033125E-4,1.004234759972545E-4,1.0120417276441345E-4,1.006194139760165E-4,1.006210625118297E-4,1.004804143743685E-4,1.007792572053268E-4,1.0043793632161146E-4,1.0066375741643287E-4,1.1168094383552929E-4,0.6406521532701791,1.0027580734826941E-4,1.0214740556594541E-4,1.0360456075180884E-4,1.0034892742092061E-4,1.0007160628201461E-4,1.0256776732141109E-4,1.0078869946101321E-4,1.004760029135633E-4,1.0055927965564952E-4,1.0153224966552127E-4,1.0088855555784911E-4,1.0100343248379412E-4,1.0111225235383996E-4,1.0188823694454993E-4,1.0135539014906382E-4,1.0561617820398987E-4,1.0030561842636881E-4,1.003083018365652E-4,1.0056243235202311E-4,1.0269986330974516E-4,1.0078285961654065E-4,1.0818186230886799E-4,1.0106634692845895E-4,1.004147965811638E-4,1.008782770615013E-4,1.0031417844564205E-4,1.0037345674451911E-4,1.0007110351417352E-4,1.0009706657528564E-4,1.0032237290704957E-4,1.0138056136424973E-4,1.008654041286391E-4,1.0046661051653144E-4,1.0168738517998188E-4,1.0050517015064492E-4,0.22235303064687376,1.0231739484370996E-4,1.0012194616843051E-4,1.0034322179233997E-4,1.0030841898257439E-4,1.031314749563239E-4,1.003447147081844E-4,1.0008818024310151E-4,1.011867912584907E-4,1.0037056084289817E-4,1.0793750717657384E-4,1.0028784245886726E-4,1.0012078831556121E-4,1.005988356943172E-4,1.0159669159715869E-4,1.0059218050912038E-4,1.0010226574589037E-4,1.0033533854028616E-4,1.0007231389188473E-4,0.1291995040295791,1.0093438990005784E-4,1.0071938487147556E-4,1.006313012173448E-4,1.0099811830653536E-4,1.0006866309516438E-4,1.0063341090543458E-4,1.0226561802537389E-4,1.0024799169783616E-4,1.0272907725984065E-4,1.0051303720321073E-4,1.0129970263273537E-4,1.0068060341350569E-4,1.0003728862202998E-4,1.001612917118962E-4]}}
{"value":"Just too many incidents of violence.<br /><br />The film goes from one scene to another, and in nearly every one violence erupts.<br /><br />Now I am not one who is shocked by violence, and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing. But, please, not one after another. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: \"Here we go again.\" There is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence, but two thirds of the way through the film I had switched off completely, and couldn't wait for the end.<br /><br />If this is the best the film makers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable lives, like making shoes or delivering mail.","finished_norm":["just","too","mani","incid","of","violencebr","br","the","film","go","from","on","scene","to","anoth","and","in","nearli","everi","on","violenc","eruptsbr","br","now","i","be","not","on","who","be","shock","by","violenc","and","to","me","a","film","without","a","fight","in","it","have","someth","miss","but","pleas","not","on","after","anoth","my","reaction","be","not","shock","or","horror","it","be","here","we","go","again","there","be","some","semblanc","of","a","stori","in","between","the","scene","of","violenc","but","two","third","of","the","wai","through","the","film","i","have","switch","off","complet","and","can","not","wait","for","the","endbr","br","if","thi","be","the","well","the","film","maker","can","do","thei","should","find","someth","els","to","do","with","their","miser","live","like","make","shoe","or","deliv","mail"],"filtered":["mani","incid","violencebr","br","film","go","scene","anoth","nearli","everi","violenc","eruptsbr","br","shock","violenc","film","without","fight","someth","miss","pleas","anoth","reaction","shock","horror","go","semblanc","stori","scene","violenc","two","third","wai","film","switch","complet","wait","endbr","br","thi","well","film","maker","thei","find","someth","els","miser","live","like","make","shoe","deliv","mail"],"filtered2":["mani","incid","violencebr","go","scene","anoth","nearli","everi","violenc","eruptsbr","shock","violenc","without","fight","someth","miss","pleas","anoth","reaction","shock","horror","go","semblanc","stori","scene","violenc","two","third","wai","switch","complet","wait","endbr","well","maker","find","someth","els","miser","live","like","make","shoe","deliv","mail"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,17,19,20,33,38,47,50,53,73,83,85,103,116,125,196,232,255,331,346,452,508,517,611,762,1330,1336,1579,2239,2445,2646,3671,3819,8406,8591],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,17,19,20,33,38,47,50,53,73,83,85,103,116,125,196,232,255,331,346,452,508,517,611,762,1330,1336,1579,2239,2445,2646,3671,3819,8406,8591],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.9416538289407692,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,3.400636547121535,3.7901378413541957,2.292318797740072,2.011190219103739,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.478925055209576,2.8377834061292515,2.6754694156628323,2.932274249550174,3.023389038124396,10.25222028117663,6.829941411188657,3.4198487640477615,3.520060914452293,3.749984152751882,4.370968887063596,4.422928625994308,4.605250182788262,5.014723312293965,5.259176650194926,5.339219357868463,5.719991853386255,5.9370563586240825,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.497337486279662E-5,9.433294719313425E-5,9.50662959064597E-5,9.4517001835937E-5,9.451855039059782E-5,9.438643234556717E-5,9.466715082012593E-5,9.434653052114013E-5,9.455865591514128E-5,1.0490766698420596E-4,0.6647142981332874,9.419423441976668E-5,9.595232309456638E-5,9.732110406769278E-5,9.426291987288076E-5,9.400241783297253E-5,9.634719055843947E-5,9.467602041758014E-5,9.438228843305022E-5,9.446051456927608E-5,9.537447544993952E-5,9.476982039628227E-5,9.487773021399437E-5,9.497995032689782E-5,9.570887265000214E-5,0.08676286053634392,9.921072002656048E-5,9.422223750199614E-5,9.422475816750627E-5,9.446347605948115E-5,9.647127512898634E-5,9.467053475066038E-5,1.016207993509044E-4,9.493682899470592E-5,9.432479417023177E-5,9.476016527487191E-5,9.423027836931383E-5,9.428596153086683E-5,9.400194555722492E-5,9.402633399875755E-5,9.423797584928606E-5,9.523198680999187E-5,9.474807306551694E-5,9.43734656704001E-5,9.55202022349175E-5,9.440968672222581E-5,9.75464517917903E-5,9.61120027850324E-5,9.404970468298268E-5,9.425756028186625E-5,9.422486820879083E-5,9.6876710195442E-5,9.42589626546692E-5,9.401798660890332E-5,9.504996856204081E-5,9.428324126120903E-5,1.0139126398019383E-4,9.420553961948432E-5,9.404861705210262E-5,9.449767159525783E-5,9.543500907789662E-5,9.449142003677015E-5,9.40312178476906E-5,9.425015513688079E-5,9.400308252739631E-5,0.08919618053309183,9.481287495638657E-5,9.461090965090296E-5,9.452816813442805E-5,9.48727383333833E-5,9.399965314586162E-5,9.453014987319173E-5,9.606336615080497E-5,9.416810574559555E-5,0.15209828299468675,9.441707665019719E-5,9.515603203572917E-5,9.457448022849536E-5,9.397018148609275E-5,9.40866639799715E-5]}}
{"value":"I'm glad some people liked this, but I hated this film. It had a very good idea for a story line, but that's where it ended. It was badly written, badly acted and badly made.<br /><br /> It had some interesting plot points, but they were just skipped over too fast, the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits, like lying about why she was kidnapped, and ditch the dross. Instead it was \"what's going on?\", 5 seconds later they tell you.<br /><br />This film had no suspense, and I was bored from start to end.

{"value":"All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the film. Her tom-boy look does not really goes well. Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all. Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin.

{"value":"Ouch! This one was a bit painful to sit through. It has a cute and amusing premise, but it all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, played it way over the top. I know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame actors, when the script and director have them do such schlock. If you're going to have outrageous characters, that's OK, but you gotta have good material to make it work. It didn't here. Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible.","finished_norm":["ouch","thi","on","be","a","bite","pain","to","sit","through","it","have","a","cute","and","amus","premis","but","it","all","go","to","hell","from","there","matthew","modin","be","almost","alwai","pedestrian","and","annoi","and","he","doe","not","disappoint","in","thi","on","deborah","kara","unger","and","john","nevil","turn","in","surprisingli","decent","perform","alan","bate","and","jennif","tilli","among","other","plai","it","wai","over","the","top","i","know","that","the","wai","the","part","be","write","and","it","hard","to","blame","actor","when","the","script","and","director","have","them","do","such","schlock","if","you","re","go","to","have","outrag","charact","that","okai","but","you","gotta","have","good","materi","to","make","it","work","it","do","not","here","run","awai","scream","from","thi","movi","if","at","all","possibl"],"filtered":["ouch","thi","bite","pain","sit","cute","amus","premis","go","hell","matthew","modin","almost","alwai","pedestrian","annoi","doe","disappoint","thi","deborah","kara","unger","john","nevil","turn","surprisingli","decent","perform","alan","bate","jennif","tilli","among","plai","wai","top","know","wai","part","write","hard","blame","actor","script","director","schlock","re","go","outrag","charact","okai","gotta","good","materi","make","work","run","awai","scream","thi","movi","possibl"],"filtered2":["ouch","bite","pain","sit","cute","amus","premis","go","hell","matthew","modin","almost","alwai","pedestrian","annoi","doe","disappoint","deborah","kara","unger","john","nevil","turn","surprisingli","decent","perform","alan","bate","jennif","tilli","among","plai","wai","top","know","wai","part","write","hard","blame","actor","script","director","schlock","re","go","outrag","charact","okai","gotta","good","materi","make","work","run","awai","scream","possibl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,10,18,26,33,40,41,48,58,61,65,68,77,96,105,131,137,154,155,171,187,191,197,244,271,291,309,364,394,402,459,484,526,537,708,826,855,898,1406,1578,1605,1738,2423,2749,3477,3744,5528,5739,5997],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,10,18,26,33,40,41,48,58,61,65,68,77,96,105,131,137,154,155,171,187,191,197,244,271,291,309,364,394,402,459,484,526,537,708,826,855,898,1406,1578,1605,1738,2423,2749,3477,3744,5528,5739,5997],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,2.803707089537043,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.9463902258768238,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2.2512118082053005,2.2939035841256437,2.348499626138016,2.3074766467914385,2.373087554090762,2.4732161909892554,2.5460113484259455,2.558331832813986,2.634508058031767,2.757740698455715,3.016831637578237,2.848772527704847,2.9878441007049847,3.0967381889441223,3.084424928710765,3.2829611516442836,3.291526514503207,3.5119855004467477,3.424750734647968,3.6683728173057184,3.8204358137024927,3.9201351739255808,3.892300374932137,4.429617614145104,4.848596441419991,4.869215728622727,4.751432692966343,5.116075806554253,5.604922523601468,5.649374286172302,5.719991853386255,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.815565394410713E-5,7.762863209826168E-5,7.823212069010988E-5,7.778009466332773E-5,7.778136900260818E-5,7.767264619243002E-5,7.790365552515117E-5,7.763981011404316E-5,7.781437271024722E-5,8.633079880278143E-5,0.7269960528760195,7.751448234283175E-5,7.896125171655571E-5,8.008765132292425E-5,7.757100509473283E-5,7.73566323053883E-5,0.07220611690170137,7.791095450963243E-5,7.766923607677268E-5,7.77336100641253E-5,7.848572833317466E-5,7.798814455037804E-5,7.807694588425147E-5,7.816106503640072E-5,7.876091105555058E-5,7.834901366362342E-5,8.164265735679298E-5,7.75375266877048E-5,7.753960099812708E-5,7.773604713876818E-5,7.93883086224971E-5,7.790644023512073E-5,8.36259640037705E-5,7.812557955511432E-5,7.762192279855021E-5,7.798019914116387E-5,7.75441436921484E-5,7.758996657578433E-5,7.735624365941305E-5,7.73763134379106E-5,7.755047811568363E-5,7.836847133508649E-5,7.79702481993222E-5,7.766197563366944E-5,7.860565007117312E-5,7.769178272429953E-5,8.027309486188558E-5,7.909265560367663E-5,7.739554568180394E-5,7.756659457082318E-5,7.753969155349134E-5,7.972194994877924E-5,7.756774861387626E-5,7.736944418941094E-5,7.821868456359471E-5,7.758772800677153E-5,8.34370743594138E-5,7.752378563734116E-5,7.739465064671855E-5,7.77641873882271E-5,7.853554277101507E-5,7.775904284490135E-5,7.738033246332355E-5,7.756050071610101E-5,7.735717929687342E-5,7.914706408824845E-5,7.802357508346259E-5,7.785737344487814E-5,7.778928365299946E-5,7.80728

Several plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end, but it's still an excellent platform for character studies.<br /><br />If 'Gideon' was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon's \"simple wisdom\" almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness).

irrelevant.","finished_norm":["the","stori","line","have","be","rehash","a","numb","of","time","a","breath","of","life","in","the","retir","home","sever","plai","movi","novel","short","stori","poem","and","new","articl","have","beat","the","subject","to","no","end","but","it","still","a","excel","platform","for","charact","studiesbr","br","if","gideon","be","craft","much","enthusiast","it","can","be","brilliant","but","the","dialogu","be","painfulli","bore","and","the","stori","be","absolut","flood","with","clich","even","the","subtitl","and","summari","of","gideon","simpl","wisdom","almost","make","me","laugh","in","it","ineffect","mostli","indiffer","act","be","the","final","straw","for","thi","weak","film","but","the","rest","of","it","be","bland","enough","to","make","the","actor","lack","of","focu","almost","irrelev"],"filtered":["stori","line","rehash","numb","time","breath","life","retir","home","sever","plai","movi","novel","short","stori","poem","new","articl","beat","subject","end","still","excel","platform","charact","studiesbr","br","gideon","craft","much","enthusiast","brilliant","dialogu","painfulli","bore","stori","absolut","flood","clich","even","subtitl","summari","gideon","simpl","wisdom","almost","make","laugh","ineffect","mostli","indiffer","act","final","straw","thi","weak","film","rest","bland","enough","make","actor","lack","focu","almost","irrelev"],"filtered2":["stori","line","rehash","numb","time","breath","life","retir","home","sever","plai","novel","short","stori","poem","new","articl","beat","subject","end","still","excel","platform","charact","studiesbr","gideon","craft","enthusiast","brilliant","dialogu","painfulli","bore","stori","absolut","flood","clich","even","subtitl","summari","gideon","simpl","wisdom","almost","make","laugh","ineffect","mostli","indiffer","act","final","straw","weak","rest","bland","enough","make","actor","lack","focu","almost","irrelev"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,10,17,21,24,40,41,64,75,87,93,107,108,131,133,156,183,222,226,248,272,302,316,379,474,510,516,550,580,619,678,737,912,1028,1240,1581,1806,1839,2223,2254,2685,2773,2858,3059,3623,4054,4489,4849,4859,5016,5151,5351],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,10,17,21,24,40,41,64,75,87,93,107,108,131,133,156,183,222,226,248,272,302,316,379,474,510,516,550,580,619,678,737,912,1028,1240,1581,1806,1839,2223,2254,2685,2773,2858,3059,3623,4054,4489,4849,4859,5016,5151,5351],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,3.83116108203179,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,2.115024371522662,2.035389827120098,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,4.502423616410601,2.3212364753796515,2.3451551414151686,2.4885128563647294,2.5771019354959765,2.5940874818617203,2.689504733779216,2.8028805344481915,2.902686292364678,2.878207028279898,3.1272886331425473,3.6466665387238555,3.374440724508766,3.442099372982581,3.4751392270607813,3.5039747767006686,3.5929222627171646,3.6715125373103863,3.6841709341823097,3.9405024767500145,4.086456389373095,4.3095999406873045,4.671389985292807,4.724033718778229,4.760735085628657,5.051537285416681,5.143104478942172,5.243909178064138,5.3560264761848435,5.373120909544144,5.426230734858092,5.672363804397,5.878215858601149,6.137727054086234,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,6.1754673820690815,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.384920189551789E-5,6.341865180041153E-5,0.3285541002942865,6.354238902745119E-5,6.354343009795466E-5,6.345460908108135E-5,6.3643331979302E-5,6.34277836718809E-5,6.357039245174486E-5,0.31212776517266255,0.23856614643199614,6.332539724475286E-5,6.450733438144697E-5,6.542754568098378E-5,6.337157346381955E-5,6.319644177702497E-5,6.477279796489052E-5,6.364929487910845E-5,6.345182318969532E-5,6.350441346957751E-5,6.411885591598304E-5,6.371235522403774E-5,6.378490140603414E-5,6.385362248324114E-5,6.434366623119969E-5,6.400716697093885E-5,6.669790667465211E-5,6.334422330472545E-5,6.334591791104327E-5,6.350640443584874E-5,6.485621819512252E-5,6.364560694598828E-5,6.831816752761804E-5,6.382463264636209E-5,6.341317064312812E-5,6.370586422803863E-5,6.334962906146016E-5,6.338706403130633E-5,6.319612427299184E-5,6.321252026323208E-5,6.335480396393723E-5,6.402306290080402E-5,6.369773481368875E-5,6.344589177623826E-5,6.421682588839989E-5,6.347024265620045E-5,6.557904363873651E-5,6.461468468683421E-5,6.322823203021607E-5,6.336797028967461E-5,6.334599189017905E-5,6.512878622222535E-5,6.336891308426685E-5,6.320690843590813E-5,0.11589725538588591,6.338523523405824E-5,6.816385427669024E-5,6.333299756410852E-5,6.322750083198553E-5,6.352939359118712E-5,6.415955178299297

{"value":"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.","finished_norm":["encourag","by","the","posit","comment","about","thi","film","on","here","i","be","look","forward","to","watch","thi","film","bad","mistak","i","have","see","+","film","and","thi","be","truli","on","of","the","wrong","of","them","it","aw","in","almost","everi","wai","edit","pace","storylin","act","soundtrack","the","film","onli","song","a","lame","countri","tune","be","plai","no","littl","than","four","time","the","film","look","cheap","and","nasti","and","be","bore","in","the","extrem","rare","have","i","be","so","happi","to","see","the","end","credit","of","a","film","br","br","the","onli","thing","that","prevent","me","give","thi","a","score","be","harvei","keitel","while","thi","be","far","from","hi","well","perform","he","at","littl","seem","to","be","make","a","bite","of","a","effort","on","for","keitel","obsess","onli"],"filtered":["encourag","posit","comment","thi","film","look","forward","watch","thi","film","bad","mistak","see","+","film","thi","truli","wrong","aw","almost","everi","wai","edit","pace","storylin","act","soundtrack","film","onli","song","lame","countri","tune","plai","littl","four","time","film","look","cheap","nasti","bore","extrem","rare","happi","see","end","credit","film","br","br","onli","thing","prevent","give","thi","score","harvei","keitel","thi","far","hi","well","perform","littl","seem","make","bite","effort","keitel","obsess","onli"],"filtered2":["encourag","posit","comment","look","forward","watch","bad","mistak","see","+","truli","wrong","aw","almost","everi","wai","edit","pace","storylin","act","soundtrack","onli","song","lame","countri","tune","plai","littl","four","time","look","cheap","nasti","bore","extrem","rare","happi","see","end","credit","onli","thing","prevent","give","score","harvei","keitel","far","well","perform","littl","seem","make","bite","effort","keitel","obsess","onli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,9,11,14,16,20,21,24,25,29,30,33,35,40,85,101,105,108,131,138,154,280,328,329,343,348,351,356,372,401,509,515,518,546,593,605,606,608,699,796,1013,1052,1122,1389,1622,1651,2256,3113,4700],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,9,11,14,16,20,21,24,25,29,30,33,35,40,85,101,105,108,131,138,154,280,328,329,343,348,351,356,372,401,509,515,518,546,593,605,606,608,699,796,1013,1052,1122,1389,1622,1651,2256,3113,4700],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.9739294460164585,2.2350163994518417,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,2.011190219103739,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.138507503627933,2.2512118082053005,2.2907365189289424,2.348499626138016,2.8028805344481915,3.1550424959247185,2.951986790814132,2.9705344631698933,3.0103169565570433,3.0135689919434205,3.028335462059722,3.070535816550098,3.0879275592619675,3.360519385990158,3.3956930001684253,3.4101163271295305,3.4572130107926293,3.5227672760500357,3.5474598886404074,3.584239140143704,3.616452760127359,3.5813614403160887,3.850067611308864,4.039936373738201,4.1302590120314875,4.263079925052412,4.449957298382227,4.770124825978496,4.646072177308517,5.064116067623542,5.521540914662417,12.511020179485236]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.093868666031004E-5,8.039289817423929E-5,8.101787629896465E-5,8.05497541465969E-5,8.055107386362969E-5,8.043847955954861E-5,8.06777148682327E-5,8.040447422627346E-5,8.058525279524141E-5,8.940493900069844E-5,0.7979598406404442,8.027468367764379E-5,8.177297084050626E-5,0.06595697671315663,8.033321913956408E-5,8.011121278238277E-5,8.210948677433453E-5,0.12984126000185414,8.043494801360488E-5,8.050161428441794E-5,8.128051461776574E-5,8.076521245022416E-5,8.085717589720064E-5,8.09442904353607E-5,8.156549627957417E-5,8.113893169647653E-5,8.454985824368198E-5,8.029854860506549E-5,8.030069677929004E-5,8.050413814047867E-5,8.221523475043183E-5,8.068059873851323E-5,8.660378815342112E-5,8.090754135700376E-5,8.038594996410155E-5,8.075698411414968E-5,8.030540123340731E-5,8.035285581709146E-5,8.011081029717249E-5,8.013159473734E-5,8.031196121846046E-5,8.115908223318389E-5,8.07466788307434E-5,8.042742903449472E-5,8.14047066305734E-5,8.04582975212518E-5,8.313152720756401E-5,8.190905386852664E-5,8.015151181926183E-5,8.032865156198375E-5,8.03007905592264E-5,8.256075665962337E-5,8.032984669917924E-5,8.012448088282216E-5,8.10039617274774E-5,8.03505375352174E-5,8.640817236663624E-5,8.028431825174312E-5,8.015058491300911E-5,8.05332804317725E-5,8.133210289029696E-5,8.052795269719106E-5,8.01357568756136E-5,8.03223407121217E-5,8.011177925160395E-5,8.196539977649601E-5,8.080190462373717E-5,8.06297847

crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes! most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best. also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it. if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since. the ending sucked but the rest was

I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it.

this.","finished_norm":["i","steal","thi","movi","when","i","be","a","freshman","in","colleg","i","have","try","to","watch","it","three","time","the","two","becaus","friend","want","to","see","it","sweet","adam","sandler","i","have","never","hear","of","thi","movi","but","sinc","he","so","funni","it","gotta","be","funni","wrong","i","ca","not","make","myself","watch","thi","pile","of","crap","after","the","dream","box","matchinsult","war","where","burn","the","gui","with","a","good","zinger","caus","your","oppon","physic","pain","you","would","think","that","terribl","comedi","hurt","you","be","ridicul","but","after","watch","thi","you","will","know","it","true","thi","movi","be","not","worth","the","price","i","pai","for","it","i","have","watch","a","ton","of","steven","segal","movi","and","i","have","even","watch","crossroad","twice","but","i","still","can","not","watch","thi"],"filtered":["steal","thi","movi","freshman","colleg","try","watch","three","time","two","becaus","friend","want","see","sweet","adam","sandler","never","hear","thi","movi","sinc","funni","gotta","funni","wrong","ca","make","watch","thi","pile","crap","dream","box","matchinsult","war","burn","gui","good","zinger","caus","oppon","physic","pain","think","terribl","comedi","hurt","ridicul","watch","thi","know","true","thi","movi","worth","price","pai","watch","ton","steven","segal","movi","even","watch","crossroad","twice","still","watch","thi"],"filtered2":["steal","freshman","colleg","try","watch","three","time","two","becaus","friend","want","see","sweet","adam","sandler","never","hear","sinc","funni","gotta","funni","wrong","ca","make","watch","pile","crap","dream","box","matchinsult","war","burn","gui","good","zinger","caus","oppon","physic","pain","think","terribl","comedi","hurt","ridicul","watch","know","true","worth","price","pai","watch","ton","steven","segal","even","watch","crossroad","twice","still","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,8,12,22,25,26,36,37,42,47,55,62,64,81,127,161,162,166,216,219,224,274,304,313,314,322,453,459,578,607,654,814,862,863,970,1131,1194,1251,1256,1388,1653,1958,2423,2694,3622,4945,6068],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,8,12,22,25,26,36,37,42,47,55,62,64,81,127,161,162,166,216,219,224,274,304,313,314,322,453,459,578,607,654,814,862,863,970,1131,1194,1251,1256,1388,1653,1958,2423,2694,3622,4945,6068],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,5.765698632433759,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,1.9536997889255368,4.045224089013853,1.883428577602134,1.949757232424728,2.4359679371086367,2.4323182980210873,2.3586007221245198,2.4423870329693536,2.6070186965339692,2.5792094178355414,2.689504733779216,2.748952192422636,2.871119826396843,2.907069060519773,3.189397019426827,2.885344817328191,3.2872346624216657,3.2829611516442836,3.575630765607104,3.68099128126493,3.634471265630037,3.9363956947973615,3.944626193933877,3.944626193933877,4.086456389373095,4.197121957260614,4.499089986959872,4.637773374493822,4.291900363587903,4.443131333311827,4.706176101378222,4.869215728622727,5.116075806554253,5.878215858601149,6.255510089742618,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.78545216929626E-5,7.732953045228559E-5,7.793069381404443E-5,7.74804094349634E-5,7.748167886423879E-5,7.737337496098454E-5,7.76034942191316E-5,7.734066539938442E-5,7.751455540921876E-5,8.599816787367194E-5,0.7751334005806246,7.72158205136966E-5,7.865701551248529E-5,7.977907512255111E-5,7.72721254845075E-5,7.705857866945122E-5,7.898070852198784E-5,7.761076508076419E-5,7.73699779844381E-5,7.743410394003935E-5,0.13033136512198074,7.768765770974797E-5,7.777611689376757E-5,7.785991193642029E-5,7.845744676024426E-5,7.804713640114982E-5,8.132808974768749E-5,7.723877606914626E-5,7.724084238728987E-5,7.743653162467989E-5,7.90824269762742E-5,7.76062681996665E-5,8.33037547518001E-5,7.782456318001971E-5,7.732284700337856E-5,7.76797429140447E-5,7.724536757839735E-5,7.729101390733241E-5,7.705819152092152E-5,7.707818397094347E-5,7.725167759551894E-5,7.806651910257407E-5,7.766983031299306E-5,7.736274551568432E-5,7.830278399349255E-5,7.739243776016E-5,7.996380415107679E-5,7.878791310292335E-5,7.709734211336616E-5,7.726773195426275E-5,7.724093259374603E-5,7.941478278885916E-5,7.726888155080985E-5,7.707134118952789E-5,7.79173094566697E-5,7.728878396348352E-5,8.311559289565773E-5,7.722508796278886E-5,7.709645052683396E-5,7.74645634502918E-5,7.823294681543127E-5,7.745943872879382E-5,7.708218751112779E-5,7.726166157904715E-5,7.705912355338853E-5,7.884211195263687E-5,7.772295172966108E-5,0

{"value":"Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids.

{"value":"I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one, but when i started with it i found it really awful. They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95% of the movie is shot in India. you can see Indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri(an Indian water brand), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan *hahah* its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie.. pure time waste.. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of

{"value":"I think that the shots and lighting were very poor. When I watched it for the first time I thought it was the old version(1956). When I really found out the true year of the film I was shocked. I didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently. Thats really all I wanted to say. This film had a good plot though, nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that George Orwelll wrote.

{"value":"Stephen Feinberg, who Played the Proctologist and was one of the writers of the movie, passed away in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in Hollywood years earlier, working mostly on TV promos. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had seen it already! Actually I had seen it years before, when it was released. At that time I didn't think it was that bad a movie. However seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. Yes is is a bit puerile as well as dated. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. That said he was just a little proud of 'The Proctologist'

{"value":"It's hard to criticize this movie, because I dislike the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have saved it. Think \"Raising Arizona\" with a mean streak. The acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly is way over the top (yet not enough to make this a nice camp film) as usual, coming in somewhere between \"Misery\" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation, either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise. A real degrading few hours of film. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended but I walked out,

{"value":"The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between.But the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable. <br /><br />But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie .Her voice was so seducing and sexy.The scenes in the bed involving Krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do.Krista really is one of the best in such roles.She also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes,which is the interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star.He could have chosen a better script than this.Ireally think he did for money.","finished_norm":["the","movi","be","not","a","wast","except","for","some","bore","scene","in","betweenbut","the","woman","cast","give","a","pretti","good","show","than","the","male","who","be","laughabl","br","br","but","krista","allen","realli","rock","in","the","movi","her","voic","be","so","seduc","and","sexyth","scene","in","the","bed","involv","krista","should","have","shorten","but","she","make","it","so","watchabl","and","sexi","than","ani","on","can","dokrista","realli","be","on","of","the","well","in","such","rolessh","conjur","enact","quiet","good","a","the","baddi","in","the","last","minuteswhich","be","the","interest","part","of","the","moviebr","br","burt","reynold","be","not","that","good","and","thi","be","not","hi","well","a","a","action","starh","can","have","choos","a","well","script","than","thisir","think","he","do","for","monei"],"filtered":["movi","wast","except","bore","scene","betweenbut","woman","cast","give","pretti","good","show","male","laughabl","br","br","krista","allen","realli","rock","movi","voic","seduc","sexyth","scene","bed","involv","krista","shorten","make","watchabl","sexi","ani","dokrista","realli","well","rolessh","conjur","enact","quiet","good","baddi","last","minuteswhich","interest","part","moviebr","br","burt","reynold","good","thi","hi","well","action","starh","choos","well","script","thisir","think","monei"],"filtered2":["wast","except","bore","scene","betweenbut","woman","cast","give","pretti","good","show","male","laughabl","krista","allen","realli","rock","voic","seduc","sexyth","scene","bed","involv","krista","shorten","make","watchabl","sexi","ani","dokrista","realli","well","rolessh","conjur","enact","quiet","good","baddi","last","minuteswhich","interest","part","moviebr","burt","reynold","good","well","action","starh","choos","well","script","thisir","think","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,12,13,19,20,27,28,30,39,60,61,70,77,78,89,92,108,126,129,144,233,241,428,465,552,582,584,649,1065,1087,1178,1345,2247,2361,2660,3278,3448,6677],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,12,13,19,20,27,28,30,39,60,61,70,77,78,89,92,108,126,129,144,233,241,428,465,552,582,584,649,1065,1087,1178,1345,2247,2361,2660,3278,3448,6677],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,2.62476135602347,3.4960351200691706,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.5538940054862738,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.094675786251684,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.138507503627933,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,2.2931108769894046,2.6102777977348763,2.6627744961815836,3.3721070011625462,3.2681460658591432,3.424750734647968,3.7099788181381825,3.5146700658174166,3.6375061693251913,4.1302590120314875,4.176068548062782,4.229557233013768,4.760735085628657,5.014723312293965,5.339219357868463,5.3064295350454715,5.7959777603641776,5.672363804397,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0384989797963897E-4,1.0314961383943803E-4,1.0395150372881355E-4,1.0335087083283601E-4,1.0335256412049451E-4,1.0320809788964273E-4,1.0351505323355929E-4,1.0316446670983115E-4,1.0339641803890349E-4,1.1471268162609465E-4,0.5324839498104925,1.0299793651530896E-4,1.0492034192399186E-4,0.07380729117915429,1.0307304153615178E-4,1.0278819212117585E-4,1.0535211499616015E-4,1.0352475181268288E-4,1.0320356667347035E-4,1.0328910408096097E-4,1.042884867432218E-4,1.0362731864504804E-4,1.0374531406825578E-4,1.0385708800818187E-4,1.0465413780238812E-4,1.0410682612407621E-4,1.0848327932043168E-4,1.0302855685745063E-4,1.0303131311262682E-4,1.0329234236175396E-4,1.0548779691765398E-4,1.0351875343734041E-4,0.20659198686151978,1.038099364148501E-4,1.0314069880827408E-4,1.0361676112432294E-4,1.0303734925060097E-4,1.0309823674306732E-4,1.0278767570498786E-4,1.0281434357025751E-4,1.0304576616229829E-4,1.0413268064763768E-4,1.0360353873742056E-4,1.0319391930648528E-4,1.0444783363149157E-4,1.0323352569661565E-4,1.0666346311782414E-4,1.0509494580206055E-4,1.0283989855528359E-4,1.0306718102018218E-4,1.0303143343873076E-4,1.0593112527520277E-4,1.0306871446334693E-4,1.02805216005969E-4,1.0393365037723339E-4,1.0309526222808513E-4,1.1086762406391461E-4,1.0301029833607202E-4,1.0283870927085417E-4,1.0332973392446191E-4,1.0435467804259139E-4,1.0332289807481354E-4,1.0281968387973034E-4,1.0305908376605834E-4,1.027889189401206E-4,1.0516724147469418E-4,1.036743972255539E-4,1.0345355558019593E-4,0.028102190405390946,1.0373985563011E-4,1.027851690373397E-4,1.0336524772877666E-4,0.1512217646820401,1.0296936576955064E-4,1.0551780392190425E-4,1.0324160631149339E-4,1.0404962689104911E-4,1.0341372134448563E-4,1.0275294285958504E-4,1.028803121893914E-4]}}

With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not funny. It had no point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid.

{"value":"I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this film--which I stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless. I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days, I have to wonder how this got made in the first place. And if you're wondering why I watched it at all, it came on after a film that I like on cable and I left it on while I worked at the computer. It's not a very demanding picture!","finished_norm":["i","be","a","fan","of","matthew","modin","but","thi","filmwhich","i","stumbl","upon","on","cablei","absolut","witless","i","see","that","the","screenwrit","and","director","be","on","and","the","same","so","there","be","no","on","around","to","check","her","wrong","instinct","there","be","no","surpris","no","origin","line","and","no","origin","charact","the","goldfish","be","basic","the","much","sympathet","charact","what","a","wast","of","all","thi","act","talent","give","how","expens","it","be","to","film","in","new","york","thi","dai","i","have","to","wonder","how","thi","get","make","in","the","place","and","if","you","re","wonder","why","i","watch","it","at","all","it","come","on","after","a","film","that","i","like","on","cabl","and","i","leav","it","on","while","i","work","at","the","comput","it","not","a","veri","demand","pictur"],"filtered":["fan","matthew","modin","thi","filmwhich","stumbl","upon","cablei","absolut","witless","see","screenwrit","director","around","check","wrong","instinct","surpris","origin","line","origin","charact","goldfish","basic","much","sympathet","charact","wast","thi","act","talent","give","expens","film","new","york","thi","dai","wonder","thi","get","make","place","re","wonder","watch","come","film","like","cabl","leav","work","comput","veri","demand","pictur"],"filtered2":["fan","matthew","modin","filmwhich","stumbl","upon","cablei","absolut","witless","see","screenwrit","director","around","check","wrong","instinct","surpris","origin","line","origin","charact","goldfish","basic","sympathet","charact","wast","act","talent","give","expens","new","york","dai","wonder","get","make","place","re","wonder","watch","come","like","cabl","leav","work","comput","veri","demand","pictur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,10,15,21,25,30,34,48,58,68,69,74,87,89,98,107,132,140,164,175,222,276,286,311,326,504,630,765,827,1503,1535,1680,1743,1779,2279,2749,3003,4959],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,10,15,21,25,30,34,48,58,68,69,74,87,89,98,107,132,140,164,175,222,276,286,311,326,504,630,765,827,1503,1535,1680,1743,1779,2279,2749,3003,4959],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,2.0064197866819473,4.254065042302116,1.9486336368009016,2.115024371522662,1.9940046109572438,2.0881990796736947,2.1439533986393955,2.253494045787767,2.317169775997098,2.3930275298746078,4.758228523915245,2.5771019354959765,2.7884729505849193,2.780700890737216,2.9203338091782562,2.942840385588056,3.41740676039221,3.558633189238533,3.965503778955432,4.062925891962901,4.605250182788262,4.558366596889411,4.662879295624898,4.724033718778229,4.715065048795469,5.02684467282631,5.604922523601468,5.649374286172302,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.031756486024137E-4,1.0247991108339001E-4,1.0327659467243175E-4,1.0267986140817203E-4,1.0268154370209658E-4,1.0253801542369421E-4,1.028429778484698E-4,1.0249466752096224E-4,1.0272511289728723E-4,0.08625267218715282,0.803867193114589,1.0232921853000529E-4,1.0423914264910779E-4,1.0572613692409254E-4,1.0240383592866922E-4,1.0212083590925735E-4,1.0466811241832946E-4,1.0285261345920285E-4,1.0253351362661364E-4,1.0261849567926181E-4,1.0361138981191649E-4,1.0295451437254266E-4,1.0307174370601743E-4,1.0318279194942526E-4,0.0414342796890805,1.0343090863118833E-4,1.077789475401973E-4,1.0235964006842137E-4,1.0236237842850694E-4,1.026217129353947E-4,1.0480291341983351E-4,1.028466540285384E-4,1.1039717078257108E-4,1.0313594648959055E-4,1.0247105393340195E-4,1.0294402539691883E-4,1.0236837537662776E-4,1.0242886755475414E-4,1.0212032284592091E-4,1.0214681756907007E-4,1.0237673764120861E-4,1.0345659529328101E-4,1.0293088885686183E-4,1.0252392889552237E-4,1.0376970213450761E-4,1.0256327813967187E-4,1.0597094656288266E-4,1.0441261290491646E-4,1.0217220663739258E-4,1.0239801346232047E-4,1.0236249797338911E-4,1.0524336345130976E-4,1.0239953694954767E-4,1.0213774926583677E-4,1.032588572344097E-4,1.0242591235192259E-4,1.1014781183555596E-4,1.0234150009118107E-4,1.0217102507443715E-4,0.06060105946451235,1.0367715136177984E-4,1.0265207026433545E-4,1.0215212320638235E-4,1.0238996877992424E-4,1.021215580093027E-4,1.0448443919517036E-4,1.0300128729358997E-4,1.0278187947093904E-4,1.0269199207206563E-4,1.0306632070698705E-4,1.0211783245290694E-4,1.0269414496157386E-4,1.0435977581989657E-4,1.0230083328089077E-4,1.0483272560247757E-4,1.0257130629085293E-4,1.0337408076633778E-4,1.0274230386050563E-4,1.0208581550482611E-4,1.0221235788445756E-4]}}
