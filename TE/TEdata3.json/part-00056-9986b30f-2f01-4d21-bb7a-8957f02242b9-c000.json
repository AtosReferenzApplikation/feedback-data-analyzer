{"value":"Fashionably fragmented, yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study, an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player, and a pot-smoking, womanizing rabble-rouser. We never learn why these young men are friends. They may share confusions about the world and their places in it, but they don't seem to have anything else in common. Making his directorial debut, Jack Nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner, based upon Larner's book--doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity, nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role), but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps intentionally), sketchy or unsure. Bruce Dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach, Karen Black is the older, married lady Tepper is having an affair with, and Michael Margotta is Tepper's wayward friend (in an off-putting, over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor, preferring (I assume) to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone; his script is no help either, and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with. Small, random moments do work (a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black, Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm-room, all of the scenes set on the court), however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess. Hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson shows no style at his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah, as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly). When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors, one has to question his motives in doing so. Perhaps if \"Drive, He Said\" ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain, audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie. *1/2 from

{"value":"It's often said that Tobe Hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and every time I see another Hooper film - that view is only reinforced. It would seem that Hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as Scanners and Firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with Spontaneous Combustion; a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films. Put it all together and you get a messy, boring film that most people would do well to miss! The film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties. The couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them. Fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named Sam; but naturally he's not a normal person and soon finds when it's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will.<br /><br />The film stars Brad Dourif, who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with Child's Play two years earlier; but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible; and not helped by the terrible supporting performances. The turgid direction and dull script also don't do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects, which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off; all of which were made some years earlier. The plot is really slow and it's almost an hour before anything of note happens, and I didn't care for it even then. It soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect. The final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film. Not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway. Overall, this is a rubbish film and another reason why Tobe Hooper is a long way from being a great horror director. See Firestarter again

{"value":"Ugly shot, poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to Joe Dante's 1981 classic. \"The Howling\" is one of the two or three ONLY good werewolf-films ever made and yet it got 'rewarded' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one. If it's any consolation, \"Stirba\" is a sequel in name only and there's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in Dante's film. The plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of Transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by Stirba. Stirba is played by Sybil Danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super-babe (with impressive bosom) in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused. Her arch-enemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee. His character  Stefan Crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to Stirba's kingdom, accompanied by an American couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult. In case you're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity...this is your film. Even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we're even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence. However, if you want a little substance or depth, you'll be sorely disappointed. The dialogues are embarrassing and there's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere. The scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires (the Transsylvanian setting, garlic, wooden stakes...) and Danning's gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film's only gimmick. During the end-credits, a shot in which she rips off her top, is re-edited repeatedly (according to my fellow reviewer Dr. Gore, no less than seventeen times!) which is pretty pathetic and pointless. The music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful. I'm talking about the fierce-looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of Stirba's castle. The directing by Philippe Mora is a giant mess and  as far as I'm concerned  his only worthwhile film remains \"The Beast Within\", released three years

The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.<br /><br />Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well cast, with a likable (if too pretty) Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /><br />The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene. Unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. Mrs Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here. I could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it's sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.","finished_norm":["i","onli","recent","find","out","that","madelein","lengl","novel","have","be","turn","into","a","tv","movi","by","disnei","and","order","the","dvd","the","book","be","a","favorit","of","mine","when","i","be","a","child","and","i","read","it","sever","timesbr","br","despit","some","of","the","child","actor","not","resembl","the","charact","a","describ","in","the","novel","the","murri","famili","be","good","cast","with","a","likabl","if","too","pretti","meg","at","the","center","and","a","charl","wallac","who","be","convinc","a","a","child","prodigi","without","becom","irrit","br","br","the","half","hour","be","promis","enough","do","a","good","job","in","establish","the","relationship","between","the","lead","charact","and","at","set","the","scene","unfortun","a","soon","a","the","nonhuman","charact","appear","the","adapt","start","to","unravel","and","onc","the","child","leav","earth","the","whole","thing","fall","apart","alfr","woodward","be","too","youth","look","and","much","too","regal","a","the","eccentr","mr","whatsit","think","miriam","margoli","or","joan","plowright","instead","and","kate","nelligan","face","be","so","mask","like","and","inexpress","she","must","have","visit","faye","dunawai","plastic","surgeon","in","recent","year","for","some","reason","thei","make","her","mr","which","look","like","glinda","from","the","wizard","of","oz","when","she","should","have","resembl","a","benign","wick","witch","of","the","westbr","br","in","the","end","what","let","thi","down","much","badli","be","the","terribl","special","effect","and","art","direct","i","understand","that","thi","be","a","tv","movi","but","the","cgi","look","like","someth","that","can","have","be","do","year","earli","mr","whatsit","centaur","incarn","be","a","disast","a","be","the","chewbacca","like","suit","for","aunt","beast","who","in","the","novel","be","a","velveti","eleg","creatur","instead","of","the","ungainli","big","foot","like","thing","show","here","i","can","go","on","and","on","nearli","everi","artist","choic","be","a","disast","presum","becaus","there","be","not","a","larg","enough","budget","to","do","thi","justic","but","conjur","becaus","the","design","work","lack","imagin","and","good","judgementbr","br","thi","realli","would","have","ne","the","sens","of","wonder","spielberg","bring","to","hi","earli","film","what","a","shame","that","with","the","current","popular","of","adapt","child","literari","fantasi","seri","nobodi","think","of","adapt","a","wrinkl","in","time","and","it","sequel","for","the","big","screen","give","it","the","scope","it","deserv"],"filtered":["onli","recent","find","madelein","lengl","novel","turn","tv","movi","disnei","order","dvd","book","favorit","mine","child","read","sever","timesbr","br","despit","child","actor","resembl","charact","describ","novel","murri","famili","good","cast","likabl","pretti","meg","center","charl","wallac","convinc","child","prodigi","without","becom","irrit","br","br","half","hour","promis","enough","good","job","establish","relationship","lead","charact","set","scene","unfortun","soon","nonhuman","charact","appear","adapt","start","unravel","onc","child","leav","earth","whole","thing","fall","apart","alfr","woodward","youth","look","much","regal","eccentr","mr","whatsit","think","miriam","margoli","joan","plowright","instead","kate","nelligan","face","mask","like","inexpress","must","visit","faye","dunawai","plastic","surgeon","recent","year","reason","thei","make","mr","look","like","glinda","wizard","oz","resembl","benign","wick","witch","westbr","br","end","let","thi","much","badli","terribl","special","effect","art","direct","understand","thi","tv","movi","cgi","look","like","someth","year","earli","mr","whatsit","centaur","incarn","disast","chewbacca","like","suit","aunt","beast","novel","velveti","eleg","creatur","instead","ungainli","big","foot","like","thing","show","go","nearli","everi","artist","choic","disast","presum","becaus","larg","enough","budget","thi","justic","conjur","becaus","design","work","lack","imagin","good","judgementbr","br","thi","realli","ne","sens","wonder","spielberg","bring","hi","earli","film","shame","current","popular","adapt","child","literari","fantasi","seri","nobodi","think","adapt","wrinkl","time","sequel","big","screen","give","scope","deserv"],"filtered2":["onli","recent","find","madelein","lengl","novel","turn","tv","disnei","order","dvd","book","favorit","mine","child","read","sever","timesbr","despit","child","actor","resembl","charact","describ","novel","murri","famili","good","cast","likabl","pretti","meg","center","charl","wallac","convinc","child","prodigi","without","becom","irrit","half","hour","promis","enough","good","job","establish","relationship","lead","charact","set","scene","unfortun","soon","nonhuman","charact","appear","adapt","start","unravel","onc","child","leav","earth","whole","thing","fall","apart","alfr","woodward","youth","look","regal","eccentr","mr","whatsit","t

{"value":"I came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. Instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad.<br /><br />The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a Rubik's Cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it. Once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by Ned Beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. Extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue.<br /><br />Here is where the main problem with the movie begins. By the very nature of Brian's solitude, Jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. Instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. As a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension. These scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story. Even worse, occasionally Jared  his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `Predator.' Speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night.<br /><br />Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. For instance, we are never shown how they react to news of Brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on. This is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey.","finished_norm":["i","come","awai","from","thi","movi","with","the","feel","that","it","can","have","be","so","much","well","instead","of","what","should","be","a","grip","tens","stori","of","a","boi","fight","for","surviv","in","the","wilder","it","come","off","a","a","nation","geograph","documentari","meet","columbia","sportswear","adbr","br","the","film","begin","with","brian","jare","rushton","prepar","for","a","journei","by","plane","to","see","hi","father","hi","mother","fortuit","give","him","the","curiou","choic","of","a","hatchet","a","a","goingawai","gift","what","wrong","with","a","rubik","cube","littl","know","how","badli","he","will","soon","ne","it","onc","in","the","air","the","plane","pilot","a","blinkandyoullmisshim","cameo","by","ned","beatti","suffer","a","fatal","heart","attack","leav","brian","helpless","a","the","plane","crash","into","a","lake","extrem","lucki","to","walk","or","rather","swim","awai","virtual","unscath","brian","must","find","shelter","food","and","hope","for","rescuebr","br","here","be","where","the","main","problem","with","the","movi","begin","by","the","veri","natur","of","brian","solitud","jare","have","veri","few","line","to","speak","and","so","the","film","ought","to","have","compens","by","ratchet","up","the","tension","of","each","scene","instead","he","be","show","walk","around","sit","around","and","so","on","with","onli","a","minim","sens","of","danger","a","a","result","too","much","relianc","be","place","on","flashback","to","the","parent","troubl","marriag","a","the","sourc","of","tension","thi","scene","mere","get","in","the","wai","and","do","not","particularli","add","much","to","the","stori","even","wrong","occasion","jare","hi","face","cover","with","mud","let","out","a","primal","scream","or","two","which","conjur","up","unfortun","parallel","to","predat","speak","of","unfortun","we","can","have","do","with","be","spare","the","sight","of","hi","mullet","but","it","presum","help","keep","him","warm","at","nightbr","br","anoth","disappoint","be","pamela","sue","martin","in","a","total","ineffectu","perform","a","the","mother","both","she","and","the","father","have","veri","littl","impact","in","the","movi","for","instanc","we","be","never","show","how","thei","react","to","new","of","brian","disappear","how","thei","mai","be","organ","rescu","attempt","and","so","on","thi","be","just","on","sourc","of","tension","the","filmmak","would","have","do","good","to","explor","instead","of","spend","so","much","time","on","event","that","happen","befor","brian","embark","on","hi","journei"],"filtered":["come","awai","thi","movi","feel","much","well","instead","grip","tens","stori","boi","fight","surviv","wilder","come","nation","geograph","documentari","meet","columbia","sportswear","adbr","br","film","begin","brian","jare","rushton","prepar","journei","plane","see","hi","father","hi","mother","fortuit","give","curiou","choic","hatchet","goingawai","gift","wrong","rubik","cube","littl","know","badli","soon","ne","onc","air","plane","pilot","blinkandyoullmisshim","cameo","ned","beatti","suffer","fatal","heart","attack","leav","brian","helpless","plane","crash","lake","extrem","lucki","walk","rather","swim","awai","virtual","unscath","brian","must","find","shelter","food","hope","rescuebr","br","main","problem","movi","begin","veri","natur","brian","solitud","jare","veri","line","speak","film","compens","ratchet","tension","scene","instead","show","walk","around","sit","around","onli","minim","sens","danger","result","much","relianc","place","flashback","parent","troubl","marriag","sourc","tension","thi","scene","mere","get","wai","particularli","add","much","stori","even","wrong","occasion","jare","hi","face","cover","mud","let","primal","scream","two","conjur","unfortun","parallel","predat","speak","unfortun","spare","sight","hi","mullet","presum","help","keep","warm","nightbr","br","anoth","disappoint","pamela","sue","martin","total","ineffectu","perform","mother","father","veri","littl","impact","movi","instanc","never","show","thei","react","new","brian","disappear","thei","mai","organ","rescu","attempt","thi","sourc","tension","filmmak","good","explor","instead","spend","much","time","event","happen","befor","brian","embark","hi","journei"],"filtered2":["come","awai","feel","well","instead","grip","tens","stori","boi","fight","surviv","wilder","come","nation","geograph","documentari","meet","columbia","sportswear","adbr","begin","brian","jare","rushton","prepar","journei","plane","see","father","mother","fortuit","give","curiou","choic","hatchet","goingawai","gift","wrong","rubik","cube","littl","know","badli","soon","ne","onc","air","plane","pilot","blinkandyoullmisshim","cameo","ned","beatti","suffer","fatal","heart","attack","leav","brian","helpless","plane","crash","lake","extrem","lucki","walk","rather","swim","awai","virtual","unscath","brian","must","find","shelter","food","hope","rescuebr","main","problem","begin","veri","natur","br

What a sight! Really I could go on about the many traditional actions, but I'll be here all day. Oh not to forget we even get the legendary Chuck Connors popping up now and again, and watch him dispatch some ninjas with his shotgun with little ease. What class! What a badass! Anyhow the ultra-cheap 'Sakura Killers' is some stupid, but cheesy ninja action fun that only fanatics of the genre would get anything out of this shonky b-grade debacle.<br /><br />A genetic lab in America has a very important video that's stolen by a couple of ninjas. Two Americans are sent to Japan by the Colonel (Chuck Connors) to retrieve it.<br /><br />The opening of the feature sets it up nicely. Get ready for the laughs! Afterwards it slows down, but soon after the two main protagonists learns about the ninja and goes through the training it gets a head of steam as they break in costumes and fled after the stolen beta tape that contains a very important formula. This is when the violently swift action and aerobic marital arts really come in to play. It's not too shoddy either, (like the moronic script and daft performances). The final climatic showdown is very well done.<br /><br />In the slow stretches it has the two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) looking in to the case, sharing brainless conversations and encountering some minor problems. What made me laugh was how the ninjas were put off by how brave and clever these two were. These were supposed to be professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ('Effects (1989)') does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is. He centres the on-screen activities around striking Taiwan locations. The score is a chintzy

{"value":"This 1970 hit film has not aged well, but frankly, it was not that good when it was released. Yet, it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War. The plot is pure drivel as it concerns Oliver Barrett IV, a privileged Harvard hockey player, who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri, an antagonistic Vassar music student proud of her working class background. His old-school father naturally disapproves of Jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie-era, extemporaneous ceremonies. He lands his dream job in New York, but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease. There is a veneer of then-contemporary film-making techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller, but none of that can hide the old-fashioned, cliché-ridden story at its core. The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.<br /><br />Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling. At least the boyish O'Neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach, but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic façade. John Marley (two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in \"The Godfather\") does better as Jenny's plainspoken baker father Phil, as does Ray Milland as the seemingly insensitive Barrett paterfamilias. The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years. The print quality on the DVD is good, though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller. The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal (upon whose book this movie is based) conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew  Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Oliver's

{"value":"I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then....<br /><br />Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life?<br /><br />Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First, Freeman looks at the Target interior as if he's walked into Harrods. Then, he's bowled over at a T-shirt rack confirming he has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life.<br /><br />One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and ex-hubby fight scene where her survival, a car in this instance, requires she physically attack her ex hubbie. Does Freeman run to her defense....naw...he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. <br /><br />Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing, tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one or another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. <br /><br />Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis: uneducated, no white collar skills or experience, VERY POOR, no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as: some people pay $100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills. In the end Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star',not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman

{"value":"Well, there you have it, another disillusion on my account. Two, actually! First of all, even though I like to think of myself that I know a little something about 70's euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors, I never heard about Joseph W. Sarno before. Here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult-laden exploitation movies and I haven't seen a single one! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, and even worse, just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies, that director's most famous and supposed \"masterpiece\" turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film. Admittedly, lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole, but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality (like José Larraz' \"Vampyres\" or Harry Kümmel's \"Daughters of Darkness\"). Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer, except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly. The events take place in a secluded old castle, hidden deep in the German mountains, where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty (literally) baroness. Her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle's catacombs, which are lit by penis-shaped candlesAUCH, and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now. Suddenly (don't even ask how) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests, so even more erotic rites ensue. Sounds delicious and entertaining enough, but \"The Devil's Plaything\" contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable! Sarno isn't capable of creating suspense or building a Gothic atmosphere (or maybe he just didn't bother to) and the actresses' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face. Please do yourself a favor: no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian-vampire movies of the 70's, this one isn't worth a penny! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this

{"value":"San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits. In this one, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They didn't even manage the most basic of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You will not be thinking \"oh, I've been there,\" you will be thinking \"how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?\" Some of the leads used East Coast speech styles and affectations. It detracts, but the acting was always competent.<br /><br />The stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, ripped scene for scene from classy Hong Kong action movies. The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and paced better. But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminaries.<br /><br />The white boy intro was pointless. I think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it down. The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal - really, folks, everyone knows it's not \"groovy\" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. They threw away some good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York. They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. That would have been interesting; this was not.<br /><br />The Hunter's Point intro was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco. You've seen it done before and you've seen it done better. Even the video game was better! <br /><br />Despite the generic non-locality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction... about ten minutes before the ending. Good concept placed in the wrong hands.<br /><br />PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.","finished_norm":["san","francisco","be","a","big","citi","with","great","act","credit","in","thi","on","the","filmmak","make","no","attempt","to","us","the","citi","thei","do","not","even","manag","the","much","basic","of","realist","detail","so","i","would","not","recommend","it","to","anyon","on","the","basi","of","be","a","san","francisco","movi","you","will","not","be","think","oh","i","have","be","there","you","will","be","think","how","do","a","two","stori","firetrapstinki","armpit","turn","into","a","quiet","hotel","lobbi","some","of","the","lead","us","east","coast","speech","styl","and","affect","it","detract","but","the","act","be","alwai","competentbr","br","the","stori","seem","to","be","shoot","in","three","distinct","styl","at","littl","in","the","begin","the","chinatown","stori","be","the","much","effect","and","interest","the","plot","be","weak","rip","scene","for","scene","from","classi","hong","kong","action","movi","the","origin","have","a","lot","much","tension","and","emot","reson","thei","be","frame","and","pace","well","but","the","act","be","fun","and","we","get","to","see","jame","hong","and","other","luminariesbr","br","the","white","boi","intro","be","pointless","i","think","the","filmmak","do","not","know","what","to","do","with","it","so","thei","leav","it","loos","structur","and","cut","it","down","the","father","be","a","odd","attempt","at","a","berkelei","liber","realli","folk","everyon","know","it","not","groovi","to","live","in","the","ghetto","but","hi","segment","be","the","much","humor","thei","throw","awai","some","good","opportun","educ","and","embitt","on","the","west","coast","a","yuppi","jerk","here","be","a","differ","kind","of","yuppi","jerk","than","thei","make","in","new","york","thei","be","equal","intoler","but","alwai","distinguish","that","would","have","be","interest","thi","be","notbr","br","the","hunter","point","intro","be","the","much","disappoint","it","be","the","much","deriv","of","the","three","and","stylist","the","much","distant","from","san","francisco","you","have","see","it","do","befor","and","you","have","see","it","do","well","even","the","video","game","be","well","br","br","despit","the","gener","nonloc","and","aimless","script","thi","charact","have","potenti","the","actor","have","talent","and","someth","interest","start","to","forc","it","wai","around","the","clumsi","direct","about","ten","minut","befor","the","end","good","concept","place","in","the","wrong","handsbr","br","p","there","be","a","miss","minor","here","see","if","you","can","guess","which","on"],"filtered":["san","francisco","big","citi","great","act","credit","thi","filmmak","make","attempt","us","citi","thei","even","manag","much","basic","realist","detail","recommend","anyon","basi","san","francisco","movi","think","oh","think","two","stori","firetrapstinki","armpit","turn","quiet","hotel","lobbi","lead","us","east","coast","speech","styl","affect","detract","act","alwai","competentbr","br","stori","seem","shoot","three","distinct","styl","littl","begin","chinatown","stori","much","effect","interest","plot","weak","rip","scene","scene","classi","hong","kong","action","movi","origin","lot","much","tension","emot","reson","thei","frame","pace","well","act","fun","get","see","jame","hong","luminariesbr","br","white","boi","intro","pointless","think","filmmak","know","thei","leav","loos","structur","cut","father","odd","attempt","berkelei","liber","realli","folk","everyon","know","groovi","live","ghetto","hi","segment","much","humor","thei","throw","awai","good","opportun","educ","embitt","west","coast","yuppi","jerk","differ","kind","yuppi","jerk","thei","make","new","york","thei","equal","intoler","alwai","distinguish","interest","thi","notbr","br","hunter","point","intro","much","disappoint","much","deriv","three","stylist","much","distant","san","francisco","see","befor","see","well","even","video","game","well","br","br","despit","gener","nonloc","aimless","script","thi","charact","potenti","actor","talent","someth","interest","start","forc","wai","around","clumsi","direct","ten","minut","befor","end","good","concept","place","wrong","handsbr","br","p","miss","minor","see","guess"],"filtered2":["san","francisco","big","citi","great","act","credit","filmmak","make","attempt","us","citi","even","manag","basic","realist","detail","recommend","anyon","basi","san","francisco","think","oh","think","two","stori","firetrapstinki","armpit","turn","quiet","hotel","lobbi","lead","us","east","coast","speech","styl","affect","detract","act","alwai","competentbr","stori","seem","shoot","three","distinct","styl","littl","begin","chinatown","stori","effect","interest","plot","weak","rip","scene","scene","classi","hong","kong","action","origin","lot","tension","emot","reson","frame","pace","well","act","fun","get","see","jame","hong","luminariesbr","white","boi","intro","pointless","think","filmmak","know","leav","loos","structur","cut","father","odd","attempt","berkelei","libe

{"value":"This is a sad film made for sad people. I was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart, wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe-inducing scenes after another. And there were people roaring with laughter behind me, which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse-s**t.<br /><br />Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters. The screenplay is dull, probably he was drunk when he was writing this film. There is no strong hold on any of these stories. Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before. One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it. I mean seriously is this story really required? Its not funny, not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. Another of the stories (which was probably the only story I was interested in) is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age-old sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what the Salmaan-Priyanka plot was all about. There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot. She can't take Karan Johar's film because she has to marry Salmaan ?? Why can't she marry him and still take the film ?? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married?? With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself. So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group, shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines. And also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore!! I come to IMDb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film. It just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are. With fans like these, movies like Salaam E Ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a

{"value":"I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a kid. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.<br /><br />Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.<br /><br />The gadget mobile was wrong. It never talked in the series and it did fine. Why did they do this?<br /><br />Gadget was too intelligent in this film. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a halfway decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron.<br /><br />Also the completely butchered the catchphrase. Borderick says \"Wowser\". It is and should always be \"Wowsers\". It sounds lame with out the 's'. I got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase.<br /><br />The ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen/sidekicks. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame, a Herve Villacheze look alike, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at.<br /><br />The other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. Don Adams voices the dog saying that \"Brain isn't in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of the woof. Woof.\" of course this isn't laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie.

{"value":"Seriously - avoid this movie at any cost. I just saw it in my first \"sneak preview\" ever and although I paid non-refundable money for it, I walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes. Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave. First time EVER I walked out of a movie. And I lived through some pretty bad ones.<br /><br />It's one of those films that is dubbed (and badly so) even though it is shown in its original language. It relies on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the military (\"What do we do once we reach the fighting zone?\" - \"You get out of the car and die\"; actually, it's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film), on drugs (a guy eats some \"space cookies\", behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high - all badly written and acted), on women in the army (\"Why do we only get trumpets? We were promised guns!\" - \"That's the way it is, that's the way it'll stay\")... Argh. Okay, you might actually find these genuinely funny, but in that case you seriously scare me.<br /><br />Additionally, I have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on European late night TV. So it had lame jokes (delivered badly), beyond lower average acting, lacked pace, was badly dubbed and edited  It just didn't work. At least not on any level used as a measure for films.<br /><br />I would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee Germans. And that's saying something if you like stereotypes. (Which I don't, it's nice to play with them, though. Just in case somebody thinks I'm not being PC enough.)<br /><br />Instead of going to see this film, do something useful. Try to teach crocheting to prawns, paint your toenails in a really irritating colour, disassemble your bicycle, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, convert to a different religion and back - in fact, go and listen to \"Last Christmas\" by Wham! on endless repeat.

{"value":"I haven't seen \"Henry Fool\", but after watching \"Fay Grim\" I'm not sure I want to. Maybe Hartley aims to be the \"anti-thriller\" director---he sure succeeded with this yawner. Based on the official description---woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security---I expected a taut geopolitical drama. Instead I got flimsy structure, goofy dialog, flabby characterizations, a convoluted plot, and a \"tone\" that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. I can hang for a long time with a frustrating, hard-to-follow plot (e.g. \"Duplicity\") because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. Even when they don't, or they do but they leave lingering questions (e.g. \"Duplicity\"), sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest. But half-way through \"Fay Grim\" I reached a deadly realization---I didn't know what was going on, and I didn't care. Too bad, because I really like Parker Posey, reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent, estranged wife and indifferent, clueless mother to tough, shrewd international \"player\" capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists. There's also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum can be very good, but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a CIA operative. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I was watching him in it. His CIA sidekick is worse; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of \"American Idol\" (are there really young CIA agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads?). Then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages. Goldblum was 54 when he made \"Fay Grim\"; Thomas Jay Ryan, who plays \"Henry Fool\", was 44. Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. Yet, a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua \"back in the '70s.\" Goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then; Henry Fool would've been a teenager. Was Hartley being \"quirky\" or lazy? The problems are too numerous to

{"value":"Whenever I make up a list of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always on it. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and I would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again.<br /><br />What's wrong with it? Let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater.<br /><br />I went to a midnight show, on a Saturday night. I the only ones in the theater were myself, and a bunch of loud, boisterous, rather unruly teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. They were obviously out having a good time on a Saturday night, and had come to this \"comedy\" for some laughs. Before the movie starts, during the previews, they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time. It was borderline annoying; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie, I might've said something, but I was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun, so I let it go. And they did settle down once the movie started.<br /><br />Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged \"comedy\" by the effect it had not just on myself, but on this rowdy bunch.<br /><br />During the entire run of the film, not one person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not myself, not the boisterous kids. Absolute silence, aside from the soundtrack. And when the film was over and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly filed out of the theater in slow, somber, absolute silence. It could've been a funeral.<br /><br />This was the effect that this \"comedy\" produced. Not laughter, not enjoyment, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the tiniest bit funny. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny.<br /><br />I consider Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles\" to be on the short list for Funniest Movie Ever. It still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the Least Funny Movie Ever.<br /><br />In short: if you're feeling too happy, give this movie a whirl; otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.","finished_norm":["whenev","i","make","up","a","list","of","the","absolut","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","thi","movi","be","alwai","on","it","it","have","no","redeem","qualiti","whatsoev","it","take","a","act","of","will","to","sit","through","the","whole","thing","and","i","would","soon","spill","my","own","blood","than","have","to","sit","through","it","againbr","br","what","wrong","with","it","let","me","tell","you","the","stori","of","my","trip","to","go","see","it","in","the","theaterbr","br","i","go","to","a","midnight","show","on","a","saturdai","night","i","the","onli","on","in","the","theater","be","myself","and","a","bunch","of","loud","boister","rather","unruli","teenag","sit","somewher","behind","me","thei","be","obvious","out","have","a","good","time","on","a","saturdai","night","and","have","come","to","thi","comedi","for","some","laugh","befor","the","movi","start","dure","the","preview","thei","be","laugh","and","joke","and","make","loud","comment","have","a","grand","old","time","it","be","borderlin","annoi","have","thei","continu","their","unbridl","enthusiasm","into","the","actual","movi","i","mai","have","sai","someth","but","i","be","feel","toler","and","empathet","of","their","spirit","fun","so","i","let","it","go","and","thei","do","settl","down","onc","the","movi","startedbr","br","why","be","i","tell","you","all","thi","becaus","you","can","judg","thi","alleg","comedi","by","the","effect","it","have","not","just","on","myself","but","on","thi","rowdi","bunchbr","br","dure","the","entir","run","of","the","film","not","on","person","in","the","theater","laugh","not","onc","not","myself","not","the","boister","kid","absolut","silenc","asid","from","the","soundtrack","and","when","the","film","be","over","and","the","light","come","on","we","all","all","of","u","slowli","file","out","of","the","theater","in","slow","somber","absolut","silenc","it","can","have","be","a","funeralbr","br","thi","be","the","effect","that","thi","comedi","produc","not","laughter","not","enjoy","but","absolut","depress","it","be","a","depress","depress","movi","and","not","the","tini","bite","funni","preachi","selfindulg","depress","but","not","funnybr","br","i","consid","mel","brook","blaze","saddl","to","be","on","the","short","list","for","funni","movi","ever","it","still","absolut","blow","my","mind","that","the","same","gentleman","can","be","respons","for","quit","probabl","the","littl","funni","movi","everbr","br","in","short","if","you","re","feel","too","happi","give","thi","movi","a","whirl","otherwis","do","not","sai","i","do","not","warn","you"],"filtered":["whenev","make","list","absolut","wrong","movi","ever","see","thi","movi","alwai","redeem","qualiti","whatsoev","take","act","sit","whole","thing","soon","spill","blood","sit","againbr","br","wrong","let","tell","stori","trip","go","see","theaterbr","br","go","midnight","show","saturdai","night","onli","theater","bunch","loud","boister","rather","unruli","teenag","sit","somewher","behind","thei","obvious","good","time","saturdai","night","come","thi","comedi","laugh","befor","movi","start","dure","preview","thei","laugh","joke","make","loud","comment","grand","old","time","borderlin","annoi","thei","continu","unbridl","enthusiasm","actual","movi","mai","sai","someth","feel","toler","empathet","spirit","fun","let","go","thei","settl","onc","movi","startedbr","br","tell","thi","becaus","judg","thi","alleg","comedi","effect","thi","rowdi","bunchbr","br","dure","entir","run","film","person","theater","laugh","onc","boister","kid","absolut","silenc","asid","soundtrack","film","light","come","u","slowli","file","theater","slow","somber","absolut","silenc","funeralbr","br","thi","effect","thi","comedi","produc","laughter","enjoy","absolut","depress","depress","depress","movi","tini","bite","funni","preachi","selfindulg","depress","funnybr","br","consid","mel","brook","blaze","saddl","short","list","funni","movi","ever","still","absolut","blow","mind","gentleman","respons","quit","probabl","littl","funni","movi","everbr","br","short","re","feel","happi","give","thi","movi","whirl","otherwis","sai","warn"],"filtered2":["whenev","make","list","absolut","wrong","ever","see","alwai","redeem","qualiti","whatsoev","take","act","sit","whole","thing","soon","spill","blood","sit","againbr","wrong","let","tell","stori","trip","go","see","theaterbr","go","midnight","show","saturdai","night","onli","theater","bunch","loud","boister","rather","unruli","teenag","sit","somewher","behind","obvious","good","time","saturdai","night","come","comedi","laugh","befor","start","dure","preview","laugh","joke","make","loud","comment","grand","old","time","borderlin","annoi","continu","unbridl","enthusiasm","actual","mai","someth","feel","toler","empathet","spirit","fun","let","go","settl","onc","startedbr","tell","becaus","judg","alleg","comedi","effect","rowdi","bunchbr","dure","entir","run","person","theater","laugh","onc","boister","kid","absolut","silenc","as

{"value":"Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has. The movie is pretentious garbage. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable.<br /><br />Now that I've got my distress out of my system, I am more able to analyse the movie: <br /><br />* From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English. The director, of course, did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true.<br /><br />* Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. I'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. I felt that the surrealism was lost.<br /><br />* The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve either of the two.<br /><br />* The names chosen for the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. However, since the film wasn't meant for Indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd.<br /><br />* The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.<br /><br />* The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role, the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. The male leads were outright rubbish.<br /><br />In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director, stay away from this one.

{"value":"The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating film to watch. Infuriatingly enigmatic, it treats each shot like a work of art. You get the impression that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a degree of exquisite care that borders on obsession; Expressing how far cinema has progressed since the very first films were cranked out in the nineteenth century and mimicking their construction, the camera here hardly ever moves  apart from during the camp and colourful musical numbers. Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and barely a word is spoken. This curious but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli alone so that, even as the story progresses at a snail-like pace we feel ourselves becoming immersed. Unfortunately, for me at least, this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour mark. I began to feel as if the film was challenging me to keep watching while becoming more difficult as the minutes dragged so that the mere act of watching became a battle of wills.<br /><br />Had the content of this film not been as sexual as it is it would no doubt been even more obscure to Western audiences. As it is, there's an abundance of female nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious (or possibly dead) woman that is so repugnant that, while it may speak volumes about the degradation to which pornography subjects both men and women (the users and the used) it is so over-zealous in the manner in which it chooses to make its point as to effectively render it ineffective. Of course the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in available pornographic content will seek this film out for all the wrong reasons and watch it with their sticky finger on the fast-forward button of the remote.<br /><br />For all its problems, the film is definitely a stayer, and the more you think about it the more sense certain aspects of it seem to make. Ironically, for a film in which so little happens, the viewer would probably be proportionately rewarded by watching a second or even third time.

{"value":"I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I had seen Jacquet's previous movie (march of the penguins) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio. However, I was severely disappointed. Most of all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like \"well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then there's an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies\" and so on. After about half an hour I began sighing, yawning, rolling my eyes, cursing the reviewer at the radio station, and hoping that it would be over soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the movie are (a) The girl, who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie (one year), and shows exactly two facial expressions: Joy and Seriousness. She is cute, no question about that. However, a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all-too-human presence. I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear, drown in the river, or something similarly terrible. (b) The commentary by the girl's adult voice, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, redundant things. (c) The music, which is desperately lacking subtlety. When the girl is happily jumping around, the music jumps around, too. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music becomes threatening, too. It reminded me of the very early days of film-making, and was just too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly, many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it, at least they got somehow involved. Thus, my warning concerns adults only: If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other

{"value":"This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it. She wasn't. I'm a gal, I watched this film with two guys, and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was.<br /><br />WARNING: PLOT SUMMARY BELOW! RAMPANT SPOILERS!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out, and sure enough, she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy girlfriend, aided by the wishy-washy one, sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her. It works. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck (Remember the movie's title?) So now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the film. And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls, she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant.<br /><br />She's already broken off relations with her girlfriends, because they were so unsupportive. Alone and pitiful, she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy (nice, huh?), but now she tells him she'll marry him, and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion. But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home, where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed. She has the kid. In the final scene, they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be smug. I kid you not, it's that bad. I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy's ridiculous lesbian moment.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","choppi","incoher","and","contriv","it","be","conjur","a","extrem","meanspirit","portray","of","woman","i","rent","it","becaus","it","be","list","a","a","comedi","that","a","stretch","and","becaus","the","cover","sai","andi","mcdowel","be","act","up","a","storm","in","it","she","be","not","i","be","a","gal","i","watch","thi","film","with","two","gui","and","we","spend","a","hour","afterward","exclaim","over","how","bad","it","wasbr","br","warn","plot","summari","below","rampant","spoilersbr","br","the","movi","start","out","with","a","fairli","hacknei","plot","about","a","old","woman","who","take","up","with","a","young","man","to","the","sever","disapprov","of","her","two","jealou","singl","girlfriend","thei","want","her","to","marri","a","bore","gui","their","own","ag","who","be","kind","of","in","love","with","her","but","she","so","happi","with","her","oversex","puppi","that","you","re","root","for","them","to","stick","it","out","and","sure","enough","she","decid","to","marri","the","gui","but","her","harpi","girlfriend","aid","by","the","wishywashi","on","set","up","a","plot","to","trick","our","heroin","into","think","the","gui","be","cheat","on","her","it","work","she","have","a","fight","with","him","he","run","out","of","the","hous","and","be","crush","by","a","truck","rememb","the","movi","titl","so","now","he","dead","twothird","of","the","wai","through","the","film","and","although","our","heroin","be","a","school","headmistress","who","spend","her","time","watch","over","girl","she","appar","forget","to","us","birth","control","and","be","pregnantbr","br","she","alreadi","break","off","relat","with","her","girlfriend","becaus","thei","be","so","unsupport","alon","and","piti","she","decid","to","marri","the","bore","gui","do","i","mention","that","the","bore","gui","who","kind","of","love","her","be","a","minist","she","have","ask","him","to","marri","her","to","the","young","gui","nice","huh","but","now","she","tell","him","she","will","marri","him","and","appar","he","have","no","object","to","be","dick","around","in","thi","fashion","but","her","girlfriend","rescu","her","at","the","altar","and","take","her","home","where","thei","notquiteconfess","that","thei","be","mostli","respons","for","the","love","of","her","life","get","smush","she","have","the","kid","in","the","final","scene","thei","leav","it","in","a","crib","insid","her","hous","while","thei","go","out","on","the","porch","to","drink","smoke","and","be","smug","i","kid","you","not","it","that","bad","i","leav","out","the","part","about","the","cancer","redher","and","the","harpi","ridicul","lesbian","moment"],"filtered":["thi","film","choppi","incoher","contriv","conjur","extrem","meanspirit","portray","woman","rent","becaus","list","comedi","stretch","becaus","cover","sai","andi","mcdowel","act","storm","gal","watch","thi","film","two","gui","spend","hour","afterward","exclaim","bad","wasbr","br","warn","plot","summari","rampant","spoilersbr","br","movi","start","fairli","hacknei","plot","old","woman","take","young","man","sever","disapprov","two","jealou","singl","girlfriend","thei","want","marri","bore","gui","ag","kind","love","happi","oversex","puppi","re","root","stick","sure","enough","decid","marri","gui","harpi","girlfriend","aid","wishywashi","set","plot","trick","heroin","think","gui","cheat","work","fight","run","hous","crush","truck","rememb","movi","titl","dead","twothird","wai","film","although","heroin","school","headmistress","spend","time","watch","girl","appar","forget","us","birth","control","pregnantbr","br","alreadi","break","relat","girlfriend","becaus","thei","unsupport","alon","piti","decid","marri","bore","gui","mention","bore","gui","kind","love","minist","ask","marri","young","gui","nice","huh","tell","marri","appar","object","dick","around","thi","fashion","girlfriend","rescu","altar","take","home","thei","notquiteconfess","thei","mostli","respons","love","life","get","smush","kid","final","scene","thei","leav","crib","insid","hous","thei","go","porch","drink","smoke","smug","kid","bad","leav","part","cancer","redher","harpi","ridicul","lesbian","moment"],"filtered2":["choppi","incoher","contriv","conjur","extrem","meanspirit","portray","woman","rent","becaus","list","comedi","stretch","becaus","cover","andi","mcdowel","act","storm","gal","watch","two","gui","spend","hour","afterward","exclaim","bad","wasbr","warn","plot","summari","rampant","spoilersbr","start","fairli","hacknei","plot","old","woman","take","young","man","sever","disapprov","two","jealou","singl","girlfriend","want","marri","bore","gui","ag","kind","love","happi","oversex","puppi","re","root","stick","sure","enough","decid","marri","gui","harpi","girlfriend","aid","wishywashi","set","plot","trick","heroin","think","gui","cheat","work","fight","run","hous","crush","truck","rememb","titl","dead","twothird","wai","although","heroin","school","headmistress","spend","time","watch","girl","appar

{"value":"Two years ago, on Berlin Film Festival we watched the Amos Kollek movie \"Sue\" in the Panorama program, with a wonderful Anna Thomson in the leading part. It's a film about loneliness and sex, and how the one thing is compensated by the other. In the same section on the Festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of Sue, \"Extension du domaine de la lutte\", which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having NO sex is one and the same problem. But unfortunately we can't sympathize with \"our hero\" (how he is called by the story-teller), because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself. Own fault, I'm sorry. I can't understand him. Not enough, the writer/director/actor want us admitting to him, that it's not his destroyed self-consciousness or the passivity of his personality, what brought him so far, but the rotten society and its image of sexuality. Yes, there are some deeper insights about gender relations, but we won't follow him so far... And the point is, that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate, having no sex. Who didn't notice yet, it's a quite depressing film...<br /><br />In the beginning, there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation. At the bed store the \"hero\" speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed. Perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs, you have to stay at home half a day... THIS is a satire about a character, who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands, DOING something... The movie doesn`t follow this path, but handles his characters with helplessness. Nobody believes, that \"our hero\" is able to instigate Tisserand for a murder. Too dull, too kind, too - passive (not to mention Tisserand's complex; he has an inhibition, but he couldn't be, of course, a murderer of women!). To finish: There are women and the world, it's not a device of a modern sexualized society. Help you as you can, but don't follow the messages and the \"wisdom\" of this movie, which announces bankruptcy to human relationships, without seizing the real conflicts

{"value":"Veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge string of films includes both the utterly forgettable and the recurrently shown (for example, John Wayne in \"Sands of Iwo Jima\") tried his hand at a big musical with \"I Dream of Jeanie.\" Harnessing a lead cast of singers with little past film experience and, as it turned out, virtually no future, he spun a fictional and in no small part offensive story about the great American songwriter, Stephen Foster.<br /><br />Bill Shirley is the young, lovestruck Foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy. His intended is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence) whose pesky younger sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), is slowly realizing she's in love with the nearly impecunious song-smith. Foster is in love with Inez who is revolted by the composer's Number 1 on the Levee Hit Parade Tune, \"O Susannah.\" Enter minstrel Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profit-making phase of Foster's career.<br /><br />This is, by the musical-film standards of the early Fifties, a big production. The sets are lavish in that special Hollywood way that portrayed fakes with all the trimmings. The singers aren't half bad and the Foster songs are almost impossible to ruin.<br /><br />But this is also a literal whitewash of the antebellum South. The biggest number features black-face for all on stage, an historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of unthinking racism. Were these portrayals of blacks anywhere near reality, the abolitionists would be rightly condemned for interfering with so beneficent an institution.<br /><br />\"I Dream of Jeanie\" apparently sank into the studio's vault with barely a death whisper. Now revived by Alpha Video for a mere $4.99 it's a period piece with charming songs and repulsive sentimentalizing about the victims of America's great crime, slavery.<br /><br />This was what Hollywood was putting out two years before Brown v.

{"value":"...at least during its first half. If it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter film. The second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships, but it's like a dull toothache getting there. Also, don't watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role, but it's a small one.<br /><br />The film starts out showing three New York City buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers), a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. World War I breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle, yet enlist in the navy anyways. The one of the three with the least industry as a civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) winds up the commanding officer to the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make matters more complex, Sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.<br /><br />The film is a little more interesting on board ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. However, James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby, especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.<br /><br />One real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design, or, I should say, the lack of it. In the scenes in New York just prior to WWI we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you've seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.","finished_norm":["at","littl","dure","it","half","if","it","have","start","out","with","the","three","buddi","in","the","navi","and","concentr","on","the","naval","action","scene","it","would","have","be","a","much","well","and","tight","film","the","half","of","the","film","be","worth","it","especi","for","the","action","sequenc","and","close","up","shot","of","earli","th","centuri","ship","but","it","like","a","dull","toothach","get","there","conjur","do","not","watch","thi","film","just","becaus","ginger","roger","be","in","it","she","have","a","import","role","but","it","a","small","onebr","br","the","film","start","out","show","three","new","york","citi","buddi","work","the","tourist","trade","and","conjur","in","goodnatur","competit","for","the","hand","of","salli","ginger","roger","a","sing","candi","salesgirl","along","the","avenu","world","war","i","break","out","the","three","buddi","seem","complet","indiffer","to","the","struggl","yet","enlist","in","the","navi","anywai","the","on","of","the","three","with","the","littl","industri","a","a","civilian","bill","boyd","a","baltimor","wind","up","the","command","offic","to","the","other","two","robert","armstrong","a","dutch","and","jame","gleason","a","skeet","to","make","matter","much","complex","salli","have","fall","in","love","with","on","of","the","three","but","doe","not","have","the","chanc","to","tell","him","befor","the","three","sail","off","to","warbr","br","the","film","be","a","littl","much","interest","on","board","ship","mainli","becaus","of","the","close","shot","we","have","of","the","ship","itself","and","conjur","becaus","the","chemistri","among","the","three","buddi","be","believ","howev","jame","gleason","at","ag","look","a","bite","long","in","the","tooth","to","be","a","swabbi","especi","when","the","sign","at","the","enlist","offic","sai","you","have","to","be","between","and","to","be","eligiblebr","br","on","real","obviou","flaw","in","the","film","that","make","me","believ","that","everyth","outsid","the","naval","scene","be","slap","togeth","with","minimum","care","be","the","costum","design","or","i","should","sai","the","lack","of","it","in","the","scene","in","new","york","just","prior","to","wwi","we","have","everyon","dress","in","the","fashion","of","and","everyon","drive","the","car","of","no","effort","be","take","to","bring","thi","film","into","periodbr","br","in","conclus","if","you","watch","the","few","scene","with","ginger","roger","in","them","and","the","last","minut","involv","the","naval","suicid","mission","you","have","see","everyth","here","worth","see","the","rest","be","pad"],"filtered":["littl","dure","half","start","three","buddi","navi","concentr","naval","action","scene","much","well","tight","film","half","film","worth","especi","action","sequenc","close","shot","earli","th","centuri","ship","like","dull","toothach","get","conjur","watch","thi","film","becaus","ginger","roger","import","role","small","onebr","br","film","start","show","three","new","york","citi","buddi","work","tourist","trade","conjur","goodnatur","competit","hand","salli","ginger","roger","sing","candi","salesgirl","along","avenu","world","war","break","three","buddi","seem","complet","indiffer","struggl","yet","enlist","navi","anywai","three","littl","industri","civilian","bill","boyd","baltimor","wind","command","offic","two","robert","armstrong","dutch","jame","gleason","skeet","make","matter","much","complex","salli","fall","love","three","doe","chanc","tell","befor","three","sail","warbr","br","film","littl","much","interest","board","ship","mainli","becaus","close","shot","ship","conjur","becaus","chemistri","among","three","buddi","believ","howev","jame","gleason","ag","look","bite","long","tooth","swabbi","especi","sign","enlist","offic","sai","eligiblebr","br","real","obviou","flaw","film","make","believ","everyth","outsid","naval","scene","slap","togeth","minimum","care","costum","design","sai","lack","scene","new","york","prior","wwi","everyon","dress","fashion","everyon","drive","car","effort","take","bring","thi","film","periodbr","br","conclus","watch","scene","ginger","roger","last","minut","involv","naval","suicid","mission","see","everyth","worth","see","rest","pad"],"filtered2":["littl","dure","half","start","three","buddi","navi","concentr","naval","action","scene","well","tight","half","worth","especi","action","sequenc","close","shot","earli","th","centuri","ship","like","dull","toothach","get","conjur","watch","becaus","ginger","roger","import","role","small","onebr","start","show","three","new","york","citi","buddi","work","tourist","trade","conjur","goodnatur","competit","hand","salli","ginger","roger","sing","candi","salesgirl","along","avenu","world","war","break","three","buddi","seem","complet","indiffer","struggl","yet","enlist","navi","anywai","three","littl","industri","civilian","bill","boyd","baltimor","wind","command","offic","two","robert","armstrong","dutch","jame","gleason","skeet

{"value":"I saw this film in its premier week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at that time I found it adequate and somewhat fun. I then came to discover the WORLD of Doc Savage through the Bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories. I had no idea before any of this of the realm of Doc, but I fast became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I read (and still own) all of the Bantam books, I started going to comic book cons (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all manner of geeky fat kid events) and had a wonderful time with each adventure I took with Doc and the ORIGINAL Fab 5. Philip Jose Farmer's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day I have very fond feelings regarding my Doc phase. In so saying I have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat. It is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up. The screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story. These stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at Lester Dent's (AKA Kenneth Robeson) outline for writing them, they broke down into PERFECT 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment. One would have thought that with George Pal and Michael Anderson at the helm, it would have turned out better. The spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there, but then fall short. It is interesting to watch though in that they hired second-string character actors (guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film) who all acquit themselves very well. Paul Gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest have fallen off the map sadly. I do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero, but I fear I will not watch it much as it is too painful. I would say 0 but I give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction (Doc's answering machine at the end was a nice touch) and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the

{"value":"First this movie was not that bad.It was entertaining...at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons. I have never seen the original so can't compare the two.<br /><br />This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned. THe two movies have different plots, but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both.<br /><br />The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery/thriller/men please don't anger the women movie. I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders. <br /><br />Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world. Stupid.<br /><br />Things get weirder when the large Amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time. Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.<br /><br />In this movie males do not fare so well. A sick twisted display of feminism? <br /><br />I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","not","that","badit","be","entertainingat","littl","to","me","for","probabl","all","the","wrong","reason","i","have","never","see","the","origin","so","ca","not","compar","the","twobr","br","thi","movi","remind","me","of","that","weird","christoph","reev","movi","villag","of","the","damn","the","two","movi","have","differ","plot","but","that","creepi","disgust","feel","and","unwant","comedi","exist","in","bothbr","br","the","wicker","man","be","suppos","to","be","a","mysterythrillermen","pleas","do","not","anger","the","woman","movi","i","do","not","know","the","whole","pagan","thing","and","sacrific","be","a","littl","offbr","br","nichola","cage","hi","gloriou","bad","self","go","to","a","seclud","island","call","summerisl","when","he","receiv","a","letter","in","calligraphi","from","hi","long","lose","fiancé","who","claim","her","daughter","have","be","take","and","hide","by","fellow","island","br","br","cage","be","a","polic","offic","and","be","the","weari","policeman","he","be","he","go","to","the","semi","unchart","island","leav","no","word","of","hi","whereabout","to","anyon","who","be","locat","in","the","real","world","stupidbr","br","thing","get","weird","when","the","larg","amishesquir","woman","who","popul","the","island","snarl","at","him","and","lie","about","the","whereabout","of","the","miss","girl","hi","fiancé","be","no","help","who","seem","to","be","elus","and","weari","the","whole","time","cage","stai","on","the","island","when","he","learn","that","the","miss","girl","be","hi","daughter","and","he","be","the","lucki","man","trick","to","come","to","thi","island","a","a","sacrifici","victim","dure","the","island","sick","harvest","festivalbr","br","in","thi","movi","male","do","not","fare","so","good","a","sick","twist","displai","of","femin","br","br","i","find","the","movi","laughabl","at","time","particularli","when","cage","punch","some","woman","and","run","around","in","a","bear","suit","i","think","there","be","too","mani","pothol","in","thi","movi","i","find","the","whole","concept","of","angri","woman","seclud","themselv","on","a","island","without","ani","care","for","male","quit","entertain","but","the","wai","it","be","portrai","in","thi","movi","be","just","weird","while","much","woman","have","have","some","jerk","hurt","and","anger","them","thi","be","clearli","a","form","of","sexism","i","would","have","turn","the","movi","off","in","disgust","if","the","role","be","revers","thi","movi","be","someth","to","watch","mayb","just","onc","or","twice","it","be","not","a","thriller","it","should","be","categor","a","just","strang"],"filtered":["thi","movi","badit","entertainingat","littl","probabl","wrong","reason","never","see","origin","ca","compar","twobr","br","thi","movi","remind","weird","christoph","reev","movi","villag","damn","two","movi","differ","plot","creepi","disgust","feel","unwant","comedi","exist","bothbr","br","wicker","man","suppos","mysterythrillermen","pleas","anger","woman","movi","know","whole","pagan","thing","sacrific","littl","offbr","br","nichola","cage","hi","gloriou","bad","self","go","seclud","island","call","summerisl","receiv","letter","calligraphi","hi","long","lose","fiancé","claim","daughter","take","hide","fellow","island","br","br","cage","polic","offic","weari","policeman","go","semi","unchart","island","leav","word","hi","whereabout","anyon","locat","real","world","stupidbr","br","thing","get","weird","larg","amishesquir","woman","popul","island","snarl","lie","whereabout","miss","girl","hi","fiancé","help","seem","elus","weari","whole","time","cage","stai","island","learn","miss","girl","hi","daughter","lucki","man","trick","come","thi","island","sacrifici","victim","dure","island","sick","harvest","festivalbr","br","thi","movi","male","fare","good","sick","twist","displai","femin","br","br","find","movi","laughabl","time","particularli","cage","punch","woman","run","around","bear","suit","think","mani","pothol","thi","movi","find","whole","concept","angri","woman","seclud","themselv","island","without","ani","care","male","quit","entertain","wai","portrai","thi","movi","weird","much","woman","jerk","hurt","anger","thi","clearli","form","sexism","turn","movi","disgust","role","revers","thi","movi","someth","watch","mayb","onc","twice","thriller","categor","strang"],"filtered2":["badit","entertainingat","littl","probabl","wrong","reason","never","see","origin","ca","compar","twobr","remind","weird","christoph","reev","villag","damn","two","differ","plot","creepi","disgust","feel","unwant","comedi","exist","bothbr","wicker","man","suppos","mysterythrillermen","pleas","anger","woman","know","whole","pagan","thing","sacrific","littl","offbr","nichola","cage","gloriou","bad","self","go","seclud","island","call","summerisl","receiv","letter","calligraphi","long","lose","fiancé","claim","daughter","take","hide","fellow","island","cage","polic","offic","weari","policeman","go","semi","unchart","island"

{"value":"OK, here it is: \"Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama.\" What we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between French, German, American, and British for over 2 hours. Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. But just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of Lhasa in 1943, speak perfect English, also with dubious accents. Of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west. In return, our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague, undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion. We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go. And last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans (which is certainly true), thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a \"political\" movie, even though it is nothing of the sort. So, zat ist my idea. Vat do you zink? Can ve make zis

{"value":"** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** <br /><br />The truly exquisite Sean Young (who in some scenes, with her hair poofed up, looks something like Elizabeth Taylor) is striking in her opening moments in this film. Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust, her face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, once the bust is over Young's strained demeanor never changes. This is one fatally inhibited actress.<br /><br />One has only to compare Young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to grasp what is missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional, and at ease at all times...in that there's no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, acts in the skittish, self-conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film. Basically, she doesn't have a clue.<br /><br />With this major void looming at the center of the movie, we're left to ponder the implausiblities of the story. For instance, after Miss Young is kidnapped by the criminal she's trailing and locked in a closet, she breaks the door down when left alone. Granted, she's dressed only in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psycho captor due to return any moment, would you head for the door...or take the time to go through his dresser, take out some clothes and get dressed? I would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions Miss Young's character is experiencing, but Young can not convey this type of complexity.<br /><br />There are a few affecting moments in the film, such as the short police interviews with the criminal's past victims, but overall this is an aimless endeavor. It's too bad Miss Young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching. Watching Miss Young try to act, at least in this \"thriller\", is a sad spectacle.","finished_norm":["contain","spoiler","br","br","the","truli","exquisit","sean","young","who","in","some","scene","with","her","hair","poof","up","look","someth","like","elizabeth","taylor","be","strike","in","her","open","moment","in","thi","film","sit","in","the","back","of","a","polic","car","wait","to","signal","a","bust","her","face","and","bodi","be","tens","and","distract","unfortun","onc","the","bust","be","over","young","strain","demeanor","never","chang","thi","be","on","fatal","inhibit","actressbr","br","on","have","onli","to","compar","young","to","the","perform","plai","her","cowork","and","well","friend","arnetia","walker","to","grasp","what","be","miss","in","young","walker","be","open","emot","and","at","eas","at","all","timesin","that","there","no","appar","barrier","between","what","she","mai","be","feel","and","her","express","of","it","she","be","a","open","book","young","on","the","other","hand","act","in","the","skittish","selfconsci","wai","you","mai","expect","your","neighbor","to","act","be","thei","suddenli","throw","into","star","in","a","film","basic","she","doe","not","have","a","cluebr","br","with","thi","major","void","loom","at","the","center","of","the","movi","we","re","leav","to","ponder","the","implausibl","of","the","stori","for","instanc","after","miss","young","be","kidnap","by","the","crimin","she","trail","and","lock","in","a","closet","she","break","the","door","down","when","leav","alon","grant","she","dress","onli","in","a","bra","and","panti","but","in","a","similar","situat","with","a","psycho","captor","due","to","return","ani","moment","would","you","head","for","the","dooror","take","the","time","to","go","through","hi","dresser","take","out","some","cloth","and","get","dress","i","would","guess","that","thi","and","other","scene","be","try","to","suggest","some","sort","of","mix","emot","miss","young","charact","be","experi","but","young","can","not","convei","thi","typ","of","complexitybr","br","there","be","a","few","affect","moment","in","the","film","such","a","the","short","polic","interview","with","the","crimin","past","victim","but","overal","thi","be","a","aimless","endeavor","it","too","bad","miss","young","be","replac","while","film","the","pair","of","comic","book","styl","film","that","mai","have","exploit","her","limit","with","some","humor","batman","and","dick","traci","becaus","her","flounder","while","attempt","to","plai","actual","peopl","be","oddli","touch","watch","miss","young","try","to","act","at","littl","in","thi","thriller","be","a","sad","spectacl"],"filtered":["contain","spoiler","br","br","truli","exquisit","sean","young","scene","hair","poof","look","someth","like","elizabeth","taylor","strike","open","moment","thi","film","sit","back","polic","car","wait","signal","bust","face","bodi","tens","distract","unfortun","onc","bust","young","strain","demeanor","never","chang","thi","fatal","inhibit","actressbr","br","onli","compar","young","perform","plai","cowork","well","friend","arnetia","walker","grasp","miss","young","walker","open","emot","eas","timesin","appar","barrier","mai","feel","express","open","book","young","hand","act","skittish","selfconsci","wai","mai","expect","neighbor","act","thei","suddenli","throw","star","film","basic","doe","cluebr","br","thi","major","void","loom","center","movi","re","leav","ponder","implausibl","stori","instanc","miss","young","kidnap","crimin","trail","lock","closet","break","door","leav","alon","grant","dress","onli","bra","panti","similar","situat","psycho","captor","due","return","ani","moment","head","dooror","take","time","go","hi","dresser","take","cloth","get","dress","guess","thi","scene","try","suggest","sort","mix","emot","miss","young","charact","experi","young","convei","thi","typ","complexitybr","br","affect","moment","film","short","polic","interview","crimin","past","victim","overal","thi","aimless","endeavor","bad","miss","young","replac","film","pair","comic","book","styl","film","mai","exploit","limit","humor","batman","dick","traci","becaus","flounder","attempt","plai","actual","peopl","oddli","touch","watch","miss","young","try","act","littl","thi","thriller","sad","spectacl"],"filtered2":["contain","spoiler","truli","exquisit","sean","young","scene","hair","poof","look","someth","like","elizabeth","taylor","strike","open","moment","sit","back","polic","car","wait","signal","bust","face","bodi","tens","distract","unfortun","onc","bust","young","strain","demeanor","never","chang","fatal","inhibit","actressbr","onli","compar","young","perform","plai","cowork","well","friend","arnetia","walker","grasp","miss","young","walker","open","emot","eas","timesin","appar","barrier","mai","feel","express","open","book","young","hand","act","skittish","selfconsci","wai","mai","expect","neighbor","act","suddenli","throw","star","basic","doe","cluebr","major","void","loom","center","re","leav","ponder","implausibl","stori","instanc","miss","young","kidnap","crimin","trail",

{"value":"Movie: There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie. Its truly awful. Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it, it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick. Characters/Actors: Denzel has done \"EXACTLY\" what he does in every movie, so no surprise there. Here is a little mind game for the readers. Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies. Now count how many of them were in which he played a cop/detective/body guard, whatever. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. His best performance was I think in \"Beyond Borders\". Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well. His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in \"Sin City\". Surely this guy knows acting, what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles. He is in desperate need of a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life. She has done better. She has had better roles. It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie. Plot: Plot was not confusing, in fact, I could think of such a plot, in fact the whole movie, while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner. I mean come on, ****SPOILER ON THE WAY----> I am sick of the un-necessary Haulocast and the Racism token. The movie is about bank robbers, why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there, nice try playing with people's emotions, worked on anyone? NOT ME. Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages? Riiiiiiight, please, we're talking about US police force and security here. Nobody could find out where Clive was, I mean they didn't find anything different with that room. Who're we kidding? Conclusion: Sure, go watch this movie, if nothing, you'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was. At least people won't think you're stupid to go watch this movie because they'd think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast

{"value":"This esteemed production has it's fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'Mary Reilly,' Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower.<br /><br />This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie \"production\" are never to make a great film, rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized, undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness. As viewers & critics are apt to fall for this, Oscars follow, feeding the whole dumb equation.<br /><br />I don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolving. Actors dutifully recite essays about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick... all things that can't respond, and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest. It's dramatically inert. It doesn't build. In narrative terms Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. After half an hour I was muttering \"Oh terrific... another oath ...another 4 minute soliloquy!\"<br /><br />In the failed effort to involve you, it's a pretty campy overacting showcase. A lot of grey hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!)<br /><br />One knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings & palette, or reverently embalming a classic as Huston does here. Paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums. A movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture. This is the Eat Your Vegetables school of film-making.<br /><br />One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the narrative. Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. And that doesn't call for a two-plus hour

{"value":"Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching, you better skip this one. I watched this one on television, so I didn't have to plunk down cash for it. Lucky me.<br /><br />The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable, it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end. It is highly questionable, if a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters would disobey direct orders. And even if he would, if the rest of his platoon would. They know he puts them in direct danger, and they know they will certainly die if they follow him, but what the heck, he is our Lt. so let's do what he says (despite the direct orders, remember).<br /><br />Still, there are some nice scenes in this movie. They somewhat save a village, where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers or so, the rest was already killed. The strange part of it, that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for it. Anyway. I think this was what earned the movie the one point I gave it.<br /><br />What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves. Only near the end they loose a few comrades. And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe that?<br /><br />They fight of an army of so many, kill hundreds of them, and only loose a few of themselves. And they have rounds and round of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around or what? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. Really? Who think up this crap.<br /><br />I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this one.

{"value":"Ouch, what a painfully BORING Sci-Fi movie! And that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! During the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files. As he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed. Figures From then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing. More like dull, pointless and vague. Scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway. They all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed; yet I fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device. Perhaps I missed something, but I doubt it. The interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities. So basically, \"The Brain Machine\" just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room. The film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a THOUSAND stagnant shots of buildings! The relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated EVERY SINGLE TIME by a five-second shot of the places. Either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all Sci-Fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves. Staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying, I assure you. James Best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent, but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time.

{"value":"I happened to spot this flick on the shelf under \"new releases\" and found the idea of a hip-hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up. That's how it was billed on the box, anyhow, and I thought to myself, \"What a great idea!\" Plus there's a \"Welcome to Oakland\" sign on the cover, too. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme. Neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture had much of a role in the movie. Having lived in Oakland myself, I know that there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there, so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack. Any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick. Why the Quiroz Brothers didn't take advantage of this is beyond me.<br /><br />Once the film got rolling, it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and Latino. You might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie... but it didn't. Somehow, the Quiroz Brothers vision of \"urban culture\" boils down to drive-by shootings and dropping an F-bomb in every line in the movie. The rapid-fire use of the word \"fuck\" is probably this movie's most distinguishing characteristics; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line didn't contain it at least once. I'm not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie, but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers (also the Quiroz Brothers), and the script was generally very poor.<br /><br />The film was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a genuinely \"urban culture\" zombie flick, but \"Hood of the Living Dead\" doesn't deliver on that count. The characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else. There was no distinct flavor to the movie. It's just another run-of-the-mill low budget flick with bad acting, lousy writing, amateurish direction, bland cinematography, a cheap soundtrack, and nothing at all to recommend it.","finished_norm":["i","happen","to","spot","thi","flick","on","the","shelf","under","new","releas","and","find","the","idea","of","a","hiphop","zombi","flick","far","too","interest","to","pass","up","that","how","it","be","bill","on","the","box","anyhow","and","i","think","to","myself","what","a","great","idea","plu","there","a","welcom","to","oakland","sign","on","the","cover","too","how","can","i","resist","unfortun","the","hiphop","part","onli","last","for","a","long","a","the","open","theme","neither","hiphop","music","nor","hiphop","cultur","have","much","of","a","role","in","the","movi","have","live","in","oakland","myself","i","know","that","there","be","mani","aspir","hiphop","artist","there","so","the","low","budget","of","thi","flick","be","no","excus","not","to","have","a","fit","soundtrack","ani","numb","of","struggl","artist","would","have","jump","on","the","opportun","to","contribut","to","thi","flick","why","the","quiroz","brother","do","not","take","advantag","of","thi","be","beyond","mebr","br","onc","the","film","get","roll","it","be","a","complet","typic","zombi","movi","with","a","cast","that","just","so","happen","to","be","complet","black","and","latino","you","mai","think","that","thi","would","put","a","unusu","slant","on","the","movi","but","it","do","not","somehow","the","quiroz","brother","vision","of","urban","cultur","boil","down","to","drivebi","shoot","and","drop","a","fbomb","in","everi","line","in","the","movi","the","rapidfir","us","of","the","word","fuck","be","probabl","thi","movi","much","distinguish","characterist","there","be","singl","line","that","contain","the","word","three","or","four","time","and","no","line","do","not","contain","it","at","littl","onc","i","be","not","at","all","squeamish","about","swear","in","a","movi","but","the","feel","here","be","that","it","be","the","result","of","a","lack","of","idea","on","the","part","of","the","writer","conjur","the","quiroz","brother","and","the","script","be","gener","veri","poorbr","br","the","film","be","gener","a","disappoint","it","would","have","be","interest","to","see","a","genuin","urban","cultur","zombi","flick","but","hood","of","the","live","dead","doe","not","deliv","on","that","count","the","charact","in","the","movi","can","just","a","easili","have","be","white","or","eskimo","or","anyth","els","there","be","no","distinct","flavor","to","the","movi","it","just","anoth","runofthemil","low","budget","flick","with","bad","act","lousi","write","amateurish","direct","bland","cinematographi","a","cheap","soundtrack","and","noth","at","all","to","recommend","it"],"filtered":["happen","spot","thi","flick","shelf","new","releas","find","idea","hiphop","zombi","flick","far","interest","pass","bill","box","anyhow","think","great","idea","plu","welcom","oakland","sign","cover","resist","unfortun","hiphop","part","onli","last","long","open","theme","neither","hiphop","music","hiphop","cultur","much","role","movi","live","oakland","know","mani","aspir","hiphop","artist","low","budget","thi","flick","excus","fit","soundtrack","ani","numb","struggl","artist","jump","opportun","contribut","thi","flick","quiroz","brother","take","advantag","thi","beyond","mebr","br","onc","film","get","roll","complet","typic","zombi","movi","cast","happen","complet","black","latino","mai","think","thi","put","unusu","slant","movi","somehow","quiroz","brother","vision","urban","cultur","boil","drivebi","shoot","drop","fbomb","everi","line","movi","rapidfir","us","word","fuck","probabl","thi","movi","much","distinguish","characterist","singl","line","contain","word","three","four","time","line","contain","littl","onc","squeamish","swear","movi","feel","result","lack","idea","part","writer","conjur","quiroz","brother","script","gener","veri","poorbr","br","film","gener","disappoint","interest","see","genuin","urban","cultur","zombi","flick","hood","live","dead","doe","deliv","count","charact","movi","easili","white","eskimo","anyth","els","distinct","flavor","movi","anoth","runofthemil","low","budget","flick","bad","act","lousi","write","amateurish","direct","bland","cinematographi","cheap","soundtrack","noth","recommend"],"filtered2":["happen","spot","flick","shelf","new","releas","find","idea","hiphop","zombi","flick","far","interest","pass","bill","box","anyhow","think","great","idea","plu","welcom","oakland","sign","cover","resist","unfortun","hiphop","part","onli","last","long","open","theme","neither","hiphop","music","hiphop","cultur","role","live","oakland","know","mani","aspir","hiphop","artist","low","budget","flick","excus","fit","soundtrack","ani","numb","struggl","artist","jump","opportun","contribut","flick","quiroz","brother","take","advantag","beyond","mebr","onc","get","roll","complet","typic","zombi","cast","happen","complet","black","latino","mai","think","put","unusu","slant","somehow","quiroz","brother","vision","urban","cultur","boil","drivebi","shoot","drop","fbomb","everi","line","rapidfir","us","word","fuck",

{"value":"Although there are a lot of familiar \"television\" names associated with \"A Man Called Sledge\", there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's-70's television series like \"The Rat Patrol\" is a bigger cast and a lot more violence. <br /><br />James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (\"Maverick\", \"Support Your Local Sheriff\"-\"Gunfighter\" etc.). Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him, as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western character. But Eastwood's stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />I suppose that \"A Man Called Sledge\" could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. Fans of the slow-paced \"Combat\" television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves, which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose. <br /><br />The plot is the standard \"big heist\" thing (insert \"The War Wagon\" here) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of \"Alias Smith and Jones\" with the same plot.<br /><br />The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer's interest.<br /><br />The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a
