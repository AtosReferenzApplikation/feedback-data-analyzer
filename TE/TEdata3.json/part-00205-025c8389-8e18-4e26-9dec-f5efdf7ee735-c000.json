{"value":"When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there. So I couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's, and the same goes for the music. And the acting was top-notch throughout: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were present. Too bad they didn't have better material to work with.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","that","thi","movi","be","be","show","on","tv","i","be","realli","look","forward","to","it","i","grow","up","in","the","and","like","everyon","els","who","have","grow","up","in","that","era","have","see","everi","teen","and","summer","camp","movi","out","there","so","i","can","not","wait","to","see","thi","movi","that","total","spoof","that","film","genr","what","a","disappoint","the","movi","be","noth","but","a","bunch","of","realli","bad","joke","and","gag","over","and","over","with","hardli","ani","plot","and","no","substanc","and","the","filmmak","attempt","at","dark","humor","total","failedsom","of","thi","socal","joke","do","not","come","across","a","anyth","but","downright","cruel","and","offens","the","onli","good","thing","about","thi","film","be","the","wardrob","music","and","act","it","be","nice","to","go","on","a","nostalgia","trip","and","see","all","of","the","summer","cloth","styl","from","the","and","the","same","go","for","the","music","and","the","act","be","topnotch","throughout","almost","all","of","hollywood","well","comedian","be","present","too","bad","thei","do","not","have","well","materi","to","work","with"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","show","tv","realli","look","forward","grow","like","everyon","els","grow","era","see","everi","teen","summer","camp","movi","wait","see","thi","movi","total","spoof","film","genr","disappoint","movi","noth","bunch","realli","bad","joke","gag","hardli","ani","plot","substanc","filmmak","attempt","dark","humor","total","failedsom","thi","socal","joke","come","across","anyth","downright","cruel","offens","onli","good","thing","thi","film","wardrob","music","act","nice","go","nostalgia","trip","see","summer","cloth","styl","go","music","act","topnotch","throughout","almost","hollywood","well","comedian","present","bad","thei","well","materi","work"],"filtered2":["see","show","tv","realli","look","forward","grow","like","everyon","els","grow","era","see","everi","teen","summer","camp","wait","see","total","spoof","genr","disappoint","noth","bunch","realli","bad","joke","gag","hardli","ani","plot","substanc","filmmak","attempt","dark","humor","total","failedsom","socal","joke","come","across","anyth","downright","cruel","offens","onli","good","thing","wardrob","music","act","nice","go","nostalgia","trip","see","summer","cloth","styl","go","music","act","topnotch","throughout","almost","hollywood","well","comedian","present","bad","well","materi","work"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,9,11,13,16,20,21,27,28,29,32,34,48,49,85,104,118,131,172,177,184,187,196,214,246,262,300,323,331,368,369,380,411,419,438,467,503,537,561,665,699,879,881,908,998,1042,1145,1204,1383,1434,1547,1557,1633,1785,1984,4134,4206,8394],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,9,11,13,16,20,21,27,28,29,32,34,48,49,85,104,118,131,172,177,184,187,196,214,246,262,300,323,331,368,369,380,411,419,438,467,503,537,561,665,699,879,881,908,998,1042,1145,1204,1383,1434,1547,1557,1633,1785,1984,4134,4206,8394],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,2.011190219103739,2.0728240170322856,4.70875905096179,2.2512118082053005,2.5001408943598484,2.458149992634611,4.992499677733764,2.4732161909892554,2.478925055209576,5.460751613699401,2.673149229007135,2.726701583487816,2.932274249550174,3.0433232530252132,2.932274249550174,3.1346146732346205,3.121829110937649,3.102062070196872,3.229006157521873,3.1758963322079246,3.1797351085150902,3.342254038012865,3.3490645070153917,3.424750734647968,6.945117160934579,3.5929222627171646,3.5813614403160887,3.8962296530720266,4.086456389373095,4.081705786614497,4.135246553542527,4.115443926246347,4.2574141875167335,4.3215761317340196,9.147503031457783,4.477736862489302,4.724033718778229,4.550761997504193,4.828393734102471,4.770124825978496,5.014723312293965,5.907203395474402,5.9370563586240825,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6384573438366713E-4,1.6370054239515643E-4,1.6374096132363073E-4,1.63708044152802E-4,1.6372353717732108E-4,1.6369963979975122E-4,1.6375055266042214E-4,1.6367528396326776E-4,1.6370057699159257E-4,1.6386974379925716E-4,1.6517000252032877E-4,1.6370084738261394E-4,1.6385588242992023E-4,1.638729533859055E-4,1.6379851018201167E-4,1.6370868897509365E-4,1.6376501109549986E-4,1.6384207946647803E-4,1.6371714054884423E-4,1.6371654198273493E-4,1.6386382989970713E-4,1.6373294470882108E-4,1.6373319250444335E-4,1.6383

{"value":"Admirably odd, though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight. Some of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as Bud Cort's vision of a \"mother bird\" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her!). In the lead, Bud Cort is--once again, after \"Harold & Maude\"--a true original; not off-putting like, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and inoffensive, a tough act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's misfires.

{"value":"A somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about World War Two dangers. The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best acting is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned evil. He is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac Jane, coded information related to allied activities. Will she tell? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is nothing short of disastrous. He seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history. It is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents. The movie is worth one look, despite being a half spy and half gangster film, and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters.

{"value":"... to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century.<br /><br />\"A river runs through it\" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, Redford acting well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all).<br /><br />I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry, narrow-minded a character as his father, a preacher. Being driven, not driving his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small town environment, losing his life. The author never even comes close to undestand his brother's motivations, but at least realizes, that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun. All there is, is fly-fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father.<br /><br />The end is not surprising, it is forseeable from the very beginning.<br /><br />Definitely NOT a

{"value":"Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended I'm sure.<br /><br />It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite,.... I just can't say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.<br /><br />If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there.

{"value":"It was pointed out in a now deleted post from another IMDb user that anyone who might see \"The Medusa Touch\" should be warned about a scene that's eerily reminiscent of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in NYC. But I hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced \"Harper\" and \"The Long Goodbye\"; co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced the Oscar-nominated \"L.A. Confidential\" and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for \"Gandhi\") and an international cast, I found \"The Medusa Touch\" to be a heavy-handed, unintentional laugh riot. It was a poorly directed, horribly written and acted mess. It tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre. The movie fails on many counts. Please consider \"Carrie\" and the underrated \"The Fury\" (both directed by Brian DePalma).

{"value":"Based on the novel by Michael Chabon, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely opposed to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually contrived with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie cinematography, the whole film feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny if outright commercial - is desperately seeking indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films but sprinkling it with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star-laden premieres at Sundance this year it felt like this was a secrety studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility points - it failed in

Movie veteran & former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a awful bad-guy & the budget was so low it was a totally unbelievable even as a kiddie movie.<br /><br />I haven't seen the sequel made in 1999 and

{"value":"While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...<br /><br />Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent (though under used) makeup effects don't save this B horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from its senseless story that's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing. The plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying conclusion for it all. The cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.<br /><br />Still I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is pretty good too, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here.

{"value":"Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever!? ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright... from the annoying characters in this movie. From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just running about without any notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?)..things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film. As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then just doesn't go anywhere, but into a new direction...and on and on...<br /><br />The acting is great, but the writing is horrible. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply strange. There are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of

{"value":"The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.<br /><br />While I absolutely loved \"The Mummy\" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite liked \"The Mummy's Hand\" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I was not as taken with \"The Mummy's Tomb\".<br /><br />It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is okay as Kharis, but doesn't really stand out. And I guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out.

{"value":"Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Contrived plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out. (This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint). Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, Ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison. C'mon.

{"value":"This movie is supposed to be taking place in and around Seattle. The, why is Porteau Cove P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L Park shown? Provincial parks are in CANADA, and not the United States. The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with stylus to 'read' that someone has hacked into the computer of the bridal shop. I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced. We learn half-way into the movie that this woman works in the District Attorney's office. Then, in the correctional center a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender!! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional setting. The director really messed on this one -- this doesn't happen in real life. The acting is adequate. The Plot is good. The Cinematography is good.

{"value":"Body Slam (1987) is a flat out terrible movie. The low budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting is lame. But if you're into old school wrestling (circa 1970's through the mid-80') then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. I gave it a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was \"directed\" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict).<br /><br />The synopsis of this \"movie\" is about a promoter who wants to combine \"hair rock\" and wrestling. But their are others that don't want him to succeed. There's more but I don't want to SPOIL it for you. If you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline, there's a few surprises near the end for die-hard wrestling fans. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy (and I mean

{"value":"'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.<br /><br />Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics, since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever. Apparently, this is one of the better of his 180+ films  it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.<br /><br />The unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M for good measure, and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.<br /><br />I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of

{"value":"Is rich, ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual? Actually, both are applicable in director Joseph Losey's wandering, meandering mess called \"Boom\", appropriately titled since tempers in the lush, luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurai's robe complete with saber. Though great-looking in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even Liz 'n Dick-philes should shun (the stars' collective \"what the hell!\" attitude to their late-'60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here). Pointless, confused, and maddening, \"Boom\" is a catastrophe--although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\", was said to

{"value":"If there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become, this one would take the prize. The plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power-seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world. Just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be? <br /><br /> The acting was bad at best. Casper Van Dien wasted his talent doing this film. Michael York's work was a fair match for the role, since he was the center of the film, and did a good job. <br /><br /> This plot was sickening and very disturbing. No tender or immature minds should see this film. This is how a basic good vs. evil plot can go astray.<br /><br /> There must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles, who look for ways to market this type of junk.

{"value":"I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love.

{"value":"Horrible, horrible TV show! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! I am, of course, speaking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I was exclusively talking about those seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good. They were, and are, awful. The comedy is not funny at all. AT ALL!!! <br /><br />The original cast was full of very talented comedians, like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name is), all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV. This show is highly overrated, and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show.

{"value":"I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production. I have to say, I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The sets in a Wagnerian production must, of necessity, be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery, vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention. I found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas. I was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production - that did come across fairly well and next time I am at the opera I am sure I will remember that part if this

{"value":"\"Nada\" was the most inadequate follow-up to \"Les NOces Rouges\" which,with hindsight,appears now as the last good movie of Chabrol's golden era (1967-1973) \"Nada\" is Chabrol's first real attempt at a wholly political movie;its previous work \"les Noces Rouges\" had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in French provinces.\"Nada\" includes terrorists,ambassador,hostage-taking,a lot of blood,not really Chabrol's field.A heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce :only Duchaussoy,who had already played with the director ,and Maurice Garrel are up to scratch.Viviane Romance ,one of Duvivier's actresses (\"la Belle Equipe\" \"Panique\") ,is wasted as a madam (Gabrielle).Italian actors (Fabio

{"value":"Okay, so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to straighten out. That is actually not the case! It's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not.<br /><br />To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this movie. They had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love/hate relationship between mother and daughter. I did not however, enjoyed watching Lindsay Lohan's acting. In reality, this movie would have been GREAT if they had someone else, perhaps a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real Lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film.<br /><br />I do however, think that if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this film.

{"value":"I simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film. It moved me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to cash-in on the success of the first film. The dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film.<br /><br />The storyline is ridiculous, the portrayal of the French police laughable and the characterisation of Doyle a mile away from the first film.<br /><br />How many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in? The ease at which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic. Like all the French Police were just drinking coffee until Doyle turns up from America and does some REAL police work. What a joke. Try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets.

{"value":"Generally I don't like films directed by Sydney Pollack (\"The Firm\" being somewhat of an exception) and I've never been a Robert Redford fan either. Still, I thought \"Three Days of the Condor\" must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received.<br /><br />Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer, I found the whole affair tremendously disappointing. The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense.<br /><br />The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can one say about that absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway?

{"value":"I've barely just made it through one episode (\"Crouch End\"). The dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy. The acting was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random, meandering plot. Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget. But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare it's overall quality to something else, I'd put this episode of \"Nightmares and Dreamscapes\" on par with the NBC's Hercules.","finished_norm":["i","have","bare","just","make","it","through","on","episod","crouch","end","the","dialog","be","stilt","and","downright","cring","worthi","the","act","be","tragic","eion","bailei","despit","hi","well","attempt","to","be","dramat","remain","mostli","expressionless","hi","eyebrow","hint","at","a","recent","botox","treatment","clair","forlani","can","have","just","a","easili","be","plai","the","damsel","in","distress","in","a","silent","movi","the","charact","be","cartoon","each","plai","their","stereotyp","cog","in","the","plot","mostli","random","meander","plot","cheesi","special","effect","can","be","excus","give","the","tv","miniseri","budget","but","attempt","to","creat","suspens","and","surpris","through","distract","cinematographi","add","to","the","unwatch","i","get","the","feel","that","the","end","be","suppos","to","be","witti","and","surpris","but","it","be","lame","and","have","littl","to","do","with","the","rest","of","the","stori","if","i","have","to","compar","it","overal","qualiti","to","someth","els","i","have","put","thi","episod","of","nightmar","and","dreamscap","on","par","with","the","nbc","hercul"],"filtered":["bare","make","episod","crouch","end","dialog","stilt","downright","cring","worthi","act","tragic","eion","bailei","despit","hi","well","attempt","dramat","remain","mostli","expressionless","hi","eyebrow","hint","recent","botox","treatment","clair","forlani","easili","plai","damsel","distress","silent","movi","charact","cartoon","plai","stereotyp","cog","plot","mostli","random","meander","plot","cheesi","special","effect","excus","give","tv","miniseri","budget","attempt","creat","suspens","surpris","distract","cinematographi","add","unwatch","get","feel","end","suppos","witti","surpris","lame","littl","rest","stori","compar","overal","qualiti","someth","els","put","thi","episod","nightmar","dreamscap","par","nbc","hercul"],"filtered2":["bare","make","crouch","end","dialog","stilt","downright","cring","worthi","act","tragic","eion","bailei","despit","well","attempt","dramat","remain","mostli","expressionless","eyebrow","hint","recent","botox","treatment","clair","forlani","easili","plai","damsel","distress","silent","charact","cartoon","plai","stereotyp","cog","plot","mostli","random","meander","plot","cheesi","special","effect","excus","give","tv","miniseri","budget","attempt","creat","suspens","surpris","distract","cinematographi","add","unwatch","get","feel","end","suppos","witti","surpris","lame","littl","rest","stori","compar","overal","qualiti","someth","els","put","nightmar","dreamscap","par","nbc","hercul"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,10,14,17,20,21,24,30,32,40,43,53,106,149,159,172,177,196,203,226,256,299,319,326,362,373,391,412,432,482,510,529,543,562,583,594,604,617,629,653,682,756,859,1054,1225,1303,1337,1356,1557,1818,1828,1836,2078,2135,2274,2480,2700,2745,3113,4542,4773,5101,6354,6740,8162,8174,8278],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,10,14,17,20,21,24,30,32,40,43,53,106,149,159,172,177,196,203,226,256,299,319,326,362,373,391,412,432,482,510,529,543,562,583,594,604,617,629,653,682,756,859,1054,1225,1303,1337,1356,1557,1818,1828,1836,2078,2135,2274,2480,2700,2745,3113,4542,4773,5101,6354,6740,8162,8174,8278],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.3364419891718522,2.742262257014735,3.2569937516641474,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,2.159084361316692,2.3253197803590226,2.300267965194495,2.5001408943598484,4.916299985269222,2.478925055209576,2.569760528637609,2.5940874818617203,2.748952192422636,2.7949961309240425,2.9056060024680126,5.885680771176112,3.058539100262467,3.070535816550098,3.109204957709252,3.107414446935464,3.235085203598255,3.3154667220492153,6.748881449017532,3.4648563601051974,3.477726550625732,3.432149042129413,3.4986697244709752,3.496027715008137,3.5727776966246974,3.5119855004467477,3.488143311483988,3.9911462095687695,3.6497387377608255,3.7636829971100436,3.9405024767500145,4.3095999406873045,4.470719289830655,4.370968887063596,4.396611317676934,4.396611317676934,4.550761997504193,4.789173020949191,4.770124825978496,4.77960356993304,4.933754249760298,4.956227105612356,5.0768550934009715,5.116075806554253,5.243909178064138,5.878215858601149,5.649374286172302,6.255510089742618,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6384573438366697E-4,1.6370054239515624E-4,1.6374096132363054E-4,1.6370804415280182E-4,1.6372353717732089E-4,1.6369963979975103E-4,1.63750552

{"value":"Another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served time in the US military can see how bogus this film is. Uniforms, equipment, sets, and mannerisms are all wrong. (And of course, all Senior Officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years. Uses every cliche', rumor, and Urban Legend from the Gulf-all are presented as gospel. (The truth is, no one knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new. War is NOT fun and I know WWII, Korean, and Viet Nam vets with some pretty serious ailments, too. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.)

{"value":"\"A stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as 'The Fiend' targets them for death. A pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of 'The Fiend' and find themselves targets as well. Just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved, you're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Taking \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" to Hollywood, producer Sam Katzman's lack of studio settings probably helps \"A Face in the Fog\" look interesting, especially toward the end (1930s traffic). The direction could be improved upon; for example, the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful. The budget appears slight. Under the circumstances, most of the silent/talkie crossover cast perform it amiably.<br /><br />**** A Face in the Fog (2/1/36) Robert F.

{"value":"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is aweful! From the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a \"plane\" movie.

{"value":"I've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll. If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you (\"let's check out the basement!\"), then this is your show. Except, it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying.<br /><br />The extent of the virus is never, ever showed. I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only, as the resulting situation is very, very frightening. But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home, and ultimately dies at his hands. The woman flees north, and runs into a few tens situations. Then, some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her (things that make you go HUH?). Or something. Then, she is huddling for warmth. The end.<br /><br />Awful.

{"value":"I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $5 on VHS. She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa doesn't make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","when","i","be","about","year","old","my","mom","bui","it","at","our","local","kmart","becaus","it","be","on","sale","for","on","vh","she","think","that","it","would","be","a","nice","christma","movi","for","me","and","my","brother","to","watch","thi","movi","howev","scare","the","hell","out","of","me","you","mai","be","ask","yourself","how","can","a","movi","about","santa","claus","scare","anyon","the","plot","of","the","movi","revolv","around","satan","send","on","hi","minion","pitch","to","earth","in","a","attempt","to","kill","santa","and","ruin","christma","that","right","satan","send","a","demon","up","from","hell","to","kill","santa","claus","pitch","stalk","santa","throughout","christma","ev","in","a","attempt","to","trap","him","on","earth","when","the","sun","rise","on","christma","dai","for","if","santa","doe","not","make","it","back","to","hi","home","in","space","he","turn","to","powder","do","not","get","me","wrong","the","movi","be","funni","and","fairli","entertain","howev","the","imag","of","demon","and","devil","danc","in","the","depth","of","hell","which","occur","at","the","begin","of","the","movi","be","just","downright","creepi"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","year","old","mom","bui","local","kmart","becaus","sale","vh","think","nice","christma","movi","brother","watch","thi","movi","howev","scare","hell","mai","ask","movi","santa","claus","scare","anyon","plot","movi","revolv","around","satan","send","hi","minion","pitch","earth","attempt","kill","santa","ruin","christma","right","satan","send","demon","hell","kill","santa","claus","pitch","stalk","santa","throughout","christma","ev","attempt","trap","earth","sun","rise","christma","dai","santa","doe","make","back","hi","home","space","turn","powder","get","wrong","movi","funni","fairli","entertain","howev","imag","demon","devil","danc","depth","hell","occur","begin","movi","downright","creepi"],"filtered2":["see","year","old","mom","bui","local","kmart","becaus","sale","vh","think","nice","christma","brother","watch","howev","scare","hell","mai","ask","santa","claus","scare","anyon","plot","revolv","around","satan","send","minion","pitch","earth","attempt","kill","santa","ruin","christma","right","satan","send","demon","hell","kill","santa","claus","pitch","stalk","santa","throughout","christma","ev","attempt","trap","earth","sun","rise","christma","dai","santa","doe","make","back","home","space","turn","powder","get","wrong","funni","fairli","entertain","howev","imag","demon","devil","danc","depth","hell","occur","begin","downright","creepi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,12,18,22,25,32,46,57,62,63,67,76,96,98,113,121,132,147,158,177,195,262,302,306,347,381,394,438,475,492,522,623,637,710,721,742,748,755,819,914,922,1073,1121,1131,1155,1259,1411,1500,1557,1813,1840,2181,2184,2254,2790,3084,3752,6658,6829],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,12,18,22,25,32,46,57,62,63,67,76,96,98,113,121,132,147,158,177,195,262,302,306,347,381,394,438,475,492,522,623,637,710,721,742,748,755,819,914,922,1073,1121,1131,1155,1259,1411,1500,1557,1813,1840,2181,2184,2254,2790,3084,3752,6658,6829],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.655771293751733,1.834162586674748,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,4.267533106664805,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,4.3043565130405606,2.2190595059394194,2.253494045787767,2.2844323215331563,2.3106972614914807,4.916299985269222,2.51289241584188,2.726701583487816,2.902686292364678,2.8739486825973213,3.0151989841543516,3.24941502915308,9.290214566832367,3.1797351085150902,3.3721070011625462,3.6016814428070463,7.209236604960712,7.215127625420226,3.7432044657665027,3.6528204042982337,7.368341868364619,3.7740817043309423,16.984712456999233,3.79165684915245,3.835141961092188,3.9612932464190886,4.030886538218284,9.071448240279304,4.403125998698128,25.13422336413155,4.291900363587903,4.315570107673808,4.715065048795469,4.605250182788262,4.550761997504193,10.153710186801943,4.890269137820559,5.039114765418124,10.370137356082408,5.274680836730892,5.408212229355414,5.463272006538442,6.0662680901040895,13.737229125258052,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.4985657968503746E-4,1.4972378419373137E-4,1.4976075215263784E-4,1.4973064545103918E-4,1.497448156805672E-4,1.4972295866195435E-4,1.497695245807488E-4,1.4970068232766643E-4,1.4972381583632256E-4,1.4987853917586028E-4,1.5106778176052934E-4,1.4972406314134882E-4,1.4986586129073624E-4,1.4988147472788508E-4,1.49813387487419E-4,1.4973123521838037E-4,
