{"value":"Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.","finished_norm":["oh","dear","lord","thi","movi","it","be","horribl","i","be","a","huge","fan","of","horror","movi","and","much","of","the","time","horror","movi","other","peopl","sai","be","bad","i","like","the","actor","who","plai","scarecrow","be","amaz","i","will","sai","that","but","thi","plot","be","aw","it","make","no","sens","it","have","wai","too","much","gore","and","a","unnecessari","and","revolt","sex","scene","at","the","begin","i","do","believ","the","director","be","try","to","be","shock","or","whatnot","but","it","just","come","out","aw","to","add","to","the","pile","of","fester","crap","thei","call","a","plot","the","actor","besid","scarecrow","we","re","aw","and","i","care","so","littl","about","them","that","i","soon","forget","who","be","who","in","conclus","thi","movi","make","me","sick","if","you","can","avoid","watch","thi","movi","in","anywai","pleas","do"],"filtered":["oh","dear","lord","thi","movi","horribl","huge","fan","horror","movi","much","time","horror","movi","peopl","sai","bad","like","actor","plai","scarecrow","amaz","sai","thi","plot","aw","make","sens","wai","much","gore","unnecessari","revolt","sex","scene","begin","believ","director","try","shock","whatnot","come","aw","add","pile","fester","crap","thei","call","plot","actor","besid","scarecrow","re","aw","care","littl","soon","forget","conclus","thi","movi","make","sick","avoid","watch","thi","movi","anywai","pleas"],"filtered2":["oh","dear","lord","horribl","huge","fan","horror","time","horror","peopl","bad","like","actor","plai","scarecrow","amaz","plot","aw","make","sens","wai","gore","unnecessari","revolt","sex","scene","begin","believ","director","try","shock","whatnot","come","aw","add","pile","fester","crap","call","plot","actor","besid","scarecrow","re","aw","care","littl","soon","forget","conclus","make","sick","avoid","watch","anywai","pleas"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,9,14,19,23,32,33,34,36,40,41,58,68,83,91,138,140,142,147,173,205,230,234,254,299,313,335,346,358,372,386,444,449,508,685,778,956,972,1081,1133,1446,1713,1983,2483],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,9,14,19,23,32,33,34,36,40,41,58,68,83,91,138,140,142,147,173,205,230,234,254,299,313,335,346,358,372,386,444,449,508,685,778,956,972,1081,1133,1446,1713,1983,2483],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.364847727375781,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.865701314626681,2.0064197866819473,4.584637595480144,2.0105926690411424,6.872209556786827,2.317169775997098,2.2844323215331563,2.2844323215331563,2.4368824319140248,2.571852579609833,2.7121382192999195,2.673149229007135,2.889652074525771,2.7949961309240425,2.907069060519773,2.908534262247101,3.023389038124396,3.2030824725120812,3.0316467233633775,3.0433232530252132,3.2535472664379905,3.2597778161886266,3.4149707055943286,3.607563812710113,3.8059428063999263,3.969732115064953,3.9911462095687695,4.1302590120314875,4.197121957260614,4.581533656170946,11.999153431210834,4.944927550358424,5.322690055917252]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816467E-4,2.2324275812784223E-4,2.2329787848933373E-4,2.2325298847310012E-4,2.2327411672029327E-4,2.232415272346223E-4,2.233109584489241E-4,2.2320831253640859E-4,2.23242805307917E-4,2.2347350255652818E-4,2.252466997550513E-4,2.2324317404730234E-4,2.234545994406501E-4,2.2347787955470633E-4,2.2337635938917745E-4,2.2325386783430921E-4,2.2333067579914016E-4,2.2343577597443498E-4,2.2326539346890391E-4,2.2326457718847376E-4,2.2346543761534032E-4,2.232869460197477E-4,2.2328728394518986E-4,2.2343032416998455E-4,2.232654740063532E-4,2.2348055066696404E-4,2.233213453268012E-4,2.2324225779449936E-4,2.2334346629394183E-4,2.2341163393927886E-4,2.2328804127835615E-4,2.2340762949082032E-4,2.2351731705956904E-4,2.237247757880988E-4,2.2332095942123806E-4,2.2325373242729926E-4,2.233342280058664E-4,2.2327640592866805E-4,2.2320855076990684E-4,2.232653243272448E-4,2.2348907433600594E-4,2.2336647651074396E-4,2.2340813859831569E-4,2.2321965983456378E-4,2.2326538109796089E-4,2.2325364847537184E-4,2.2332921781121286E-4,2.233679433767197E-4,2.2332252276763837E-4,2.2328712575322477E-4,2.2325420056448954E-4,2.2371161216552593E-4,2.23310377752348E-4,2.2326532992581898E-4,2.2330918184256568E-4,2.2324248620167705E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760433E-4,2.232545139848125E-4,2.2324235876917283E-4,2.2342095801135598E-4,2.2333127123814594E-4,2.2324226544800517E-4,2.2321956888982677E-4,2.23197121696452E-4,2.2339892722621755E-4,2.2325320192525606E-4,2.2335468452716273E-4,2.234202334647874E-4,2.233188720525105E-4,2.2326562563335241E-4,2.23219861515807E-4,2

{"value":"Yep, the topic is a straight quote from the movie and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to dead with this pointless effort. All the flashes etc. making no sense after first 20 minutes is just bad film making + If you are epileptic, you would have died at least five times already. Of course all the David Lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be \"the best film ever made\" because it doesn't make any sense AND when it doesn't make any sense it's got to be art, and art movie is always good. Right? I say WRONG. This kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that you're a good film maker.

{"value":"As a girl, Hinako moved away from her small village to Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She reunites with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I rented this because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama a nifty actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be \"fruity.\" This movie is silly, boring, poorly filmed, unimaginative, and most of all, unscary.

{"value":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was going to get up and leave at Tape 4 but I stuck it out. I now consider myself a Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who's the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the lead actor(George Calil) was particularly inept. Apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake, I thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make \"Larson the Lunatic Implodes, all over a screen near you\" disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11. Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day, was appalling. The camera shake didn't make me feel sick, that cold hearted stunt did.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","be","go","to","get","up","and","leav","at","tape","but","i","stick","it","out","i","now","consid","myself","a","masochist","afghanistan","come","on","gui","who","the","idiot","who","forget","to","hide","the","sanskrit","billboard","i","think","the","lead","actorgeorg","calil","be","particularli","inept","apart","from","the","bad","act","and","over","zealou","camera","shake","i","think","us","the","event","of","a","a","reason","to","make","larson","the","lunat","implod","all","over","a","screen","near","you","disgrac","and","irrever","to","the","victim","of","us","a","phone","call","from","larson","wife","sarah","supposedli","from","on","of","the","terrorist","hold","plane","on","that","dai","be","appal","the","camera","shake","do","not","make","me","feel","sick","that","cold","heart","stunt","do"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","go","get","leav","tape","stick","consid","masochist","afghanistan","come","gui","idiot","forget","hide","sanskrit","billboard","think","lead","actorgeorg","calil","particularli","inept","apart","bad","act","zealou","camera","shake","think","us","event","reason","make","larson","lunat","implod","screen","near","disgrac","irrever","victim","us","phone","call","larson","wife","sarah","supposedli","terrorist","hold","plane","dai","appal","camera","shake","make","feel","sick","cold","heart","stunt"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","go","get","leav","tape","stick","consid","masochist","afghanistan","come","gui","idiot","forget","hide","sanskrit","billboard","think","lead","actorgeorg","calil","particularli","inept","apart","bad","act","zealou","camera","shake","think","us","event","reason","make","larson","lunat","implod","screen","near","disgrac","irrever","victim","us","phone","call","larson","wife","sarah","supposedli","terrorist","hold","plane","dai","appal","camera","shake","make","feel","sick","cold","heart","stunt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,9,12,21,25,34,43,44,55,56,74,95,132,142,157,192,231,263,317,372,414,416,470,497,535,555,572,614,705,707,778,946,983,1088,1106,1403,1413,1544,1561,1642,1812,2246,2544,4051,4918,5433,7689,7720],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,9,12,21,25,34,43,44,55,56,74,95,132,142,157,192,231,263,317,372,414,416,470,497,535,555,572,614,705,707,778,946,983,1088,1106,1403,1413,1544,1561,1642,1812,2246,2544,4051,4918,5433,7689,7720],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.9536997889255368,3.7221218701403576,1.9486336368009016,2.0323326556775485,2.253494045787767,2.2844323215331563,2.3360150694757706,2.5318267134339894,5.409870614011723,2.902686292364678,2.8529247828056143,3.0316467233633775,3.1254654785810323,3.1401446412440817,3.3814747511661465,3.342254038012865,3.4986697244709752,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.553030933689863,3.6590123745461547,3.6375061693251913,3.8059428063999263,3.9612932464190886,4.165705761027235,4.513582994262438,4.213208095012239,4.550761997504193,4.449957298382227,4.6973654716960676,4.550761997504193,9.342779970585614,5.014723312293965,5.444579873526289,5.156897801074508,5.878215858601149,6.489124940924123,6.255510089742618,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247368E-4,2.1540780663323995E-4,2.1546099248468385E-4,2.1541767793321662E-4,2.154380646612075E-4,2.154066189395789E-4,2.1547361338862645E-4,2.1537456994793317E-4,2.1540785215747778E-4,2.156304528310065E-4,2.1734141771275793E-4,2.154082079555466E-4,2.1561221314088627E-4,2.1563467621359277E-4,2.155367190105506E-4,2.1541852643227154E-4,2.1549263873663E-4,2.15594050305036E-4,2.1542964756197323E-4,2.1542885992980752E-4,2.1562267093784912E-4,2.1545044370220885E-4,2.1545076976778386E-4,2.1558878983769228E-4,2.1542972527287165E-4,2.1563725358021162E-4,2.1548363572753695E-4,2.154073238596491E-4,2.1550498033487083E-4,2.155707555613039E-4,2.154515005215051E-4,2.1556689165339277E-4,2.1567272961560592E-4,2.1587290735061636E-4,2.1548326336575632E-4,2.1541839577752037E-4,2.1549606627473258E-4,2.1544027352728257E-4,2.1537479982036334E-4,2.1542958084691711E-4,2.1564547810166165E-4,2.1552718298266583E-4,2.155673828931975E-4,2.1538551900010994E-4,2.154296356252021E-4,2.1541831477197865E-4,2.154912319184015E-4,2.1552859836735787E-4,2.1548477184478573E-4,2.1545061712774073E-4,2.154188474849182E-4,2.1586020571993616E-4,2.1547305307223892E-4,2.1542958624900312E-4,2.1547189913423303E-4,2.1540754425062426E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.154411514247661E-4,2.154191499054083E-4,2.154074212905047E-4,2.1557975239475937E-4,2.

Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning. Loosy actors, nothing with story. This is not cruel, this is playing. First one has better actors, better story, and its mean. I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. It is not the worst movie I saw, but in compaer with first one its one big, big, big nothing.","finished_norm":["if","you","ask","me","the","on","be","realli","well","on","look","at","sarah","be","g","she","be","real","mean","cruel","girl","look","at","ami","adam","she","be","just","littl","fool","hang","around","she","be","noth","peopl","do","not","ador","her","sebastian","be","cute","and","hot","in","movi","now","he","be","babi","face","stori","be","not","that","good","and","i","do","not","understand","why","do","not","thei","make","thi","on","it","be","the","begin","loosi","actor","noth","with","stori","thi","be","not","cruel","thi","be","plai","on","have","well","actor","well","stori","and","it","mean","i","think","that","the","music","be","well","in","cruel","intent","and","the","music","be","well","in","cruel","intent","it","be","not","the","wrong","movi","i","see","but","in","compaer","with","on","it","on","big","big","big","noth"],"filtered":["ask","realli","well","look","sarah","g","real","mean","cruel","girl","look","ami","adam","littl","fool","hang","around","noth","peopl","ador","sebastian","cute","hot","movi","babi","face","stori","good","understand","thei","make","thi","begin","loosi","actor","noth","stori","thi","cruel","thi","plai","well","actor","well","stori","mean","think","music","well","cruel","intent","music","well","cruel","intent","wrong","movi","see","compaer","big","big","big","noth"],"filtered2":["ask","realli","well","look","sarah","g","real","mean","cruel","girl","look","ami","adam","littl","fool","hang","around","noth","peopl","ador","sebastian","cute","hot","babi","face","stori","good","understand","make","begin","loosi","actor","noth","stori","cruel","plai","well","actor","well","stori","mean","think","music","well","cruel","intent","music","well","cruel","intent","wrong","see","compaer","big","big","big","noth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,12,13,14,16,17,20,23,25,40,41,49,80,82,84,88,98,118,147,212,251,306,666,698,811,848,855,1057,1248,1984,2246,2450,2718,3154,3738],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,12,13,14,16,17,20,23,25,40,41,49,80,82,84,88,98,118,147,212,251,306,666,698,811,848,855,1057,1248,1984,2246,2450,2718,3154,3738],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,3.83116108203179,5.826725200115285,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,5.076090992426206,1.9951803900462557,6.060589753185969,2.2212694515902225,4.063444682693467,2.0881990796736947,4.70875905096179,2.2844323215331563,2.5983793339432615,2.6942272927333892,2.8739486825973213,3.6621227969605474,3.90413483257914,7.685153879159413,3.827761853794566,3.9201351739255808,4.181290492043933,4.637773374493822,20.05889324917586,5.444579873526289,5.426230734858092,5.274680836730892,5.541743621979936,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805344E-4,2.1925531043720585E-4,2.1930944626706022E-4,2.1926535805328178E-4,2.1928610891855588E-4,2.1925410152956955E-4,2.193222925991184E-4,2.1922148009526638E-4,2.192553567745743E-4,2.1948193342720773E-4,2.2122345868647698E-4,2.1925571892772582E-4,2.1946336794909395E-4,2.1948623224568847E-4,2.1938652538130754E-4,2.192662217077918E-4,2.1934165776813384E-4,2.194448806979817E-4,2.192775414774105E-4,2.1927673977696285E-4,2.194740125378645E-4,2.1929870906764096E-4,2.192990409572321E-4,2.1943952627086726E-4,2.1927762057634114E-4,2.1948885564790848E-4,2.1933249395190814E-4,2.1925481904056063E-4,2.19354219805675E-4,2.1942116987548008E-4,2.1929978476330165E-4,2.1941723695242685E-4,2.1952496533805864E-4,2.197287185451421E-4,2.193321149391923E-4,2.1926608871935242E-4,2.1934514652716475E-4,2.1928835723826433E-4,2.1922171407356001E-4,2.1927747357072423E-4,2.1949722707154397E-4,2.1937681902578176E-4,2.1941773696650515E-4,2.192326247137996E-4,2.1927752932743088E-4,2.1926600626693128E-4,2.1934022582203942E-4,2.193782596913495E-4,2.1933365036190075E-4,2.192988855908108E-4,2.1926654849491623E-4,2.1971579004444674E-4,2.1932172227464683E-4,2.1927747906929957E-4,2.1932054772559189E-4,2.1925504336804642E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163026E-4,2.1926685631708606E-4,2.1925491821167626E-4,2.1943032740576215E-4,2.1934224257171337E-4,2.1925482655736346E-4,2.1923253539347085E-4,2.1921048914035562E-4,2.1940869012321285E-4,2.1926556769286476E-4,2.1936523766456558E-4,2.194296158006729E-4,2.1933006485397476E-4,2.1927776949505663E-4,2.1923282279271585E-4,2.1928890659939334E-4,2.1923270471120224E-4,2.1924420968899233E-4,2.1923282899755117E-4,2.1937514173922434E-4,2.1930984867656834E-4,2.1925511920612136E-4,2.1927635817480426E-4]}}

{"value":"While most of the movie is very amateurish, the Kosher slaughter scene is played up, but not untrue. Kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin. The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the Peta film showing a Kosher slaughter, in which the animals throat is cut, and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. We must remember that history is written by the victors.

{"value":"Words really can't describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. This is just laughable! Terrible script, poor direction, awful acting and you know what? I can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money (assuming that you need it!).

{"value":"I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie. I couldn't even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /><br />I like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death. Badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious. You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie. I wonder what I was thinking watching it to the end. I recommend this movie to no one.

{"value":"While channel surfing, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. We were dismayed at the flat acting, and formulaic storyline. We found amusing the exploding car scenes, unbelievable shoot outs, and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard. What was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from \"Dante's Peak\", where the church front falls on the school bus, the store fronts break away from the main street, the overpass collapsing, and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it. It was a good laugh although unintended, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster

{"value":"Disappointing film. Performance of actors is weak. Sets are fine, could have been better. The story is also weak. Battle sequences are awful. Sounds and quality of film are trashy. The history of Kazakh people was told very poorly. This film should have included more Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And also should have been in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic origins. I don't get it. Since when Hispanic people play Turkic-Mongolian people. This film is shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the finest filmmakers in the world. Czekh director is excused, since he is not nomadic origin, he cannot know true spirit and history of nomads.","finished_norm":["disappoint","film","perform","of","actor","be","weak","set","be","fine","can","have","be","well","the","stori","be","conjur","weak","battl","sequenc","be","aw","sound","and","qualiti","of","film","be","trashi","the","histori","of","kazakh","peopl","be","tell","veri","poorli","thi","film","should","have","includ","much","kazakh","actor","in","lead","role","and","conjur","should","have","be","in","kazakh","languag","kuno","bekker","and","jai","hernandez","be","hispan","origin","i","do","not","get","it","sinc","when","hispan","peopl","plai","turkicmongolian","peopl","thi","film","be","shame","of","kazakh","cinema","rustam","ibragimbekov","disappoint","me","he","be","on","of","the","fine","filmmak","in","the","world","czekh","director","be","excus","sinc","he","be","not","nomad","origin","he","cannot","know","true","spirit","and","histori","of","nomad"],"filtered":["disappoint","film","perform","actor","weak","set","fine","well","stori","conjur","weak","battl","sequenc","aw","sound","qualiti","film","trashi","histori","kazakh","peopl","tell","veri","poorli","thi","film","includ","much","kazakh","actor","lead","role","conjur","kazakh","languag","kuno","bekker","jai","hernandez","hispan","origin","get","sinc","hispan","peopl","plai","turkicmongolian","peopl","thi","film","shame","kazakh","cinema","rustam","ibragimbekov","disappoint","fine","filmmak","world","czekh","director","excus","sinc","nomad","origin","know","true","spirit","histori","nomad"],"filtered2":["disappoint","perform","actor","weak","set","fine","well","stori","conjur","weak","battl","sequenc","aw","sound","qualiti","trashi","histori","kazakh","peopl","tell","veri","poorli","includ","kazakh","actor","lead","role","conjur","kazakh","languag","kuno","bekker","jai","hernandez","hispan","origin","get","sinc","hispan","peopl","plai","turkicmongolian","peopl","shame","kazakh","cinema","rustam","ibragimbekov","disappoint","fine","filmmak","world","czekh","director","excus","sinc","nomad","origin","know","true","spirit","histori","nomad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,15,17,20,23,26,39,40,41,58,69,90,105,109,128,138,157,162,165,178,187,301,304,319,323,349,379,398,409,464,499,574,617,786,894,1094,2177,2653,5234,7588],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,15,17,20,23,26,39,40,41,58,69,90,105,109,128,138,157,162,165,178,187,301,304,319,323,349,379,398,409,464,499,574,617,786,894,1094,2177,2653,5234,7588],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,4.094543182127343,1.3324924169710188,3.1077880109725475,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.865701314626681,4.254065042302116,2.0477128419653545,2.1765612129984904,2.125691139326857,2.3409902041158843,2.2907365189289424,2.3360150694757706,4.7172014442490395,2.448847599972298,2.532833256045391,4.946432381978511,2.8309760279012264,2.871119826396843,2.9056060024680126,3.0433232530252132,3.0568369721919364,6.254577266285095,3.143848349181566,3.2209578243390444,6.5744693248433315,6.762949502332293,3.5039747767006686,3.5119855004467477,3.900174431363043,4.091229668125752,4.218628162481577,5.259176650194926,5.373120909544144,12.875663293073144,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918352E-4,2.3612552253122064E-4,2.3618382374676034E-4,2.3613634324334566E-4,2.36158690747249E-4,2.361242206063243E-4,2.3619765851711915E-4,2.3608908917345183E-4,2.3612557243393595E-4,2.3636958262639038E-4,2.3824510646673104E-4,2.3612596245232122E-4,2.3634958866039743E-4,2.363742122098564E-4,2.362668335771339E-4,2.3613727335022451E-4,2.362185137048159E-4,2.3632967894044428E-4,2.3614946409949674E-4,2.3614860071362605E-4,2.3636105227822527E-4,2.361722603925212E-4,2.3617261781876998E-4,2.363239125264052E-4,2.3614954928455472E-4,2.3637703746512054E-4,2.3620864479495754E-4,2.3612499332492963E-4,2.3623204230611885E-4,2.3630414373063946E-4,2.3617341885568208E-4,2.3629990819577752E-4,2.3641592555151696E-4,2.3663535618876835E-4,2.3620823661977858E-4,2.3613713012922487E-4,2.3622227090024033E-4,2.3616111205994108E-4,2.3608934115479146E-4,2.3614939096785063E-4,2.363860530131423E-4,2.362563803832485E-4,2.3630044668255477E-4,2.361010912949481E-4,2.3614945101465846E-4,2.36137041332648E-4,2.3621697158016173E-4,2.3625793189828046E-4,2.362098901828718E-4,2.3617245049795414E-4,2.3613762528140628E-4,2.366214329274519E-4,2.3619704431003977E-4,2.361493968895041E-4,2.3619577938738506E-4,2.3612523491289706E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276115E-4,2.3613795678840857E-4,2.3612510012659135E-4,2.3631400587089337E-4,2.362191435050726E-4,2.3612500142009956E-4,2.3610099510202465E-4,2.360772525389537E-4,2.3629070374590528E-4,2.3613656901327556E-4,2.3624390791467597E-4,2.3631323951260906E-4,2.3620602879437968E-4,2.361497096615574E-4,2.3610130461469624E-4,2.361617036906906E-4,2

{"value":"I went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama (in the same vein as Remember the Titans); however, I came away feeling like I had just attended a Ted Haggard sermon about the Rapture. The only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie. Actually, one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the televangelist sermon, there are quotes from the Scripture rather than quotes from popularist self-help pulp. The plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long-enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie.","finished_norm":["i","go","into","thi","movi","think","that","it","would","be","a","neat","footbal","drama","in","the","same","vein","a","rememb","the","titan","howev","i","come","awai","feel","like","i","have","just","attend","a","ted","haggard","sermon","about","the","raptur","the","onli","thing","that","be","miss","be","the","request","for","a","tith","at","the","end","of","the","movi","actual","on","would","probabl","get","much","out","of","a","televangelist","sermon","than","thi","poor","excus","for","entertain","at","littl","with","the","televangelist","sermon","there","be","quot","from","the","scriptur","rather","than","quot","from","popularist","selfhelp","pulp","the","plot","be","entir","too","predict","to","the","point","that","anyon","with","a","longenough","attent","spin","can","have","lai","out","the","entir","plot","within","the","minut","of","the","movi"],"filtered":["go","thi","movi","think","neat","footbal","drama","vein","rememb","titan","howev","come","awai","feel","like","attend","ted","haggard","sermon","raptur","onli","thing","miss","request","tith","end","movi","actual","probabl","get","much","televangelist","sermon","thi","poor","excus","entertain","littl","televangelist","sermon","quot","scriptur","rather","quot","popularist","selfhelp","pulp","plot","entir","predict","point","anyon","longenough","attent","spin","lai","entir","plot","within","minut","movi"],"filtered2":["go","think","neat","footbal","drama","vein","rememb","titan","howev","come","awai","feel","like","attend","ted","haggard","sermon","raptur","onli","thing","miss","request","tith","end","actual","probabl","get","televangelist","sermon","poor","excus","entertain","littl","televangelist","sermon","quot","scriptur","rather","quot","popularist","selfhelp","pulp","plot","entir","predict","point","anyon","longenough","attent","spin","lai","entir","plot","within","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,11,12,14,24,29,32,34,43,52,59,66,113,146,148,155,158,160,195,198,255,290,337,463,617,636,672,1605,1708,1808,1862,1871,2649,2720,2944,3099,3614,4751,5700,5824,7124,7558],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,11,12,14,24,29,32,34,43,52,59,66,113,146,148,155,158,160,195,198,255,290,337,463,617,636,672,1605,1708,1808,1862,1871,2649,2720,2944,3099,3614,4751,5700,5824,7124,7558],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.929723173391612,2.1521782565202803,2.326138445979858,2.3018654096236517,2.3074766467914385,2.3106972614914807,2.3722295531801256,2.51289241584188,5.087945223472195,2.6754694156628323,2.8612813773965557,2.973659465713028,3.3467891931782563,3.5119855004467477,3.530930586689197,3.616452760127359,9.275546748987644,4.671389985292807,4.770124825978496,5.274680836730892,4.890269137820559,5.604922523601468,5.626901430320244,5.463272006538442,5.626901430320244,5.672363804397,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353,21.10700594187658]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815696E-4,2.4557311712357496E-4,2.4563375102320043E-4,2.455843707821272E-4,2.456076124297671E-4,2.455717631074922E-4,2.456481393351681E-4,2.4553522603438366E-4,2.455731690229428E-4,2.458269422827268E-4,2.477775075192787E-4,2.4557357464631454E-4,2.458061483401665E-4,2.4583175709999247E-4,2.45720082151569E-4,2.4558533810341906E-4,2.4566982895768744E-4,2.4578544201440576E-4,2.4559801661553737E-4,2.455971186848212E-4,2.458180706276571E-4,2.45621725008755E-4,2.456220967359495E-4,2.4577944488095305E-4,2.455981052089262E-4,2.458346953962615E-4,2.4565956518386684E-4,2.4557256674326413E-4,2.4568389885049985E-4,2.457588851178833E-4,2.4562292982306915E-4,2.457544801154609E-4,2.4587513942998123E-4,2.46103349684445E-4,2.4565914067723176E-4,2.4558518915201836E-4,2.4567373648188103E-4,2.4561013062135846E-4,2.4553548809772344E-4,2.455979405578283E-4,2.4584407166447064E-4,2.457092107159918E-4,2.457550401475786E-4,2.45547708371559E-4,2.455980030071629E-4,2.4558509680261057E-4,2.4566822513123846E-4,2.4571082430853604E-4,2.4566086040087205E-4,2.456219227204773E-4,2.4558570411568404E-4,2.4608886934091685E-4,2.456475005531109E-4,2.455979467164124E-4,2.456461850197627E-4,2.455728179973835E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.456111314579804E-4,2.4558604888657974E-4,2.455726778181564E-4,2.4576914185124143E-4,2.4567048395681903E-4,2.4557257516232906E-4,2.4554760832987013E-4,2.4552291580549017E-4,2.457449073872683E-4,2.455846055853151E-4,2.456962392127305E-4,2.457683448302727E-4,2.4565684451475237E-4,2.45598272002757E-4,2.455479302264222E-4,2.4561074592378655E-4,2.455477979712658E-4,2.455606839225922E-4,2.455479371

{"value":"When I was a kid we always used to be babysat, and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema. This is one of the films we watched. This is one of the stupidest films I've ever seen, I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures film! A martian is dropped on earth, turns into a human, befriends a human, and is trying everything he can to get back home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd as the martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber's Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie.

{"value":"What seemed as a good premise for a movie...unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level. Very hard to follow at the start of the movie I actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many \"arty\" splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story. It really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it.","finished_norm":["what","seem","a","a","good","premis","for","a","movieunfortun","it","fail","to","deliv","on","nearli","everi","level","veri","hard","to","follow","at","the","start","of","the","movi","i","actual","find","myself","fight","the","urg","to","turn","it","off","the","big","problem","from","a","visual","aspect","be","the","fact","that","the","camera","work","be","simpli","over","the","top","with","so","mani","arti","splice","and","semisublimin","cut","throughout","the","movi","that","actual","distract","you","from","the","from","the","overal","stori","it","realli","try","too","hard","to","immers","you","in","the","moment","and","build","to","a","suspens","end","but","the","movi","just","have","so","mani","half","conceiv","charact","and","non","relev","script","it","just","leav","you","feel","disappoint","and","confus","a","to","why","thei","try","to","go","so","deep","with","it"],"filtered":["seem","good","premis","movieunfortun","fail","deliv","nearli","everi","level","veri","hard","follow","start","movi","actual","find","fight","urg","turn","big","problem","visual","aspect","fact","camera","work","simpli","top","mani","arti","splice","semisublimin","cut","throughout","movi","actual","distract","overal","stori","realli","try","hard","immers","moment","build","suspens","end","movi","mani","half","conceiv","charact","non","relev","script","leav","feel","disappoint","confus","thei","try","go","deep"],"filtered2":["seem","good","premis","movieunfortun","fail","deliv","nearli","everi","level","veri","hard","follow","start","actual","find","fight","urg","turn","big","problem","visual","aspect","fact","camera","work","simpli","top","mani","arti","splice","semisublimin","cut","throughout","actual","distract","overal","stori","realli","try","hard","immers","moment","build","suspens","end","mani","half","conceiv","charact","non","relev","script","leav","feel","disappoint","confus","try","go","deep"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,10,13,15,17,24,35,36,38,43,48,50,52,71,74,77,82,85,96,97,167,171,187,188,201,206,215,231,233,260,303,364,412,427,438,445,477,484,517,529,611,635,645,834,1356,2020,2233,2605,2606,3241,4398,5353],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,10,13,15,17,24,35,36,38,43,48,50,52,71,74,77,82,85,96,97,167,171,187,188,201,206,215,231,233,260,303,364,412,427,438,445,477,484,517,529,611,635,645,834,1356,2020,2233,2605,2606,3241,4398,5353],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.463169012899134,2.9360366939211433,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,3.43598877114071,3.4244306149452273,1.9214926742550966,1.9486336368009016,1.9463902258768238,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0390708128715254,2.0545557924622586,2.4609576687888097,4.746175108181524,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,2.561435818751577,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,2.7049353070058615,2.8377834061292515,2.6754694156628323,2.868298950055202,2.9878441007049847,3.107414446935464,3.233054746047873,3.1797351085150902,3.241201430615691,3.351345009714117,3.291526514503207,3.4198487640477615,3.4648563601051974,3.520060914452293,3.587125145032839,3.558633189238533,3.8240921249056035,4.396611317676934,4.979216623837056,5.039114765418124,5.185068678041204,5.243909178064138,5.521540914662417,5.9370563586240825,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613016E-4,2.1169300653874466E-4,2.117452751773491E-4,2.1170270760391576E-4,2.117227427540309E-4,2.1169183932737064E-4,2.1175767842838535E-4,2.116603430343437E-4,2.116930512778975E-4,2.1191181310725436E-4,2.135932716651462E-4,2.116934009400759E-4,2.1189388796842012E-4,2.1191596365579497E-4,2.118196957667698E-4,2.1170354147024024E-4,2.117763756760955E-4,2.1187603835847094E-4,2.117144708112862E-4,2.117136967621753E-4,2.1190416541618507E-4,2.117349083131562E-4,2.117352287555904E-4,2.1187086861014474E-4,2.1171454718202682E-4,2.119184965746201E-4,2.11767527927759E-4,2.1169253209079163E-4,2.1178850443817672E-4,2.1185314534259432E-4,2.1173594690715003E-4,2.118493480694338E-4,2.1195336081055504E-4,2.1215008639459401E-4,2.1176716198751714E-4,2.1170341306868631E-4,2.1177974410483216E-4,2.1172491352726232E-4,2.116605689425251E-4,2.1171440524675987E-4,2.1192657926066713E-4,2.1181032419177948E-4,2.1184983083759725E-4,2.116711032654155E-4,2.1171445908036983E-4,2.1170333346011997E-4,2.1177499311905127E-4,2.118117151675549E-4,2.1176864445217813E-4,2.1173507874789035E-4,2.117038569861962E-4,2.1213760380898737E-4,2.1175712777489448E-4,2.1171441055568458E-4,2.1175599373704485E-4,2.1169274868102983E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502686E-4,2.117041541913151E-4,2.1169262784141032E-4,2.1186198702179476E-

{"value":"What an awful movie. I love monster flicks but I couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting, cardboard characters and abysmal special effects. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous, uninspiring sock puppets. The plot is formulaic, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drivel. Even the CGI is horrible. You know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy. No surprises here,just same old same old. This is truly one of the worst films ever made.

{"value":"This absolute trash is based so closely on the Friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy, accept for it being an Australian film with people who can't act.<br /><br />Once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon. Now, a number of years later, the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video. It is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money, see it only out of curiosity, or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how NOT to (not be able to) act.

{"value":"Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a \"worst case scenario\" of playing \"strong\" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... Don't waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe

David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl

{"value":"Comedy Central has had success with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the hugely popular Colbert Report all star professional comics and all are, or in the case of Chapelle Show, were, solid shows. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I was expecting good stuff when I tuned in.<br /><br />I was so disappointed.<br /><br />There were some mildly funny sequences, but given that the star is the caliber of Silverman, the show could have been much better. It was just the pilot, and hopefully next week's show will be better.

{"value":"Labored comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating eccentric farm family in Maryland who have never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts the squeeze on the not-so-disinterested tax-man. Debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period--and this one's no better or worse than the rest. Picture begins brightly but flags at the halfway point, becoming frantic and witless. Randall isn't a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry.

{"value":"I saw this movie for 2 reasons--I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because it does explain his disdain for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists. I actually enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","for","reasonsi","like","gerard","butler","and","christoph","plummer","unfortun","thi","poor","man","be","forc","to","carri","a","pretti","dumb","movi","i","like","the","idea","that","dracula","be","actual","a","reincarn","of","juda","iscariot","becaus","it","doe","explain","hi","disdain","for","all","thing","christian","but","there","be","so","much","camp","that","thi","idea","be","not","realiz","a","much","a","it","can","have","be","i","see","thi","movi","much","a","a","wai","for","the","talent","gerard","butler","to","pai","hi","due","befor","be","truli","recogn","and","a","wai","for","the","legendari","christoph","plummer","to","remind","the","public","me","and","the","other","peopl","who","see","thi","film","that","he","still","exist","i","actual","enjoi","the","special","featur","on","the","dvd","much","than","the","movi","itself"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","reasonsi","like","gerard","butler","christoph","plummer","unfortun","thi","poor","man","forc","carri","pretti","dumb","movi","like","idea","dracula","actual","reincarn","juda","iscariot","becaus","doe","explain","hi","disdain","thing","christian","much","camp","thi","idea","realiz","much","see","thi","movi","much","wai","talent","gerard","butler","pai","hi","due","befor","truli","recogn","wai","legendari","christoph","plummer","remind","public","peopl","see","thi","film","still","exist","actual","enjoi","special","featur","dvd","much","movi"],"filtered2":["see","reasonsi","like","gerard","butler","christoph","plummer","unfortun","poor","man","forc","carri","pretti","dumb","like","idea","dracula","actual","reincarn","juda","iscariot","becaus","doe","explain","disdain","thing","christian","camp","idea","realiz","see","wai","talent","gerard","butler","pai","due","befor","truli","recogn","wai","legendari","christoph","plummer","remind","public","peopl","see","still","exist","actual","enjoi","special","featur","dvd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,18,22,23,29,33,45,52,64,78,79,123,146,200,203,227,247,276,305,322,338,342,395,405,420,528,568,621,644,684,780,908,1162,1568,2145,2972,3892,4045,4607,6396,6469],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,18,22,23,29,33,45,52,64,78,79,123,146,200,203,227,247,276,305,322,338,342,395,405,420,528,568,621,644,684,780,908,1162,1568,2145,2972,3892,4045,4607,6396,6469],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,2.803707089537043,1.8162961064622165,3.4244306149452273,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,4.523814194644097,2.326138445979858,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,2.6005321873043625,2.7303758068497004,2.7884729505849193,2.8612813773965557,2.885344817328191,2.9720957437368454,2.9705344631698933,3.153168081130368,3.109204957709252,3.3023374306074227,3.4198487640477615,3.4471119148061256,3.5446859617576822,3.5670958631572662,4.1302590120314875,3.7775721092707104,4.081705786614497,8.767415825682052,4.597282013139085,5.626901430320244,5.408212229355414,5.999576715605417,11.874112717248165,12.978249881848246,13.451027437976705,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.31874654576517E-4,2.3166917872259965E-4,2.3172637963242854E-4,2.3167979521786165E-4,2.3170172096235672E-4,2.3166790136863865E-4,2.3173995330228212E-4,2.3163343296338682E-4,2.3166922768351226E-4,2.319086327265583E-4,2.337487602278492E-4,2.3166961034116836E-4,2.318890161021827E-4,2.319131749369382E-4,2.318078228369682E-4,2.3168070777104287E-4,2.317604148947183E-4,2.3186948213389032E-4,2.316926684470496E-4,2.3169182135566598E-4,2.31900263369733E-4,2.3171503451076977E-4,2.3171538519139344E-4,2.3186382454808472E-4,2.3169275202442917E-4,2.3191594687179605E-4,2.317507322385731E-4,2.316686595038998E-4,2.3177368817377565E-4,2.318444288443493E-4,2.3171617111051633E-4,2.3184027324578294E-4,2.3195410103209592E-4,2.3216939040434872E-4,2.3175033176679237E-4,2.316805672530209E-4,2.3176410118143964E-4,2.3170409657815972E-4,2.3163368018913938E-4,2.3169259669560054E-4,2.3192479227141037E-4,2.3179756692385685E-4,2.318408015698205E-4,2.316452085715471E-4,2.316926556091585E-4,2.3168048013228184E-4,2.317589018742354E-4,2.31799089157495E-4,2.3175195412256176E-4,2.317152210283857E-4,2.316810530603067E-4,2.321557299136074E-4,2.3173935068699462E-4,2.31692602505496E-4,2.317381096369403E-4,2.316688965324319E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.317050407490892E-4,2.31681378310852E-4,2.316687642899178E-4,2.3185410485865128E-4,2.3176103280889658E-4,2.3166866744629138E-4,2.31645114194051E-4,2.316218197190258E-4,2.3183124250942018E-4,2.3168001672688654E-4,2.3178532984537473E-4,2.3185335296367428E-4,2.31748165609185E-4,2.3169290937467276E-4,2.316454178653597E-4,2.3170467704319533E-4,2.3164529309826863E-4,2.3165744946862304E-4,

{"value":"This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs \"Sini Ne\" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesn't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","absolut","pathet","a","piti","screenplai","and","lack","of","ani","stori","just","leav","me","watch","three","loser","drool","over","bikini","babe","at","time","i","feel","like","i","be","watch","a","episod","of","beavi","and","butthead","i","can","not","even","sit","through","the","whole","movi","emran","hashmi","disappoint","and","hrshitta","bhatt","be","not","impress","at","all","celina","jaitlei","be","not","bad","the","onli","worthwhil","part","of","the","film","be","the","spoof","on","anu","malik","and","hi","obsess","of","shayari","it","be","pretti","hilari","the","song","sini","ne","and","it","remix","version","be","realli","good","you","can","alwai","count","on","emran","liplock","and","lipsynch","a","chartbust","all","in","all","it","seem","emran","doe","not","have","a","good","script","from","the","bhatt","to","back","him","up","thi","time"],"filtered":["thi","movi","absolut","pathet","piti","screenplai","lack","ani","stori","leav","watch","three","loser","drool","bikini","babe","time","feel","like","watch","episod","beavi","butthead","even","sit","whole","movi","emran","hashmi","disappoint","hrshitta","bhatt","impress","celina","jaitlei","bad","onli","worthwhil","part","film","spoof","anu","malik","hi","obsess","shayari","pretti","hilari","song","sini","ne","remix","version","realli","good","alwai","count","emran","liplock","lipsynch","chartbust","seem","emran","doe","good","script","bhatt","back","thi","time"],"filtered2":["absolut","pathet","piti","screenplai","lack","ani","stori","leav","watch","three","loser","drool","bikini","babe","time","feel","like","watch","beavi","butthead","even","sit","whole","emran","hashmi","disappoint","hrshitta","bhatt","impress","celina","jaitlei","bad","onli","worthwhil","part","spoof","anu","malik","obsess","shayari","pretti","hilari","song","sini","ne","remix","version","realli","good","alwai","count","emran","liplock","lipsynch","chartbust","seem","emran","doe","good","script","bhatt","back","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,17,18,27,35,43,61,63,74,77,78,110,111,183,187,197,220,222,224,244,328,418,602,632,703,885,1122,1266,1524,1547,2022,2608,3748,5042],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,17,18,27,35,43,61,63,74,77,78,110,111,183,187,197,220,222,224,244,328,418,602,632,703,885,1122,1266,1524,1547,2022,2608,3748,5042],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.9486336368009016,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,2.4885128563647294,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.8336934208777267,2.5771019354959765,2.689504733779216,2.634508058031767,3.1550424959247185,3.164467636384302,3.506637894120152,3.541919708264792,3.6746621462132825,3.9323057095458362,4.263079925052412,4.327618446189983,4.6973654716960676,4.724033718778229,4.900964426937307,5.390512652256013,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7310929654841793E-4,2.728672805936188E-4,2.729346536330475E-4,2.728797850372723E-4,2.7290560987210073E-4,2.7286577608575286E-4,2.7295064113039627E-4,2.7282517810867476E-4,2.728673382613291E-4,2.731493170874145E-4,2.7531667741558316E-4,2.728677889676103E-4,2.7312621200724233E-4,2.731546670463563E-4,2.730305800133632E-4,2.728808598712503E-4,2.729747414406553E-4,2.7310320428201737E-4,2.7289494753346763E-4,2.7289394980246375E-4,2.7313945939443253E-4,2.729212909901957E-4,2.7292170403291755E-4,2.7309654059864784E-4,2.7289504597354674E-4,2.7315793191883876E-4,2.7296333690222756E-4,2.7286666904142423E-4,2.729903751282305E-4,2.730736957257879E-4,2.729226297132994E-4,2.730688011304589E-4,2.732028710947005E-4,2.734564457215509E-4,2.729628652139074E-4,2.7288069436468297E-4,2.7297908326566066E-4,2.729084079474747E-4,2.728254692989797E-4,2.7289486302234324E-4,2.731683503100629E-4,2.7301850027476295E-4,2.7306942340720803E-4,2.728390477921335E-4,2.728949324125938E-4,2.72880591751123E-4,2.7297295935731165E-4,2.730202932096521E-4,2.72964776075807E-4,2.729215106765386E-4,2.728812665638581E-4,2.734403559638166E-4,2.7294993135106504E-4,2.728948698654217E-4,2.729484696030877E-4,2.728669482211206E-4,0.9784334310143923,2.72909520021836E-4,2.7288164965422987E-4,2.72866792461708E-4,2.7308509244124276E-4,2.7297546923950365E-4,2.7286667839622404E-4,2.728389366313358E-4,2.7281149966243033E-4,2.7305816444375485E-4,2.7288004593760255E-4,2.730040870569744E-4,2.7308420683557524E-4,2.729603138450161E-4,2.7289523130563675E-4,2.728392943050007E-4,2.7290909163753924E-4,2.728391473503776E-4,2.728534655

{"value":"This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back!<br /><br />Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into a long line of former SNL-ers that have attempted movies. Some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. There's not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not so funny, and then dead...so I suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career.<br /><br />Avoid this movie like the plague.<br /><br

{"value":"When anti-bush jokes get really easy to do, a show like this had better make sure it has something extra. When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet, it's just plain nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly. There's also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all. The democratic characters rarely give their names so it's a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton.<br /><br />The episodes have coherent stories but that's not

one.","finished_norm":["basic","cruel","intent","be","cruel","intent","again","onli","poorli","do","the","stori","be","exactli","the","same","a","the","on","even","some","of","the","line","with","onli","a","few","except","the","cast","be","much","unknown","and","definit","littl","talent","instead","of","be","seduct","and","draw","me","into","watch","it","i","end","up","feel","dirti","becaus","it","compar","to","watch","a","softcor","porn","i","be","not","sure","whether","to","blame","some","of","the","idiot","line","on","the","actor","or","the","writersand","i","alwai","feel","bad","sai","that","becaus","i","know","how","hard","it","be","to","do","bothbut","it","be","basic","a","twohour","wast","of","my","life","it","liter","amaz","me","that","some","movi","get","make","and","thi","be","no","exceptioni","ca","not","believ","thei","have","make","a","on"],"filtered":["basic","cruel","intent","cruel","intent","onli","poorli","stori","exactli","even","line","onli","except","cast","much","unknown","definit","littl","talent","instead","seduct","draw","watch","end","feel","dirti","becaus","compar","watch","softcor","porn","sure","whether","blame","idiot","line","actor","writersand","alwai","feel","bad","sai","becaus","know","hard","bothbut","basic","twohour","wast","life","liter","amaz","movi","get","make","thi","exceptioni","ca","believ","thei","make"],"filtered2":["basic","cruel","intent","cruel","intent","onli","poorli","stori","exactli","even","line","onli","except","cast","unknown","definit","littl","talent","instead","seduct","draw","watch","end","feel","dirti","becaus","compar","watch","softcor","porn","sure","whether","blame","idiot","line","actor","writersand","alwai","feel","bad","becaus","know","hard","bothbut","basic","twohour","wast","life","liter","amaz","get","make","exceptioni","ca","believ","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,9,11,14,17,22,24,26,41,43,75,81,89,91,92,107,119,152,171,197,232,276,286,392,398,462,482,576,597,685,705,811,897,898,971,1512,1634,1984,3470,3538],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,9,11,14,17,22,24,26,41,43,75,81,89,91,92,107,119,152,171,197,232,276,286,392,398,462,482,576,597,685,705,811,897,898,971,1512,1634,1984,3470,3538],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,2.5958480334723544,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,4.287906797278791,2.1653408989309972,2.3131195476980753,2.373087554090762,2.558331832813986,2.6102777977348763,2.7884729505849193,5.561401781474432,3.0670934723591254,3.143848349181566,3.2639531875991072,3.3154667220492153,3.587125145032839,3.4986697244709752,3.607563812710113,3.6590123745461547,7.685153879159413,3.8844878351953436,3.892300374932137,4.181290492043933,4.566029469634981,4.654440426979034,10.02944662458793,5.7959777603641776,5.695894301807195]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.318746545765172E-4,2.3166917872259984E-4,2.3172637963242873E-4,2.3167979521786184E-4,2.317017209623569E-4,2.3166790136863884E-4,2.3173995330228229E-4,2.31633432963387E-4,2.3166922768351245E-4,2.319086327265585E-4,2.3374876022784938E-4,2.3166961034116855E-4,2.3188901610218286E-4,2.319131749369384E-4,2.318078228369684E-4,2.3168070777104306E-4,2.3176041489471848E-4,2.318694821338905E-4,2.3169266844704978E-4,2.3169182135566617E-4,2.319002633697332E-4,2.3171503451076996E-4,2.3171538519139363E-4,2.318638245480849E-4,2.3169275202442933E-4,2.3191594687179624E-4,2.3175073223857326E-4,2.3166865950389996E-4,2.3177368817377584E-4,2.318444288443495E-4,2.3171617111051652E-4,2.3184027324578313E-4,2.319541010320961E-4,2.3216939040434888E-4,2.3175033176679255E-4,2.316805672530211E-4,2.3176410118143983E-4,2.3170409657815991E-4,2.3163368018913957E-4,2.3169259669560073E-4,2.3192479227141056E-4,2.3179756692385704E-4,2.318408015698207E-4,2.316452085715473E-4,2.3169265560915868E-4,2.3168048013228203E-4,2.317589018742356E-4,2.317990891574952E-4,2.3175195412256192E-4,2.3171522102838587E-4,2.316810530603069E-4,2.3215572991360759E-4,2.317393506869948E-4,2.3169260250549618E-4,2.317381096369405E-4,2.316688965324321E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.317050407490894E-4,2.316813783108522E-4,2.3166876428991798E-4,2.3185410485865147E-4,2.3176103280889677E-4,2.3166866744629157E-4,2.3164511419405118E-4,2.31621819719026E-4,2.3183124250942037E-4,2.3168001672688673E-4,2.3178532984537492E-4,2.3185335296367445E-4,2.3174816560918518E-4,2.3169290937467295E-4,2.3164541786535985E-4,2.3170467704319552E-4,2.3164529309826882E-4,2.3165744946862323E-4,2.3164542442150255E-4,2.3179579467214525E-4,2.317268048256889E-4,2.3166897666433177E-4,2.3169141814783

{"value":"This Movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act. I was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start. It actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time. Maybe it was the Musical score or the Director himself, but one thing is for sure the Make-up artist needs to get another job ! The Facial Powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces ! Would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it never hit the Theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all. The Plot was great just needed a whole lot more.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","some","great","actor","in","it","unfortun","thei","have","forget","how","to","act","i","be","hope","the","movi","would","get","well","a","it","go","along","but","the","act","be","so","robot","it","be","doom","from","the","veri","start","it","actual","appear","that","mayb","the","actor","be","read","from","a","script","the","whole","time","mayb","it","be","the","music","score","or","the","director","himself","but","on","thing","be","for","sure","the","makeup","artist","ne","to","get","anoth","job","the","facial","powder","be","so","thick","you","can","see","it","cake","on","the","actor","face","would","not","recommend","thi","movi","to","anyon","no","wonder","it","never","hit","the","theater","cuba","good","jr","jame","wood","shame","on","you","gui","for","not","give","it","your","all","the","plot","be","great","just","ne","a","whole","lot","much"],"filtered":["thi","movi","great","actor","unfortun","thei","forget","act","hope","movi","get","well","go","along","act","robot","doom","veri","start","actual","appear","mayb","actor","read","script","whole","time","mayb","music","score","director","thing","sure","makeup","artist","ne","get","anoth","job","facial","powder","thick","see","cake","actor","face","recommend","thi","movi","anyon","wonder","never","hit","theater","cuba","good","jr","jame","wood","shame","gui","give","plot","great","ne","whole","lot","much"],"filtered2":["great","actor","unfortun","forget","act","hope","get","well","go","along","act","robot","doom","veri","start","actual","appear","mayb","actor","read","script","whole","time","mayb","music","score","director","thing","sure","makeup","artist","ne","get","anoth","job","facial","powder","thick","see","cake","actor","face","recommend","anyon","wonder","never","hit","theater","cuba","good","jr","jame","wood","shame","gui","give","plot","great","ne","whole","lot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,8,15,20,21,29,30,32,41,42,51,52,55,58,71,72,73,77,110,111,118,119,145,158,163,170,175,181,227,251,289,298,324,372,388,424,518,574,620,655,724,960,1154,1844,2072,2228,2917,3059,3713,6829],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,8,15,20,21,29,30,32,41,42,51,52,55,58,71,72,73,77,110,111,118,119,145,158,163,170,175,181,227,251,289,298,324,372,388,424,518,574,620,655,724,960,1154,1844,2072,2228,2917,3059,3713,6829],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,4.70627975028631,1.6219954307453837,3.4279798616619646,1.7122153074726136,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,4.2580959472608155,4.236691060675177,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.34599021453259,2.3106972614914807,4.800114871605731,2.4214486257841834,2.3791142619576227,2.4442286541160034,2.6005321873043625,2.6942272927333892,2.8282659991423613,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,3.0316467233633775,3.0914425013694116,3.212973749990824,3.4101163271295305,3.5039747767006686,3.7568101178222815,3.7297814454343623,3.7987743169213135,4.058285512406398,4.589376833631972,4.9227044135737135,5.039114765418124,5.039114765418124,5.463272006538442,5.444579873526289,6.101359409915359,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079226E-4,1.9803239209117225E-4,1.9808128781854378E-4,1.9804146714364124E-4,1.9806020941939273E-4,1.9803130020030511E-4,1.9809289068399777E-4,1.9800183637269875E-4,1.9803243394329385E-4,1.9823707900490505E-4,1.9981003252786687E-4,1.9803276104166494E-4,1.982203105807613E-4,1.982409617172791E-4,1.9815090602457139E-4,1.9804224720031683E-4,1.9811038139259558E-4,1.9820361281160052E-4,1.980524712676429E-4,1.9805174716815783E-4,1.9822992482167913E-4,1.9807158993126743E-4,1.9807188969545337E-4,1.981987766687147E-4,1.9805254271015627E-4,1.9824333118607785E-4,1.981021045921649E-4,1.980319482594907E-4,1.9812172748195073E-4,1.981821970890391E-4,1.9807256150447324E-4,1.9817864485507683E-4,1.9827594562220647E-4,1.984599764441488E-4,1.9810176226615873E-4,1.9804212708455444E-4,1.981135324555958E-4,1.9806224011196372E-4,1.9800204770295613E-4,1.980524099340155E-4,1.982508922939226E-4,1.9814213920018103E-4,1.9817909647006305E-4,1.9801190224276902E-4,1.9805246029372614E-4,1.9804205261315323E-4,1.981090880523802E-4,1.981434404158643E-4,1.981031490669218E-4,1.9807174936779608E-4,1.9804254235593165E-4,1.9844829936360855E-4,1.9809237556434503E-4,1.9805241490035368E-4,1.9809131470630465E-4,1.980321508730946E-4,0.9843481445040683,1.9806304719570587E-4,1.9804282038231335E-4,1.9803203783129268E-4,1.9819046821197695E-4,1.981109095898444E-4,1.98031

{"value":"As far as I can tell you, in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors, this film IS currently available on DVD. I found it only a few weeks ago.<br /><br />It is on the Value DVD label and I paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it. I found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super-duper Swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had??? I thought so.<br /><br />This film was indeed well worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I might start to argue with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember that saying about getting what you pay for.
