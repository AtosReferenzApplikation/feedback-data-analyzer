{"value":"Even in a bad film, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply terrible all over. The acting was laughable, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable Breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were shoddy at best. This was a very bad film and one that even Drew Barrymore wishes was expunged from history. Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer harsh self inflicted pain. b) See just how bad a film can be. This is one film where I can use the cliché \"there's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back\" with some

{"value":"This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie. Face it, you can't. Because that way there's nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot, have meaningless transitions, trite, unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid turd.<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie, really I did; I like lots of crappy movies. But once I've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and WHY, DEAR LORD, WHY? more than a few times, I really can't take it any more.<br /><br />Also, I would love for someone to

{"value":"this movie was terrible. i thought with all the some what decent actors, it would be better. don't waste your time. Eva longoria parker was awful. she should stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd is becoming a B actor. the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i'm saying. and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons. watch just like heaven with Reese Witherspoon...it was a tad better. or any other ghost movie. you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time.

You people are just marking 10 stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman, if its such a \"great\" show then why did it get canceled after 6 measly episodes? exactly. People that support her, please seek help you do NOT know what is funny. Her stand up comedy is just so stupid, seriously how do you find this trash funny? The show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all. Carlos Mencia is funny and to that stupid poster, he actually has fans and his show is on the air so I'm sorry your a redneck who doesen't get his jokes.

{"value":"Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode. the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows.

{"value":"I've tried to like this film, really. In watching it, all I can think is, \"This guy gives me the creeps, I would have gotten a restraining order\". It also calls out CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really the conversation before making the movie? \"Let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!\" From what I've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. <br /><br />The mood of the movie is distinctly 80-ish; brooding and slow. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, just very few of them.","finished_norm":["i","have","try","to","like","thi","film","realli","in","watch","it","all","i","can","think","be","thi","gui","give","me","the","creep","i","would","have","get","a","restrain","order","it","conjur","call","out","codepend","in","capit","letter","be","thi","realli","the","convers","befor","make","the","movi","let","make","a","film","that","put","two","chronic","depress","social","inept","peopl","into","a","relationship","which","deepen","their","isol","and","encourag","them","to","complain","about","how","bad","their","live","be","from","what","i","have","see","in","life","be","that","the","last","thing","on","earth","we","find","attract","in","a","potenti","mate","be","constant","selfpiti","br","br","the","mood","of","the","movi","be","distinctli","ish","brood","and","slow","do","not","get","me","wrong","the","film","have","it","moment","just","veri","few","of","them"],"filtered":["try","like","thi","film","realli","watch","think","thi","gui","give","creep","get","restrain","order","conjur","call","codepend","capit","letter","thi","realli","convers","befor","make","movi","let","make","film","put","two","chronic","depress","social","inept","peopl","relationship","deepen","isol","encourag","complain","bad","live","see","life","last","thing","earth","find","attract","potenti","mate","constant","selfpiti","br","br","mood","movi","distinctli","ish","brood","slow","get","wrong","film","moment","veri"],"filtered2":["try","like","realli","watch","think","gui","give","creep","get","restrain","order","conjur","call","codepend","capit","letter","realli","convers","befor","make","let","make","put","two","chronic","depress","social","inept","peopl","relationship","deepen","isol","encourag","complain","bad","live","see","life","last","thing","earth","find","attract","potenti","mate","constant","selfpiti","mood","distinctli","ish","brood","slow","get","wrong","moment","veri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,9,12,13,15,23,25,29,30,36,38,39,47,55,75,79,116,124,142,144,159,188,390,439,522,547,577,648,975,1075,1129,1304,1413,1458,1664,1823,2068,2123,2200,2257,2799,4816,5403,7294,7673,7786],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,9,12,13,15,23,25,29,30,36,38,39,47,55,75,79,116,124,142,144,159,188,390,439,522,547,577,648,975,1075,1129,1304,1413,1458,1664,1823,2068,2123,2200,2257,2799,4816,5403,7294,7673,7786],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.9536997889255368,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.2466628996789315,2.2323930368088845,2.2844323215331563,2.2931108769894046,2.300267965194495,2.5378812223426954,3.132778125427319,3.2872346624216657,3.604618302480356,3.432149042129413,3.604618302480356,3.6105180246075443,4.086456389373095,4.202455303235976,4.197121957260614,4.456830177669989,4.449957298382227,4.4919214974812585,4.828393734102471,4.798834931860927,5.039114765418124,5.00274712124725,5.129498826886393,5.064116067623542,5.390512652256013,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125571E-4,2.273779263270827E-4,2.2743406769354602E-4,2.2738834617097757E-4,2.2740986578072433E-4,2.2737667263379285E-4,2.2744738993572328E-4,2.2734284269338738E-4,2.27377974381083E-4,2.276129448788428E-4,2.2941898734736622E-4,2.2737834995069833E-4,2.2759369161694297E-4,2.276174029529933E-4,2.275140023100702E-4,2.273892418207621E-4,2.2746747251417907E-4,2.2757451948007197E-4,2.2740098094688527E-4,2.2740014954633695E-4,2.2760473054921068E-4,2.2742293271974017E-4,2.2742327690463971E-4,2.2756896669080763E-4,2.274010629761451E-4,2.276201235427729E-4,2.2745796921172092E-4,2.2737741672596988E-4,2.2748049992975616E-4,2.2754993025739283E-4,2.2742404826603274E-4,2.2754585163377154E-4,2.2765757096628245E-4,2.2786887249241994E-4,2.2745757615795538E-4,2.2738910390558226E-4,2.2747109051910822E-4,2.2741219739254258E-4,2.2734308533973015E-4,2.27400910524502E-4,2.2762880509736262E-4,2.27503936369194E-4,2.2754637017156215E-4,2.2735440017971115E-4,2.2740096834679289E-4,2.2738901839859728E-4,2.2746598751966326E-4,2.275054304062081E-4,2.2745916846251936E-4,2.274231157824547E-4,2.2738958071416703E-4,2.2785546503755478E-4,2.2744679848279374E-4,2.2740091622677964E-4,2.2744558042094633E-4,2.2737764936397726E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441381E-4,2.2738989994003443E-4,2.2737751957101646E-4,2.275594270410359E-4,2.2746807898261516E-4,2.2737742452124304E-4,2.2735430755038743E-4,2.2733144456336726E-4,2.2753698

{"value":"This will be brief. Let me first state that I'm agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians, especially xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games. I just couldn't take it seriously. Mentioning how CharlesManson thought he was Christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil? i don't know it was just cheap and childish -- made the opposition look ignorant. Furthermore, the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious. The delivery was complete overkill. I can't take this documentary seriously. Might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games.","finished_norm":["thi","will","be","brief","let","me","state","that","i","be","agnost","and","not","exactli","crazi","about","xtian","especi","xtian","fanat","howev","thi","documentari","have","a","tone","of","the","like","of","some","teenag","angri","at","hi","xtian","mother","for","not","let","him","plai","video","game","i","just","can","not","take","it","serious","mention","how","charlesmanson","think","he","be","christ","to","illustr","the","point","that","xtianiti","can","bre","evil","i","do","not","know","it","be","just","cheap","and","childish","make","the","opposit","look","ignor","furthermor","the","narrat","just","seem","snobbi","and","pretenti","the","deliveri","be","complet","overkil","i","ca","not","take","thi","documentari","serious","mai","appeal","to","a","angri","teenag","pissd","off","at","hi","xtian","mother","for","not","let","him","plai","video","game"],"filtered":["thi","brief","let","state","agnost","exactli","crazi","xtian","especi","xtian","fanat","howev","thi","documentari","tone","like","teenag","angri","hi","xtian","mother","let","plai","video","game","take","serious","mention","charlesmanson","think","christ","illustr","point","xtianiti","bre","evil","know","cheap","childish","make","opposit","look","ignor","furthermor","narrat","seem","snobbi","pretenti","deliveri","complet","overkil","ca","take","thi","documentari","serious","mai","appeal","angri","teenag","pissd","hi","xtian","mother","let","plai","video","game"],"filtered2":["brief","let","state","agnost","exactli","crazi","xtian","especi","xtian","fanat","howev","documentari","tone","like","teenag","angri","xtian","mother","let","plai","video","game","take","serious","mention","charlesmanson","think","christ","illustr","point","xtianiti","bre","evil","know","cheap","childish","make","opposit","look","ignor","furthermor","narrat","seem","snobbi","pretenti","deliveri","complet","overkil","ca","take","documentari","serious","mai","appeal","angri","teenag","pissd","xtian","mother","let","plai","video","game"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,12,16,26,31,35,40,46,66,81,103,113,124,240,267,285,321,351,371,374,397,462,498,624,690,693,712,762,967,1047,1161,1186,1214,1652,1931,2113,2572,2775,2816,3152,3287],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,12,16,26,31,35,40,46,66,81,103,113,124,240,267,285,321,351,371,374,397,462,498,624,690,693,712,762,967,1047,1161,1186,1214,1652,1931,2113,2572,2775,2816,3152,3287],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.3324924169710188,2.814133962290301,1.463169012899134,3.2569937516641474,1.655771293751733,1.929723173391612,1.949757232424728,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,6.697179110426653,5.533214255322713,2.7085302779237206,2.808171552082607,3.09496984188738,3.0135689919434205,6.093369201455837,6.914426021585259,6.635343589215059,3.2639531875991072,3.386191741044285,7.8483511669251715,3.634471265630037,7.506782622146992,3.7165362186843414,3.7465885637507435,4.110553940952155,4.140259095366071,8.655236892379966,4.2574141875167335,4.456830177669989,4.646072177308517,5.143104478942172,5.00274712124725,5.1994574154933035,5.3064295350454715,5.3560264761848435,5.521540914662417,5.604922523601468]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255705E-4,2.2737792632708265E-4,2.2743406769354596E-4,2.2738834617097752E-4,2.2740986578072427E-4,2.2737667263379277E-4,2.2744738993572323E-4,2.2734284269338733E-4,2.2737797438108294E-4,2.2761294487884276E-4,2.2941898734736617E-4,2.2737834995069828E-4,2.2759369161694292E-4,2.276174029529932E-4,2.275140023100701E-4,2.2738924182076205E-4,2.27467472514179E-4,2.2757451948007191E-4,2.2740098094688521E-4,2.274001495463369E-4,2.2760473054921063E-4,2.2742293271974009E-4,2.2742327690463966E-4,2.2756896669080758E-4,2.2740106297614504E-4,2.2762012354277285E-4,2.2745796921172086E-4,2.2737741672596983E-4,2.274804999297561E-4,2.2754993025739278E-4,2.274240482660327E-4,2.2754585163377146E-4,2.276575709662824E-4,2.2786887249241986E-4,2.2745757615795533E-4,2.273891039055822E-4,2.2747109051910816E-4,2.2741219739254252E-4,2.273430853397301E-4,2.2740091052450196E-4,2.2762880509736257E-4,2.2750393636919395E-4,2.275463701715621E-4,2.2735440017971107E-4,2.2740096834679283E-4,2.273890183985972E-4,2.274659875196632E-4,2.27505430406208E-4,2.2745916846251928E-4,2.2742311578245462E-4,2.2738958071416695E-4,2.2785546503755472E-4,2.2744679848279366E-4,2.2740091622677958E-4,2.2744558042094628E-4,2.273776493639772E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441373E-4,2.2738989994003437E-4,2.273775195710164E-4,2.2755942704103584E-4,2.274680789826151E-4,2.27377424521243E-4,2.2735430755038737E-4,2.273314445633672E-4,2.2753698817546124E-4,2.2738856357694845E-4,2.2749192596045116E-4,2.2755868907355293E-4,2.274554501244986E-4,2.2740121741176008E-4,2.

women.","finished_norm":["good","what","can","it","be","sai","about","thi","disast","i","watch","it","becaus","it","air","on","cabl","i","regret","for","wast","my","time","but","at","littl","i","do","not","wast","monei","br","br","the","creatur","be","the","cheesi","you","can","get","pleas","you","ne","to","be","veri","gener","not","to","get","anger","by","the","cheap","halloween","costum","oh","good","there","be","conjur","displai","of","horribl","act","fx","and","dialogu","the","confront","with","the","creatur","be","unbeliev","you","ca","not","get","a","much","pathet","scene","br","br","thi","be","the","wrong","you","can","get","from","direct","to","video","flick","creatur","unknown","make","full","moon","pictur","movi","look","like","halloween","br","br","avoid","thi","on","at","all","cost","pleas","the","onli","posit","thing","about","thi","trash","be","the","sexi","woman"],"filtered":["good","sai","thi","disast","watch","becaus","air","cabl","regret","wast","time","littl","wast","monei","br","br","creatur","cheesi","get","pleas","ne","veri","gener","get","anger","cheap","halloween","costum","oh","good","conjur","displai","horribl","act","fx","dialogu","confront","creatur","unbeliev","ca","get","much","pathet","scene","br","br","thi","wrong","get","direct","video","flick","creatur","unknown","make","full","moon","pictur","movi","look","like","halloween","br","br","avoid","thi","cost","pleas","onli","posit","thing","thi","trash","sexi","woman"],"filtered2":["good","disast","watch","becaus","air","cabl","regret","wast","time","littl","wast","monei","creatur","cheesi","get","pleas","ne","veri","gener","get","anger","cheap","halloween","costum","oh","good","conjur","displai","horribl","act","fx","dialogu","confront","creatur","unbeliev","ca","get","pathet","scene","wrong","get","direct","video","flick","creatur","unknown","make","full","moon","pictur","look","like","halloween","avoid","cost","pleas","onli","posit","thing","trash","sexi","woman"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,11,14,15,16,19,21,22,25,29,39,70,81,89,102,110,126,225,230,234,240,248,257,311,335,336,346,351,509,543,571,602,671,679,761,776,836,1034,1063,1087,1436,1512,1533,1678,1834,2012,2148,2453],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,8,11,14,15,16,19,21,22,25,29,39,70,81,89,102,110,126,225,230,234,240,248,257,311,335,336,346,351,509,543,571,602,671,679,761,776,836,1034,1063,1087,1436,1512,1533,1678,1834,2012,2148,2453],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,3.1865361882879695,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.5538940054862738,2.094675786251684,1.949757232424728,3.9880092219144876,2.087553710177271,2.1290479736304078,2.2391270689902285,2.641219492619754,2.7121382192999195,2.673149229007135,2.7666071276613566,2.689504733779216,2.7602659523229094,2.9203338091782562,2.908534262247101,2.9233055795674137,6.046778076248792,3.0135689919434205,3.360519385990158,3.477726550625732,3.467417180966871,3.506637894120152,3.6466665387238555,3.6715125373103863,11.821507430250044,3.770603439954617,3.7881170224473255,4.125296222689358,4.100845126825194,4.176068548062782,4.77960356993304,4.566029469634981,4.558366596889411,4.679973728984199,4.77960356993304,10.02944662458793,5.170884043049248,5.156897801074508]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623877E-4,1.9488834103030843E-4,1.949364604671858E-4,1.948972720031749E-4,1.949157167181519E-4,1.9488726647479035E-4,1.9494787912034477E-4,1.9485827042812356E-4,1.94888382217967E-4,1.9508977824281068E-4,1.9663775885027957E-4,1.9488870412317765E-4,1.950732760416881E-4,1.9509359931150195E-4,1.950049733833555E-4,1.9489803967532088E-4,1.9496509213860947E-4,1.9505684337379835E-4,1.9490810142076928E-4,1.9490738881741237E-4,1.950827376426058E-4,1.9492691654791672E-4,1.94927211552912E-4,1.9505208401168569E-4,1.9490817172902928E-4,1.950959311615515E-4,1.9495694674437401E-4,1.948879042450977E-4,1.949762580923621E-4,1.9503576765685183E-4,1.9492787269599063E-4,1.9503227181974888E-4,1.9512802779626679E-4,1.953091368623547E-4,1.9495660985328903E-4,1.948979214665702E-4,1.9496819317392047E-4,1.94917715170537E-4,1.94858478403207E-4,1.9490804106090206E-4,1.9510337222585747E-4,1.949963457450005E-4,1.9503271626469305E-4,1.9486817648792674E-4,1.9490809062107936E-4,1.9489784817751035E-4,1.9496381933204333E-4,1.9499762630200007E-4,1.9495797463658132E-4,1.9492707345315953E-4,1.948983301449128E-4,1.9529764517238146E-4,1.9494737217896265E-4,1.9490804594839243E-4,1.949463281635802E-4,1.9488810364191715E-4,0.9845966403807116,1.9491850944065576E-4,1.94898603757223E-4,1.948

{"value":"When I saw this movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where these hilarious creatures, dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth, really meant to be scary? Or where they designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope so). If you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them (better; dragging them across the screen). The whole was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part. It is one big joke from beginning to end and I believe this movie belongs into a new category: So unbelievable crappy you'll be laughing from beginning to end.

{"value":"Suppose you've been on a deserted island the last ten years. Haven't heard of Scream and left when Halloween part 1 entered the cinema. Then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene.<br /><br />At the moment, a 2.7 rating is on IMDb and it doesn't deserve a that low appreciation. Slashing all the way, like \"I know what you did\", and a who-is-it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who-and-why.<br /><br />No big surprise, just a nice flick to watch with a cola, popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot, deep characters. If the video rental is out of the top titles, you can take it without a risk, but don't expect a masterwork. I've seen a lot worse.","finished_norm":["suppos","you","have","be","on","a","desert","island","the","last","ten","year","have","not","hear","of","scream","and","leav","when","halloween","part","enter","the","cinema","then","thi","movi","would","have","be","a","blast","and","a","complet","new","vision","on","the","horror","scenebr","br","at","the","moment","a","rate","be","on","imdb","and","it","doe","not","deserv","a","that","low","appreci","slash","all","the","wai","like","i","know","what","you","do","and","a","whoisit","that","when","get","to","the","end","convinc","me","of","that","whoandwhybr","br","no","big","surpris","just","a","nice","flick","to","watch","with","a","colon","popcorn","and","no","urg","to","get","a","difficult","plot","deep","charact","if","the","video","rental","be","out","of","the","top","titl","you","can","take","it","without","a","risk","but","do","not","expect","a","masterwork","i","have","see","a","lot","wrong"],"filtered":["suppos","desert","island","last","ten","year","hear","scream","leav","halloween","part","enter","cinema","thi","movi","blast","complet","new","vision","horror","scenebr","br","moment","rate","imdb","doe","deserv","low","appreci","slash","wai","like","know","whoisit","get","end","convinc","whoandwhybr","br","big","surpris","nice","flick","watch","colon","popcorn","urg","get","difficult","plot","deep","charact","video","rental","top","titl","take","without","risk","expect","masterwork","see","lot","wrong"],"filtered2":["suppos","desert","island","last","ten","year","hear","scream","leav","halloween","part","enter","cinema","blast","complet","new","vision","horror","scenebr","moment","rate","imdb","doe","deserv","low","appreci","slash","wai","like","know","whoisit","get","end","convinc","whoandwhybr","big","surpris","nice","flick","watch","colon","popcorn","urg","get","difficult","plot","deep","charact","video","rental","top","titl","take","without","risk","expect","masterwork","see","lot","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,10,18,24,25,26,31,32,33,57,61,72,74,82,83,87,103,125,130,144,149,188,202,216,217,240,257,262,264,326,364,409,423,478,526,545,591,719,803,834,961,1170,1187,1505,1510,1927,2012,2605,2619,2755,2804,3301,8513],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,10,18,24,25,26,31,32,33,57,61,72,74,82,83,87,103,125,130,144,149,188,202,216,217,240,257,262,264,326,364,409,423,478,526,545,591,719,803,834,961,1170,1187,1505,1510,1927,2012,2605,2619,2755,2804,3301,8513],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,2.020196584395323,2.292318797740072,2.115024371522662,2.098582041218749,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,2.2931108769894046,2.3253197803590226,2.5378812223426954,2.597304642813496,2.6070186965339692,2.6113665294700725,2.7666071276613566,2.7602659523229094,2.726701583487816,2.757740698455715,2.942840385588056,2.9878441007049847,3.2209578243390444,3.164467636384302,3.3243163373261977,3.5119855004467477,3.442099372982581,3.509308122676031,4.072271754381138,3.7636829971100436,3.8240921249056035,3.9954846111673676,4.2860694432771105,4.436351646326448,4.535724120139652,4.597282013139085,4.848596441419991,5.014723312293965,5.185068678041204,5.290429193699031,5.3560264761848435,5.3560264761848435,5.521540914662417,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612962E-4,2.1169300653874412E-4,2.1174527517734855E-4,2.1170270760391521E-4,2.1172274275403036E-4,2.116918393273701E-4,2.117576784283848E-4,2.1166034303434314E-4,2.1169305127789696E-4,2.1191181310725382E-4,2.135932716651457E-4,2.1169340094007535E-4,2.1189388796841958E-4,2.1191596365579442E-4,2.1181969576676926E-4,2.117035414702397E-4,2.1177637567609497E-4,2.118760383584704E-4,2.1171447081128565E-4,2.1171369676217477E-4,2.1190416541618453E-4,2.1173490831315566E-4,2.1173522875558986E-4,2.118708686101442E-4,2.1171454718202628E-4,2.1191849657461954E-4,2.1176752792775847E-4,2.1169253209079108E-4,2.1178850443817618E-4,2.1185314534259377E-4,2.1173594690714948E-4,2.1184934806943326E-4,2.119533608105545E-4,2.1215008639459347E-4,2.117671619875166E-4,2.1170341306868577E-4,2.1177974410483162E-4,2.1172491352726178E-4,2.1166056894252457E-4,2.1171440524675933E-4,2.119265792606666E-4,2.1181032419177894E-4,2.118498308375967E-4,2.1167110326541496E-4,2.1171445908036929E-4,2.1170333346011942E-4,2.1177499311905072E-4,2.1181171516755436E-4,2.1176864445217759E-4,2.117350787478898E-4,2.1170385698619562E-4,2.1213760380898682E-4,2.117571277748939E-4,2.1171441055568404E-4,2.117559937

{"value":"This is, quite literally, the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to heckle, and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead, we sat in stunned silence, pitying poor Peter Sellers.<br /><br />This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It is worse than the Matrix sequels. It is worse than Krull.

{"value":"I had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now An Unexpected Love. It's not really worth looking for but I was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on Lifetime. Everything's pretty restrained and you don't really get an idea of who these characters are so, as a viewer, I wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline. I guess I'm not the target audience for this but I'm not sure who is. Everything's muted and soft focus and earth tones...nothing's very interesting. I had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it's handled so discreetly that I was disappointed.

{"value":"This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4. I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose. This is also a \"horror\" film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight. My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared.<br /><br />The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries. It cannot be that high in demand. <br /><br />The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is British and half the time she is

{"value":"Although it has been 2 years, I still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it while browsing through the new releases at Blockbuster. We decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable. Although it has been quite some time since I viewed the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no true plot), and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie.

{"value":"This was really a very bad movie. I am a huge fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two 'Demons' films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad. It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the *** wife drove me mad, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film. I turned it off about three quarters of the way through because I was very, very BORED!

{"value":"Four best friends young male chauvinist pigs (with the emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a NYC diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable \"whipping\". Although the film's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had, overall the flick doesn't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story. One of those one-man band flix with a dozen producers, \"Whipped\" is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think \"The Man Show\" is Emmy material.","finished_norm":["four","well","friend","young","male","chauvinist","pig","with","the","emphasi","on","pig","meet","weekli","at","a","nyc","diner","to","recount","their","date","sexploit","in","thi","misanthrop","and","viscer","comedi","peet","be","the","common","denomin","who","date","the","three","bachelor","in","the","group","which","lead","to","conflict","and","the","inevit","whip","although","the","film","premis","have","potenti","and","there","be","some","funni","moment","to","be","have","overal","the","flick","doe","not","work","especi","in","the","end","where","the","girl","be","make","to","appear","no","well","than","the","gui","which","run","contrari","to","the","crux","of","the","stori","on","of","that","oneman","band","flix","with","a","dozen","produc","whip","be","like","to","be","enjoi","onli","by","the","kind","of","young","male","who","think","the","man","show","be","emmi","materi"],"filtered":["four","well","friend","young","male","chauvinist","pig","emphasi","pig","meet","weekli","nyc","diner","recount","date","sexploit","thi","misanthrop","viscer","comedi","peet","common","denomin","date","three","bachelor","group","lead","conflict","inevit","whip","although","film","premis","potenti","funni","moment","overal","flick","doe","work","especi","end","girl","make","appear","well","gui","run","contrari","crux","stori","oneman","band","flix","dozen","produc","whip","like","enjoi","onli","kind","young","male","think","man","show","emmi","materi"],"filtered2":["four","well","friend","young","male","chauvinist","pig","emphasi","pig","meet","weekli","nyc","diner","recount","date","sexploit","misanthrop","viscer","comedi","peet","common","denomin","date","three","bachelor","group","lead","conflict","inevit","whip","although","premis","potenti","funni","moment","overal","flick","doe","work","especi","end","girl","make","appear","well","gui","run","contrari","crux","stori","oneman","band","flix","dozen","produc","whip","like","enjoi","onli","kind","young","male","think","man","show","emmi","materi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,11,12,17,18,20,24,28,45,48,55,62,84,122,127,135,137,157,161,170,188,200,224,237,257,261,267,350,410,412,484,537,547,606,647,649,927,939,1323,1331,2252,2585,3188,3255,3708,3757,4647,4935,6379,6399,6908,7400,7512,8054],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,11,12,17,18,20,24,28,45,48,55,62,84,122,127,135,137,157,161,170,188,200,224,237,257,261,267,350,410,412,484,537,547,606,647,649,927,939,1323,1331,2252,2585,3188,3255,3708,3757,4647,4935,6379,6399,6908,7400,7512,8054],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.8162961064622165,1.6955116224012472,1.9536997889255368,2.0226120445069267,2.2212694515902225,2.2489347673732487,2.4359679371086367,4.732488142874176,2.2939035841256437,2.3360150694757706,2.4323182980210873,2.4214486257841834,2.5378812223426954,2.5308211829319704,2.689504733779216,2.640097787510554,2.7602659523229094,2.7085302779237206,2.7085302779237206,3.0135689919434205,3.2070272508030975,3.107414446935464,3.291526514503207,3.424750734647968,3.432149042129413,3.584239140143704,7.349324292426565,7.275012338650383,4.251780369798478,3.969732115064953,4.383707912841026,4.513582994262438,5.014723312293965,10.926544013076883,11.209845047202936,5.521540914662417,5.695894301807195,5.907203395474402,6.0662680901040895,6.342521466732247,6.489124940924123,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.982080342507922E-4,1.980323920911722E-4,1.9808128781854373E-4,1.9804146714364122E-4,1.980602094193927E-4,1.9803130020030506E-4,1.9809289068399772E-4,1.980018363726987E-4,1.9803243394329382E-4,1.98237079004905E-4,1.9981003252786682E-4,1.980327610416649E-4,1.9822031058076123E-4,1.9824096171727905E-4,1.9815090602457136E-4,1.9804224720031677E-4,1.9811038139259552E-4,1.9820361281160047E-4,1.9805247126764285E-4,1.9805174716815778E-4,1.9822992482167908E-4,1.980715899312674E-4,1.9807188969545332E-4,1.9819877666871465E-4,1.9805254271015624E-4,1.9824333118607782E-4,1.9810210459216484E-4,1.9803194825949067E-4,1.9812172748195068E-4,1.9818219708903905E-4,1.9807256150447322E-4,1.9817864485507678E-4,1.9827594562220641E-4,1.9845997644414877E-4,1.981017622661587E-4,1.9804212708455439E-4,1.9811353245559576E-4,1.9806224011196367E-4,1.9800204770295608E-4,1.9805240993401544E-4,1.9825089229392255E-4,1.9814213920018098E-4,1.9817909647006302E-4,1.9801190224276897E-4,1.980524602937261E-4,1.9804205261315317E-4,1.9810908805238016E-4,1.9814344041586428E-4,1.9810314906692177E-4,1.9807174936779603E-4,1.980425423559316E-4,1.9

{"value":"Oh... my... god... this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie I have ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole film just doesn't make sense. Couple this with mediocre directing, really strange scenes (such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in), and thoroughly abysmal dialog (\"Look!\" \"Musta peed his pants!\"), and you get one complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing Mr. Atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars. But this is part of the movie's charm.

{"value":"Most of the French films I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but that's okay. I found them interesting, well-photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, I did at one point wonder if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film ever made! It seemed that way.)<br /><br />This movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening. But then it became talk, talk and more talk....which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery. After awhile, I almost fell asleep watching this.<br /><br />Actually, the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room. Thus, if you love plays, you should like this...but I want a little more bang for a murder

{"value":"If you liked the first two films, then I'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one. This is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video, probably TV made sequel. The still idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is still living with his family and he has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. Then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too. Now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger.

{"value":"It's interesting to see what shape Pierce Brosnan's career was in before Bond arrived on the scene. In this \"tense\" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick, who works leading ghetto kids on \"confidence courses\". He romances a woman, who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s kid called Eric. The woman's drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce.<br /><br />At one stage Pierce is innocently making \"vegeburgers\". The husband enters. Pierce resumes making vegeburgers. The husband then assaults Pierce. Little chunks of half-eaten vegeburger call fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome.

The Plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />The cast couldn't have been more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason.

{"value":"This movie was long and boring. Surprising that it was selected for Cannes, although they tend to like pretentiousness. Point is that contrary to other Dutch stars of the arty genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels utterly empty. Even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever. A long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. The story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems I couldn't identify with at all. The actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times. Leopold tried, but she is not the talent I hoped she would be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop?

{"value":"Daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior. She starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative (who she resembles) that was burned for being a werewolf. She goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats. She does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she extracts her violent and furry revenge.<br /><br />'Werewolf Woman' isn't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film. A fun time could be had by harping the bad acting / dubbing / translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production.

{"value":"The writer/director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film. I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey, because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun. <br /><br />The story was awful, the characters were very one dimensional. For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your day job.

{"value":"...but a lousy film. As Maltin says this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. Well, it is serious...TOO serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality)...the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again. I actually dozed off a few times! The film is sooooo dull!

{"value":"Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.","finished_norm":["have","grow","up","in","texa","and","littl","than","mile","from","what","us","to","be","gillei","i","can","tell","you","that","thi","movi","be","nauseat","the","major","of","texan","do","not","live","like","thi","movi","indic","the","plot","be","weak","and","the","fake","accent","be","amus","and","it","reinforc","the","stereotyp","imag","that","all","texan","be","beer","drink","honkytonkin","redneck","the","horribli","fake","texa","accent","be","what","kill","it","for","me","true","there","be","a","certain","texa","twang","to","much","texan","accent","but","thi","peopl","overdo","it","you","ca","not","get","someon","from","new","jersei","and","ohio","to","do","texa","accent","it","just","doe","not","work","john","travolta","should","have","stick","to","discodanc","or","the","debra","winger","be","much","convinc","a","wonder","girl","than","she","be","a","a","texan"],"filtered":["grow","texa","littl","mile","us","gillei","tell","thi","movi","nauseat","major","texan","live","like","thi","movi","indic","plot","weak","fake","accent","amus","reinforc","stereotyp","imag","texan","beer","drink","honkytonkin","redneck","horribli","fake","texa","accent","kill","true","certain","texa","twang","much","texan","accent","thi","peopl","overdo","ca","get","someon","new","jersei","ohio","texa","accent","doe","work","john","travolta","stick","discodanc","debra","winger","much","convinc","wonder","girl","texan"],"filtered2":["grow","texa","littl","mile","us","gillei","tell","nauseat","major","texan","live","like","indic","plot","weak","fake","accent","amus","reinforc","stereotyp","imag","texan","beer","drink","honkytonkin","redneck","horribli","fake","texa","accent","kill","true","certain","texa","twang","texan","accent","peopl","overdo","ca","get","someon","new","jersei","ohio","texa","accent","doe","work","john","travolta","stick","discodanc","debra","winger","convinc","wonder","girl","texan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,14,18,23,32,48,56,76,81,84,87,90,116,139,175,291,304,379,404,416,478,559,561,604,639,667,708,742,774,1206,1276,1419,1950,1977,2035,3589,3691,5054,5645,7118],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,14,18,23,32,48,56,76,81,84,87,90,116,139,175,291,304,379,404,416,478,559,561,604,639,667,708,742,774,1206,1276,1419,1950,1977,2035,3589,3691,5054,5645,7118],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3711311285073675,1.6955116224012472,1.8610609350701788,2.1337665533324026,1.949757232424728,2.2212694515902225,2.115024371522662,2.0477128419653545,2.2466628996789315,2.2939035841256437,2.3791142619576227,3.016831637578237,2.871119826396843,3.1272886331425473,3.1419947805322432,3.1401446412440817,3.3243163373261977,14.29111078649879,3.4725585804672896,3.5727776966246974,7.232905520254718,3.6652429242967908,3.6683728173057184,3.7740817043309423,3.753391311073496,4.364659717870332,4.297765483040301,4.436351646326448,20.05889324917586,4.900964426937307,4.979216623837056,5.649374286172302,5.7446844659766265,6.137727054086234,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.50808460972783E-4,2.505862069158133E-4,2.506480785860337E-4,2.505976903047264E-4,2.506214064035925E-4,2.5058482525906577E-4,2.506627606186687E-4,2.5054754232407145E-4,2.505862598746464E-4,2.508452136206053E-4,2.5283559737960366E-4,2.505866737783479E-4,2.508239951938733E-4,2.508501267267698E-4,2.5073617206405776E-4,2.5059867737275824E-4,2.506848930096251E-4,2.508028661725361E-4,2.5061161470196704E-4,2.5061069844103885E-4,2.508361608610075E-4,2.506358070744794E-4,2.506361863900526E-4,2.5079674661457357E-4,2.5061170510388693E-4,2.508531250049424E-4,2.5067441971279007E-4,2.50585645300128E-4,2.506992501229479E-4,2.507757671478343E-4,2.5063703648367763E-4,2.5077127222240684E-4,2.508943946566083E-4,2.5112726355820144E-4,2.506739865403454E-4,2.5059852538068784E-4,2.50688880301384E-4,2.5062397600113863E-4,2.505478097371297E-4,2.5061153709162826E-4,2.508626926787704E-4,2.5072507870075754E-4,2.507718436869293E-4,2.5056027947365384E-4,2.5061160081579347E-4,2.505984311460742E-4,2.50683256442923E-4,2.5072672523291837E-4,2.5067574137014513E-4,2.5063600882225677E-4,2.5059905085673826E-4,2.511124876152886E-4,2.5066210879661816E-4,2.506115433759327E-4,2.506607664081856E-4,2.505859016833082E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867716E-4,2.505994026657311E-4,2.5058575864248515E-4,2.5078623326048414E-4,2.506855613798027E-4,2.505856538910584E-4,2.505601773897301E-4,2.505349807961615E-4,2.5076150407809313E-4,2.505979299011485E-4,2.5071184239933207E-4,2.5078541996925854E-4,2.506716435043774E-4,2.5061187530261997E-4,2.505605058574262E-4,2.506246038642507E-4,2.505603709024345E-4,2.5057351990548176E-4,2.5056051294891304E-4,2.5072316173520954E-4,2.506485384985989

{"value":"I'll just put it out here, that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen. In 1950, Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs, add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. \"Put it together and what do you get?\" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with, \"and they lived happily ever after.\" not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like \"A twist in time\" which was moderate but better than this. Also, What do we care of Anastasia?
