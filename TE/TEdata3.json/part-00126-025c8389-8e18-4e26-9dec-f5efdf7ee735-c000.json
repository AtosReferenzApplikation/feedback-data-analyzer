{"value":"Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the more (most!)open-minded movie-viewers...Movies are my passion, and I am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-place...I also feel the need to add that they often ask ME for advice about movies whenever I get there, and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult-movie-area...I love to rent strange stuff, and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult-movie-video-place.He told me he thought I had to see this, and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a Jodorowsky(one of my favorites!)atmosphere, I rented it.<br /><br />The vote I gave here is not really fair, because I did not think it was awful, I just did not know how to rate it otherwise. A question mark would have been more appropriate...<br /><br />This is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach: I actually felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned? Still I did not want to turn it off, or maybe I just couldn't because I was fascinated in a nasty way...<br /><br />I do not ever wanna see this movie again.<br /><br />Not awful,a 1 as I said.Just

{"value":"I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that \"I, Robot\" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too).<br /><br />I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as \"retread\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).<br /><br />\"I, Robot\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true

{"value":"Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister, she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them. VCR'S had just became a household item and we didn't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them.<br /><br />I was at a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie I don't have and I knew this movie looked familiar. I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought. She had sold it years ago in a yard sale I am guessing - who knows.<br /><br />I didn't recall anything at all about it and I watched it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. I am not sure how I felt about it as a kid but I am sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I'd watch and enjoy anything back then.<br /><br />I am a horror freak, but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it \"good\" and this one fell very short. It was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types. What death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you're lucky you get that much.<br /><br />The story is good and I have seen a few with similar plots, so I think this one should be buried and forgotten.

{"value":"I'm a huge fan of war movies, and, as a Vietnam combat vet, have some experience with the technical details. I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them. Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives. The opening scene particularly annoyed me. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately. Yelling, \"Stop dialing\" is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious. As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination. Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen. Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed these things out in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why \"La La land\" is so

{"value":"***SPOILERS*** Let's start with the \"good\" of this film--the serviceable acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is awful (this isn't aided by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing my head off as he was expressing his \"fury\" over having lost a bunch of money; horrid performance. Patrick Muldoon isn't much better, and his \"it's a hostile takeover\" line (that's the remainder of the title of this film) was delivered about as badly as one could do it. There are no other main characters, but no other actor/actress distinguished him/herself in this film. We next come to the plot. This should tell you all you need to know: In the original \"Rage and Honor,\" Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the inner city. Now, she's a C.I.A. agent (or was it some other governmental agency--sorry, but this film was so bad that I don't even remember). Hmmm...I can imagine what that C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What past job experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you're hired! I only give it a \"2\" because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end (though we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, will be caught).","finished_norm":["spoiler","let","start","with","the","good","of","thi","filmth","servic","act","of","cynthia","rothrock","and","richard","norton","the","rest","of","the","act","be","aw","thi","be","not","aid","by","the","atroci","script","the","wrong","culprit","be","the","villain","buntao","the","head","of","a","asian","crime","syndic","plai","by","fran","tumbuan","i","be","laugh","my","head","off","a","he","be","express","hi","furi","over","have","lose","a","bunch","of","monei","horrid","perform","patrick","muldoon","be","not","much","well","and","hi","it","a","hostil","takeov","line","that","the","remaind","of","the","titl","of","thi","film","be","deliv","about","a","badli","a","on","can","do","it","there","be","no","other","main","charact","but","no","other","actoractress","distinguish","himherself","in","thi","film","we","next","come","to","the","plot","thi","should","tell","you","all","you","ne","to","know","in","the","origin","rage","and","honor","cynthia","rothrock","who","plai","chri","fairchild","be","a","teacher","in","the","inner","citi","now","she","a","cia","agent","or","be","it","some","other","government","agencysorri","but","thi","film","be","so","bad","that","i","do","not","even","rememb","hmmmi","can","imagin","what","that","cia","applic","process","be","like","interview","what","past","job","experi","do","you","have","chri","i","be","a","teacher","interview","okai","you","re","hire","i","onli","give","it","a","becaus","of","some","decent","act","and","a","nice","plot","twist","at","the","end","though","we","know","that","tommi","muldoon","the","secret","villain","will","be","catch"],"filtered":["spoiler","let","start","good","thi","filmth","servic","act","cynthia","rothrock","richard","norton","rest","act","aw","thi","aid","atroci","script","wrong","culprit","villain","buntao","head","asian","crime","syndic","plai","fran","tumbuan","laugh","head","express","hi","furi","lose","bunch","monei","horrid","perform","patrick","muldoon","much","well","hi","hostil","takeov","line","remaind","titl","thi","film","deliv","badli","main","charact","actoractress","distinguish","himherself","thi","film","next","come","plot","thi","tell","ne","know","origin","rage","honor","cynthia","rothrock","plai","chri","fairchild","teacher","inner","citi","cia","agent","government","agencysorri","thi","film","bad","even","rememb","hmmmi","imagin","cia","applic","process","like","interview","past","job","experi","chri","teacher","interview","okai","re","hire","onli","give","becaus","decent","act","nice","plot","twist","end","though","know","tommi","muldoon","secret","villain","catch"],"filtered2":["spoiler","let","start","good","filmth","servic","act","cynthia","rothrock","richard","norton","rest","act","aw","aid","atroci","script","wrong","culprit","villain","buntao","head","asian","crime","syndic","plai","fran","tumbuan","laugh","head","express","furi","lose","bunch","monei","horrid","perform","patrick","muldoon","well","hostil","takeov","line","remaind","titl","deliv","badli","main","charact","actoractress","distinguish","himherself","next","come","plot","tell","ne","know","origin","rage","honor","cynthia","rothrock","plai","chri","fairchild","teacher","inner","citi","cia","agent","government","agencysorri","bad","even","rememb","hmmmi","imagin","cia","applic","process","like","interview","past","job","experi","chri","teacher","interview","okai","re","hire","onli","give","becaus","decent","act","nice","plot","twist","end","though","know","tommi","muldoon","secret","villain","catch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,9,10,11,20,21,22,24,25,26,30,32,34,40,68,69,71,77,86,90,105,107,110,124,126,133,138,179,191,208,221,226,262,264,289,290,297,309,333,340,419,435,440,448,490,512,517,520,595,641,753,798,846,1014,1069,1091,1114,1140,1219,1421,1492,1632,1898,1951,2050,2492,2506,2757,2894,2910,3260,3719,4890,4949,5152,7005,7496,7674,8075,8318,8516],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,9,10,11,20,21,22,24,25,26,30,32,34,40,68,69,71,77,86,90,105,107,110,124,126,133,138,179,191,208,221,226,262,264,289,290,297,309,333,340,419,435,440,448,490,512,517,520,595,641,753,798,846,1014,1069,1091,1114,1140,1219,1421,1492,1632,1898,1951,2050,2492,2506,2757,2894,2910,3260,3719,4890,4949,5152,7005,7496,7674,8075,8318,8516],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.165345040023057,3.4860466360051467,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.3364419891718522,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,3.2569937516641474,2.0064197866819473,2.12703252115

{"value":"Can I please say first of all, that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up to IMDb specifically to review it. And my review? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- Nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together. Remember the episode of South Park that featured manatees writing Family Guy using 'idea balls'? Did these manatees also write Unholy? Its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but had no idea how to link them all together, and then to make things make even less sense, included a Donnie Darko-esquire time travel theme to the ending, messing up the chronology.<br /><br />I could tell from early on that this was a bad movie. Special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to DVD. The acting wasn't great, but in fairness I've seen worse. I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the evil Nazi butcher guy was just comic.<br /><br />I don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even into the horror genre. But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story had been well told, this would have been a good movie. But it has been over hyped.

{"value":"Republic pictures comes late in the game to the \"werewolf\" er Werecat genre. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a \"catman\". Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead. Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not.<br /><br />Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections. The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer, he's the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time (just over an hour) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it. As good as the talk is, I just wished someone would do something.

{"value":"If Todd Sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre, I would change my rating to an eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody. I could probably crap out alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's dad and the other dad walk, I repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies. This is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, the ex-marine turns around, says \"God you're a horny bastard\", and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm's length away. She then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Still, I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else.","finished_norm":["if","todd","sheet","be","to","come","out","and","admit","that","thi","movi","be","intend","to","spoof","the","zombi","genr","i","would","chang","my","rate","to","a","eight","try","to","imagin","a","movi","where","everi","scene","line","and","even","everi","act","nuanc","be","design","to","be","a","parodi","i","can","probabl","crap","out","alphabet","soup","rearrang","what","be","leav","of","the","letter","and","still","have","a","well","script","two","scene","in","particular","come","to","mind","when","i","think","of","thi","movi","spoiler","alert","on","be","when","mike","dad","and","the","other","dad","walk","i","repeat","walk","down","a","staircas","jam","pack","with","zombi","thi","be","a","small","staircas","and","even","though","thei","brush","up","against","the","flail","undead","noth","happen","to","them","when","thei","reach","the","end","the","exmarin","turn","around","sai","god","you","re","a","horni","bastard","and","shoot","onli","on","the","other","be","in","the","militari","complex","the","girl","stab","a","zombi","with","a","machet","and","be","immedi","surround","the","camera","move","around","her","for","roughli","forti","second","while","she","be","surround","by","zombi","at","a","arm","length","awai","she","then","almost","casual","run","out","from","the","crowd","and","join","the","other","human","spoiler","alert","over","thi","scene","must","be","see","to","be","believ","still","i","enjoi","thi","movi","a","much","a","almost","ani","comedi","just","becaus","it","so","damn","funni","kudo","to","todd","sheet","for","get","so","mani","peopl","in","hi","movi","and","have","the","drive","to","make","it","but","not","realli","for","anyth","els"],"filtered":["todd","sheet","come","admit","thi","movi","intend","spoof","zombi","genr","chang","rate","eight","try","imagin","movi","everi","scene","line","even","everi","act","nuanc","design","parodi","probabl","crap","alphabet","soup","rearrang","leav","letter","still","well","script","two","scene","particular","come","mind","think","thi","movi","spoiler","alert","mike","dad","dad","walk","repeat","walk","staircas","jam","pack","zombi","thi","small","staircas","even","though","thei","brush","flail","undead","noth","happen","thei","reach","end","exmarin","turn","around","sai","god","re","horni","bastard","shoot","onli","militari","complex","girl","stab","zombi","machet","immedi","surround","camera","move","around","roughli","forti","second","surround","zombi","arm","length","awai","almost","casual","run","crowd","join","human","spoiler","alert","thi","scene","must","see","believ","still","enjoi","thi","movi","much","almost","ani","comedi","becaus","damn","funni","kudo","todd","sheet","get","mani","peopl","hi","movi","drive","make","realli","anyth","els"],"filtered2":["todd","sheet","come","admit","intend","spoof","zombi","genr","chang","rate","eight","try","imagin","everi","scene","line","even","everi","act","nuanc","design","parodi","probabl","crap","alphabet","soup","rearrang","leav","letter","still","well","script","two","scene","particular","come","mind","think","spoiler","alert","mike","dad","dad","walk","repeat","walk","staircas","jam","pack","zombi","small","staircas","even","though","brush","flail","undead","noth","happen","reach","end","exmarin","turn","around","god","re","horni","bastard","shoot","onli","militari","complex","girl","stab","zombi","machet","immedi","surround","camera","move","around","roughli","forti","second","surround","zombi","arm","length","awai","almost","casual","run","crowd","join","human","spoiler","alert","scene","must","see","believ","still","enjoi","almost","ani","comedi","becaus","damn","funni","kudo","todd","sheet","get","mani","peopl","drive","make","realli","anyth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,11,12,13,19,20,21,22,23,24,27,34,36,47,49,50,62,64,68,74,77,84,85,86,91,94,96,98,104,107,117,127,131,137,141,148,155,196,200,202,231,238,268,275,278,292,294,313,340,352,363,461,467,490,681,691,832,889,926,934,947,984,986,988,992,1016,1275,1294,1319,1327,1472,1507,1547,1587,1651,1664,1720,2207,3157,3377,3472,3653,3668,3900,4014,4063,4207,4228,4432,4480,4574,4993,6856,7691,8046,8509],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,11,12,13,19,20,21,22,23,24,27,34,36,47,49,50,62,64,68,74,77,84,85,86,91,94,96,98,104,107,117,127,131,137,141,148,155,196,200,202,231,238,268,275,278,292,294,313,340,352,363,461,467,490,681,691,832,889,926,934,947,984,986,988,992,1016,1275,1294,1319,1327,1472,1507,1547,1587,1651,1664,1720,2207,3157,3377,3472,3653,3668,3900,4014,4063,420

{"value":"I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more Buster Keaton films for IMDb than any other person. Every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions have I reviewed, so you can tell I am a major fan. It's because of this that I found this episode so painful and hard to watch. I loved this man's films and kept thinking \"Buster, how could you?!\". Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this god-awful episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay--appearing in Beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserved much better. The show is supposed to be funny but isn't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch--particularly with Keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick.

{"value":"Dolph Lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches Boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother,who was well thought of in the community, however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact on the basis of his performance here, one would forget Lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. That said the material gives Lundgren nothing to work with, in fact, Lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent. However the movie is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot not given enough exploration (Too much boring B.S around Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually really good (As is newcomer Danielle Brett) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie particularly disappointing.

{"value":"I was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. It appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends, and from there casually decided to make a movie. <br /><br />It is frequently unwatchable. Lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon probably would have livened things up. Perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed.<br /><br />Of course, the bikers terrorize a small town. Fights, murder, a cowardly cop, a goofy mechanic, etc. One of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws.<br /><br />The script has nothing to offer. One scene features a biker assaulting a woman, yelling in the lady's face \"You're all the same! You're all the same!\". We come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares \"You're all the same!\". Couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say??<br /><br />At the end the good guys have killed the bad guys. We also learn that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Susie is going away to college, and we abruptly learn that Joe's wedding is still on (but with a different bride).

{"value":"From the opening dialog and scenes, I knew I knew I was in for a train wreck. Didn't want to look, but couldn't turn away. If it weren't for the meer eye candy of this film, I would have given one star. The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched, added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film. But this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.<br /><br />If you were stuck out in the woods, your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do?<br /><br />A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Have sex with your friends girlfriend. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. D.) Bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel. E.) All of the above.<br /><br />According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are that far fetched. In fact, all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store. Stay away.

{"value":"Battlestar Gallactica was so great because it had tight writing, a great look, excellent actors, and interesting stories... AND yeah, had hot men and women running around in and out of uniform.<br /><br />Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors smoking up a storm to give them \"character.\" Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, that is a Ford Focus sitting in the background). Lots and lots of teenage angst. LOTS of gyrating naked women (but in the background. Which I'm sure will be cut for the series) and a token view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker took my attention at all. At an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it was going to be over.<br /><br />So what exactly is it that's supposed to bring me back? The science fiction? It's awfully light on that. The actors? Besides Polly Walker's fine turn, there isn't much interesting being done here. There aren't even any \"hotties\" in the cast, except for maybe Esai, although for the younger set he's pretty old, since he's over 25.<br /><br />I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils over at SciFi and get to work making this more than The OC on another

{"value":"Wow! Only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar \"Showgirls.\" I mean where to begin? The indescibably horrid theme song? Pia Zadora's non-expressions throughout the movie? The fact that despite being set in Los Angeles, aka \"land of the casting couch\" EVERY single man (and woman!) is fawning all over themselves to sleep with Pia Zadora, by any contrived means necessary? Or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they're either mind-numbingly stupid (Pia) or obvious despicable sleazeball (everyone else)? And given that this flick was written by actual \"screenwriters (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie-making industry (who the Hell would admire and kiss up to a SCREENWRITER?)<br /><br />But it's (unintentionally) funny as hell though. The \"breakdown\" scene alone will have you giggling, and after seeing the climatic \"I'm not the only one who had to **** her way to the top\" scene at the \"Awards\" (all done in the usual bargain-basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia actually reused that speech when she \"won\" her Golden Globe. It's fitting and that would totally make my day.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a fan of bad, tashy camp, give this otherwise tacky movie a try.","finished_norm":["wow","onli","a","movi","thi","ludicr","aw","can","inspir","the","similar","showgirl","i","mean","where","to","begin","the","indescib","horrid","theme","song","pia","zadora","nonexpress","throughout","the","movi","the","fact","that","despit","be","set","in","lo","angel","aka","land","of","the","cast","couch","everi","singl","man","and","woman","be","fawn","all","over","themselv","to","sleep","with","pia","zadora","by","ani","contriv","mean","necessari","or","what","about","the","fact","that","everi","person","in","the","movi","be","total","unsympathet","becaus","thei","re","either","mindnumbingli","stupid","pia","or","obviou","despic","sleazebal","everyon","els","and","give","that","thi","flick","be","write","by","actual","screenwrit","sorta","it","show","a","shock","lack","of","understand","of","the","moviemak","industri","who","the","hell","would","admir","and","kiss","up","to","a","screenwriterbr","br","but","it","unintention","funni","a","hell","though","the","breakdown","scene","alon","will","have","you","giggl","and","after","see","the","climat","i","be","not","the","onli","on","who","have","to","her","wai","to","the","top","scene","at","the","award","all","do","in","the","usual","bargainbas","act","level","we","expect","from","such","qualiti","thespian","a","pia","i","sincer","hope","that","our","dear","pia","actual","reus","that","speech","when","she","win","her","golden","globe","it","fit","and","that","would","total","make","my","daybr","br","anywai","if","you","re","a","fan","of","bad","tashi","camp","give","thi","otherwis","tacki","movi","a","try"],"filtered":["wow","onli","movi","thi","ludicr","aw","inspir","similar","showgirl","mean","begin","indescib","horrid","theme","song","pia","zadora","nonexpress","throughout","movi","fact","despit","set","lo","angel","aka","land","cast","couch","everi","singl","man","woman","fawn","themselv","sleep","pia","zadora","ani","contriv","mean","necessari","fact","everi","person","movi","total","unsympathet","becaus","thei","re","either","mindnumbingli","stupid","pia","obviou","despic","sleazebal","everyon","els","give","thi","flick","write","actual","screenwrit","sorta","show","shock","lack","understand","moviemak","industri","hell","admir","kiss","screenwriterbr","br","unintention","funni","hell","though","breakdown","scene","alon","giggl","see","climat","onli","wai","top","scene","award","usual","bargainbas","act","level","expect","qualiti","thespian","pia","sincer","hope","dear","pia","actual","reus","speech","win","golden","globe","fit","total","make","daybr","br","anywai","re","fan","bad","tashi","camp","give","thi","otherwis","tacki","movi","try"],"filtered2":["wow","onli","ludicr","aw","inspir","similar","showgirl","mean","begin","indescib","horrid","theme","song","pia","zadora","nonexpress","throughout","fact","despit","set","lo","angel","aka","land","cast","couch","everi","singl","man","woman","fawn","themselv","sleep","pia","zadora","ani","contriv","mean","necessari","fact","everi","person","total","unsympathet","becaus","re","either","mindnumbingli","stupid","pia","obviou","despic","sleazebal","everyon","els","give","flick","write","actual","screenwrit","sorta","show","shock","lack","understand","moviemak","industri","hell","admir","kiss","screenwriterbr","unintention","funni","hell","though","breakdown","scene","alon","giggl","see","climat","onli","wai","top","scene","award","usual","bargainbas","act","level","expect","qualiti","thespian","pia","sincer","hope","dear","pia","actual","reus","speech","win","golden","globe","fit","total","make","daybr","anywai","re","fan","bad","tashi","camp","give","otherwis","tacki","try"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,11,19,21,22,27,28,30,33,36,45,52,62,65,68,70,85,86,88,92,97,109,130,136,138,140,147,153,181,183,184,196,207,212,246,257,265,319,328,364,383,386,391,394,436,438,443,445,457,489,508,534,589,627,676,732,870,908,909,1003,1004,1036,1083,1180,1273,1394,1461,1499,1603,1714,1769,1860,1898,1983,2221,2261,2310,2891,3034,3563,3830,4000,4140,4275,4587,5059,5661,5913,6109,6263,6279,6428,6752],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,11,19,21,22,27,28,30,33,36,45,52,62,65,68,70,85,86,88,92,97,109,130,136,138,140,147,153,181,183,184,196,207,212,246,257,265,319,328,364,383,386,391,394,436,438,443,445,457,489,508,534,589,627,676,732,870,908,909,1003,1004,1036,1083,1180,1273,1394,1461,1499,1603,1714,1769,1860,1898,1983,2221,2261,2310,2891,3034,3563,3830,4000,4140,4275,4587,5059,5661,5913,6109,6263,6279,6428,6752],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.

{"value":"A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the fairly good makeup effects, there's really not much to it. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days... and once he's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.<br /><br />In any case, the movie has far worse problems than that--the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-TV-show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse.<br /><br />The only reason why I'm giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegna's character takes over, the movie develops a fun, campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feel, and the gangster's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch. The ending, if predictable, is also nicely mean. Avoid unless you're a King-o-Phile or are REALLY psyched up at the idea of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy

{"value":"86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema.<br /><br />I have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.<br /><br />Everything in this dire adaptation is overacted. And if it isn't the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you off the entire farce.<br /><br />As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.<br /><br />Bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.","finished_norm":["wast","minut","of","my","life","i","fall","asleep","the","time","i","attempt","watch","it","and","i","must","sai","i","be","not","on","to","ever","fall","asleep","in","the","cinemabr","br","i","have","never","see","such","a","pointless","plot","act","in","such","a","stilt","and","forc","manner","and","can","onli","surmis","that","the","actor","be","a","hardup","a","the","protagonist","writer","allegedli","be","in","the","film","itselfbr","br","everyth","in","thi","dire","adapt","be","overact","and","if","it","be","not","the","wooden","act","almost","a","though","you","can","see","the","teleprompt","then","the","set","itself","which","be","overlit","and","interfer","in","utterli","unnecessari","wai","and","overdress","to","a","unimagin","extent","be","enough","to","put","you","off","the","entir","farcebr","br","a","to","the","suppos","shock","of","a","detect","under","disguis","ani","person","who","doe","not","see","that","a","good","a","the","entir","rest","of","thi","ludicr","plot","telegraph","light","year","in","advanc","should","check","their","eyesight","immediatelybr","br","bad","act","and","from","two","veri","decent","actor","coupl","with","the","hypercoddl","branagh","trademark","overdirect","be","enough","to","make","you","want","to","us","real","bullet","rather","than","blank","yourselfbr","br","on","top","of","it","all","there","be","a","complet","risibl","underton","of","homoerotica","in","thi","heighten","toward","the","end","of","it","all","i","can","hope","for","be","that","thi","be","such","a","flop","that","peopl","sha","not","try","to","emul","thi","level","of","cinema","ever","again"],"filtered":["wast","minut","life","fall","asleep","time","attempt","watch","must","sai","ever","fall","asleep","cinemabr","br","never","see","pointless","plot","act","stilt","forc","manner","onli","surmis","actor","hardup","protagonist","writer","allegedli","film","itselfbr","br","everyth","thi","dire","adapt","overact","wooden","act","almost","though","see","teleprompt","set","overlit","interfer","utterli","unnecessari","wai","overdress","unimagin","extent","enough","put","entir","farcebr","br","suppos","shock","detect","disguis","ani","person","doe","see","good","entir","rest","thi","ludicr","plot","telegraph","light","year","advanc","check","eyesight","immediatelybr","br","bad","act","two","veri","decent","actor","coupl","hypercoddl","branagh","trademark","overdirect","enough","make","want","us","real","bullet","rather","blank","yourselfbr","br","top","complet","risibl","underton","homoerotica","thi","heighten","toward","end","hope","thi","flop","peopl","sha","try","emul","thi","level","cinema","ever"],"filtered2":["wast","minut","life","fall","asleep","time","attempt","watch","must","ever","fall","asleep","cinemabr","never","see","pointless","plot","act","stilt","forc","manner","onli","surmis","actor","hardup","protagonist","writer","allegedli","itselfbr","everyth","dire","adapt","overact","wooden","act","almost","though","see","teleprompt","set","overlit","interfer","utterli","unnecessari","wai","overdress","unimagin","extent","enough","put","entir","farcebr","suppos","shock","detect","disguis","ani","person","doe","see","good","entir","rest","ludicr","plot","telegraph","light","year","advanc","check","eyesight","immediatelybr","bad","act","two","veri","decent","actor","coupl","hypercoddl","branagh","trademark","overdirect","enough","make","want","us","real","bullet","rather","blank","yourselfbr","top","complet","risibl","underton","homoerotica","heighten","toward","end","hope","flop","peopl","sha","try","emul","level","cinema","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,8,9,11,15,18,21,23,24,27,32,33,36,37,41,42,44,47,56,57,59,75,80,86,89,93,103,109,131,141,149,153,159,160,169,177,181,193,198,226,253,287,309,338,353,364,409,445,505,508,531,563,701,816,891,1046,1062,1081,1281,1346,1394,1415,1525,1747,1909,1956,2040,2275,2353,2634,2640,2700,3424,4520,5125,5515,5769,6068,6544,6626,7347,8016,8178],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,8,9,11,15,18,21,23,24,27,32,33,36,37,41,42,44,47,56,57,59,75,80,86,89,93,103,109,131,141,149,153,159,160,169,177,181,193,198,226,253,287,309,338,353,364,409,445,505,508,531,563,701,816,891,1046,1062,1081,1281,1346,1394,1415,1525,1747,1909,1956,2040,2275,2353,2634,2640,2700,3424,4520,5125,5515,5769,6068,6544,6626,7347,8016,8178],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,3.4860466360051467,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.300270

{"value":"With the runaway success of \"God's Army\", every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now. In the case of the recent \"The Other Side of Heaven\", this wasn't at all a bad thing. That film, while not great, was quite good. \"The Singles Ward\", however, is not.<br /><br />Telling the story of a young, divorced Mormon guy thrust back into single life, the writing and shooting style of \"The Singles Ward\" is, in many ways, very similar to the 80s comedy \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". However, the similarities end there. While \"Ferris Bueller\" was funny, original, and well-acted (as far as stupid comedies like this ever are), \"The Singles Ward\" is completely the opposite. It tries very hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seem to be thrown in to fill out the time. And the acting, while not awful, is amaturish at best.<br /><br />In addition, if you're not either a Mormon yourself, or very, VERY familiar with Mormon culture, you won't get hardly anything at all. Whereas \"God's Army\" and \"The Other Side of Heaven\" were appealing to a broad range of viewers, both inside and outside of the Mormon church, this film is most definitely one big inside joke, and even if you get it, it's just not that funny.","finished_norm":["with","the","runawai","success","of","god","armi","everi","mormon","with","a","camera","seem","to","be","try","to","make","a","movi","now","in","the","case","of","the","recent","the","other","side","of","heaven","thi","be","not","at","all","a","bad","thing","that","film","while","not","great","be","quit","good","the","singl","ward","howev","be","notbr","br","tell","the","stori","of","a","young","divorc","mormon","gui","thrust","back","into","singl","life","the","write","and","shoot","styl","of","the","singl","ward","be","in","mani","wai","veri","similar","to","the","comedi","ferri","bueller","dai","off","howev","the","similar","end","there","while","ferri","bueller","be","funni","origin","and","wellact","a","far","a","stupid","comedi","like","thi","ever","be","the","singl","ward","be","complet","the","opposit","it","try","veri","hard","to","be","funni","howev","of","the","gag","either","fall","flat","or","be","clich","and","joke","you","have","probabl","hear","a","million","time","befor","the","other","seem","to","be","throw","in","to","fill","out","the","time","and","the","act","while","not","aw","be","amaturish","at","bestbr","br","in","addit","if","you","re","not","either","a","mormon","yourself","or","veri","veri","familiar","with","mormon","cultur","you","wo","not","get","hardli","anyth","at","all","wherea","god","armi","and","the","other","side","of","heaven","be","appeal","to","a","broad","rang","of","viewer","both","insid","and","outsid","of","the","mormon","church","thi","film","be","much","definit","on","big","insid","joke","and","even","if","you","get","it","it","just","not","that","funni"],"filtered":["runawai","success","god","armi","everi","mormon","camera","seem","try","make","movi","case","recent","side","heaven","thi","bad","thing","film","great","quit","good","singl","ward","howev","notbr","br","tell","stori","young","divorc","mormon","gui","thrust","back","singl","life","write","shoot","styl","singl","ward","mani","wai","veri","similar","comedi","ferri","bueller","dai","howev","similar","end","ferri","bueller","funni","origin","wellact","far","stupid","comedi","like","thi","ever","singl","ward","complet","opposit","try","veri","hard","funni","howev","gag","either","fall","flat","clich","joke","probabl","hear","million","time","befor","seem","throw","fill","time","act","aw","amaturish","bestbr","br","addit","re","either","mormon","veri","veri","familiar","mormon","cultur","wo","get","hardli","anyth","wherea","god","armi","side","heaven","appeal","broad","rang","viewer","insid","outsid","mormon","church","thi","film","much","definit","big","insid","joke","even","get","funni"],"filtered2":["runawai","success","god","armi","everi","mormon","camera","seem","try","make","case","recent","side","heaven","bad","thing","great","quit","good","singl","ward","howev","notbr","tell","stori","young","divorc","mormon","gui","thrust","back","singl","life","write","shoot","styl","singl","ward","mani","wai","veri","similar","comedi","ferri","bueller","dai","howev","similar","end","ferri","bueller","funni","origin","wellact","far","stupid","comedi","like","ever","singl","ward","complet","opposit","try","veri","hard","funni","howev","gag","either","fall","flat","clich","joke","probabl","hear","million","time","befor","seem","throw","fill","time","act","aw","amaturish","bestbr","addit","re","either","mormon","veri","veri","familiar","mormon","cultur","wo","get","hardli","anyth","wherea","god","armi","side","heaven","appeal","broad","rang","viewer","insid","outsid","mormon","church","definit","big","insid","joke","even","get","funni"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,8,9,15,17,21,24,29,33,35,36,44,50,51,55,62,63,65,68,69,75,79,82,85,90,101,103,104,113,117,120,127,132,135,136,138,148,169,171,207,214,216,231,279,288,310,352,380,392,406,425,443,532,553,562,589,593,665,690,791,807,880,890,982,998,1095,1130,1185,1543,1554,1581,1652,2457,2517,2576,2785,3003,3242,4644,5312,5954,6298,6660],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,8,9,15,17,21,24,29,33,35,36,44,50,51,55,62,63,65,68,69,75,79,82,85,90,101,103,104,113,117,120,127,132,135,136,138,148,169,171,207,214,216,231,279,288,310,352,380,392,406,425,443,532,553,562,589,593,665,690,791,807,880,890,982,998,1095,1130,1185,1543,1554,1581,1652,2457,2517,2576,2785,3003,3242,4644,5312,5954,6298,6660],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,4.800243119426277,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,2.926338025

{"value":"As a kid, my friends and I all believed that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody movie ever made. I'm not sure who started that rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren't allowed to see it for one reason or other. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a perennial late night cable movie, and as a result, I've been able to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times, and I can always spot it from 1-2 seconds of screen time. However, aside from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the stiff dialog, and the outrageously difficult story-line, the film has some things going for it. With all that's bad about the movie visually, the sound is actually pretty entertaining. Never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume! The canned kung-fu sounds are cheeky, but the slowed and pitched-down music, and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird. The chase through the city of demented, blood-thirsty villagers isn't really tense as much as it is irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train-wreck a little fun.

{"value":"Well I'm blowed, a Woody Allen film that I walked out of after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which I've seen less than half, but I hope you'll understand why). Basically, it became apparent very early on that we were going to be patronised from the screen with: a script that set out its conceit as if with bullet points; a cast that were all trying to be characters from Hannah and Her Sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and were badly directed into doing so; and a camera that sat around portentously, only for there to be nothing to film but chat and the actor delivering it. Drama? None; it's partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation.<br /><br />Maybe I did leave too early in this case, but by then I'd decided against another hour and a half of one-liner-Allen clones. The script has its funny moments  I went almost entirely on the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!)  but there's little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly, as is best. Worse than this there's no fluidity. Saying this film's wooden makes a forest look like a jelly: the opening café-bound discussion being the most abject case-in-point. The only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing 

{"value":"One would think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese, a movie should be, at the very least, decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time.<br /><br />Well, apparently I was grossly mistaken--this is single-handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny. It pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts I have had the misfortune to come across. Based solely on the big names, I remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film, but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever.<br /><br />Normally, both with movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this film, it's hard not to let loose. I can count on one hand, perhaps even two or three fingers, major Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made.<br /><br />I tried to enjoy this---I really did. But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet.

{"value":"This documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of Betty Page's(Paige Richards) career. The Tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950's and was fetish photos, bondage and cat-fight \"girly flicks\". Irving Klaw(Dukey Flyswatter)at his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or \"stag films\", but nonetheless, Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. It is no surprise that Betty had a cult following at the height of her career. The girl-next-door with jet black hair, blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades. After all, it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie actually could have been a lot better; but good enough to hold interest.<br /><br />Miss Richards is stunning in her own right.

{"value":"I am not from America and I know what 'Wife Swap' is. When a show came out of that name I was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real sucking stupidity. I was misjudged by its title name, it has no adult contents, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (broad casted threw Hallmark channel and I think they edited/mute out such contents to make it neat).<br /><br />A show which gives a picture of current American/western family state, overweight chubby peoples, polluted teenagers, and their sucking family goings. In each episode two wives/two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each others home and re-changes each others family routine with their new own rule. Sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad. On the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days. It's the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights. I was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff.

{"value":"This movie is just like every other dutch movie, so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood. then you might be okay with this one (even though those two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline. There's a lot of nudity (but me and others just could not find that girl attractive), the dialog is laughable (as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers), and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else (like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody's eye out...it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying \"did you hear what happened...I was there\"). the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice...that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews, you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching. All you know is that it's a new movie that's not yet in the theaters). My advice is to stay far away from this film, if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or

{"value":"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior \"The Naked City\", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write home about. It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.<br

{"value":"Tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV. However, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the \"phantom.\" He's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as \"hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat,\" etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.<br /><br />We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, I have a hard time rooting for the \"little guy.\"<br /><br />These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed.

{"value":"A sentimental school drama set in Denmark, 1969, \"We Shall Overcome\" offers a pathetic Danish take on US culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a flower-power obsessed, naive 13-year-old, exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master Lindum-Svendsen's (Bent Mejding) office. Lindum-Svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant, has the local community in control. Lindum-Svendsen's gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there wasn't enough drama already..), and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher Mr Svale ('Hi, call me Freddie'), Frits stands up for justice.<br /><br />Tell you what. It's so unconvincing, over-(method-)acted, and so full of misery, that as a 'family' picture this grotesque -filled with cliché's- excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non-Scandinavian audiences. Sorry, kind danish readers, to crash like this into your sentimental journeys.. But it's definitely NOT a tale about a 'boy becoming a man by fighting the system'. The boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eyed cry-face. If you call a church of small minded small town folk, led by a dictator like cartoonish character \"the system\", I'm sorry if I'm missing something.<br /><br />If you're into family pictures, go see

{"value":"It's terrible how some people can get away with such things... This is one of those overrated things again... And I hate things that are overrated that are no good... Why can't we have more TV Shows and Movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something?? It takes many people to make this movie, the series, and the band, all possible, and those people are all wasting their time... It seems that the bands are getting younger and younger... I looked at how small that they were, and I thought that they were 5 or 6. It's sad that kids are performing that young... They are still too young... Performing takes a lot of work, and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives... The idea about having a very young band is horrible... They need to stop having bands like this... And I don't like the idea at all, nor the kids themselves... They are very annoying, very young, and their name is \"The Naked Brothers Band\" The people that are involved in this, and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds...

{"value":"Disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel blatantly ripped off. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan on introducing her to King Triton. The celebration is quickly crashed by Ursula 's sister, Morgana who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to get the King 's trident. Stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there.<br /><br />Awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other Disney movies. I guess Disney can only plagiarize itself! Do not tell me that the penguin and walrus does not remind you of another duo from the LION KING!<br /><br />Other disappointing moments include the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They terribly under played it! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment.<br /><br />I will not give anything away, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle. An embarrassment to Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better left to rent and laugh at.

{"value":"Like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously, I'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went', \"Yea!!! This is it. This is the next film we are going to green light!!\" And whoever that person is, should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script, well, I'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money. This film is atrocious in every way.<br /><br />The Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way. But in here, not only does the premise defy all logic, not only is the acting terrible, not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to see this film. Maybe if it was free...naaah, it would still be a waste of time.<br /><br />Usually I'd be inclined to write some long winded, detailed review about why this film is so bad, but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking.

{"value":"I almost never comment on movies, but I saw the 5 glowing reviews of this \"movie\" and decided I had to weigh in with my own review. An instructor of mine received this film in the mail, mixed in with his Academy screeners (AMPAS, aka the guys who vote on the Oscars), and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how NOT to put together a movie.<br /><br />This film has no plot, the scenes are horribly, horribly edited (oftentimes using faux \"24\" style picture-in-picture techniques), and the performances (particularly the lead, who even fails at acting like a bad actress) are for the most part, obnoxious. Someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction, namely, the setting up of the plot. There is no setup! Halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about. The opening crane shot, which sets up some kind of murder, is never addressed, and now that I think about it, was possibly meant to be a flash-forward, with the rest of the film being a flashback, but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such.<br /><br />Bah, I could really go on and on. At the very least, this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability.","finished_norm":["i","almost","never","comment","on","movi","but","i","see","the","glow","review","of","thi","movi","and","decid","i","have","to","weigh","in","with","my","own","review","a","instructor","of","mine","receiv","thi","film","in","the","mail","mix","in","with","hi","academi","screener","ampa","aka","the","gui","who","vote","on","the","oscar","and","be","so","floor","with","how","terribli","construct","thi","movi","be","that","he","bring","it","in","to","our","class","to","demonstr","to","u","how","not","to","put","togeth","a","moviebr","br","thi","film","have","no","plot","the","scene","be","horribli","horribli","edit","oftentim","us","faux","styl","pictureinpictur","techniqu","and","the","perform","particularli","the","lead","who","even","fail","at","act","like","a","bad","actress","be","for","the","much","part","obnoxi","someon","truli","fail","to","understand","the","point","of","a","introduct","name","the","set","up","of","the","plot","there","be","no","setup","halfwai","through","the","movi","neither","myself","nor","the","rest","of","the","class","know","what","thi","movi","be","suppos","to","be","about","the","open","crane","shoot","which","set","up","some","kind","of","murder","be","never","address","and","now","that","i","think","about","it","be","possibli","mean","to","be","a","flashforward","with","the","rest","of","the","film","be","a","flashback","but","it","cut","from","that","scene","directli","to","the","next","without","ani","indic","a","suchbr","br","bah","i","can","realli","go","on","and","on","at","the","veri","littl","thi","movi","give","me","renew","confid","in","my","own","filmmak","abil"],"filtered":["almost","never","comment","movi","see","glow","review","thi","movi","decid","weigh","review","instructor","mine","receiv","thi","film","mail","mix","hi","academi","screener","ampa","aka","gui","vote","oscar","floor","terribli","construct","thi","movi","bring","class","demonstr","u","put","togeth","moviebr","br","thi","film","plot","scene","horribli","horribli","edit","oftentim","us","faux","styl","pictureinpictur","techniqu","perform","particularli","lead","even","fail","act","like","bad","actress","much","part","obnoxi","someon","truli","fail","understand","point","introduct","name","set","plot","setup","halfwai","movi","neither","rest","class","know","thi","movi","suppos","open","crane","shoot","set","kind","murder","never","address","think","possibli","mean","flashforward","rest","film","flashback","cut","scene","directli","next","without","ani","indic","suchbr","br","bah","realli","go","veri","littl","thi","movi","give","renew","confid","filmmak","abil"],"filtered2":["almost","never","comment","see","glow","review","decid","weigh","review","instructor","mine","receiv","mail","mix","academi","screener","ampa","aka","gui","vote","oscar","floor","terribli","construct","bring","class","demonstr","u","put","togeth","moviebr","plot","scene","horribli","horribli","edit","oftentim","us","faux","styl","pictureinpictur","techniqu","perform","particularli","lead","even","fail","act","like","bad","actress","part","obnoxi","someon","truli","fail","understand","point","introduct","name","set","plot","setup","halfwai","neither","rest","class","know","suppos","open","crane","shoot","set","kind","murder","never","address","think","possibli","mean","flashforward","rest","flashback","cut","scene","directli","next","without","ani","indic","suchbr","bah","realli","go","veri","littl","give","renew","confid","filmmak","abil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,9,12,13,14,15,19,21,26,27,30,32,42,55,56,61,66,88,105,109,112,117,122,125,131,139,143,149,157,159,176,212,215,226,242,249,250,270,273,280,297,303,323,342,348,355,380,465,497,558,628,718,782,847,979,1031,1051,1152,1189,1237,1276,1396,1419,1518,1580,1714,1753,1794,1817,1880,1985,1987,2220,2288,2566,3178,3824,5737,5763,6290,8078,8240],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,9,12,13,14,15,19,21,26,27,30,32,42,55,56,61,66,88,105,109,112,117,122,125,131,139,143,149,157,159,176,212,215,226,242,249,250,270,273,280,297,303,323,342,348,355,380,465,497,558,628,718,782,847,979,1031,1051,1152,1189,1237,1276,1396,1419,1518,1580,1714,1753,1794,1817,1880,1985,1987,2220,2288,2566,3178,3824,5737,5763,6290,8078,8240],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,2.742262257014735,3.2439908614907673,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.88185170473

{"value":"Awwww....yes, it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by ABC/Sears and has their home \"renovated.\" That's where the humanistic appeal ends. I liked it early in its run, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive.<br /><br />Ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on. The people at Habitat For Humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom, or have his bed tricked-out with \"Low Rider\" hydraulics? Does the mom really need her dilapidated, non-running and rusted out old pick-up truck restored and \"pimped\" by some of the best customizers in California? A new one would have done the job quite nicely, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there's the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills. Even after the zaniacs at \"Makeover\" leave, somebody still has earn a living. I doubt the friendly folks down at Social Services will see the humor in all of this largess.<br /><br />This show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for ABC, and a tacit commercial for its

{"value":"This has to be some of the worst direction I've seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when every scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /><br />Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work with, the backdrops of Mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty towns Costner rolls through on his journey for revenge. Unfortunately we only catch quick glimpses of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a big, giant head. Even the transition scenes where Costner is driving alone across Mexico quickly cut to a close-up. <br /><br />The score is over-dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. Among other things, too many people pop up out of nowhere to help Costner along - it's just bad writing. <br /><br />It's a typical thriller storyline, but many others have taken the same premise and done outstanding things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better movie. <br /><br />The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scoring of the film. This movie was never going to be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less of giant heads this film might have been watchable.","finished_norm":["thi","have","to","be","some","of","the","wrong","direct","i","have","see","the","closeup","can","be","a","veri","power","shoot","but","when","everi","scene","consist","of","noth","but","closeup","it","lose","all","it","impact","br","br","toni","scott","have","some","veri","beauti","sceneri","to","work","with","the","backdrop","of","mexico","the","cantina","the","beauti","estat","where","anthoni","quinn","live","and","the","dusti","town","costner","roll","through","on","hi","journei","for","reveng","unfortun","we","onli","catch","quick","glimps","of","thi","place","befor","the","camera","cut","to","a","pictur","of","a","big","giant","head","even","the","transit","scene","where","costner","be","drive","alon","across","mexico","quickli","cut","to","a","closeup","br","br","the","score","be","overdramat","and","intrus","dictat","everi","emot","we","should","feel","the","stori","itself","should","have","be","handl","much","well","among","other","thing","too","mani","peopl","pop","up","out","of","nowher","to","help","costner","along","it","just","bad","write","br","br","it","a","typic","thriller","storylin","but","mani","other","have","take","the","same","premis","and","do","outstand","thing","with","it","costner","no","wai","out","have","a","somewhat","similar","storylin","but","it","be","a","much","well","movi","br","br","the","end","be","complet","anticlimact","and","suffer","from","the","much","melodramat","score","of","the","film","thi","movi","be","never","go","to","be","great","but","if","we","see","much","of","mexico","and","littl","of","giant","head","thi","film","mai","have","be","watchabl"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","direct","see","closeup","veri","power","shoot","everi","scene","consist","noth","closeup","lose","impact","br","br","toni","scott","veri","beauti","sceneri","work","backdrop","mexico","cantina","beauti","estat","anthoni","quinn","live","dusti","town","costner","roll","hi","journei","reveng","unfortun","onli","catch","quick","glimps","thi","place","befor","camera","cut","pictur","big","giant","head","even","transit","scene","costner","drive","alon","across","mexico","quickli","cut","closeup","br","br","score","overdramat","intrus","dictat","everi","emot","feel","stori","handl","much","well","among","thing","mani","peopl","pop","nowher","help","costner","along","bad","write","br","br","typic","thriller","storylin","mani","take","premis","outstand","thing","costner","wai","somewhat","similar","storylin","much","well","movi","br","br","end","complet","anticlimact","suffer","much","melodramat","score","film","thi","movi","never","go","great","see","much","mexico","littl","giant","head","thi","film","mai","watchabl"],"filtered2":["wrong","direct","see","closeup","veri","power","shoot","everi","scene","consist","noth","closeup","lose","impact","toni","scott","veri","beauti","sceneri","work","backdrop","mexico","cantina","beauti","estat","anthoni","quinn","live","dusti","town","costner","roll","journei","reveng","unfortun","onli","catch","quick","glimps","place","befor","camera","cut","pictur","big","giant","head","even","transit","scene","costner","drive","alon","across","mexico","quickli","cut","closeup","score","overdramat","intrus","dictat","everi","emot","feel","stori","handl","well","among","thing","mani","peopl","pop","nowher","help","costner","along","bad","write","typic","thriller","storylin","mani","take","premis","outstand","thing","costner","wai","somewhat","similar","storylin","well","end","complet","anticlimact","suffer","melodramat","score","never","go","great","see","mexico","littl","giant","head","mai","watchabl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,9,11,14,15,17,19,20,23,24,25,29,31,33,42,43,46,48,49,50,51,65,79,82,85,102,103,116,117,164,185,208,221,227,231,303,311,324,325,365,450,457,461,484,503,506,512,515,518,589,596,613,633,714,770,795,799,826,828,871,907,930,945,952,1138,1173,1178,1456,1712,1795,1948,1954,2403,2422,2637,2768,2803,3001,3022,3831,4648,5468,5512,5924,6750,7346],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,9,11,14,15,17,19,20,23,24,25,29,31,33,42,43,46,48,49,50,51,65,79,82,85,102,103,116,117,164,185,208,221,227,231,303,311,324,325,365,450,457,461,484,503,506,512,515,518,589,596,613,633,714,770,795,799,826,828,871,907,930,945,952,1138,1173,1178,1456,1712,1795,1948,1954,2403,2422,2637,2768,2803,3001,3022,3831,4648,5468,5512,5924,6750,7346],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,2.330690080046114,1.364847727375781,1.32103
