{"value":"The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy, quaint streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere.<br /><br />Othello works for big, fat Mr. Karva, his crime-boss step-dad (at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it's never really defined, but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers, so trust me, he's a prick) doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand-jobs. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who is always dashing from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running. Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello's flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy kidnapped. But he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job? Either way, I don't want to see the little boy grant him the second.<br /><br />It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but since there's hardly any back-story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience.<br /><br />Writer Tony Grisoni, a favourite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who's origins are never revealed. That's just plain irritating! <br /><br />Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend.","finished_norm":["the","live","of","the","saint","start","off","with","a","atmospher","vision","of","london","a","a","bustl","citi","of","busi","quaint","street","and","sunshin","i","be","hope","it","would","maintain","thi","atmospher","but","it","get","bog","down","in","a","stori","that","go","pretti","much","nowherebr","br","othello","work","for","big","fat","mr","karva","hi","crimeboss","stepdad","at","littl","i","think","that","be","what","he","be","suppos","to","be","becaus","it","never","realli","defin","but","he","doe","drop","kitten","into","deep","fat","frier","so","trust","me","he","a","prick","do","scrappi","littl","errand","while","hi","skanki","girlfriend","give","daddi","handjob","on","of","hi","colleagu","be","runner","a","black","dude","who","be","alwai","dash","from","a","to","b","until","the","dai","he","come","across","almost","mute","homeless","child","who","grant","him","hi","wish","of","be","abl","to","stop","run","runner","dump","the","lose","boi","in","othello","flat","where","he","promptli","start","grant","much","wish","keen","to","have","some","of","hi","own","desir","fulfil","karva","have","the","boi","kidnap","but","he","be","not","sure","of","what","would","realli","bring","him","happi","be","it","the","innoc","of","be","a","child","again","or","be","it","anoth","handjob","either","wai","i","do","not","want","to","see","the","littl","boi","grant","him","the","secondbr","br","it","just","take","ag","to","get","go","and","there","be","load","of","repetit","scene","the","end","try","to","be","shock","but","sinc","there","hardli","ani","backstori","on","invest","in","ani","of","thi","charact","it","onli","serv","a","a","releas","for","the","bore","audiencebr","br","writer","toni","grisoni","a","favourit","of","terri","gilliam","try","to","blend","in","some","kind","of","religi","allegori","which","end","up","be","pretenti","a","all","hell","iron","if","he","give","u","someth","much","access","or","at","littl","have","well","explan","for","the","charact","suddenli","act","all","weird","then","it","would","have","be","a","much","enjoy","film","a","it","be","we","be","introduc","to","a","bunch","of","annoi","loudmouth","who","then","miracul","seem","to","develop","intellig","when","confront","by","the","mysteri","boi","who","origin","be","never","reveal","that","just","plain","irrit","br","br","asid","from","sporad","moment","of","atmospher","and","a","moodi","score","thi","film","have","littl","to","recommend"],"filtered":["live","saint","start","atmospher","vision","london","bustl","citi","busi","quaint","street","sunshin","hope","maintain","thi","atmospher","get","bog","stori","go","pretti","much","nowherebr","br","othello","work","big","fat","mr","karva","hi","crimeboss","stepdad","littl","think","suppos","becaus","never","realli","defin","doe","drop","kitten","deep","fat","frier","trust","prick","scrappi","littl","errand","hi","skanki","girlfriend","give","daddi","handjob","hi","colleagu","runner","black","dude","alwai","dash","b","dai","come","across","almost","mute","homeless","child","grant","hi","wish","abl","stop","run","runner","dump","lose","boi","othello","flat","promptli","start","grant","much","wish","keen","hi","desir","fulfil","karva","boi","kidnap","sure","realli","bring","happi","innoc","child","anoth","handjob","either","wai","want","see","littl","boi","grant","secondbr","br","take","ag","get","go","load","repetit","scene","end","try","shock","sinc","hardli","ani","backstori","invest","ani","thi","charact","onli","serv","releas","bore","audiencebr","br","writer","toni","grisoni","favourit","terri","gilliam","try","blend","kind","religi","allegori","end","pretenti","hell","iron","give","u","someth","much","access","littl","well","explan","charact","suddenli","act","weird","much","enjoy","film","introduc","bunch","annoi","loudmouth","miracul","seem","develop","intellig","confront","mysteri","boi","origin","never","reveal","plain","irrit","br","br","asid","sporad","moment","atmospher","moodi","score","thi","film","littl","recommend"],"filtered2":["live","saint","start","atmospher","vision","london","bustl","citi","busi","quaint","street","sunshin","hope","maintain","atmospher","get","bog","stori","go","pretti","nowherebr","othello","work","big","fat","mr","karva","crimeboss","stepdad","littl","think","suppos","becaus","never","realli","defin","doe","drop","kitten","deep","fat","frier","trust","prick","scrappi","littl","errand","skanki","girlfriend","give","daddi","handjob","colleagu","runner","black","dude","alwai","dash","b","dai","come","across","almost","mute","homeless","child","grant","wish","abl","stop","run","runner","dump","lose","boi","othello","flat","promptli","start","grant","wish","keen","desir","fulfil","karva","boi","kidnap","sure","realli","bring","happi","innoc","child","anoth","handjob","either","wai","want","see","littl","boi","grant","secondbr","take","ag","get","go","load","repetit","scene","end","try","shock","sinc","hardli","ani","ba

{"value":"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Juggernaut is a British made \"thriller\" released in the US by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to retreat to France and start up a medical practice. He is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows Karloff needs the money.<br /><br />Karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband. All the while, the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed. When he spills the beans to the wife, she goes berserk and even bites the son's hand.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse has misplaced the hypo Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff finds out he isn't getting any money, he asks the wife to poison the son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo. Analysis shows poison, but not quite in time as Karloff kidnaps the nurse.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by Karloff. Karloff instead injects himself and dies.<br /><br />This movie does have some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man Who Lived Again. It is peculiar, however, to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over. We never find out why he is walking this way. I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister.<br /><br />The actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible. She has a French accent. Even though she overacts badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting...).<br /><br />A little below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the audio is a bit choppy.","finished_norm":["spoiler","spoiler","juggernaut","be","a","british","make","thriller","releas","in","the","u","by","nation","karloff","be","dr","sartoriu","who","have","to","leav","hi","research","becaus","hi","fund","have","dry","up","karloff","be","forc","to","retreat","to","franc","and","start","up","a","medic","practic","he","be","proposit","by","a","conniv","woman","who","want","to","get","rid","of","her","much","old","husband","she","know","karloff","ne","the","moneybr","br","karloff","agre","to","the","proposit","and","soon","becom","the","person","doctor","of","the","husband","all","the","while","the","wife","be","pranc","about","town","with","the","local","no","good","playboi","karloff","final","inject","the","old","geyser","with","poison","and","he","kick","off","howev","hi","son","from","anoth","marriag","arriv","a","few","dai","befor","the","kill","and","find","out","the","will","have","be","chang","when","he","spill","the","bean","to","the","wife","she","go","berserk","and","even","bite","the","son","handbr","br","meanwhil","karloff","nurs","have","misplac","the","hypo","karloff","us","to","kill","the","old","man","when","karloff","find","out","he","be","not","get","ani","monei","he","ask","the","wife","to","poison","the","son","the","nurs","suspect","karloff","and","find","the","miss","hypo","analysi","show","poison","but","not","quit","in","time","a","karloff","kidnap","the","nursebr","br","to","make","a","long","stori","short","the","nurs","escap","get","the","polic","and","manag","to","save","the","son","who","be","about","to","be","inject","by","karloff","karloff","instead","inject","himself","and","diesbr","br","thi","movi","doe","have","some","good","point","karloff","be","possess","and","plai","the","typ","of","mad","doctor","he","do","in","the","devil","command","and","the","man","who","live","again","it","be","peculiar","howev","to","see","him","walk","around","stiffli","and","slightli","hunch","over","we","never","find","out","why","he","be","walk","thi","wai","i","suspect","the","director","think","it","make","him","much","sinisterbr","br","the","actress","plai","the","time","wife","overact","someth","terribl","she","have","a","french","accent","even","though","she","overact","badli","you","still","manag","to","hate","her","or","mayb","you","hate","her","becaus","of","her","actingbr","br","a","littl","below","averag","for","a","karloff","vehicl","if","you","bui","the","sinist","cinema","vh","copi","the","audio","be","a","bite","choppi"],"filtered":["spoiler","spoiler","juggernaut","british","make","thriller","releas","u","nation","karloff","dr","sartoriu","leav","hi","research","becaus","hi","fund","dry","karloff","forc","retreat","franc","start","medic","practic","proposit","conniv","woman","want","get","rid","much","old","husband","know","karloff","ne","moneybr","br","karloff","agre","proposit","soon","becom","person","doctor","husband","wife","pranc","town","local","good","playboi","karloff","final","inject","old","geyser","poison","kick","howev","hi","son","anoth","marriag","arriv","dai","befor","kill","find","chang","spill","bean","wife","go","berserk","even","bite","son","handbr","br","meanwhil","karloff","nurs","misplac","hypo","karloff","us","kill","old","man","karloff","find","get","ani","monei","ask","wife","poison","son","nurs","suspect","karloff","find","miss","hypo","analysi","show","poison","quit","time","karloff","kidnap","nursebr","br","make","long","stori","short","nurs","escap","get","polic","manag","save","son","inject","karloff","karloff","instead","inject","diesbr","br","thi","movi","doe","good","point","karloff","possess","plai","typ","mad","doctor","devil","command","man","live","peculiar","howev","see","walk","around","stiffli","slightli","hunch","never","find","walk","thi","wai","suspect","director","think","make","much","sinisterbr","br","actress","plai","time","wife","overact","someth","terribl","french","accent","even","though","overact","badli","still","manag","hate","mayb","hate","becaus","actingbr","br","littl","averag","karloff","vehicl","bui","sinist","cinema","vh","copi","audio","bite","choppi"],"filtered2":["spoiler","spoiler","juggernaut","british","make","thriller","releas","u","nation","karloff","dr","sartoriu","leav","research","becaus","fund","dry","karloff","forc","retreat","franc","start","medic","practic","proposit","conniv","woman","want","get","rid","old","husband","know","karloff","ne","moneybr","karloff","agre","proposit","soon","becom","person","doctor","husband","wife","pranc","town","local","good","playboi","karloff","final","inject","old","geyser","poison","kick","howev","son","anoth","marriag","arriv","dai","befor","kill","find","chang","spill","bean","wife","go","berserk","even","bite","son","handbr","meanwhil","karloff","nurs","misplac","hypo","karloff","us","kill","old","man","karloff","find","get","ani","monei","ask","wife","poison","son","nurs","suspect","karloff","find","miss","hypo","analysi","show","poison","quit"

{"value":"- A film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old, supposedly cursed house where over the years, seven people have mysteriously died. One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie. It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using. But as the book is read, the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger .<br /><br />- IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes. For the first 60 of those minutes, nothing happens. Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie. Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting? We already know that their movie isn't \"real\". These scares just don't work.<br /><br />- There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses. The acting is atrocious. Most of these \"actors\" would have trouble making a elementary school play. The score is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, other than a few moments at the end of the movie, there is none to speak of. Character logic is all but non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I don't think I remember one scene where a character didn't choose the most illogical avenue available to them. And finally, there's those first 60 minutes of the movie that I've already mentioned. Can you say BORING? <br /><br />- I haven't rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie (probably by accident) actually works. My two favorite are the beginning and ending. The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie. And, the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective (what a ringing endorsement). Overall though, these moments aren't enough to make this a good movie.","finished_norm":["a","film","crow","be","shoot","a","horror","movi","in","a","old","supposedli","curs","hous","where","over","the","year","seven","peopl","have","mysteri","die","on","of","the","crow","find","a","old","book","of","spell","and","it","look","like","it","would","be","perfect","to","us","in","some","of","the","ritual","scene","in","their","movi","it","be","reason","that","the","spell","in","the","book","be","well","write","than","the","script","thei","be","us","but","a","the","book","be","read","the","graveyard","outsid","suddenli","come","to","life","now","the","cast","and","crow","be","face","with","real","danger","br","br","imdb","list","a","run","time","of","minut","for","the","of","that","minut","noth","happen","far","too","much","time","be","spend","on","the","movi","within","a","movi","be","we","suppos","to","be","frighten","by","the","horror","movi","that","thei","be","shoot","we","alreadi","know","that","their","movi","be","not","real","thi","scare","just","do","not","workbr","br","there","be","veri","few","thing","to","enjoi","about","the","hous","of","seven","corps","the","act","be","atroci","much","of","thi","actor","would","have","troubl","make","a","elementari","school","plai","the","score","be","terribl","it","be","veri","reminisc","of","a","televis","seri","and","provid","no","atmospher","speak","of","atmospher","other","than","a","few","moment","at","the","end","of","the","movi","there","be","none","to","speak","of","charact","logic","be","all","but","nonexist","even","in","a","movi","you","expect","charact","to","behav","in","a","certain","wai","here","i","do","not","think","i","rememb","on","scene","where","a","charact","do","not","choos","the","much","illog","avenu","avail","to","them","and","final","there","that","minut","of","the","movi","that","i","have","alreadi","mention","can","you","sai","bore","br","br","i","have","not","rate","the","hous","of","seven","corps","ani","low","becaus","of","instanc","where","the","movi","probabl","by","accid","actual","work","my","two","favorit","be","the","begin","and","end","the","open","titl","sequenc","present","the","death","of","the","seven","previou","owner","and","mai","be","the","highlight","of","the","movi","and","the","end","scene","on","the","massiv","staircas","a","the","zombi","menac","the","film","crow","be","somewhat","effect","what","a","ring","endors","overal","though","thi","moment","be","not","enough","to","make","thi","a","good","movi"],"filtered":["film","crow","shoot","horror","movi","old","supposedli","curs","hous","year","seven","peopl","mysteri","die","crow","find","old","book","spell","look","like","perfect","us","ritual","scene","movi","reason","spell","book","well","write","script","thei","us","book","read","graveyard","outsid","suddenli","come","life","cast","crow","face","real","danger","br","br","imdb","list","run","time","minut","minut","noth","happen","far","much","time","spend","movi","within","movi","suppos","frighten","horror","movi","thei","shoot","alreadi","know","movi","real","thi","scare","workbr","br","veri","thing","enjoi","hous","seven","corps","act","atroci","much","thi","actor","troubl","make","elementari","school","plai","score","terribl","veri","reminisc","televis","seri","provid","atmospher","speak","atmospher","moment","end","movi","none","speak","charact","logic","nonexist","even","movi","expect","charact","behav","certain","wai","think","rememb","scene","charact","choos","much","illog","avenu","avail","final","minut","movi","alreadi","mention","sai","bore","br","br","rate","hous","seven","corps","ani","low","becaus","instanc","movi","probabl","accid","actual","work","two","favorit","begin","end","open","titl","sequenc","present","death","seven","previou","owner","mai","highlight","movi","end","scene","massiv","staircas","zombi","menac","film","crow","somewhat","effect","ring","endors","overal","though","thi","moment","enough","make","thi","good","movi"],"filtered2":["crow","shoot","horror","old","supposedli","curs","hous","year","seven","peopl","mysteri","die","crow","find","old","book","spell","look","like","perfect","us","ritual","scene","reason","spell","book","well","write","script","us","book","read","graveyard","outsid","suddenli","come","life","cast","crow","face","real","danger","imdb","list","run","time","minut","minut","noth","happen","far","time","spend","within","suppos","frighten","horror","shoot","alreadi","know","real","scare","workbr","veri","thing","enjoi","hous","seven","corps","act","atroci","actor","troubl","make","elementari","school","plai","score","terribl","veri","reminisc","televis","provid","atmospher","speak","atmospher","moment","end","none","speak","charact","logic","nonexist","even","expect","charact","behav","certain","wai","think","rememb","scene","charact","choos","illog","avenu","avail","final","minut","alreadi","mention","bore","rate","hous","seven","corps","ani","low","becaus","instanc","probabl","accid","actual","work","two","favorit","begin",

{"value":"*May contain spoilers*<br /><br />I bent over backwards to be fair to this film. I knew it starred Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew it got a lot of bad reviews. I wasn't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality like we got in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes.<br /><br />Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, nit-witted Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the ship's first-mate who the Madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted Mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson. Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two-thirds of the movie.<br /><br />\"Swept Away\" is a silly, simplistic, superficial movie from beginning to end. Madonna gives a typically wooden performance. There are many dumb scenes: Madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of Giannini, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt. Guy Ritchie does his \"stylish\" editing which is laughable here. The film contains some of the worst dialog I've heard in a major movie in several years. The ending is sappy and implausible. It's basically \"The Blue Lagoon\" meets \"Overboard\" minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter.<br /><br />Maybe Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress. Please give it up, Madge, for our sake as well as yours. This isn't her worst movie though. That distinction still belongs to \"Shanghai Surprise\".

{"value":"This film was made and cast from my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town...<br /><br />Storyline...<br /><br />Essentially 20 years after a film was \"laid to rest\" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed.<br /><br />The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.<br /><br />As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played \"director\" and \"producer\") looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to.<br /><br />The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film, but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed. Maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better.<br /><br />Now I know it is a comedy and elements were funny.

{"value":"In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The plot is unrealistically convoluted, the actors sport bad accents and director Robert Altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check. Once again he has assembled an impressive cast (Like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman)that this time around to the letter is miscast. But that's only part of the problem.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad. With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way. Fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that's not enough there's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale.<br /><br />Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent. Running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is every bit as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible. The female leads (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen)are lean leggy and unemotive. Even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have.<br /><br />In addition to paying little attention to his actors, Altman's mise en scene dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless, his action scenes comic book. It lacks his offbeat touches and observations (he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia)that make a well done Altman so unique.

{"value":"it is of course very nice to see improvements on Turkish movie industry, however, i would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting from the script, which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think. especially the cheesiness of the dialogs, which were putting the audience in a position that, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations, which, most of the times makes the movie unbearable. it also has an obvious ending; you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning. the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people, like professionals right away!!!did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals, to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use?????!!!!!!also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient, with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film. and that scene was so suitable for \"Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir\" title!! those are not the only weak parts of the movie. there were also a lot of preciosities in the film. the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from Hannibal, also appearance of Togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie! the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it. Gen is a total disappointment. i would have wonder, if Sahan was not this famous, would Togan be able to shoot this movie, with this much of budget amount?? i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet!!!!hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big

{"value":"Next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre. While slasher films had 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' to get the whole thing going, zombie flicks had George Romero's 'Dead' films. And unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in. A lot of Italian directors were especially interested, such as Lucio Fulci who brought us 'Zombie' a year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', known as 'Zombi' in Italy and some other countries, and it was there that Fulci's film was known as 'Zombi 2'. Apart from the walking dead it has no relation to Romero's film, but is a good film in it's own right. It was a big success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born.<br /><br />Pros: Lots of beautiful, lush scenery. Awesome score. The acting isn't exactly good, but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience. After kind of a slow start, the pace moves along like that of an action flick. Plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers. Good job on the make-up effects. Lots of blood and some decent gore.<br /><br />Cons: Virtually plot less. Nothing you haven't already seen before. Blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of 'Return of the Living Dead' films. Cardboard characters. Hasn't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music(Not that I'm saying all rock music of that period is bad), clothing, and overall feel of the movie.<br /><br />Final thoughts: First of all, this is not a true sequel to Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off. For those that don't know, Fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are pretty laughable, but like this film many are good campy fun. And that's all this film really is, just something to watch for fun.<br /><br />My rating: 3.5/5 (So-bad-it's-good rating) 2/5 (Serious

{"value":"Very bad. Very, very bad. As a fellow who aspires to make, be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set, I find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made. However, this movie ... oh dear.<br /><br />Realizing Frightworld doesn't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it is more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not by much. So I won't try to critique, just let me ask throw out some observations.<br /><br />1) If gore is the point of the movie, shouldn't you be able to see it?<br /><br />2) If you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment.<br /><br />3) In a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll. Difficult I know but really...<br /><br />4) There is a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo/Rochester area, most you can hire really cheap. Get one who knows how to frame a scene.<br /><br />5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds.<br /><br />6) Kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time, get girls who's tops we want to see taken off.<br /><br />7) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood. At the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags. A chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary, it's sloppy.<br /><br />Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once she started fighting back. There was some neat imagery, unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason. \"Acid Poptart\" is a name that deserves a better movie. I like the moxie of Frightworld too.

{"value":"I don't know what it is with these Brady kids. First, Barry Williams publicly brags about having sexy with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, then about dating his TV mom, Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum might have had a little same-sex fling on the side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early-20s during his stint on \"The Surreal Life\", which at first was fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship. The last episode, where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on her part. And he dealt with it in a very mature fashion, just picking up and leaving to clear his head. I think he was always bowing to her every need and now he's finally taking a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think she abuses him, verbally. The way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing. Also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men, which is not something any self-respecting human being should do when already married to someone. If this were a man talking down to his wife like that, and going out every night partying and having sex with other people, everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him. Why should this be any different. What started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things. I feel sorry for her, but Chris needs to rid himself of her, because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","know","what","it","be","with","thi","bradi","kid","barri","william","publicli","brag","about","have","sexi","with","hi","tv","sister","maureen","mccormick","then","about","date","hi","tv","mom","florenc","hederson","then","susan","cindi","olsen","doe","music","for","a","bunch","of","porno","movi","then","mike","bobbi","lookinland","get","in","troubl","for","drink","drive","final","maureen","marcia","mccormick","and","ev","jan","plum","mai","have","have","a","littl","samesex","fling","on","the","side","now","christoph","peter","knight","be","pursu","by","a","beauti","young","model","in","her","earli","dure","hi","stint","on","the","surreal","life","which","at","be","fun","to","watch","and","now","thei","be","marri","and","in","a","veri","volatil","and","hostil","relationship","the","last","episod","where","she","pose","for","a","bunch","of","nude","photograph","with","anoth","nake","girl","for","a","scrapbook","to","give","to","christoph","for","hi","birthdai","be","not","a","good","move","on","her","part","and","he","deal","with","it","in","a","veri","matur","fashion","just","pick","up","and","leav","to","clear","hi","head","i","think","he","be","alwai","bow","to","her","everi","ne","and","now","he","final","take","a","stand","and","i","hate","to","sai","it","but","i","think","she","abus","him","verbal","the","wai","she","be","tortur","him","for","a","engag","ring","and","the","wai","she","ream","him","for","everi","littl","thing","conjur","she","talk","openli","about","have","fling","with","other","woman","and","it","be","obviou","she","still","sleep","around","on","him","with","woman","and","man","which","be","not","someth","ani","selfrespect","human","be","should","do","when","alreadi","marri","to","someon","if","thi","be","a","man","talk","down","to","hi","wife","like","that","and","go","out","everi","night","parti","and","have","sex","with","other","peopl","everyon","would","be","ralli","behind","the","wife","to","leav","him","why","should","thi","be","ani","differ","what","start","out","a","a","cute","littl","crush","on","anoth","realiti","show","blossom","into","a","huge","disast","adriann","a","beauti","a","she","be","be","like","anoth","britnei","spear","and","lindsai","lohan","clearli","in","ne","of","some","therapi","becaus","she","cry","like","a","babi","over","so","mani","silli","thing","i","feel","sorri","for","her","but","chri","ne","to","rid","himself","of","her","becaus","he","be","a","good","man","who","cannot","afford","to","be","humili","like","thi"],"filtered":["know","thi","bradi","kid","barri","william","publicli","brag","sexi","hi","tv","sister","maureen","mccormick","date","hi","tv","mom","florenc","hederson","susan","cindi","olsen","doe","music","bunch","porno","movi","mike","bobbi","lookinland","get","troubl","drink","drive","final","maureen","marcia","mccormick","ev","jan","plum","mai","littl","samesex","fling","side","christoph","peter","knight","pursu","beauti","young","model","earli","dure","hi","stint","surreal","life","fun","watch","thei","marri","veri","volatil","hostil","relationship","last","episod","pose","bunch","nude","photograph","anoth","nake","girl","scrapbook","give","christoph","hi","birthdai","good","move","part","deal","veri","matur","fashion","pick","leav","clear","hi","head","think","alwai","bow","everi","ne","final","take","stand","hate","sai","think","abus","verbal","wai","tortur","engag","ring","wai","ream","everi","littl","thing","conjur","talk","openli","fling","woman","obviou","still","sleep","around","woman","man","someth","ani","selfrespect","human","alreadi","marri","someon","thi","man","talk","hi","wife","like","go","everi","night","parti","sex","peopl","everyon","ralli","behind","wife","leav","thi","ani","differ","start","cute","littl","crush","anoth","realiti","show","blossom","huge","disast","adriann","beauti","like","anoth","britnei","spear","lindsai","lohan","clearli","ne","therapi","becaus","cry","like","babi","mani","silli","thing","feel","sorri","chri","ne","rid","becaus","good","man","afford","humili","like","thi"],"filtered2":["know","bradi","kid","barri","william","publicli","brag","sexi","tv","sister","maureen","mccormick","date","tv","mom","florenc","hederson","susan","cindi","olsen","doe","music","bunch","porno","mike","bobbi","lookinland","get","troubl","drink","drive","final","maureen","marcia","mccormick","ev","jan","plum","mai","littl","samesex","fling","side","christoph","peter","knight","pursu","beauti","young","model","earli","dure","stint","surreal","life","fun","watch","marri","veri","volatil","hostil","relationship","last","pose","bunch","nude","photograph","anoth","nake","girl","scrapbook","give","christoph","birthdai","good","move","part","deal","veri","matur","fashion","pick","leav","clear","head","think","alwai","bow","everi","ne","final","take","stand","hate","think","abus","verbal","wai","tortur","engag","ring","wai","ream","everi","littl","thing","conjur","talk","openli","fling","

{"value":"This is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk.<br /><br />My GF and I have figured this movie out (we think) so here it is:<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />Firstly, this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (95% of the movie.)<br /><br />Ignoring the junk, what REALLY happened is this: A group of school friends go to a rave one night. They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. That's the simple cut down version. (That's right, I said Sean, bear with me)<br /><br />Right after the accident, Cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie. This is where the dream part starts.<br /><br />The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 weirdos and Jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her). The souls continue doing what they were defined as: Annie the rave-going chick, the 2 weirdo-killers (from opening scene), Father Jude still helping people etc.<br /><br />We are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images (many of which my GF and I still can't tie in) but it all boils down to it not being Cassie's time to die.<br /><br />At the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being \"dead\" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She's OK.<br /><br />Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled.

{"value":"This so-called \"documentary\" tries to tell that USA faked the moon-landing. Year right.<br /><br />All those who have actually studied the case knows different.<br /><br />First of all: there is definitely proof. When the astronauts was on the moon, they brought back MANY pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. These where spread around the world to hundreds of labs, who tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. I.E. the conspiracy theorists never studies anything: they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest.<br /><br />Another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, I.E. the flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. And what proves this: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut have let it be, I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad-scientists, they cant study a subject properly, or only studies it until they have what they came for, so that they can make a lie from that, and make a profit (I.E. this so-called \"documentary\").<br /><br />A claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light-sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in an earth desert at night, with no light-sources. But i doubt that any Conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a Star Treck-convention is held over.<br /><br />The Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME.

{"value":"I went in to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them.<br /><br />I don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I do expect them to be internally consistent. This film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of LOTR or even Godzilla.<br /><br />A shape-shifting mystic warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent \"paranormal division\" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims \"I never meant for this to happen.\" A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who \"died like star-crossed lovers.\" Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.<br /><br />The dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing \"Ran\" with a karaoke rendition of My Way - and let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim to Kurosawa.<br /><br />In short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in Koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer. I would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video, but I'm not even sure that it's worth that much.","finished_norm":["i","go","in","to","see","dwar","on","a","whim","and","with","veri","low","expect","the","movi","fail","to","meet","thembr","br","i","do","not","mind","stori","that","stretch","credul","rememb","reign","of","fire","but","i","do","expect","them","to","be","intern","consist","thi","film","leap","from","howler","to","howler","without","paus","for","breath","all","interspers","with","special","effect","that","lag","far","behind","the","like","of","lotr","or","even","godzillabr","br","a","shapeshift","mystic","warrior","from","korea","curious","metamorphos","into","a","caucasian","antiqu","dealer","and","pop","up","like","deu","ex","machina","to","get","the","hapless","protagonist","out","of","their","late","mess","a","special","agent","from","the","fbi","who","seem","to","be","complet","bone","up","on","ancient","korean","folklor","becaus","of","the","fe","excel","paranorm","divis","which","have","go","unremark","up","to","thi","point","lover","kiss","on","desert","beach","where","on","exclaim","i","never","mean","for","thi","to","happen","a","reincarn","pair","of","long","dead","korean","who","die","like","starcross","lover","mystic","pendant","faceless","hord","of","robot","soldier","that","ow","a","lot","to","peter","jackson","orc","and","a","serpent","who","wast","so","much","time","roar","that","everi","time","it","choos","prei","be","within","reach","someth","come","along","to","distract","itbr","br","the","dialogu","be","appal","the","act","wooden","and","the","effect","of","the","whole","be","to","be","honest","tediou","howev","for","me","the","crown","moment","be","at","the","end","after","the","final","when","the","music","for","the","close","credit","be","arirang","thi","be","rather","like","akira","kurosawa","close","run","with","a","karaok","rendit","of","my","wai","and","let","me","be","clear","that","i","be","in","no","wai","compar","director","shim","to","kurosawabr","br","in","short","a","self","indulg","lacklust","collect","of","cliché","and","narr","nonsequituur","which","mai","appeal","to","the","sens","of","the","melodramat","so","preval","in","koran","popular","cultur","but","should","not","be","worth","the","price","of","the","ticket","to","ani","seriou","movi","goer","or","even","a","not","soseri","movi","goer","i","would","suggest","that","thi","bypass","the","movi","theater","altogeth","and","go","straight","to","video","but","i","be","not","even","sure","that","it","worth","that","much"],"filtered":["go","see","dwar","whim","veri","low","expect","movi","fail","meet","thembr","br","mind","stori","stretch","credul","rememb","reign","fire","expect","intern","consist","thi","film","leap","howler","howler","without","paus","breath","interspers","special","effect","lag","far","behind","like","lotr","even","godzillabr","br","shapeshift","mystic","warrior","korea","curious","metamorphos","caucasian","antiqu","dealer","pop","like","deu","ex","machina","get","hapless","protagonist","late","mess","special","agent","fbi","seem","complet","bone","ancient","korean","folklor","becaus","fe","excel","paranorm","divis","go","unremark","thi","point","lover","kiss","desert","beach","exclaim","never","mean","thi","happen","reincarn","pair","long","dead","korean","die","like","starcross","lover","mystic","pendant","faceless","hord","robot","soldier","ow","lot","peter","jackson","orc","serpent","wast","much","time","roar","everi","time","choos","prei","within","reach","someth","come","along","distract","itbr","br","dialogu","appal","act","wooden","effect","whole","honest","tediou","howev","crown","moment","end","final","music","close","credit","arirang","thi","rather","like","akira","kurosawa","close","run","karaok","rendit","wai","let","clear","wai","compar","director","shim","kurosawabr","br","short","self","indulg","lacklust","collect","cliché","narr","nonsequituur","mai","appeal","sens","melodramat","preval","koran","popular","cultur","worth","price","ticket","ani","seriou","movi","goer","even","soseri","movi","goer","suggest","thi","bypass","movi","theater","altogeth","go","straight","video","even","sure","worth","much"],"filtered2":["go","see","dwar","whim","veri","low","expect","fail","meet","thembr","mind","stori","stretch","credul","rememb","reign","fire","expect","intern","consist","leap","howler","howler","without","paus","breath","interspers","special","effect","lag","far","behind","like","lotr","even","godzillabr","shapeshift","mystic","warrior","korea","curious","metamorphos","caucasian","antiqu","dealer","pop","like","deu","ex","machina","get","hapless","protagonist","late","mess","special","agent","fbi","seem","complet","bone","ancient","korean","folklor","becaus","fe","excel","paranorm","divis","go","unremark","point","lover","kiss","desert","beach","exclaim","never","mean","happen","reincarn","pair","long","dead","korean","die","like","starcross","lover","mystic","pendant","faceless","hord","robot","soldier","ow","lot","peter","jackson","orc","serpent","wast","time"

{"value":"Who wrote this? Some guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on.

Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in New York, and it will look real, and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he's learned that lesson now.<br /><br />And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's starring in this movie. OH wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of.<br /><br />So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall.<br /><br />I am so glad I didn't pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, around when the first act is ending, you realize it'll only get worse, and that's when you either need to leave, or kill yourself.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding.","finished_norm":["who","write","thi","some","gui","name","john","cohen","i","guess","thi","be","the","screenplai","he","ever","work","on","someon","should","have","tell","him","you","re","suppos","to","write","dialog","that","sound","like","someth","someon","actual","mai","saybr","br","and","who","direct","thi","scott","marshal","son","of","gerri","marshal","my","the","nut","have","fall","far","from","the","tree","someon","mai","have","want","to","let","him","know","that","you","can","in","fact","shoot","a","scene","in","a","cab","in","new","york","and","it","will","look","real","and","you","wo","not","have","to","fake","it","with","a","blue","screen","for","no","reason","mai","have","conjur","want","to","let","him","know","he","should","stai","awai","from","jessica","simpson","but","hopefulli","he","learn","that","lesson","nowbr","br","and","jessica","simpson","natur","she","ca","not","act","hell","she","make","jessica","alba","look","like","audri","hepburn","and","yet","she","star","in","thi","movi","oh","wait","it","be","produc","by","her","father","okai","that","why","she","get","the","part","that","realli","the","onli","reason","i","can","think","ofbr","br","so","should","i","be","surpris","it","bad","no","should","i","be","amaz","at","how","bad","it","be","i","think","a","lot","of","peopl","would","if","thei","see","a","much","of","it","a","i","do","i","mean","you","expect","a","movi","star","jessica","simpson","to","be","bad","but","thi","it","not","just","bad","it","the","complet","opposit","of","a","classic","film","think","of","a","great","woodi","allen","movi","thi","film","be","a","bad","a","that","film","be","good","it","the","antianni","hallbr","br","i","be","so","glad","i","do","not","pai","to","see","it","i","stop","watch","ten","minut","in","cu","i","can","not","go","on","no","doubt","i","would","have","walk","out","of","the","theater","soon","in","fact","i","wonder","how","mani","of","the","peopl","who","see","it","per","theater","actual","stai","and","watch","the","whole","thing","the","film","start","out","laughabl","bad","and","then","go","to","the","point","of","be","so","bad","it","becom","a","kind","of","chines","water","tortur","and","then","around","when","the","act","be","end","you","realiz","it","will","onli","get","wrong","and","that","when","you","either","ne","to","leav","or","kill","yourselfbr","br","in","conclus","thi","film","go","under","the","categori","of","be","so","bad","it","should","be","us","in","place","of","water","board","at","guantanamo","bai","although","some","prefer","the","water","board"],"filtered":["write","thi","gui","name","john","cohen","guess","thi","screenplai","ever","work","someon","tell","re","suppos","write","dialog","sound","like","someth","someon","actual","mai","saybr","br","direct","thi","scott","marshal","son","gerri","marshal","nut","fall","far","tree","someon","mai","want","let","know","fact","shoot","scene","cab","new","york","look","real","wo","fake","blue","screen","reason","mai","conjur","want","let","know","stai","awai","jessica","simpson","hopefulli","learn","lesson","nowbr","br","jessica","simpson","natur","ca","act","hell","make","jessica","alba","look","like","audri","hepburn","yet","star","thi","movi","oh","wait","produc","father","okai","get","part","realli","onli","reason","think","ofbr","br","surpris","bad","amaz","bad","think","lot","peopl","thei","see","much","mean","expect","movi","star","jessica","simpson","bad","thi","bad","complet","opposit","classic","film","think","great","woodi","allen","movi","thi","film","bad","film","good","antianni","hallbr","br","glad","pai","see","stop","watch","ten","minut","cu","go","doubt","walk","theater","soon","fact","wonder","mani","peopl","see","per","theater","actual","stai","watch","whole","thing","film","start","laughabl","bad","go","point","bad","becom","kind","chines","water","tortur","around","act","end","realiz","onli","get","wrong","either","ne","leav","kill","yourselfbr","br","conclus","thi","film","go","categori","bad","us","place","water","board","guantanamo","bai","although","prefer","water","board"],"filtered2":["write","gui","name","john","cohen","guess","screenplai","ever","work","someon","tell","re","suppos","write","dialog","sound","like","someth","someon","actual","mai","saybr","direct","scott","marshal","son","gerri","marshal","nut","fall","far","tree","someon","mai","want","let","know","fact","shoot","scene","cab","new","york","look","real","wo","fake","blue","screen","reason","mai","conjur","want","let","know","stai","awai","jessica","simpson","hopefulli","learn","lesson","nowbr","jessica","simpson","natur","ca","act","hell","make","jessica","alba","look","like","audri","hepburn","yet","star","oh","wait","produc","father","okai","get","part","realli","onli","reason","think","ofbr","surpris","bad","amaz","bad","think","lot","peopl","see","mean","expect","star","jessica","simpson","bad","bad","complet","opposit","classic","think","great","woodi","allen","bad"

{"value":"Dialogue: stilted, clichéd; Acting: hammy, clichéd; Plot: predictable, clichéd.<br /><br />Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this \"B\" rubbish? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made, Kinski had masterpieces like \"Tess\" and \"Cat People\" behind her... Must have been desperate.<br /><br />The bad guys all have bad-guy accents - *bad* bad-guy accents! (Plummer especially! Where *did* he learn to do \"German\"?) and most of them have bad-guy sneers as well. The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh. The good guy survives, amongst other things: * a 5\" throwing knife buried hilt-deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all; * marines' machine-gun fire (I think someone referred to a .50) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp; * several fist-fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium-first into a door frame; * a fall, backwards, from what looks like the third floor, onto paving, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience. The script has exactly 3 clever lines, the rest of the time it's all so dull and boring.<br /><br />OK it's not all bad. Plummer does bring a certain class to his part, and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick. Of course that doesn't say much, but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here. He delivers his \"Ve haff vays and meance\" type lines with some menace, but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain.<br /><br />This movie is truly an awful waste of time. The acting, such as it is, is sort of 70's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee's very obviously faked fight scenes, but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film. Don't bother.","finished_norm":["dialogu","stilt","clichéd","act","hammi","clichéd","plot","predict","clichédbr","br","just","what","be","christoph","plummer","nastassia","kinski","do","in","thi","b","rubbish","plummer","be","good","establish","decad","befor","thi","movi","be","make","kinski","have","masterpiec","like","tess","and","cat","peopl","behind","her","must","have","be","desperatebr","br","the","bad","gui","all","have","badgui","accent","bad","badgui","accent","plummer","especi","where","do","he","learn","to","do","german","and","much","of","them","have","badgui","sneer","a","good","the","innoc","bystand","all","overdo","their","panic","enough","to","make","you","laugh","the","good","gui","surviv","amongst","other","thing","a","throw","knife","buri","hiltdeep","in","hi","shoulder","just","pull","it","out","and","second","late","be","us","the","arm","with","no","difficulti","at","all","marin","machinegun","fire","i","think","someon","refer","to","a","in","the","leg","which","he","sort","out","by","tie","a","bandag","around","hi","pant","leg","and","thereaft","he","bare","have","a","limp","sever","fistfight","in","which","he","sustain","multipl","punch","to","the","face","a","good","a","be","run","craniumfirst","into","a","door","frame","a","fall","backward","from","what","look","like","the","floor","onto","pave","without","the","slight","sign","of","a","twist","ankl","or","ani","other","such","trifl","inconveni","the","script","have","exactli","clever","line","the","rest","of","the","time","it","all","so","dull","and","boringbr","br","okai","it","not","all","bad","plummer","doe","bring","a","certain","class","to","hi","part","and","be","undoubtedli","the","well","actor","in","thi","flick","of","cours","that","doe","not","sai","much","but","he","can","do","the","callou","villain","without","resort","to","the","ham","techniqu","much","of","the","villain","us","here","he","deliv","hi","have","haff","vai","and","meanc","typ","line","with","some","menac","but","you","be","alwai","awar","you","be","watch","christoph","plummer","act","the","villainbr","br","thi","movi","be","truli","a","aw","wast","of","time","the","act","such","a","it","be","be","sort","of","movi","wooden","line","deliveri","meet","bruce","lee","veri","obvious","fake","fight","scene","but","it","not","even","anywher","near","a","good","a","either","a","roger","moor","or","a","bruce","lee","film","do","not","bother"],"filtered":["dialogu","stilt","clichéd","act","hammi","clichéd","plot","predict","clichédbr","br","christoph","plummer","nastassia","kinski","thi","b","rubbish","plummer","good","establish","decad","befor","thi","movi","make","kinski","masterpiec","like","tess","cat","peopl","behind","must","desperatebr","br","bad","gui","badgui","accent","bad","badgui","accent","plummer","especi","learn","german","much","badgui","sneer","good","innoc","bystand","overdo","panic","enough","make","laugh","good","gui","surviv","amongst","thing","throw","knife","buri","hiltdeep","hi","shoulder","pull","second","late","us","arm","difficulti","marin","machinegun","fire","think","someon","refer","leg","sort","tie","bandag","around","hi","pant","leg","thereaft","bare","limp","sever","fistfight","sustain","multipl","punch","face","good","run","craniumfirst","door","frame","fall","backward","look","like","floor","onto","pave","without","slight","sign","twist","ankl","ani","trifl","inconveni","script","exactli","clever","line","rest","time","dull","boringbr","br","okai","bad","plummer","doe","bring","certain","class","hi","part","undoubtedli","well","actor","thi","flick","cours","doe","sai","much","callou","villain","without","resort","ham","techniqu","much","villain","us","deliv","hi","haff","vai","meanc","typ","line","menac","alwai","awar","watch","christoph","plummer","act","villainbr","br","thi","movi","truli","aw","wast","time","act","sort","movi","wooden","line","deliveri","meet","bruce","lee","veri","obvious","fake","fight","scene","even","anywher","near","good","either","roger","moor","bruce","lee","film","bother"],"filtered2":["dialogu","stilt","clichéd","act","hammi","clichéd","plot","predict","clichédbr","christoph","plummer","nastassia","kinski","b","rubbish","plummer","good","establish","decad","befor","make","kinski","masterpiec","like","tess","cat","peopl","behind","must","desperatebr","bad","gui","badgui","accent","bad","badgui","accent","plummer","especi","learn","german","badgui","sneer","good","innoc","bystand","overdo","panic","enough","make","laugh","good","gui","surviv","amongst","thing","throw","knife","buri","hiltdeep","shoulder","pull","second","late","us","arm","difficulti","marin","machinegun","fire","think","someon","refer","leg","sort","tie","bandag","around","pant","leg","thereaft","bare","limp","sever","fistfight","sustain","multipl","punch","face","good","run","craniumfirst","door","frame","fall","backward","look","like","floor","onto","pave","without","slight","sign","twist","ankl","ani","trifl","inconveni","script","exactli","

{"value":"This is a really bad film, with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though!. All the characters are just annoying (except Lamas), and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for!, plus the action is very boring. The film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring, laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up!, plus it looks very cheap and amateurish!. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but he can't save this piece of crap, and believe it or not the opening was really cool, as was the ending, however the middle is incredibly boring, and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button!, plus The dialog is especially laughable!.There is a cool bar scene that i really liked, but once Lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart, plus the scene where The villains torture Jennifer's family, and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable!. This is a really bad film, with bad acting and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though!, however it is not enough, not recommended. The Direction is very bad. George Erschbamer does a very bad job here, with mediocre camera work, bland location, and keeping the film at a boring pace. The Acting is pretty bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is awesome here, and while he isn't required to act, he is quite fun to watch, and has a really cool character, and had a lot of charisma, however even he can't save this one,and he had no chemistry with the cast either! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and while she's decent looking, she isn't very convincing and had no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but does not have much to do but scream and scared, she did okay at that.Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying as the main villain, and wasn't menacing at all, he was laughable as were the other 2.

{"value":"PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance(is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump AB in their movies together?). Some touching scenes in the 2nd half.<br /><br />CONS: The whole 1st hour(the jokes were flat to say the least). Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav. Major stupidity in AB's decision making. Let me get this straight, he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way(that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to make Akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth?? WTF? He considers Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father is soon gonna die due to cancer, but thinks insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Easily the movie's biggest flaw.<br /><br />- Akshay becoming a stunt man. LMAO!! We're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in MBA. But when the time arrives to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stunt man. LOL!! How abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field? Or Heck, anywhere else where ur life isn't in danger? This is some incredibly dumb writing.<br /><br />- The ending. I hate this sort of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for AB's character, which I couldn't. The entire thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH(which I hate). This \"please feel sorry for the guy with the illness\" crap has run its course. I felt more like puking than sympathy for the OLD man. Couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd. the whole thing.<br /><br />Bottomline: Waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie. Its obvious director Vipul Shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense. Give 'em some decent song picturizations, fancy outfits, plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap-up crap like this.","finished_norm":["pro","akshai","kumar","performancei","it","just","me","or","doe","thi","gui","alwai","manag","to","trump","ab","in","their","movi","togeth","some","touch","scene","in","the","nd","halfbr","br","con","the","whole","st","hourth","joke","be","flat","to","sai","the","littl","everi","scene","involv","rajpal","yadav","major","stupid","in","ab","decis","make","let","me","get","thi","straight","he","believ","brutal","insult","hi","son","soul","in","everi","possibl","waythat","will","like","ruin","their","relationship","beyond","repair","be","a","well","wai","for","him","to","make","akshai","final","take","some","respons","then","actual","tell","him","the","truth","wtf","he","consid","akshay","be","too","soft","to","bear","the","fact","that","hi","old","father","be","soon","gonna","die","due","to","cancer","but","think","insult","him","will","make","him","strong","be","i","the","onli","on","who","doe","not","see","the","logic","here","easili","the","movi","big","flawbr","br","akshai","becom","a","stunt","man","lmao","we","re","tell","he","finish","st","in","colleg","everi","year","and","have","a","degre","in","mba","but","when","the","time","arriv","to","support","himself","and","hi","pregnant","wife","he","becom","a","stunt","man","lol","how","abt","actual","appli","for","a","normal","job","in","ur","field","or","heck","anywher","els","where","ur","life","be","not","in","danger","thi","be","some","incredibli","dumb","writingbr","br","the","end","i","hate","thi","sort","of","melodramat","crap","everyth","be","push","down","our","throat","to","feel","sorri","for","ab","charact","which","i","can","not","the","entir","thing","remind","me","a","littl","too","much","of","srk","in","khnhwhich","i","hate","thi","pleas","feel","sorri","for","the","gui","with","the","ill","crap","have","run","it","cours","i","feel","much","like","puke","than","sympathi","for","the","old","man","can","not","watch","the","final","or","so","minut","becaus","of","it","and","thu","have","to","fast","fwd","the","whole","thingbr","br","bottomlin","waqt","be","just","too","dumb","to","be","call","a","good","movi","it","obviou","director","vipul","shah","target","thi","at","the","emotion","fragil","chica","and","oldi","who","can","care","littl","about","a","stori","that","actual","make","sens","give","em","some","decent","song","pictur","fanci","outfit","plenti","of","glycerinfil","scene","and","some","star","power","and","thei","will","happili","lapup","crap","like","thi"],"filtered":["pro","akshai","kumar","performancei","doe","thi","gui","alwai","manag","trump","ab","movi","togeth","touch","scene","nd","halfbr","br","con","whole","st","hourth","joke","flat","sai","littl","everi","scene","involv","rajpal","yadav","major","stupid","ab","decis","make","let","get","thi","straight","believ","brutal","insult","hi","son","soul","everi","possibl","waythat","like","ruin","relationship","beyond","repair","well","wai","make","akshai","final","take","respons","actual","tell","truth","wtf","consid","akshay","soft","bear","fact","hi","old","father","soon","gonna","die","due","cancer","think","insult","make","strong","onli","doe","see","logic","easili","movi","big","flawbr","br","akshai","becom","stunt","man","lmao","re","tell","finish","st","colleg","everi","year","degre","mba","time","arriv","support","hi","pregnant","wife","becom","stunt","man","lol","abt","actual","appli","normal","job","ur","field","heck","anywher","els","ur","life","danger","thi","incredibli","dumb","writingbr","br","end","hate","thi","sort","melodramat","crap","everyth","push","throat","feel","sorri","ab","charact","entir","thing","remind","littl","much","srk","khnhwhich","hate","thi","pleas","feel","sorri","gui","ill","crap","run","cours","feel","much","like","puke","sympathi","old","man","watch","final","minut","becaus","thu","fast","fwd","whole","thingbr","br","bottomlin","waqt","dumb","call","good","movi","obviou","director","vipul","shah","target","thi","emotion","fragil","chica","oldi","care","littl","stori","actual","make","sens","give","em","decent","song","pictur","fanci","outfit","plenti","glycerinfil","scene","star","power","thei","happili","lapup","crap","like","thi"],"filtered2":["pro","akshai","kumar","performancei","doe","gui","alwai","manag","trump","ab","togeth","touch","scene","nd","halfbr","con","whole","st","hourth","joke","flat","littl","everi","scene","involv","rajpal","yadav","major","stupid","ab","decis","make","let","get","straight","believ","brutal","insult","son","soul","everi","possibl","waythat","like","ruin","relationship","beyond","repair","well","wai","make","akshai","final","take","respons","actual","tell","truth","wtf","consid","akshay","soft","bear","fact","old","father","soon","gonna","die","due","cancer","think","insult","make","strong","onli","doe","see","logic","easili","big","flawbr","akshai","becom","stunt","man","lmao","re","tell","finish","st","colleg","everi","year","degre","mba","time","arriv","support","pregnant","wife

{"value":"This is a very old and cheaply made film--a typical low-budget B-Western in so many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of John Wayne that were done for \"poverty row\" studios. With both actors, their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper doesn't seem exactly like the Cooper of just a few years later (he talks faster in this early film, among other things).<br /><br />However, unlike the average B-movie of the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see the woman that was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very, very odd casting choice, as she has a heavy accent (she was French) and wasn't even close to being \"movie star pretty\". Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /><br />But for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot--sort of like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought this was a NEW idea). Gary Cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep Cooper clear of females. This misogyny alone doesn't necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls--with his arms cradled around him! This was pretty edgy stuff for the time and I think this makes this dull film really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip-able. Unless you are curious about Damita or the homosexual undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better Western.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","veri","old","and","cheapli","make","filma","typic","lowbudget","bwestern","in","so","mani","wai","gari","cooper","be","not","yet","a","star","and","thi","film","be","highli","reminisc","of","the","earli","film","of","john","wayn","that","be","do","for","poverti","row","studio","with","both","actor","their","familiar","styl","and","persona","be","still","not","complet","form","thi","incarn","of","gari","cooper","doe","not","seem","exactli","like","the","cooper","of","just","a","few","year","late","he","talk","fast","in","thi","earli","film","among","other","thingsbr","br","howev","unlik","the","averag","bmovi","of","the","era","there","be","at","littl","a","few","interest","elem","that","make","the","film","uniqu","if","not","good","if","you","ever","want","to","see","the","woman","that","be","marri","to","errol","flynn","for","seven","year","thi","be","your","chanc","lili","damita","star","a","the","femal","love","interest","and","thi","be","a","veri","veri","odd","cast","choic","a","she","have","a","heavi","accent","she","be","french","and","be","not","even","close","to","be","movi","star","pretti","incident","she","be","conjur","marri","to","director","michael","curtiz","br","br","but","for","me","the","much","memor","and","weird","aspect","of","the","film","be","the","seemingli","gai","subplotsort","of","like","a","brokeback","mountain","from","the","and","we","think","thi","be","a","new","idea","gari","cooper","charact","be","rais","by","two","man","who","hate","woman","and","do","everyth","thei","can","through","much","of","the","film","to","keep","cooper","clear","of","femal","thi","misogyni","alon","doe","not","necessarili","mean","much","but","there","be","so","mani","clue","throughout","the","film","that","indic","the","maker","of","the","film","realli","be","try","to","portrai","them","a","a","gai","coupl","in","particular","toward","the","end","when","on","of","them","be","kill","the","other","be","shoot","by","a","arrow","and","hold","off","dye","long","enough","to","crawl","over","to","the","bodi","of","hi","fall","friend","and","then","fallswith","hi","arm","cradl","around","him","thi","be","pretti","edgi","stuff","for","the","time","and","i","think","thi","make","thi","dull","film","realli","fascin","todai","a","far","a","cooper","and","the","plot","go","the","film","be","a","bite","of","a","disappoint","and","veri","skipabl","unless","you","be","curiou","about","damita","or","the","homosexu","underton","do","yourself","a","favor","and","find","a","well","western"],"filtered":["thi","veri","old","cheapli","make","filma","typic","lowbudget","bwestern","mani","wai","gari","cooper","yet","star","thi","film","highli","reminisc","earli","film","john","wayn","poverti","row","studio","actor","familiar","styl","persona","still","complet","form","thi","incarn","gari","cooper","doe","seem","exactli","like","cooper","year","late","talk","fast","thi","earli","film","among","thingsbr","br","howev","unlik","averag","bmovi","era","littl","interest","elem","make","film","uniqu","good","ever","want","see","woman","marri","errol","flynn","seven","year","thi","chanc","lili","damita","star","femal","love","interest","thi","veri","veri","odd","cast","choic","heavi","accent","french","even","close","movi","star","pretti","incident","conjur","marri","director","michael","curtiz","br","br","much","memor","weird","aspect","film","seemingli","gai","subplotsort","like","brokeback","mountain","think","thi","new","idea","gari","cooper","charact","rais","two","man","hate","woman","everyth","thei","much","film","keep","cooper","clear","femal","thi","misogyni","alon","doe","necessarili","mean","much","mani","clue","throughout","film","indic","maker","film","realli","try","portrai","gai","coupl","particular","toward","end","kill","shoot","arrow","hold","dye","long","enough","crawl","bodi","hi","fall","friend","fallswith","hi","arm","cradl","around","thi","pretti","edgi","stuff","time","think","thi","make","thi","dull","film","realli","fascin","todai","far","cooper","plot","go","film","bite","disappoint","veri","skipabl","unless","curiou","damita","homosexu","underton","favor","find","well","western"],"filtered2":["veri","old","cheapli","make","filma","typic","lowbudget","bwestern","mani","wai","gari","cooper","yet","star","highli","reminisc","earli","john","wayn","poverti","row","studio","actor","familiar","styl","persona","still","complet","form","incarn","gari","cooper","doe","seem","exactli","like","cooper","year","late","talk","fast","earli","among","thingsbr","howev","unlik","averag","bmovi","era","littl","interest","elem","make","uniqu","good","ever","want","see","woman","marri","errol","flynn","seven","year","chanc","lili","damita","star","femal","love","interest","veri","veri","odd","cast","choic","heavi","accent","french","even","close","star","pretti","incident","conjur","marri","director","michael","curtiz","memor","weird","aspect","seemingli","gai","subplotsort","like","

{"value":"Easily the best known of all the Shakespeare plays, it has been seriously let down here. Shoddy direction, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.<br /><br />In the town of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. Bloodshed soon erupts...<br /><br />The studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the play. It's a story that, with it's energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. Coupled with this the costumes are hideous, with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces. The stage fighting looks horrendous, with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging.<br /><br />Patrick Ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective Romeo. He manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland, often inexpressive eyes limit his range. It is very hard for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too youthful to be a good Juliet - she captures the character's naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.<br /><br />The supporting roles don't fare much better. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera. He gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt. He did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years, but that isn't in evidence here. The Prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera. Only Micheal Hordern, in probably his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity. His Capulet is well-played and a joy to watch.<br /><br />See one of the other versions of this story

{"value":"This was the first sequel I'd seen (apart from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed.<br /><br />The storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when Melody finds out she's upset and angry. And she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy swimming around, and Ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid.<br /><br />The story doesn't sound too bad written down, but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable.<br /><br />There's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and Dash being two of them. They aren't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. The animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it's jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements.<br /><br />Another piece of advice-try to forget about Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. This is much better viewed if you've never seen the original-you'll have nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />However, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II.

{"value":"As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser, I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. The penchant for slapstick spoilt 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same applies here. To me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'Flash For Freedom', adapted by Mr Fraser, worked quite well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen.","finished_norm":["a","a","avid","fan","of","the","flashman","book","by","georg","mcdonald","fraser","i","look","forward","immens","to","see","flashi","on","the","big","screen","when","thi","film","be","releas","sadli","it","be","a","huge","disappoint","then","so","i","leav","it","alon","for","year","befor","go","back","to","watch","it","again","but","it","be","no","well","the","time","mr","fraser","be","a","tremend","skill","writer","but","i","be","not","a","fan","of","hi","film","screenplai","work","with","richard","lester","the","penchant","for","slapstick","spoil","the","three","musket","for","me","and","the","same","appli","here","to","me","the","whole","tone","and","feel","of","the","film","be","wrong","the","flashman","book","be","uproari","funni","in","part","but","thei","be","adventur","novel","there","be","much","serious","in","the","wai","the","adventur","that","flashman","have","after","all","he","be","involv","in","danger","situat","thi","be","convei","in","the","novel","but","not","convei","at","all","on","film","due","to","the","it","comed","styl","it","be","a","tremend","shame","a","it","can","have","a","great","film","have","it","be","a","much","faith","adapt","of","the","styl","of","the","book","when","i","read","that","the","book","be","to","be","film","the","articl","sai","that","the","film","be","to","star","oliv","re","i","rejoic","a","re","to","me","be","the","epitom","of","flashman","how","i","would","have","love","to","see","him","in","the","role","malcolm","mcdowel","be","a","good","actor","but","doe","not","fit","the","visual","imag","of","flashman","creat","by","the","book","too","scrawni","look","flashman","be","suppos","to","be","a","big","strap","fellow","neverheless","re","be","excel","a","bismarck","what","kill","the","film","be","that","it","be","make","a","a","comedi","the","onli","scene","in","which","it","creat","the","true","atmospher","of","the","book","be","the","scene","in","which","flashman","kill","de","gautet","tom","bell","a","great","shame","a","the","product","valu","costum","set","etc","be","superb","and","the","cast","be","gener","excel","just","about","everybodi","in","the","film","be","good","cast","apart","from","malcolm","mcdowel","possibli","the","directorship","of","richard","lester","be","respons","for","the","wai","the","film","be","a","a","recent","radio","adapt","of","flash","for","freedom","adapt","by","mr","fraser","work","quit","good","perhap","on","dai","we","mai","see","flashman","do","justic","on","screen"],"filtered":["avid","fan","flashman","book","georg","mcdonald","fraser","look","forward","immens","see","flashi","big","screen","thi","film","releas","sadli","huge","disappoint","leav","alon","year","befor","go","back","watch","well","time","mr","fraser","tremend","skill","writer","fan","hi","film","screenplai","work","richard","lester","penchant","slapstick","spoil","three","musket","appli","whole","tone","feel","film","wrong","flashman","book","uproari","funni","part","thei","adventur","novel","much","serious","wai","adventur","flashman","involv","danger","situat","thi","convei","novel","convei","film","due","comed","styl","tremend","shame","great","film","much","faith","adapt","styl","book","read","book","film","articl","sai","film","star","oliv","re","rejoic","re","epitom","flashman","love","see","role","malcolm","mcdowel","good","actor","doe","fit","visual","imag","flashman","creat","book","scrawni","look","flashman","suppos","big","strap","fellow","neverheless","re","excel","bismarck","kill","film","make","comedi","onli","scene","creat","true","atmospher","book","scene","flashman","kill","de","gautet","tom","bell","great","shame","product","valu","costum","set","etc","superb","cast","gener","excel","everybodi","film","good","cast","apart","malcolm","mcdowel","possibli","directorship","richard","lester","respons","wai","film","recent","radio","adapt","flash","freedom","adapt","mr","fraser","work","quit","good","perhap","dai","mai","see","flashman","justic","screen"],"filtered2":["avid","fan","flashman","book","georg","mcdonald","fraser","look","forward","immens","see","flashi","big","screen","releas","sadli","huge","disappoint","leav","alon","year","befor","go","back","watch","well","time","mr","fraser","tremend","skill","writer","fan","screenplai","work","richard","lester","penchant","slapstick","spoil","three","musket","appli","whole","tone","feel","wrong","flashman","book","uproari","funni","part","adventur","novel","serious","wai","adventur","flashman","involv","danger","situat","convei","novel","convei","due","comed","styl","tremend","shame","great","faith","adapt","styl","book","read","book","articl","star","oliv","re","rejoic","re","epitom","flashman","love","see","role","malcolm","mcdowel","good","actor","doe","fit","visual","imag","flashman","creat","book","scrawni","look","flashman","suppos","big","strap","fellow","neverheless","re","excel","bismarck","kill","make","comedi","onli","scene","creat","true","atmospher","bo

{"value":"When this film was released in 1997 the 'special effects', such as they are, were poor. They would have been dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no-one involved in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar. It's a wild departure from director Fred Olen Ray's usual stuff, most of which has the word \"Bikini\" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet, etc) and are little more than T&A flicks, but here we are with a film rated \"U\" and aimed squarely at the kiddies. You've got to give him credit for diversifying!! This was a minor direct-to-video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career went downhill fast after 1982s \"E.T.) plays the 'invisible mom' of the films title and would return for the sequel. Russ Tamblyn (whose career had been in free-fall even longer since 1961s \"West Side Story\") plays the villainous Dr. Woorter. It's probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month - except maybe young Trenton Knight as Josh. It's rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie, this child actor didn't work again after the sequel, \"Invisible Mom 2\". Maybe the film was cursed. After all, he wasn't that bad in this film. For a child actor, he's pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-stars.<br /><br />As mentioned above, the \"invisibility\" effects are naff to say the least, the direction is poor, the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about. There are plenty of worse films out there though, and for anyone under the age of about ten, this film will no doubt be quite watchable. Most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though, and I wouldn't blame them one

{"value":"Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the full-feature movie-version of \"Earth\" by DisneyNature. I guess, like the auto manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really do care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think it warrants a special unit with the word \"nature\" in it. I do know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about Disney? <br /><br />Aside from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Preceded by a half-dozen Disney movie trailers, rife with Disney cliché (\"circle of life\", \"falling with style\"), over-dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims \"40% new footage\"). I was even starting to think that James Earl Jones narration is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman doing every Warner Brothers narrative starts to wear thin. I really think that Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it.<br /><br />And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals? There were a half-dozen such scenes, complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out. I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents. I was also cognizant of how Disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change. Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it's still a controversial subject? <br /><br />I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature films seem to be best done by the British at the

{"value":"I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all, it was on the back of the box. I don't think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ;) Even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lay in this case) in front of a camera.<br /><br />I was pretty much let down by the overall \"zombie\" effect. Since apparently in this movie, zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there, and casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair but no interior bathroom), the zombie-movie genre isn't even a factor until the end. Even then, a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie.<br /><br />On to the vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is OK by me. I'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight, or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through. The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire \"Do you think we did the right thing?\" by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that about put it over the top.<br /><br />The acting and special effects were at an all-time low also. You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General. Speaking of the General, where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers look-alike anyways? No idea what he was the General of, aside of generally confusing and misplaced.<br /><br />All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3.

{"value":"Insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind. The special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! \"The Brain\" takes place in a typical quiet-American town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a TV-guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling. Under the label of \"independent thinkers\", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now, it's up to the Meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the \"evil\" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made \"Bloody Birthday\" (guilty pleasure of mine) and \"Plague\". Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her \"masterpiece\". In her debut, she was credited as 'runaway model' and in \"3 men and a baby\", her character is referred to as 'one of Jack's girls'.

{"value":"Possible Spoilers, Perhaps. I must say that \"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True\" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney's sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as \"The Little Mermaid II,\" \"The Jungle Book II,\" and \"Peter Pan II,\" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (Disney also made \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame II\" and \"Atlantis II,\" but I'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.\") Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney \"Cinderella.\" The sequel to \"Cinderella,\" however, was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, \"I'm going to do this banquet my way!\" Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, \"Ewww!\" That is the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original \"Cinderella\" when making this sequel? Well, it surely doesn't seem so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was evil. In the second one, she is good. One just can't leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney's name. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse.","finished_norm":["possibl","spoiler","perhap","i","must","sai","that","cinderella","ii","dream","come","true","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","ever","make","of","all","the","movi","be","make","dure","the","height","of","disnei","sequel","rampag","it","be","creat","around","the","same","time","a","the","littl","mermaid","ii","the","jungl","book","ii","and","peter","pan","ii","all","of","which","be","disservic","to","their","origin","film","classic","disnei","conjur","make","the","hunchback","of","notr","dame","ii","and","atlanti","ii","but","i","be","go","to","drop","that","topic","becaus","their","origin","movi","be","never","realli","classic","in","the","place","let","me","go","ahead","and","sai","that","i","be","a","avid","support","of","good","disnei","film","and","i","absolut","ador","the","origin","disnei","cinderella","the","sequel","to","cinderella","howev","be","a","wast","of","time","the","charact","of","cinderella","in","the","sequel","be","so","veri","unlik","the","origin","girl","that","i","grow","up","watch","in","the","origin","cinderella","be","kind","and","love","the","new","cinderella","have","veri","outofcharact","moment","with","currentera","phrase","like","i","be","go","to","do","thi","banquet","my","wai","let","me","conjur","tell","you","that","new","cinderella","a","i","have","affection","name","her","sai","ewww","that","be","the","anticinderella","i","try","to","find","the","well","in","peopl","but","in","the","sequel","anastasia","on","of","the","stepsist","be","good","what","the","heck","why","thei","make","it","all","out","to","be","like","ladi","tremain","and","drizella","be","just","horribl","famili","member","for","poor","littl","anastasia","my","question","to","the","world","do","the","peopl","at","disnei","watch","the","origin","cinderella","when","make","thi","sequel","good","it","sure","doe","not","seem","so","if","i","rememb","correctli","anastasia","be","just","a","abus","to","cinderella","a","drizella","and","ladi","tremain","i","be","all","for","redempt","and","forgiv","but","there","be","no","point","of","redempt","for","anastasia","in","thi","movi","in","the","on","anastasia","be","evil","in","the","on","she","be","good","on","just","ca","not","leav","a","stori","like","thi","i","hope","disnei","realiz","that","thi","movi","among","other","movi","be","shame","walt","disnei","name","perhap","now","that","michael","eisner","be","go","thing","will","start","shape","up","around","the","hous","of","mous"],"filtered":["possibl","spoiler","perhap","must","sai","cinderella","ii","dream","come","true","wrong","movi","ever","make","movi","make","dure","height","disnei","sequel","rampag","creat","around","time","littl","mermaid","ii","jungl","book","ii","peter","pan","ii","disservic","origin","film","classic","disnei","conjur","make","hunchback","notr","dame","ii","atlanti","ii","go","drop","topic","becaus","origin","movi","never","realli","classic","place","let","go","ahead","sai","avid","support","good","disnei","film","absolut","ador","origin","disnei","cinderella","sequel","cinderella","howev","wast","time","charact","cinderella","sequel","veri","unlik","origin","girl","grow","watch","origin","cinderella","kind","love","new","cinderella","veri","outofcharact","moment","currentera","phrase","like","go","thi","banquet","wai","let","conjur","tell","new","cinderella","affection","name","sai","ewww","anticinderella","try","find","well","peopl","sequel","anastasia","stepsist","good","heck","thei","make","like","ladi","tremain","drizella","horribl","famili","member","poor","littl","anastasia","question","world","peopl","disnei","watch","origin","cinderella","make","thi","sequel","good","sure","doe","seem","rememb","correctli","anastasia","abus","cinderella","drizella","ladi","tremain","redempt","forgiv","point","redempt","anastasia","thi","movi","anastasia","evil","good","ca","leav","stori","like","thi","hope","disnei","realiz","thi","movi","among","movi","shame","walt","disnei","name","perhap","michael","eisner","go","thing","start","shape","around","hous","mous"],"filtered2":["possibl","spoiler","perhap","must","cinderella","ii","dream","come","true","wrong","ever","make","make","dure","height","disnei","sequel","rampag","creat","around","time","littl","mermaid","ii","jungl","book","ii","peter","pan","ii","disservic","origin","classic","disnei","conjur","make","hunchback","notr","dame","ii","atlanti","ii","go","drop","topic","becaus","origin","never","realli","classic","place","let","go","ahead","avid","support","good","disnei","absolut","ador","origin","disnei","cinderella","sequel","cinderella","howev","wast","time","charact","cinderella","sequel","veri","unlik","origin","girl","grow","watch","origin","cinderella","kind","love","new","cinderella","veri","outofcharact","moment","currentera","phrase","like","go","banquet","wai","let","conjur","tell","new","cinderella","affection","name","ewww","anticinderella","try","find","well","peopl","sequel","anastasia","stepsist"

{"value":"Why did I go to see this film? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston's involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.<br /><br />However, as my \"one line Summary\" suggests, I was Disappointed. For various reasons;<br /><br />Reason 1: It wasn't funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking \"I really should have got some ice-cream\". I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem's such as 'The Truman Show' , 'Liar Liar' , 'Me, Myself and Irene' , 'Dumb and Dumber' , 'The Mask', and the 'Ace Ventura' films then produces, in Bruce Nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?<br /><br />Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.<br /><br />Reason 3: One word - Cliché<br /><br />Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. \"A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!\" God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?<br /><br />In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations

{"value":"POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br /><br />The Spy Who Shagged Me is a muchly overrated and over-hyped sequel. International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue. It was a lone star that few people had heard of. But it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.<br /><br />OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand-alone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.<br /><br />In particular, I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one, and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spy-spoof, I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point.<br /><br />The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross-out humour. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.<br /><br />If this were the first movie of the series then I'd probably be easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour. So I say, only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one ultimate disappointment.","finished_norm":["possibl","spoilersbr","br","the","spy","who","shag","me","be","a","muchli","overr","and","overhyp","sequel","intern","man","of","mysteri","come","straight","out","of","the","blue","it","be","a","lone","star","that","few","peopl","have","hear","of","but","it","be","stunningli","origin","have","sophist","humour","and","ampl","humour","alwai","keep","in","good","tast","and","have","a","brilliant","cast","the","spy","who","shag","me","be","a","lot","much","commerci","advertis","and","hyp","aboutbr","br","okai","i","will","admit","the","time","i","see","thi","film","i","think","it","be","veri","funni","but","it","onli","after","watch","it","two","or","three","time","that","you","see","all","the","flaw","the","act","be","okai","but","heather","graham","cannot","act","her","perform","do","not","seem","veri","convinc","and","she","be","not","near","a","good","a","liz","hurlei","be","in","the","on","that","charact","who","bloom","in","the","on","scott","evil","numb","etc","be","throw","into","the","background","hear","and","do","not","get","mani","standalon","scene","the","film","be","simpli","overrun","with","cameosbr","br","in","particular","i","hate","the","wai","thei","total","disregard","some","of","the","scene","in","imom","when","thei","kill","off","vanessa","at","the","start","and","have","basil","sit","that","he","know","she","be","a","fembot","all","along","what","be","the","point","of","that","thei","kill","off","numb","in","the","on","and","now","thei","bring","him","back","with","no","explan","whatsoev","thi","be","suppos","to","be","a","spyspoof","i","do","not","think","ani","of","the","charact","even","hold","a","gun","in","the","film","it","just","go","on","a","trail","far","and","far","awai","from","the","pointbr","br","the","new","charact","be","veri","unwelcom","the","whole","minim","make","fun","of","my","size","joke","get","old","veri","quickli","fat","bastard","be","just","a","lame","excus","for","grossout","humour","in","total","there","about","two","or","three","good","joke","the","rest","be","either","tasteless","or","rehash","from","imombr","br","if","thi","be","the","movi","of","the","seri","then","i","have","probabl","be","easi","on","it","but","the","seri","start","on","a","note","of","spindri","wit","and","then","plummet","down","to","a","level","of","gross","out","humour","so","i","sai","onli","watch","thi","film","if","you","have","not","see","it","predecessor","becaus","the","spy","who","shag","me","be","on","ultim","disappoint"],"filtered":["possibl","spoilersbr","br","spy","shag","muchli","overr","overhyp","sequel","intern","man","mysteri","come","straight","blue","lone","star","peopl","hear","stunningli","origin","sophist","humour","ampl","humour","alwai","keep","good","tast","brilliant","cast","spy","shag","lot","much","commerci","advertis","hyp","aboutbr","br","okai","admit","time","see","thi","film","think","veri","funni","onli","watch","two","three","time","see","flaw","act","okai","heather","graham","act","perform","seem","veri","convinc","near","good","liz","hurlei","charact","bloom","scott","evil","numb","etc","throw","background","hear","get","mani","standalon","scene","film","simpli","overrun","cameosbr","br","particular","hate","wai","thei","total","disregard","scene","imom","thei","kill","vanessa","start","basil","sit","know","fembot","along","point","thei","kill","numb","thei","bring","back","explan","whatsoev","thi","suppos","spyspoof","think","ani","charact","even","hold","gun","film","go","trail","far","far","awai","pointbr","br","new","charact","veri","unwelcom","whole","minim","make","fun","size","joke","get","old","veri","quickli","fat","bastard","lame","excus","grossout","humour","total","two","three","good","joke","rest","either","tasteless","rehash","imombr","br","thi","movi","seri","probabl","easi","seri","start","note","spindri","wit","plummet","level","gross","humour","sai","onli","watch","thi","film","see","predecessor","becaus","spy","shag","ultim","disappoint"],"filtered2":["possibl","spoilersbr","spy","shag","muchli","overr","overhyp","sequel","intern","man","mysteri","come","straight","blue","lone","star","peopl","hear","stunningli","origin","sophist","humour","ampl","humour","alwai","keep","good","tast","brilliant","cast","spy","shag","lot","commerci","advertis","hyp","aboutbr","okai","admit","time","see","think","veri","funni","onli","watch","two","three","time","see","flaw","act","okai","heather","graham","act","perform","seem","veri","convinc","near","good","liz","hurlei","charact","bloom","scott","evil","numb","etc","throw","background","hear","get","mani","standalon","scene","simpli","overrun","cameosbr","particular","hate","wai","total","disregard","scene","imom","kill","vanessa","start","basil","sit","know","fembot","along","point","kill","numb","bring","back","explan","whatsoev","suppos","spyspoof","think","ani","charact","even","hold","gun","go","trail","far","far","awai","pointbr","new","charact","veri","un

{"value":"(r#97)<br /><br />There is one good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (make of that what you will): the opening theme. It has to be the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed Japanese made-for-the-consumers-oops-I-mean-the-young-fans anime TV show. Unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening theme. And they just couldn't come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than the others' cards. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I can't imagine why any kids would want to sit through a show where dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the running time.<br /><br />\"My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your measly Pyramid Diamond Animal in a single strike! Can't you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, you fool?! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA!\"<br /><br />\"Oh yeah? Well watch this! I am about to use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card which eradicates every single one of your Power Munchers and renders your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond all Significance Attack useless! I bet you didn't see that one coming!\" <br /><br />Seriously, that's all they ever do in this show, talk. Whereas in another crappy kids' show I used to watch, namely the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (every soccer mum's pet peeve), at least the monsters had the courtesy to duke it out every once in a while, \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" is just, in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange review, \"plain talky and boring\". Not to mention long-winded (I realize I'm being hypocritical here considering the sentence I just wrote).<br /><br />This show goes on forever. I don't know if there's any plot, and the static monsters have none of the character of Pokémon. Even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a kid, this show sucks.

{"value":"This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it. It doesn't give any insight-, or solutions to the problem. It's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family. Why would you want to watch this? It's all so totally pointless and meaningless.<br /><br />It also really doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50+ year old male. You'll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize for him. He just seems like a dirty old playboy, who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes.<br /><br />It also doesn't have a bad visual style, though it all feels a bit forced. But nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows, if the film-makers had been given better material to work with, the movie would had deserved a better faith.<br /><br />The story really gets ridicules at times. There are really some pointless plot-lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be. I'm talking about for instance the whole Ordell plot-line. Things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending. Also the whole way the story is being told, cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple.<br /><br />But as far as bad movies are concerned, this just isn't one of them. It's not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flick, with similar concepts.<br /><br />Still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is. Guess they were really desperate for work and money.<br /><br

{"value":"Let this film serve as the death knell to the \"big twist\" films borne out of the 1990s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as \"Mr. Madonna\"), utilizes the Soze motif in a far more obsequious manner. <br /><br />Jason Statham (with a highly questionable head of hair) stars as Jack Green (known to all as \"Mr. Green.\") He may or may not also be criminal mastermind Mr. Gold. Or, perhaps Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld. I'm not quite certain, but I certainly don't care. REVOLVER is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess I've had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time. Witness the fractured time structure, the painful jump cuts, the ceaseless inner-monologues, and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This \"everything and the kitchen sink\" directing style makes Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre look sedate. The cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as I was watching it.<br /><br />The film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green as I always enjoy Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, though, he struggles along like a remedial reader in a University English Literature class. His lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord, Liotta spits, cries, and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos. <br /><br />There are no redeeming qualities to REVOLVER. It's yet another filmic faux pas from Ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst film

The production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and a lot of the boys in the movie that don't speak are cute too. Why isn't the actress who plays Amy listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink.<br /><br />The worse thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend. He can't act. He's also very scrawny, not nice to look at at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It's no wonder he has to make his own movie and cast himself in it. No one else would cast him in anything.<br /><br />James Townsend is not believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so gay. They should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what's best for the movie. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft-core porn, definitely not real acting because he would have taken some acting lessons. Plus, anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood.<br /><br />The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the casting of a tan-skinned Latina as Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem like an actress at all. All in all, this movie is soft-core porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by it and doesn't want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name. Plus, I ran into him in West Hollywood one time recently and when I mentioned this movie, he just turned around and walked away. I understand.
