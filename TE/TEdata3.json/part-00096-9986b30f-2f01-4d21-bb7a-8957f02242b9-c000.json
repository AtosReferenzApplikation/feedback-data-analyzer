{"value":"It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the MediocreLand? \"PP\" reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, \"This could be me\" sentiment. They are not funny either.<br /><br />The actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference/counter-transference courses in Stanford. Somebody should give them a Code of Ethics to read (the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it). No therapists are that bad.<br /><br />Women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death, we've all graduated \"Sex and the City\". Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well. The only successful/palatable developments are Addison struggling with her decision to move to LA, and the \"Voodoo Dr\" and his coping with widowhood.<br /><br />This concept might work with a whole new writing team.","finished_norm":["it","look","like","the","brilliant","team","of","shonda","rhime","outsourc","the","write","of","thi","on","somewher","offshor","mayb","to","the","mediocreland","pp","remind","me","ani","on","of","the","mani","tediou","promis","at","but","predict","within","season","david","kelli","flick","picket","fenc","alli","mcbeal","and","now","boston","legal","the","crazi","case","thei","get","be","so","outlandish","thei","bare","evok","sympathi","or","sad","and","that","what","actual","make","good","medic","drama","tick","dramat","situat","you","be","afraid","of","thi","can","be","me","sentim","thei","be","not","funni","eitherbr","br","the","actor","be","quit","good","but","the","plot","line","be","dead","and","cannot","be","bring","back","to","live","i","be","a","therapist","and","let","me","tell","you","ami","brennan","plai","the","much","unbeliev","incompet","uneth","untrain","therapist","whoever","write","her","stuff","flunk","the","ethic","and","the","transferencecountertransfer","cours","in","stanford","somebodi","should","give","them","a","code","of","ethic","to","read","the","episod","with","the","nosebleed","wife","and","the","therapist","involv","in","it","no","therapist","be","that","badbr","br","woman","yearn","for","man","who","have","move","on","have","be","do","to","death","we","have","all","graduat","sex","and","the","citi","addison","in","her","youth","aggress","toward","the","gui","she","like","veri","ageinappropri","look","so","unnatur","on","a","woman","over","and","thi","otherwis","talent","actress","doe","not","believ","it","herself","and","doe","not","deliv","it","veri","good","the","onli","successfulpalat","develop","be","addison","struggl","with","her","decis","to","move","to","la","and","the","voodoo","dr","and","hi","cope","with","widowhoodbr","br","thi","concept","mai","work","with","a","whole","new","write","team"],"filtered":["look","like","brilliant","team","shonda","rhime","outsourc","write","thi","somewher","offshor","mayb","mediocreland","pp","remind","ani","mani","tediou","promis","predict","within","season","david","kelli","flick","picket","fenc","alli","mcbeal","boston","legal","crazi","case","thei","get","outlandish","thei","bare","evok","sympathi","sad","actual","make","good","medic","drama","tick","dramat","situat","afraid","thi","sentim","thei","funni","eitherbr","br","actor","quit","good","plot","line","dead","bring","back","live","therapist","let","tell","ami","brennan","plai","much","unbeliev","incompet","uneth","untrain","therapist","whoever","write","stuff","flunk","ethic","transferencecountertransfer","cours","stanford","somebodi","give","code","ethic","read","episod","nosebleed","wife","therapist","involv","therapist","badbr","br","woman","yearn","man","move","death","graduat","sex","citi","addison","youth","aggress","toward","gui","like","veri","ageinappropri","look","unnatur","woman","thi","otherwis","talent","actress","doe","believ","doe","deliv","veri","good","onli","successfulpalat","develop","addison","struggl","decis","move","la","voodoo","dr","hi","cope","widowhoodbr","br","thi","concept","mai","work","whole","new","write","team"],"filtered2":["look","like","brilliant","team","shonda","rhime","outsourc","write","somewher","offshor","mayb","mediocreland","pp","remind","ani","mani","tediou","promis","predict","within","season","david","kelli","flick","picket","fenc","alli","mcbeal","boston","legal","crazi","case","get","outlandish","bare","evok","sympathi","sad","actual","make","good","medic","drama","tick","dramat","situat","afraid","sentim","funni","eitherbr","actor","quit","good","plot","line","dead","bring","back","live","therapist","let","tell","ami","brennan","plai","unbeliev","incompet","uneth","untrain","therapist","whoever","write","stuff","flunk","ethic","transferencecountertransfer","cours","stanford","somebodi","give","code","ethic","read","nosebleed","wife","therapist","involv","therapist","badbr","woman","yearn","man","move","death","graduat","sex","citi","addison","youth","aggress","toward","gui","like","veri","ageinappropri","look","unnatur","woman","otherwis","talent","actress","doe","believ","doe","deliv","veri","good","onli","successfulpalat","develop","addison","struggl","decis","move","la","voodoo","dr","cope","widowhoodbr","concept","mai","work","whole","new","write","team"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,11,15,16,18,27,30,32,40,41,45,46,48,50,52,55,62,63,65,70,87,90,91,107,111,116,120,124,145,163,199,228,241,245,250,254,257,263,275,276,288,320,337,354,361,455,463,473,517,563,571,589,595,627,644,672,675,683,712,723,726,739,756,766,804,817,842,912,1082,1235,1244,1483,1609,1628,1640,1675,1819,1823,1900,2136,2281,2443,2811,3073,3165,3181,3224,3341,3449,3523,3988,4123,4779,5019,5044,5161,5753,6407],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. I don't know why it took me so long as I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet.<br /><br />First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough. The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all.<br /><br />The plot is non-existent. There's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all I got. What the deal was with the short/giant Italian guy I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything.<br /><br />And if the title is anything to go by, his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. And he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD, but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can.

{"value":"As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting wasn't the best. That's forgivable. It's the message that's not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait, that's not all. You'll get a brand new truck, a $6000 raise, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. THEN you'll win the state championship because God helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - all because \"God wanted him to make it.\" Then you'll win the state championship again the next year. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts.<br /><br />Here's what I took away from the movie: God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which bible is this story based on? I'll bet Saint Stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus.

{"value":"It was Jon Pertwee who said \" It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly \" . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is \" Very easy \" . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap

{"value":"So I had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater. As I watched it for the first time I was expecting another romantic, tear-jerking Barbra Streisand film; Something like The Way We Were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. There wasn't anything romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast-forward button. At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and I kept asking myself when it was going to end.<br /><br />The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever. It wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard.<br /><br />The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The ending of the movie when she sings \"With One More Look At You/Watch Closely Now\" was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.","finished_norm":["so","i","have","hear","from","a","few","peopl","that","thi","film","have","bring","them","to","tear","in","the","theater","a","i","watch","it","for","the","time","i","be","expect","anoth","romant","tearjerk","barbra","streisand","film","someth","like","the","wai","we","be","i","be","certainli","wrong","the","chemistri","between","the","two","main","charact","esther","hoffman","and","her","john","howard","be","nonexist","make","it","imposs","to","get","attach","to","the","charact","there","be","not","anyth","romant","about","it","streisand","charact","fall","for","a","alcohol","drug","addict","who","can","not","sing","a","singl","note","without","make","me","want","to","hit","the","fastforward","button","at","on","point","her","charact","find","her","husband","in","bed","with","anoth","woman","and","she","forgiv","him","about","five","minut","late","there","noth","romant","about","a","deadbeat","rock","star","and","a","woman","who","ca","not","seem","to","realiz","it","until","he","actual","die","part","of","the","movi","seem","to","drag","on","and","on","and","i","keep","ask","myself","when","it","be","go","to","endbr","br","the","death","of","john","howard","be","complet","predict","there","be","total","obviou","foreshadow","of","hi","reckless","behavior","earli","on","in","the","movi","and","when","he","die","i","feel","no","emot","whatsoev","it","be","not","a","tragic","accid","it","be","him","basic","be","a","idiot","not","to","mention","throughout","the","movi","i","be","distract","by","hi","hideou","beardbr","br","the","onli","part","of","thi","movi","worth","see","be","the","streisand","song","the","end","of","the","movi","when","she","sing","with","on","much","look","at","youwatch","close","now","be","my","reason","for","give","thi","film","a","whop","that","minut","be","the","onli","part","of","the","movi","i","actual","feel","a","emot","other","than","irrit","and","anger"],"filtered":["hear","peopl","thi","film","bring","tear","theater","watch","time","expect","anoth","romant","tearjerk","barbra","streisand","film","someth","like","wai","certainli","wrong","chemistri","two","main","charact","esther","hoffman","john","howard","nonexist","make","imposs","get","attach","charact","anyth","romant","streisand","charact","fall","alcohol","drug","addict","sing","singl","note","without","make","want","hit","fastforward","button","point","charact","find","husband","bed","anoth","woman","forgiv","five","minut","late","noth","romant","deadbeat","rock","star","woman","ca","seem","realiz","actual","die","part","movi","seem","drag","keep","ask","go","endbr","br","death","john","howard","complet","predict","total","obviou","foreshadow","hi","reckless","behavior","earli","movi","die","feel","emot","whatsoev","tragic","accid","basic","idiot","mention","throughout","movi","distract","hi","hideou","beardbr","br","onli","part","thi","movi","worth","see","streisand","song","end","movi","sing","much","look","youwatch","close","reason","give","thi","film","whop","minut","onli","part","movi","actual","feel","emot","irrit","anger"],"filtered2":["hear","peopl","bring","tear","theater","watch","time","expect","anoth","romant","tearjerk","barbra","streisand","someth","like","wai","certainli","wrong","chemistri","two","main","charact","esther","hoffman","john","howard","nonexist","make","imposs","get","attach","charact","anyth","romant","streisand","charact","fall","alcohol","drug","addict","sing","singl","note","without","make","want","hit","fastforward","button","point","charact","find","husband","bed","anoth","woman","forgiv","five","minut","late","noth","romant","deadbeat","rock","star","woman","ca","seem","realiz","actual","die","part","seem","drag","keep","ask","go","endbr","death","john","howard","complet","predict","total","obviou","foreshadow","reckless","behavior","earli","die","feel","emot","whatsoev","tragic","accid","basic","idiot","mention","throughout","distract","hideou","beardbr","onli","part","worth","see","streisand","song","end","sing","look","youwatch","close","reason","give","whop","minut","onli","part","actual","feel","emot","irrit","anger"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,10,11,16,23,24,25,30,33,35,37,38,43,47,49,52,53,59,61,66,70,73,81,95,100,103,104,125,130,134,150,170,179,184,216,219,245,250,266,285,286,291,293,295,306,328,337,383,388,389,405,424,438,443,505,506,536,560,582,659,697,706,764,864,901,959,992,1065,1120,1132,1310,1325,1356,1484,1494,1905,1949,2052,2078,2210,2239,2298,2456,2548,2657,3258,4069,5024,5500,6428,6544,8257],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,

{"value":"Being the only movie I was able to see at this year's \"Nordische Filmtage\" at Lübeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.<br /><br />This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it.<br /><br />First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have rescued the movie. E.g. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so called \"sex-scene\" was nothing else but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality), but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. Lynch, but of course without their geniality.<br /><br />So, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in

{"value":"Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful, it's terrible.<br /><br />I wouldn't have minded if this had been an animated series- would've been better that way I guess, but as a live-action show, it typifies the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy'. Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi- coloured, spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is woeful, and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch, it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme, look as equally as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look as if they are jumping and dancing about; like it was some version of the 'Nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. Besides, there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly.<br /><br />Kids show or not, this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America, you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; thus the somewhat 'fake' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version.<br /><br />If you like this type of thing, then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent.","finished_norm":["veri","rare","do","i","give","littl","rave","review","on","a","show","or","film","i","dislik","on","imdb","but","mighti","morphin","power","ranger","be","just","so","painstakingli","dread","it","terriblebr","br","i","would","not","have","mind","if","thi","have","be","a","anim","seri","would","have","be","well","that","wai","i","guess","but","a","a","liveact","show","it","typifi","the","term","cheesi","and","campi","of","which","power","ranger","be","five","multi","colour","spandex","wear","teen","battl","evil","by","us","their","martial","art","skill","the","costum","be","horrid","thei","look","like","someth","that","be","reminisc","of","what","track","and","field","athlet","and","femal","gymnast","would","wear","the","act","be","woeful","and","the","fight","choreographi","be","so","shockingli","bad","and","so","lame","to","watch","it","make","jean","claud","van","damm","look","a","equal","a","good","a","bruce","lee","which","be","a","understat","in","itself","in","fact","thei","look","a","if","thei","be","jump","and","danc","about","like","it","be","some","version","of","the","nutcrack","or","thei","be","do","ballet","rather","than","fight","besid","there","be","some","cartoon","that","heavili","featur","martial","art","and","yet","it","be","do","in","a","funyet","not","so","cheesi","wai","that","make","it","look","sillybr","br","kid","show","or","not","thi","be","just","so","lame","and","on","the","verg","of","absurd","and","even","though","thi","version","be","set","in","america","you","can","be","forgiv","into","think","that","a","you","watch","some","of","the","fight","sequenc","that","thei","be","not","film","in","the","u","but","rather","in","japan","thu","the","somewhat","fake","fight","and","footag","be","borrow","from","the","japanes","versiononli","to","be","juxtapos","onto","the","u","versionbr","br","if","you","like","thi","typ","of","thing","then","stick","with","sentai","the","japanes","equival"],"filtered":["veri","rare","give","littl","rave","review","show","film","dislik","imdb","mighti","morphin","power","ranger","painstakingli","dread","terriblebr","br","mind","thi","anim","seri","well","wai","guess","liveact","show","typifi","term","cheesi","campi","power","ranger","five","multi","colour","spandex","wear","teen","battl","evil","us","martial","art","skill","costum","horrid","thei","look","like","someth","reminisc","track","field","athlet","femal","gymnast","wear","act","woeful","fight","choreographi","shockingli","bad","lame","watch","make","jean","claud","van","damm","look","equal","good","bruce","lee","understat","fact","thei","look","thei","jump","danc","like","version","nutcrack","thei","ballet","rather","fight","besid","cartoon","heavili","featur","martial","art","yet","funyet","cheesi","wai","make","look","sillybr","br","kid","show","thi","lame","verg","absurd","even","though","thi","version","set","america","forgiv","think","watch","fight","sequenc","thei","film","u","rather","japan","thu","somewhat","fake","fight","footag","borrow","japanes","versiononli","juxtapos","onto","u","versionbr","br","like","thi","typ","thing","stick","sentai","japanes","equival"],"filtered2":["veri","rare","give","littl","rave","review","show","dislik","imdb","mighti","morphin","power","ranger","painstakingli","dread","terriblebr","mind","anim","well","wai","guess","liveact","show","typifi","term","cheesi","campi","power","ranger","five","multi","colour","spandex","wear","teen","battl","evil","us","martial","art","skill","costum","horrid","look","like","someth","reminisc","track","field","athlet","femal","gymnast","wear","act","woeful","fight","choreographi","shockingli","bad","lame","watch","make","jean","claud","van","damm","look","equal","good","bruce","lee","understat","fact","look","jump","danc","like","version","nutcrack","ballet","rather","fight","besid","cartoon","heavili","featur","martial","art","yet","funyet","cheesi","wai","make","look","sillybr","kid","show","lame","verg","absurd","even","though","version","set","america","forgiv","think","watch","fight","sequenc","u","rather","japan","thu","somewhat","fake","fight","footag","borrow","japanes","versiononli","juxtapos","onto","u","versionbr","like","typ","thing","stick","sentai","japanes","equival"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,9,12,14,15,16,20,21,28,29,30,33,53,56,86,97,109,112,114,160,176,194,220,232,238,243,277,305,321,349,366,372,382,384,416,422,492,505,514,543,570,592,596,639,653,658,674,776,786,809,818,843,858,867,881,906,928,972,976,995,1013,1192,1282,1297,1310,1335,1386,1515,1733,1841,1898,1963,2029,2046,2099,2153,2321,2365,2436,3292,3420,3943,4053,4132,4522,4641,4814,4881,5003,5076,5430,5812,6016,6361,8541],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"\"The Dream Child\" of 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) \"Nightmare\" series, and at the latest from this point on, the series became total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's 1984 original, and the third part, \"The Dream Warriors\" of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals, and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses, who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as a super-dumb 'eerie' children's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel... In Short: No originality, just a decline of the old formula, and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals, and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel, \"Freddy's Dead\", which is awful beyond belief. In case you're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, \"The Dream Child\" should be avoided, and even if you are, this is more than likely to disappoint.","finished_norm":["the","dream","child","of","be","the","film","in","the","gener","overr","nightmar","seri","and","at","the","late","from","thi","point","on","the","seri","becom","total","garbag","the","onli","good","film","in","the","seri","be","we","craven","origin","and","the","part","the","dream","warrior","of","the","part","be","disappoint","and","bore","and","it","be","the","part","in","which","the","formerli","scari","madman","freddi","krueger","begin","to","annoi","with","constant","idiot","joke","thi","entri","to","the","seri","have","hardli","anyth","to","recommend","except","for","admittedli","great","visual","and","on","creepi","scene","a","flashback","sequenc","to","how","freddi","krueger","come","into","exist","the","rest","of","the","film","consist","mainli","of","our","razorclaw","maniacturnedjokest","yell","stupid","onelin","and","the","old","formula","of","a","bunch","of","teenag","jackass","who","desper","try","to","avoid","fall","asleep","becaus","good","old","freddi","await","them","in","their","dream","lisa","wilcox","be","back","in","the","role","of","alic","johnson","and","a","bunch","of","uninterest","crap","such","a","a","superdumb","eeri","child","rhym","be","add","for","no","other","reason","than","to","have","some","sort","of","justif","for","make","thi","superflu","and","bore","sequel","in","short","no","origin","just","a","declin","of","the","old","formula","and","a","overload","of","painfulli","annoi","joke","my","gener","rate","of","be","due","to","the","great","visual","and","especi","to","emphas","the","differ","to","the","terribl","next","sequel","freddi","dead","which","be","aw","beyond","belief","in","case","you","re","not","a","hardcor","freddi","krueger","enthusiast","the","dream","child","should","be","avoid","and","even","if","you","be","thi","be","much","than","like","to","disappoint"],"filtered":["dream","child","film","gener","overr","nightmar","seri","late","thi","point","seri","becom","total","garbag","onli","good","film","seri","craven","origin","part","dream","warrior","part","disappoint","bore","part","formerli","scari","madman","freddi","krueger","begin","annoi","constant","idiot","joke","thi","entri","seri","hardli","anyth","recommend","except","admittedli","great","visual","creepi","scene","flashback","sequenc","freddi","krueger","come","exist","rest","film","consist","mainli","razorclaw","maniacturnedjokest","yell","stupid","onelin","old","formula","bunch","teenag","jackass","desper","try","avoid","fall","asleep","becaus","good","old","freddi","await","dream","lisa","wilcox","back","role","alic","johnson","bunch","uninterest","crap","superdumb","eeri","child","rhym","add","reason","sort","justif","make","thi","superflu","bore","sequel","short","origin","declin","old","formula","overload","painfulli","annoi","joke","gener","rate","due","great","visual","especi","emphas","differ","terribl","next","sequel","freddi","dead","aw","beyond","belief","case","re","hardcor","freddi","krueger","enthusiast","dream","child","avoid","even","thi","much","like","disappoint"],"filtered2":["dream","child","gener","overr","nightmar","late","point","becom","total","garbag","onli","good","craven","origin","part","dream","warrior","part","disappoint","bore","part","formerli","scari","madman","freddi","krueger","begin","annoi","constant","idiot","joke","entri","hardli","anyth","recommend","except","admittedli","great","visual","creepi","scene","flashback","sequenc","freddi","krueger","come","exist","rest","consist","mainli","razorclaw","maniacturnedjokest","yell","stupid","onelin","old","formula","bunch","teenag","jackass","desper","try","avoid","fall","asleep","becaus","good","old","freddi","await","dream","lisa","wilcox","back","role","alic","johnson","bunch","uninterest","crap","superdumb","eeri","child","rhym","add","reason","sort","justif","make","superflu","bore","sequel","short","origin","declin","old","formula","overload","painfulli","annoi","joke","gener","rate","due","great","visual","especi","emphas","differ","terribl","next","sequel","freddi","dead","aw","beyond","belief","case","re","hardcor","freddi","krueger","enthusiast","dream","child","avoid","even","like","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,11,19,22,34,36,51,61,63,66,67,68,69,95,104,108,115,128,136,138,147,150,166,170,180,184,187,202,204,214,225,226,228,233,267,269,271,272,288,297,298,299,313,335,349,387,396,419,502,528,568,607,635,665,692,702,706,755,788,828,1051,1054,1136,1176,1211,1240,1248,1346,1460,1512,1662,1775,1965,2111,2120,2143,2144,2305,2426,2570,2984,3059,3330,3388,3742,3821,4125,4392,4524,4756,4784,5464,7857],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"I cannot believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows. I really wouldn't even consider this true sci-fi. Every episode I have sat through was like a lame, watered down version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting.<br /><br />It's basically a bunch of people standing around in ARMY fatigues, talking about something boring, who occasionally go through the Stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like Earth, with people who look and sound just like Humans! It seemed extremely low budget. The characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts, and the many attempts at humor fall flat. It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he is not. It is just sad.<br /><br />The movie was terrible as well. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING! This shows no imagination! I actually thought the TV series \"Alien Nation\" from a few years back (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. That show actually had good story lines and decent characters. I wasn't crazy about \"Alien Nation\", but compared to this overrated crap, it was great!<br /><br />Also, unlike the great new \"Battlestar Galactica\" series, \"Stargate\" copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! They should have at least updated the cheesy \"toilet flushing\" special effect of whenever somebody goes through the Stargate.","finished_norm":["i","cannot","believ","how","popular","thi","show","be","i","consid","myself","a","avid","scifi","fan","i","have","read","countless","scifi","novel","and","have","enjoi","mani","scifi","movi","and","tv","show","i","realli","would","not","even","consid","thi","true","scifi","everi","episod","i","have","sit","through","be","like","a","lame","water","down","version","of","a","star","trek","episod","minu","anyth","that","mai","make","it","interest","or","excitingbr","br","it","basic","a","bunch","of","peopl","stand","around","in","armi","fatigu","talk","about","someth","bore","who","occasion","go","through","the","stargat","and","end","up","on","a","planet","that","look","just","like","earth","with","peopl","who","look","and","sound","just","like","human","it","seem","extrem","low","budget","the","charact","be","all","forgett","on","dimension","cutout","and","the","mani","attempt","at","humor","fall","flat","it","remind","me","when","you","see","a","commerci","with","a","famou","athlet","in","it","try","to","be","funni","but","he","be","not","it","be","just","sadbr","br","the","movi","be","terribl","a","good","there","be","so","much","you","can","do","with","a","portal","through","space","yet","everi","place","the","armi","peopl","go","be","bore","thi","show","no","imagin","i","actual","think","the","tv","seri","alien","nation","from","a","few","year","back","base","on","the","movi","alien","nation","be","much","well","that","show","actual","have","good","stori","line","and","decent","charact","i","be","not","crazi","about","alien","nation","but","compar","to","thi","overr","crap","it","be","greatbr","br","conjur","unlik","the","great","new","battlestar","galactica","seri","stargat","copi","the","look","and","feel","of","the","lame","movi","too","close","thei","should","have","at","littl","updat","the","cheesi","toilet","flush","special","effect","of","whenev","somebodi","go","through","the","stargat"],"filtered":["believ","popular","thi","show","consid","avid","scifi","fan","read","countless","scifi","novel","enjoi","mani","scifi","movi","tv","show","realli","even","consid","thi","true","scifi","everi","episod","sit","like","lame","water","version","star","trek","episod","minu","anyth","mai","make","interest","excitingbr","br","basic","bunch","peopl","stand","around","armi","fatigu","talk","someth","bore","occasion","go","stargat","end","planet","look","like","earth","peopl","look","sound","like","human","seem","extrem","low","budget","charact","forgett","dimension","cutout","mani","attempt","humor","fall","flat","remind","see","commerci","famou","athlet","try","funni","sadbr","br","movi","terribl","good","much","portal","space","yet","everi","place","armi","peopl","go","bore","thi","show","imagin","actual","think","tv","seri","alien","nation","year","back","base","movi","alien","nation","much","well","show","actual","good","stori","line","decent","charact","crazi","alien","nation","compar","thi","overr","crap","greatbr","br","conjur","unlik","great","new","battlestar","galactica","seri","stargat","copi","look","feel","lame","movi","close","thei","littl","updat","cheesi","toilet","flush","special","effect","whenev","somebodi","go","stargat"],"filtered2":["believ","popular","show","consid","avid","scifi","fan","read","countless","scifi","novel","enjoi","mani","scifi","tv","show","realli","even","consid","true","scifi","everi","sit","like","lame","water","version","star","trek","minu","anyth","mai","make","interest","excitingbr","basic","bunch","peopl","stand","around","armi","fatigu","talk","someth","bore","occasion","go","stargat","end","planet","look","like","earth","peopl","look","sound","like","human","seem","extrem","low","budget","charact","forgett","dimension","cutout","mani","attempt","humor","fall","flat","remind","see","commerci","famou","athlet","try","funni","sadbr","terribl","good","portal","space","yet","everi","place","armi","peopl","go","bore","show","imagin","actual","think","tv","alien","nation","year","back","base","alien","nation","well","show","actual","good","stori","line","decent","charact","crazi","alien","nation","compar","overr","crap","greatbr","conjur","unlik","great","new","battlestar","galactica","stargat","copi","look","feel","lame","close","littl","updat","cheesi","toilet","flush","special","effect","whenev","somebodi","go","stargat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,10,12,13,14,16,17,20,23,24,28,35,36,39,43,46,50,51,52,53,57,60,62,63,85,87,91,98,100,104,106,107,108,140,145,164,166,170,172,177,178,186,194,200,203,217,220,244,256,286,292,295,304,309,313,317,329,334,340,369,372,377,419,474,482,522,543,565,594,615,637,644,712,747,781,830,865,951,982,1008,1055,1082,1099,1125,1391,1498,1891,2111,2306,2516,2559,2604,3227,4183,4349,4814,4873,4930,5206,6188,7897,8420],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers? That point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie.<br /><br />I think sports movies fall into two categories; well made movies about the human spirit and competitions, and `By the Sword'.<br /><br />Honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be, a touching drama for trying to be your best in life, an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick. In the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or completely enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it.<br /><br />For the record I also am a fencing instructor (and now I am officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fencing in a movie doesn't make it bad automatically. I mean look at Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fencing). I liked those movies. But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason people think that it is only the purists that think it a lame effort.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by any comments on the smaller issue of fencing. This is just a bad movie. In the end, this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the movie buff or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells.<br /><br />When I see a movie and am forced to think, `Man, I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks.' I know that it is time to bypass the argument with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby that will somehow give me two hours of my life back.","finished_norm":["why","be","it","that","everyon","who","have","see","thi","movi","feel","it","be","their","respons","to","tell","u","whether","or","not","thei","be","fencer","that","point","be","complet","immateri","to","ani","argum","to","be","make","against","thi","total","dog","of","a","moviebr","br","i","think","sport","movi","fall","into","two","categori","good","make","movi","about","the","human","spirit","and","competit","and","by","the","swordbr","br","honestli","thi","movi","never","can","decid","what","it","want","to","be","a","touch","drama","for","try","to","be","your","well","in","life","a","indict","of","competit","motiv","or","a","martial","art","flick","in","the","end","it","do","not","do","ani","of","that","convincingli","or","complet","enough","to","make","me","give","on","ounc","of","care","of","ani","of","itbr","br","for","the","record","i","conjur","be","a","fenc","instructor","and","now","i","be","offici","a","bad","a","the","rest","but","putt","bad","fenc","in","a","movi","doe","not","make","it","bad","automat","i","mean","look","at","star","war","episod","good","movi","bad","fenc","i","like","that","movi","but","when","you","put","bad","sport","into","a","bad","movi","for","some","reason","peopl","think","that","it","be","onli","the","purist","that","think","it","a","lame","effortbr","br","do","not","be","fool","by","ani","comment","on","the","small","issu","of","fenc","thi","be","just","a","bad","movi","in","the","end","thi","movi","have","noth","for","the","fenc","enthusiast","or","the","movi","buff","or","simpli","anyon","with","a","puls","and","three","brain","cellsbr","br","when","i","see","a","movi","and","be","forc","to","think","man","i","wish","i","be","watch","the","mighti","duck","i","know","that","it","be","time","to","bypass","the","argum","with","the","theater","manag","to","get","my","monei","back","and","see","if","there","be","anyon","in","the","lobbi","that","will","somehow","give","me","two","hour","of","my","life","back"],"filtered":["everyon","see","thi","movi","feel","respons","tell","u","whether","thei","fencer","point","complet","immateri","ani","argum","make","thi","total","dog","moviebr","br","think","sport","movi","fall","two","categori","good","make","movi","human","spirit","competit","swordbr","br","honestli","thi","movi","never","decid","want","touch","drama","try","well","life","indict","competit","motiv","martial","art","flick","end","ani","convincingli","complet","enough","make","give","ounc","care","ani","itbr","br","record","conjur","fenc","instructor","offici","bad","rest","putt","bad","fenc","movi","doe","make","bad","automat","mean","look","star","war","episod","good","movi","bad","fenc","like","movi","put","bad","sport","bad","movi","reason","peopl","think","onli","purist","think","lame","effortbr","br","fool","ani","comment","small","issu","fenc","thi","bad","movi","end","thi","movi","noth","fenc","enthusiast","movi","buff","simpli","anyon","puls","three","brain","cellsbr","br","see","movi","forc","think","man","wish","watch","mighti","duck","know","time","bypass","argum","theater","manag","get","monei","back","see","anyon","lobbi","somehow","give","two","hour","life","back"],"filtered2":["everyon","see","feel","respons","tell","u","whether","fencer","point","complet","immateri","ani","argum","make","total","dog","moviebr","think","sport","fall","two","categori","good","make","human","spirit","competit","swordbr","honestli","never","decid","want","touch","drama","try","well","life","indict","competit","motiv","martial","art","flick","end","ani","convincingli","complet","enough","make","give","ounc","care","ani","itbr","record","conjur","fenc","instructor","offici","bad","rest","putt","bad","fenc","doe","make","bad","automat","mean","look","star","war","good","bad","fenc","like","put","bad","sport","bad","reason","peopl","think","onli","purist","think","lame","effortbr","fool","ani","comment","small","issu","fenc","bad","end","noth","fenc","enthusiast","buff","simpli","anyon","puls","three","brain","cellsbr","see","forc","think","man","wish","watch","mighti","duck","know","time","bypass","argum","theater","manag","get","monei","back","see","anyon","lobbi","somehow","give","two","hour","life","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,12,16,18,20,23,24,26,27,30,36,37,39,42,43,45,47,49,63,66,75,88,90,93,95,100,103,112,126,158,159,170,174,184,201,205,224,226,246,249,257,280,292,314,338,345,363,372,382,399,424,431,463,465,549,597,609,673,745,757,806,894,902,915,1020,1057,1213,1386,1473,1676,1992,2262,2331,2577,2665,3059,3220,3523,3943,5150,5228,5657,6285,6692,8093,8253],"values":[4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"I just finished watching this film and WOW was that bad. Actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY bad it was kind of entertaining. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall to gunfire, to their incredibly bad acting (were the bad guys all just pulled off the street, or were they actually actors?), to incredibly bad delivery of lines, to their inexplicable actions (if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter, obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob!!). This film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines.<br /><br />The camera work was also really bad - you can hardly see what's going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness.<br /><br />I would have voted \"1\" except that I do like Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained by a couple of scenes: 1) breaking of a villain's arm so the bone pops out of the skin (that's gotta hurt) 2) a drug kingpin eating a brown-furred animal (a monkey??) by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba's performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers.<br /><br />I am actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba but this one is really not worth anyone's time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching (and they are great!) are the Street Fighter series, and The Killing Machine.

{"value":"Shame really - very rarely do I watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end. I've seen quite a few of Ira Levin's adaptations - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and liked both them, but this just didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />When I read the plot outline - an award winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former pupils (Christopher Reeve) and steel his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine's a good actor, Sidney Lumet's a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good.<br /><br />I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but all I'd say is there are LOADS of twists and turns. So many its kind of hard to explain the film's plot line in detail, without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out. Though I have to give Lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Though Worth's obvious fake Russian accent got on my nerves slightly (nothing personal Irene, I think any actor's fake accent would irritate me). Not sure if Cannon's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time.<br /><br />Anyone reading this - I don't want you to be put-off watching this because of my views - give it a chance, you may like it, you may not.

{"value":"This film is massively boring and pretentious. There is only one good moment when a sailor shaves Mr Barney's(think the purple dinosaur-less pretense) eyebrow. The music is relentlessly cloying-it is sad that Bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art. The pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid. the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted. Not just from Japanese culture but from another filmmaker...(stay tuned) In a perfect \"art imitates life\" moment-the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh*t. Which is what the audience found in the theatre. There are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart---thenprepare for spoilers-I'm talking to you MR BARNEY.<br /><br />The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you have been outted! I have seen Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. And your thin, fake veil of BS has been lifted. You have stolen your images your style and your ENTIRE ART CATALOGUE from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINALLY let's hope the powers that be at the Art Councils of the world STOP FINANCING YOU! Poor Jodorowsky-lost in a financial battle with the Beatles Lawyer when he is the Lennon/McCartney of film-making. And BTW while Jodorowsky is the Beatle-YOU ARE THE MONKEES! A cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen. And BTW I am a filmmaker.

{"value":"Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they wish!) starring Melinda/Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in a South-of-the-border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw (an overacting Robert Englund in a toupee). She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they're transformed by a newly fallen meteor. The dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen \"bitches\" and Candy develops a VERY long, talking, killing forked tongue she can't control. Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications.<br /><br />First off, Clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie. You watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises, including an eye-popping, skin tight latex bodysuit...and wonder how come this actress isn't a huge star. It's too bad the rest of this cult attempt doesn't live up to her promise.<br /><br />Blame director/scripter Sciamma, who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs...but his vulgar gags, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales. Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in his film, because she alone keeps you

{"value":"Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150). A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay is a joke. It is just as cheap as the entire production. The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically cop Thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks.

{"value":"I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job.

{"value":"I watched this movie on the grounds that Amber Benson rocks and Nick Stahl is generally pretty cool - I figured that any film featuring two actors I like and respect couldn't be all bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the cringe-making dialogue they were given, both of them perform reasonably well. Not well enough to stop the movie from sucking, you understand, but well enough that I was able to make it through the 75-odd minutes of movie (and that's the main sign of an awful film: when, at 40 minutes through, you're already praying for it to be over).<br /><br />It's hard to know where to start with the problems in \"Taboo\". The dialogue, as mentioned, is appalling; wooden and completely unnatural. January Jones' acting is unbelievably bad, and since she's the character we spend most of our time following around the house, this is an unforgivable flaw. The plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clichéd as to be completely predictable (literally, not one of the major 'twists' in this film would surprise anyone but a toddler). A few interesting shots aside, the director tries far too hard with far too little success, awkward tracking shots and jittery camera-work distracting from what little element of story there is.<br /><br />Three of this movie's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit.

{"value":"I'm an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film. After watching it, however, I honestly believe that I could have made a better documentary myself. Its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources (despite his being listed in the credits on IMDb I didn't see Richard Dawkins anywhere), it's edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects, and it doesn't make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial. The narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering, almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment, ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someone's mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir (i.e. me). Though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of Jesus, the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the Christian school which the director attended as a child, an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this day.<br /><br />Though TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of Christianity. There's certainly a dearth of skeptically-minded religious documentaries on the market, and this film could have helped fill the void. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him. It's too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he needn't subject an audience to his coping mechanism.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","incorrig","skeptic","and","agnost","and","be","thu","expect","to","enjoi","thi","film","after","watch","it","howev","i","honestli","believ","that","i","can","have","make","a","well","documentari","myself","it","argum","appear","to","have","onli","four","spuriou","sourc","despit","hi","be","list","in","the","credit","on","imdb","i","do","not","see","richard","dawkin","anywher","it","edit","togeth","crude","with","laughabl","amateurish","comput","effect","and","it","doe","not","make","even","the","slight","attempt","to","appear","imparti","the","narrat","be","pervad","throughout","with","a","sneer","almost","adolesc","antichristian","sentim","ruin","ani","possibl","that","the","film","mai","actual","chang","someon","mind","a","oppos","to","just","preach","to","the","choir","ie","me","though","there","be","some","interest","discuss","of","the","histor","of","jesu","the","movi","hit","a","unbear","snag","when","it","begin","to","dwell","heavili","on","the","christian","school","which","the","director","attend","a","a","child","a","institut","which","appar","scar","him","badli","psycholog","a","it","obsess","him","to","thi","daybr","br","though","tgwwt","obvious","have","a","low","budget","there","be","still","a","opportun","here","to","make","a","intellig","commentari","on","the","highli","question","root","of","christian","there","certainli","a","dearth","of","skepticallymind","religi","documentari","on","the","market","and","thi","film","can","have","help","fill","the","void","instead","the","director","choos","to","insult","our","intellig","with","thi","piec","of","garbag","which","in","the","end","appear","to","be","some","sort","of","therapeut","exercis","for","him","it","too","bad","that","hi","christian","upbring","traumat","him","but","he","ne","not","subject","a","audienc","to","hi","cope","mechan"],"filtered":["incorrig","skeptic","agnost","thu","expect","enjoi","thi","film","watch","howev","honestli","believ","make","well","documentari","argum","appear","onli","four","spuriou","sourc","despit","hi","list","credit","imdb","see","richard","dawkin","anywher","edit","togeth","crude","laughabl","amateurish","comput","effect","doe","make","even","slight","attempt","appear","imparti","narrat","pervad","throughout","sneer","almost","adolesc","antichristian","sentim","ruin","ani","possibl","film","mai","actual","chang","someon","mind","oppos","preach","choir","ie","though","interest","discuss","histor","jesu","movi","hit","unbear","snag","begin","dwell","heavili","christian","school","director","attend","child","institut","appar","scar","badli","psycholog","obsess","thi","daybr","br","though","tgwwt","obvious","low","budget","still","opportun","make","intellig","commentari","highli","question","root","christian","certainli","dearth","skepticallymind","religi","documentari","market","thi","film","help","fill","void","instead","director","choos","insult","intellig","thi","piec","garbag","end","appear","sort","therapeut","exercis","bad","hi","christian","upbring","traumat","ne","subject","audienc","hi","cope","mechan"],"filtered2":["incorrig","skeptic","agnost","thu","expect","enjoi","watch","howev","honestli","believ","make","well","documentari","argum","appear","onli","four","spuriou","sourc","despit","list","credit","imdb","see","richard","dawkin","anywher","edit","togeth","crude","laughabl","amateurish","comput","effect","doe","make","even","slight","attempt","appear","imparti","narrat","pervad","throughout","sneer","almost","adolesc","antichristian","sentim","ruin","ani","possibl","mai","actual","chang","someon","mind","oppos","preach","choir","ie","though","interest","discuss","histor","jesu","hit","unbear","snag","begin","dwell","heavili","christian","school","director","attend","child","institut","appar","scar","badli","psycholog","obsess","daybr","though","tgwwt","obvious","low","budget","still","opportun","make","intellig","commentari","highli","question","root","christian","certainli","dearth","skepticallymind","religi","documentari","market","help","fill","void","instead","director","choos","insult","intellig","piec","garbag","end","appear","sort","therapeut","exercis","bad","christian","upbring","traumat","ne","subject","audienc","cope","mechan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,11,18,20,24,27,46,52,58,60,64,86,91,106,110,113,130,131,139,147,152,168,169,177,180,185,200,217,218,238,256,269,270,278,296,308,341,348,356,378,388,389,391,402,438,448,550,552,553,584,592,602,603,606,624,641,684,702,709,710,757,765,896,953,993,1122,1141,1188,1192,1214,1241,1292,1317,1326,1362,1416,1440,1459,1588,1798,1848,1876,1962,1992,2082,2099,2355,2366,3073,3189,3234,3265,3958,4136,4351,4779,4935,5243,5595,6086,6460,6624],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.

{"value":"Am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on Showtime. The film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography, but the screenplay was stilted and wooden. The acting was fairly bad- thought the two female leads were serviceable. You never really believed anything the supporting actors said though. There were the stereotypes- bible-thumping Reverend without a hint of nuance, authoritative Captain, hot-headed soldier, etc. I am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies I clocked it straight away as Canadian without knowing it to be such-the Telefilm Canada end credits gave it away. I know I'm a horrible person.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained. Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians-that's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them. If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them. The question of their \"immortal soul\" can be resolved later.<br /><br />Also, I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy, these girls are supposed to be the protagonists? One of them murdered the Indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives. I guess one is just a victim of her condition who can't be necessarily blamed for her actions, but the other is just a murderer who doesn't deserve her happy

{"value":"Definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing over every neurosis. However, I can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. <br /><br />However, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of festival darlings. Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. Yet I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong

{"value":"There have been so many many films based on the same theme. single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex, pays him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending......this has been done many times.<br /><br />The thing is I knew this before starting to watch. But, despite this, I was still looking forward to it. In the right hands, with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.<br /><br />this was none of these.<br /><br />this was dire.<br /><br />A female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me. I truly did not care if she \"got her man\" or remained single and unhappy.<br /><br />A male lead who, after a few of his endless words of wisdom, i wanted to kill. Just to remove that smug look. i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment.<br /><br />A totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have jobs, all of them had more money than sense, a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend....plus \"i would miss you even if we had never met\"!!!!! i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross.....I could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name \"woody\" but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film.","finished_norm":["there","have","be","so","mani","mani","film","base","on","the","same","theme","singl","cute","girl","ne","handsom","boi","to","impress","ex","pai","him","and","then","guess","what","she","fall","in","love","with","him","there","a","bite","of","fumbl","follow","by","a","row","befor","everyon","make","up","befor","the","happi","endingthi","have","be","do","mani","timesbr","br","the","thing","be","i","know","thi","befor","start","to","watch","but","despit","thi","i","be","still","look","forward","to","it","in","the","right","hand","with","a","good","cast","and","a","bright","script","it","can","still","be","a","pleasant","wai","to","pass","a","coupl","of","hoursbr","br","thi","be","none","of","thesebr","br","thi","be","direbr","br","a","femal","lead","lack","in","charm","or","wit","who","total","fail","to","light","even","the","slight","spark","in","me","i","truli","do","not","care","if","she","get","her","man","or","remain","singl","and","unhappybr","br","a","male","lead","who","after","a","few","of","hi","endless","word","of","wisdom","i","want","to","kill","just","to","remov","that","smug","look","i","have","no","idea","that","lead","a","life","of","a","male","whore","be","the","path","to","allse","allknow","enlightenmentbr","br","a","total","unrealist","film","fill","with","unrealist","charact","none","of","them","seem","to","have","job","all","of","them","have","much","monei","than","sens","a","bridegroom","who","still","go","ahead","with","hi","wed","after","learn","that","hi","bride","sleep","with","hi","well","friendplu","i","would","miss","you","even","if","we","have","never","meet","i","can","go","on","but","i","have","just","realis","that","i","be","wast","even","much","time","on","thi","drossi","can","rant","about","introduc","a","charact","just","to","have","a","veri","cheap","laugh","at","the","name","woodi","but","in","truth","that","be","the","onli","remot","humor","thing","that","happen","in","the","film"],"filtered":["mani","mani","film","base","theme","singl","cute","girl","ne","handsom","boi","impress","ex","pai","guess","fall","love","bite","fumbl","follow","row","befor","everyon","make","befor","happi","endingthi","mani","timesbr","br","thing","know","thi","befor","start","watch","despit","thi","still","look","forward","right","hand","good","cast","bright","script","still","pleasant","wai","pass","coupl","hoursbr","br","thi","none","thesebr","br","thi","direbr","br","femal","lead","lack","charm","wit","total","fail","light","even","slight","spark","truli","care","get","man","remain","singl","unhappybr","br","male","lead","hi","endless","word","wisdom","want","kill","remov","smug","look","idea","lead","life","male","whore","path","allse","allknow","enlightenmentbr","br","total","unrealist","film","fill","unrealist","charact","none","seem","job","much","monei","sens","bridegroom","still","go","ahead","hi","wed","learn","hi","bride","sleep","hi","well","friendplu","miss","even","never","meet","go","realis","wast","even","much","time","thi","drossi","rant","introduc","charact","veri","cheap","laugh","name","woodi","truth","onli","remot","humor","thing","happen","film"],"filtered2":["mani","mani","base","theme","singl","cute","girl","ne","handsom","boi","impress","ex","pai","guess","fall","love","bite","fumbl","follow","row","befor","everyon","make","befor","happi","endingthi","mani","timesbr","thing","know","befor","start","watch","despit","still","look","forward","right","hand","good","cast","bright","script","still","pleasant","wai","pass","coupl","hoursbr","none","thesebr","direbr","femal","lead","lack","charm","wit","total","fail","light","even","slight","spark","truli","care","get","man","remain","singl","unhappybr","male","lead","endless","word","wisdom","want","kill","remov","smug","look","idea","lead","life","male","whore","path","allse","allknow","enlightenmentbr","total","unrealist","fill","unrealist","charact","none","seem","job","monei","sens","bridegroom","still","go","ahead","wed","learn","bride","sleep","well","friendplu","miss","even","never","meet","go","realis","wast","even","time","drossi","rant","introduc","charact","veri","cheap","laugh","name","woodi","truth","onli","remot","humor","thing","happen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,15,16,20,26,29,33,35,37,42,45,50,54,64,71,75,76,77,79,84,89,92,94,110,121,123,126,133,143,154,157,170,173,183,184,205,215,235,243,246,253,255,258,260,282,289,322,334,343,350,351,353,369,370,391,418,422,430,443,487,533,553,605,649,682,699,732,758,797,851,855,883,929,1264,1321,1322,1329,1440,1497,1518,1694,1760,2097,2174,2312,2470,2521,2602,3002,3042,3268,4054,4066,4239,6235],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Kitten Natividad, of Russ Meyer film fame, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruit (Crockazilla?) that is supposed to have healing powers. After going down on some of this fruit (which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero, specifically, The Double D Avenger. Note that she's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, that all sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer film fame) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the guise of the Double D Avenger. Watch her do a \"Wonder Woman\" type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow. With the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70's \"live action\" kid's show with adult content, although while this is unrated it could probably get away with PG-13 at the worst. And it's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison. Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman but so what.

{"value":"Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And, while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, I couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN! Now, despite this being a wretched movie, it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. And, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, Rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped \"romance\" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And, while the bad guys are using AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers!

{"value":"On the back burner for years (so it was reported) this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly - and went straight downhill from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up on each other's lives. What a novel concept! But, sad to relate, nothing worth talking about (let alone making a movie about) has happened to either of them in the intervening years. So, instead, the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another (most having to do with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. The supporting cast is instantly forgettable, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone. Moore allegedly stalled this project for years, waiting for \"just the right script\" before committing herself. If this was the one she considered \"right\", what on earth were the ones she turned down like? It's not the age of the characters that does this in (for time inevitably marches on), but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work. At one time this was intended as a pilot but, all to obviously, it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, among potential audiences. Quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic.","finished_norm":["on","the","back","burner","for","year","so","it","be","report","thi","televis","reunion","of","two","of","the","much","belov","charact","in","sitcom","histori","start","off","badli","and","go","straight","downhil","from","there","mari","richard","mari","tyler","moor","and","her","well","friend","rhoda","morgenstern","valeri","harper","meet","in","new","york","after","a","long","estrang","and","catch","up","on","each","other","live","what","a","novel","concept","but","sad","to","relat","noth","worth","talk","about","let","alon","make","a","movi","about","have","happen","to","either","of","them","in","the","interven","year","so","instead","the","script","content","itself","with","throw","out","on","hoari","old","plot","devic","after","anoth","much","have","to","do","with","old","woman","in","the","workplac","while","complet","miss","the","quirki","charm","and","sophist","that","make","the","origin","show","a","winner","the","support","cast","be","instantli","forgett","the","humor","be","nonexist","and","the","chemistri","which","moor","and","harper","onc","have","togeth","be","go","moor","allegedli","stall","thi","project","for","year","wait","for","just","the","right","script","befor","commit","herself","if","thi","be","the","on","she","consid","right","what","on","earth","be","the","on","she","turn","down","like","it","not","the","ag","of","the","charact","that","doe","thi","in","for","time","inevit","march","on","but","the","almost","complet","lack","of","imagin","coupl","with","a","blatant","disregard","for","the","elem","that","make","the","seri","work","at","on","time","thi","be","intend","a","a","pilot","but","all","to","obvious","it","fail","to","gener","ani","interest","among","potenti","sponsor","or","for","that","matt","among","potenti","audienc","quickli","and","mercifulli","forget","the","film","be","a","travesti","and","a","insult","to","a","classic"],"filtered":["back","burner","year","report","thi","televis","reunion","two","much","belov","charact","sitcom","histori","start","badli","go","straight","downhil","mari","richard","mari","tyler","moor","well","friend","rhoda","morgenstern","valeri","harper","meet","new","york","long","estrang","catch","live","novel","concept","sad","relat","noth","worth","talk","let","alon","make","movi","happen","either","interven","year","instead","script","content","throw","hoari","old","plot","devic","anoth","much","old","woman","workplac","complet","miss","quirki","charm","sophist","make","origin","show","winner","support","cast","instantli","forgett","humor","nonexist","chemistri","moor","harper","onc","togeth","go","moor","allegedli","stall","thi","project","year","wait","right","script","befor","commit","thi","consid","right","earth","turn","like","ag","charact","doe","thi","time","inevit","march","almost","complet","lack","imagin","coupl","blatant","disregard","elem","make","seri","work","time","thi","intend","pilot","obvious","fail","gener","ani","interest","among","potenti","sponsor","matt","among","potenti","audienc","quickli","mercifulli","forget","film","travesti","insult","classic"],"filtered2":["back","burner","year","report","televis","reunion","two","belov","charact","sitcom","histori","start","badli","go","straight","downhil","mari","richard","mari","tyler","moor","well","friend","rhoda","morgenstern","valeri","harper","meet","new","york","long","estrang","catch","live","novel","concept","sad","relat","noth","worth","talk","let","alon","make","happen","either","interven","year","instead","script","content","throw","hoari","old","plot","devic","anoth","old","woman","workplac","complet","miss","quirki","charm","sophist","make","origin","show","winner","support","cast","instantli","forgett","humor","nonexist","chemistri","moor","harper","onc","togeth","go","moor","allegedli","stall","project","year","wait","right","script","befor","commit","consid","right","earth","turn","like","ag","charact","doe","time","inevit","march","almost","complet","lack","imagin","coupl","blatant","disregard","elem","make","work","time","intend","pilot","obvious","fail","gener","ani","interest","among","potenti","sponsor","matt","among","potenti","audienc","quickli","mercifulli","forget","travesti","insult","classic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,8,10,18,20,27,28,32,47,48,49,57,60,63,67,69,70,71,73,77,79,87,92,94,96,99,103,116,121,124,131,152,161,168,183,186,207,215,219,225,236,253,255,270,310,317,331,332,340,341,350,369,373,408,442,448,455,457,458,474,479,499,512,522,547,548,641,660,663,709,726,771,797,826,827,903,923,926,969,990,1132,1142,1391,1429,1484,1554,1756,1869,2248,2339,2453,2486,2526,2734,2825,2827,2996,3210,3450,4090,4198,4846,5405,5443,5509,6337,6521,7445],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"A lot of death happens in the wild. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film! <br /><br />And, why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money?<br /><br />Then in typical, comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent Birds-of-Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of First and Second graders on a school field trip! Wow! From the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat!<br /><br />If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration,

{"value":"This film was slated to be a blockbuster film, and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind, the movie delivers, perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man, but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />Many viewers, myself included, will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered, but that only makes the film a poor adaptation, not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes, as is Sabertooth, though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.<br /><br />The \"final boss\" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character.<br /><br />Very disappointing...","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","slate","to","be","a","blockbust","film","and","it","realli","be","thi","be","the","typ","of","movi","that","be","make","to","eat","popcorn","to","and","watch","the","flashi","graphic","with","that","in","mind","the","movi","deliv","perhap","not","a","good","a","the","ultra","flashi","iron","man","but","good","enough","outsid","of","the","popcorn","munch","action","and","special","effect","the","film","drop","off","of","the","cliff","fast","than","wile","e","coyotebr","br","mani","viewer","myself","includ","will","complain","about","how","much","of","the","charact","be","sever","alter","but","that","onli","make","the","film","a","poor","adapt","not","a","poor","film","thi","film","be","unsatisfactori","for","other","reason","the","maker","focu","much","on","make","it","appeal","to","the","ey","than","thei","do","to","the","mind","the","charact","that","have","be","long","await","and","promot","be","reduc","to","scene","cameo","the","main","charact","of","wolverin","victor","cre","never","call","sabertooth","in","the","film","and","colonel","stryker","be","good","develop","i","be","pleasantli","surpris","by","liev","schriber","perform","the","rest","of","the","charact","be","toss","to","the","waysid","to","make","wai","for","the","all","import","eyecandi","wolverin","charact","be","fulli","develop","after","minut","a","be","sabertooth","though","victor","doe","pull","off","some","surpris","late","in","the","filmbr","br","the","final","boss","of","the","film","be","a","twist","and","pervers","adapt","of","the","origin","charact","and","bare","get","ani","develop","to","show","just","why","he","be","the","wai","he","be","the","filmmak","obvious","feel","that","all","thei","realli","ne","to","do","be","creat","a","bad","ass","charact","who","can","do","anyth","thei","want","and","slap","on","the","name","of","a","popular","characterbr","br","veri","disappoint"],"filtered":["thi","film","slate","blockbust","film","realli","thi","typ","movi","make","eat","popcorn","watch","flashi","graphic","mind","movi","deliv","perhap","good","ultra","flashi","iron","man","good","enough","outsid","popcorn","munch","action","special","effect","film","drop","cliff","fast","wile","e","coyotebr","br","mani","viewer","includ","complain","much","charact","sever","alter","onli","make","film","poor","adapt","poor","film","thi","film","unsatisfactori","reason","maker","focu","much","make","appeal","ey","thei","mind","charact","long","await","promot","reduc","scene","cameo","main","charact","wolverin","victor","cre","never","call","sabertooth","film","colonel","stryker","good","develop","pleasantli","surpris","liev","schriber","perform","rest","charact","toss","waysid","make","wai","import","eyecandi","wolverin","charact","fulli","develop","minut","sabertooth","though","victor","doe","pull","surpris","late","filmbr","br","final","boss","film","twist","pervers","adapt","origin","charact","bare","get","ani","develop","show","wai","filmmak","obvious","feel","thei","realli","ne","creat","bad","ass","charact","anyth","thei","want","slap","name","popular","characterbr","br","veri","disappoint"],"filtered2":["slate","blockbust","realli","typ","make","eat","popcorn","watch","flashi","graphic","mind","deliv","perhap","good","ultra","flashi","iron","man","good","enough","outsid","popcorn","munch","action","special","effect","drop","cliff","fast","wile","e","coyotebr","mani","viewer","includ","complain","charact","sever","alter","onli","make","poor","adapt","poor","unsatisfactori","reason","maker","focu","make","appeal","ey","mind","charact","long","await","promot","reduc","scene","cameo","main","charact","wolverin","victor","cre","never","call","sabertooth","colonel","stryker","good","develop","pleasantli","surpris","liev","schriber","perform","rest","charact","toss","waysid","make","wai","import","eyecandi","wolverin","charact","fulli","develop","minut","sabertooth","though","victor","doe","pull","surpris","late","filmbr","final","boss","twist","pervers","adapt","origin","charact","bare","get","ani","develop","show","wai","filmmak","obvious","feel","realli","ne","creat","bad","ass","charact","anyth","want","slap","name","popular","characterbr","veri","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,9,10,11,13,15,18,19,27,28,33,37,42,43,45,50,59,69,86,93,95,99,104,105,106,110,129,142,143,146,150,156,179,187,203,226,238,279,281,301,316,318,320,323,326,341,362,384,435,517,542,544,566,589,599,600,619,689,701,762,791,904,951,1146,1199,1246,1249,1366,1477,1491,1661,1682,1831,2014,2199,2287,2509,2765,2874,3253,3502,3742,3814,3860,4135,4287,5680,7116,8181,8300],"values":[4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,

{"value":"I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally resides in making it original, new and inventive. This movie fails to do so.<br /><br />There is no sense of who the characters really are, apart from Sylvie Moreau's (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie can become annoying, rhythm lacks, and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally, or rather, making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious. Of course, along with that, you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.<br /><br />I can't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive. If you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy, this is not it. Or rather, this a poor attempt at it. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks.<br /><br />Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","romant","comedi","and","thi","be","on","of","the","easiestworst","attempt","at","on","a","lot","of","the","scene","work","in","a","plugandplai","manner","insert","strictli","to","conform","to","the","romanticcomedi","genr","usual","thi","be","okai","becaus","we","re","deal","with","a","genr","but","the","challeng","gener","resid","in","make","it","origin","new","and","invent","thi","movi","fail","to","do","sobr","br","there","be","no","sens","of","who","the","charact","realli","be","apart","from","sylvi","moreau","who","be","the","real","star","of","thi","movi","not","isabel","blai","thei","fit","into","thi","onedimension","cliché","and","thei","becom","noth","much","than","simpl","puppet","serv","the","purpos","of","a","veri","light","narrativebr","br","the","pace","of","the","movi","can","becom","annoi","rhythm","lack","and","the","edit","be","fill","with","unnecessari","closeup","i","should","conjur","mention","the","overli","styliz","decor","make","some","scene","devoid","of","ani","natur","or","rather","make","the","attempt","at","natur","seem","too","obviou","of","cours","along","with","that","you","have","the","rightoncu","sappi","music","which","unfortun","often","sound","mismatchedbr","br","i","ca","not","believ","that","a","movi","who","make","obviou","woodi","allen","allus","end","up","be","thi","decept","if","you","expect","a","good","lightheart","romant","comedi","thi","be","not","it","or","rather","thi","a","poor","attempt","at","it","you","will","onli","leav","the","theater","wonder","why","thi","film","have","be","get","such","prais","when","cinema","be","now","much","than","year","old","and","there","be","far","superior","quebecoi","director","make","well","flicksbr","br","le","aimant","be","a","good","movi","for","what","it","be","but","it","a","bad","on","if","you","regard","cinema","a","a","art","and","director","a","auteur"],"filtered":["see","romant","comedi","thi","easiestworst","attempt","lot","scene","work","plugandplai","manner","insert","strictli","conform","romanticcomedi","genr","usual","thi","okai","becaus","re","deal","genr","challeng","gener","resid","make","origin","new","invent","thi","movi","fail","sobr","br","sens","charact","realli","apart","sylvi","moreau","real","star","thi","movi","isabel","blai","thei","fit","thi","onedimension","cliché","thei","becom","noth","much","simpl","puppet","serv","purpos","veri","light","narrativebr","br","pace","movi","becom","annoi","rhythm","lack","edit","fill","unnecessari","closeup","conjur","mention","overli","styliz","decor","make","scene","devoid","ani","natur","rather","make","attempt","natur","seem","obviou","cours","along","rightoncu","sappi","music","unfortun","often","sound","mismatchedbr","br","ca","believ","movi","make","obviou","woodi","allen","allus","end","thi","decept","expect","good","lightheart","romant","comedi","thi","rather","thi","poor","attempt","onli","leav","theater","wonder","thi","film","get","prais","cinema","much","year","old","far","superior","quebecoi","director","make","well","flicksbr","br","le","aimant","good","movi","bad","regard","cinema","art","director","auteur"],"filtered2":["see","romant","comedi","easiestworst","attempt","lot","scene","work","plugandplai","manner","insert","strictli","conform","romanticcomedi","genr","usual","okai","becaus","re","deal","genr","challeng","gener","resid","make","origin","new","invent","fail","sobr","sens","charact","realli","apart","sylvi","moreau","real","star","isabel","blai","fit","onedimension","cliché","becom","noth","simpl","puppet","serv","purpos","veri","light","narrativebr","pace","becom","annoi","rhythm","lack","edit","fill","unnecessari","closeup","conjur","mention","overli","styliz","decor","make","scene","devoid","ani","natur","rather","make","attempt","natur","seem","obviou","cours","along","rightoncu","sappi","music","unfortun","often","sound","mismatchedbr","ca","believ","make","obviou","woodi","allen","allus","end","decept","expect","good","lightheart","romant","comedi","rather","poor","attempt","onli","leav","theater","wonder","get","prais","cinema","year","old","far","superior","quebecoi","director","make","well","flicksbr","le","aimant","good","bad","regard","cinema","art","director","auteur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,9,10,11,13,15,19,20,22,24,27,35,39,48,49,57,58,67,68,69,72,74,80,81,87,91,100,101,115,118,127,130,146,160,173,175,177,178,183,191,199,215,225,227,265,271,285,324,348,353,382,383,400,409,424,456,467,468,523,546,553,572,676,737,794,815,864,1019,1046,1081,1345,1463,1636,1642,1645,1717,1760,1946,1964,2238,2263,2327,2335,2418,2688,3303,3824,4016,4035,4501,4692,5383,5437,5840,6416],"values":[5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,

{"value":"I just finished reading a book on Anita Loos' work and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so I thought I'd watch this movie. I'd never heard of the film before, so I had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever. Thought it got off to a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won't stay on was really endearing. I was even with the film when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddy stays \"asleep\" for the entire rest of movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter, because he's just dreaming. The rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless. I had to force myself to stick with it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky.<br /><br />Had Eddy \"woken\" a sooner and the original story continued, or had he really married an angel, I think it would have been a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character.<br /><br />There weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Even so, Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine, showing what true stars they

{"value":"The original 1965 Japanese film \"Gamera\" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (\"Godzilla King of the Monsters\"), \"Gammera the Invincible\" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. <br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film.<br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. <br /><br />The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.","finished_norm":["the","origin","japanes","film","gamera","httpproimdbcomtitlett","be","essenti","a","updat","of","the","dark","littl","kidori","gojira","godzillafor","sensibl","gamera","of","cours","be","a","giant","fly","flamethrow","turtl","who","liter","consum","energi","not","quit","a","big","a","some","version","of","godzilla","but","gener","similar","in","much","wai","br","br","thi","version","of","the","origin","film","be","edit","and","recut","by","the","notori","sandi","frank","and","just","like","the","american","version","of","godzilla","godzilla","king","of","the","monster","gammera","the","invinc","get","much","than","just","the","spell","wrong","the","american","scene","be","not","nearli","a","ludicr","and","annoi","a","that","add","to","the","great","gojira","but","do","not","realli","add","much","to","the","stori","either","becaus","there","be","littl","follow","up","on","them","br","br","the","film","start","off","promis","there","be","a","few","scene","worth","of","charact","develop","and","there","be","enough","person","to","creat","some","tension","outsid","of","the","main","plot","onc","gamera","appear","howev","the","film","begin","to","descend","into","a","fairli","runofth","mill","kaiju","filmbr","br","the","act","be","good","enough","even","the","american","addon","be","okai","the","direct","be","pretti","good","for","thi","period","and","genr","and","the","special","effect","be","not","bad","at","all","for","their","time","all","miniatur","some","of","the","set","and","backdrop","be","actual","veri","good","br","br","the","big","problem","here","of","cours","be","that","there","be","littl","to","noth","origin","about","thi","film","gamera","howev","develop","a","much","much","uniqu","person","in","hi","late","film","much","of","which","be","worth","watch","if","you","be","a","kaiju","fan"],"filtered":["origin","japanes","film","gamera","httpproimdbcomtitlett","essenti","updat","dark","littl","kidori","gojira","godzillafor","sensibl","gamera","cours","giant","fly","flamethrow","turtl","liter","consum","energi","quit","big","version","godzilla","gener","similar","much","wai","br","br","thi","version","origin","film","edit","recut","notori","sandi","frank","like","american","version","godzilla","godzilla","king","monster","gammera","invinc","get","much","spell","wrong","american","scene","nearli","ludicr","annoi","add","great","gojira","realli","add","much","stori","either","becaus","littl","follow","br","br","film","start","promis","scene","worth","charact","develop","enough","person","creat","tension","outsid","main","plot","onc","gamera","appear","howev","film","begin","descend","fairli","runofth","mill","kaiju","filmbr","br","act","good","enough","even","american","addon","okai","direct","pretti","good","thi","period","genr","special","effect","bad","time","miniatur","set","backdrop","actual","veri","good","br","br","big","problem","cours","littl","noth","origin","thi","film","gamera","howev","develop","much","much","uniqu","person","hi","late","film","much","worth","watch","kaiju","fan"],"filtered2":["origin","japanes","gamera","httpproimdbcomtitlett","essenti","updat","dark","littl","kidori","gojira","godzillafor","sensibl","gamera","cours","giant","fly","flamethrow","turtl","liter","consum","energi","quit","big","version","godzilla","gener","similar","wai","version","origin","edit","recut","notori","sandi","frank","like","american","version","godzilla","godzilla","king","monster","gammera","invinc","get","spell","wrong","american","scene","nearli","ludicr","annoi","add","great","gojira","realli","add","stori","either","becaus","littl","follow","start","promis","scene","worth","charact","develop","enough","person","creat","tension","outsid","main","plot","onc","gamera","appear","howev","begin","descend","fairli","runofth","mill","kaiju","filmbr","act","good","enough","even","american","addon","okai","direct","pretti","good","period","genr","special","effect","bad","time","miniatur","set","backdrop","actual","veri","good","big","problem","cours","littl","noth","origin","gamera","howev","develop","uniqu","person","late","worth","watch","kaiju","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,17,19,21,22,25,32,33,49,51,52,69,71,78,82,93,102,106,109,113,120,140,147,150,153,167,169,179,191,199,203,207,219,220,223,225,236,260,271,299,320,348,362,368,413,467,541,566,591,611,652,683,743,791,819,843,886,897,907,1197,1301,1373,1394,1435,1783,2226,2390,2559,2671,2762,3001,3327,3495,3529,6069,6287,6949],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,17,19,21,22,25,32,33,49,51,5

{"value":"I've always liked Fred MacMurray, andalthough her career was tragically cut shortI think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Pair these two major and attractive stars together, add top supporting players like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, team them with noted director Mitchell Leisen and you geta mediocre movie experience.<br /><br />Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) \"meet cute\" during her visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid's a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall. During his climb to musical stardom, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start over after he's hit rock bottom. Ah, yesit's the true Hollywood happy ending, which comes none too soon.<br /><br />Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it's difficult to watch at times. The early scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever, and later an alcoholic Skid just wanders endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the tired script and S-L-O-W direction just don't give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, just doesn't ring true.<br /><br />This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard.

{"value":"I first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. On top of that, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon. With both of those, I thought it would hold my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes in, and I had the fast forward button down. I ran through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it.<br /><br />Afterwards, I read some of the other reviews here and figured I didn't give it enough of a chance. I recorded it again and watched it through. There's 75 minutes of my life I'm not getting back.<br /><br />I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum. How many ways are there to say this is a waste of time?<br /><br />The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts, profanity, and puke jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of \"Swinging the Alphabet\" is lame, essentially cobbling the tune, getting through A - E, hitting the obvious profanity a \"F\", and then having no idea where to go. The trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time, let alone the following ones. <br /><br />Across the board, the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to \"out-South Park\" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny.

{"value":"I can watch a good gory film now and then. I've seen some pretty sick stuff. However, this is one of the few films that I found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting. I like gore films when they are fun. I like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this film is not creative. It is sick. It is repugnant. It is completely unpleasant. Because of this, this film is certainly not entertaining. The film is a horror film, but it lacks scares. So pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore, but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film, and that's saying a lot. The acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, and the music is really annoying and WAY too electronic sounding. It all took me right out of the film. Pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal. There's this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off. I guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process. There's some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog, some dismembered head floating down a stream, and an ending involving a man being electrocuted. There were times where I tried really hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole film that I thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, nasty, ad unappealing horror films, this one is for
